We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

We have to make a second guess. We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter (since we know it's in the correct position).
- Does not contain C, A, N, E (because they are not in the word).

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words with R in the second position:

- TRY: words like ""BRICK"", ""BRISK"", ""BROWN"", ""FRUIT"", ""GRASP"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINT"", etc.

But note: we cannot use A (from ""GRASP"") because A is not in the word. Similarly, we cannot use E (from ""PRINT"") because E is not in the word.

So, we must avoid A, C, E, N.

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""BROWN"": B, R (fixed), O, W, N -> but N is not allowed? Wait, N is in the word? No, feedback said N is not in the word. So we cannot use N? Actually, we can use any letters in our guess, but if we use a letter that we know is not in the word, it might not be optimal because it won't help us find the word. However, we are allowed to guess words with letters we know are not in the word? But it's better to avoid them to get more information about other letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that C, A, N, E are not in the word. So we should avoid them to test new letters.

So, for the second guess, we want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Uses letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to form a word without A, C, E, N.

Some options:
- ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all new letters.
- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> but S and H are new.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word, but we can still use it? However, using a letter we know is not in the word would waste a slot. So better to avoid.

We should avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (C, A, N, E) because they won't help us get new information.

So, let's choose a word without those.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good candidate: 
- B: new
- R: fixed in position 2
- O: new
- I: new
- L: new

Alternatively, ""BRISK"": 
- B: new
- R: fixed
- I: new
- S: new
- K: new

But we don't know if these letters are in the word or not.

Another option: ""PRISM"": 
- P: new
- R: fixed
- I: new
- S: new
- M: new

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a valid word.

But let me check: BROIL means to cook with direct heat.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRYST"": 
- T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T.

But we want to cover more letters. ""BROIL"" has 5 distinct letters.

Another common word: ""FRUIT"" -> but it has U and I, but also F. However, we know from the first guess that the word does not have A, C, E, N. But ""FRUIT"" has F, R, U, I, T. But R is fixed. However, the first letter F is new.

But note: we are not restricted to not use letters we haven't tried, but we should avoid the ones we know are absent.

So, ""FRUIT"" is acceptable? But we don't know if F is in the word or not.

But we are trying to get information. So using F, U, I, T is good.

However, we have to have R in the second position.

I think ""BROIL"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

Alternatively, ""PRICK"": but that has C? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid.

Wait, ""PRICK"" has C, which we know is not in the word. So we shouldn't use it.

Similarly, ""BRICK"" has C.

So, let's avoid words with C, A, N, E.

Another word: ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. But we don't know about G, U, M, P.

But ""GRUMP"" is a word? Grump means a grumpy person.

But I think ""BROIL"" is more common.

Another: ""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S. All new.

But we don't know if D, O, P, S are in the word.

I think ""DROPS"" is a good one too.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""BROIL"" because it has common vowels and consonants.

So, second guess: BROIL

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word. We are testing B, O, I, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common letters. For example, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S. But T is a common letter.

But we don't know about T.

I think ""BROIL"" is fine.

But let me think: the word has R in the second position and does not have C, A, N, E. So the word must be of the form _ R _ _ _

We are going to guess ""BROIL"".

So, the guess is ""BROIL"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes new common letters to maximize information (e.g., B, O, I, L, S, T).

I considered words like ""BROIL"" (which uses B, O, I, L) and ""BRISK"" (which uses B, I, S, K). ""BROIL"" is a strong choice because it tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids known absent letters.

We need to choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R as the second letter (since we know it\'s in the correct position).\n- Does not contain C, A, N, E (because they are not in the word).\n\nWe also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: B, D, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible words with R in the second position:\n\n- TRY: words like ""BRICK"", ""BRISK"", ""BROWN"", ""FRUIT"", ""GRASP"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINT"", etc.\n\nBut note: we cannot use A (from ""GRASP"") because A is not in the word. Similarly, we cannot use E (from ""PRINT"") because E is not in the word.\n\nSo, we must avoid A, C, E, N.\n\nLet\'s list some words that fit:\n- ""BROWN"": B, R (fixed), O, W, N -> but N is not allowed? Wait, N is in the word? No, feedback said N is not in the word. So we cannot use N? Actually, we can use any letters in our guess, but if we use a letter that we know is not in the word, it might not be optimal because it won\'t help us find the word. However, we are allowed to guess words with letters we know are not in the word? But it\'s better to avoid them to get more information about other letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that C, A, N, E are not in the word. So we should avoid them to test new letters.\n\nSo, for the second guess, we want a word that:\n- Has R in the second position.\n- Uses letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word without A, C, E, N.\n\nSome options:\n- ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all new letters.\n- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> but S and H are new.\n- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word, but we can still use it? However, using a letter we know is not in the word would waste a slot. So better to avoid.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (C, A, N, E) because they won\'t help us get new information.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word without those.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" is a good candidate: \n- B: new\n- R: fixed in position 2\n- O: new\n- I: new\n- L: new\n\nAlternatively, ""BRISK"": \n- B: new\n- R: fixed\n- I: new\n- S: new\n- K: new\n\nBut we don\'t know if these letters are in the word or not.\n\nAnother option: ""PRISM"": \n- P: new\n- R: fixed\n- I: new\n- S: new\n- M: new\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let me check: BROIL means to cook with direct heat.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""TRYST"": \n- T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know about T.\n\nBut we want to cover more letters. ""BROIL"" has 5 distinct letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""FRUIT"" -> but it has U and I, but also F. However, we know from the first guess that the word does not have A, C, E, N. But ""FRUIT"" has F, R, U, I, T. But R is fixed. However, the first letter F is new.\n\nBut note: we are not restricted to not use letters we haven\'t tried, but we should avoid the ones we know are absent.\n\nSo, ""FRUIT"" is acceptable? But we don\'t know if F is in the word or not.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. So using F, U, I, T is good.\n\nHowever, we have to have R in the second position.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRICK"": but that has C? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid.\n\nWait, ""PRICK"" has C, which we know is not in the word. So we shouldn\'t use it.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRICK"" has C.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with C, A, N, E.\n\nAnother word: ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. But we don\'t know about G, U, M, P.\n\nBut ""GRUMP"" is a word? Grump means a grumpy person.\n\nBut I think ""BROIL"" is more common.\n\nAnother: ""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S. All new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D, O, P, S are in the word.\n\nI think ""DROPS"" is a good one too.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BROIL"" because it has common vowels and consonants.\n\nSo, second guess: BROIL\n\nBut note: we are not sure if B is in the word. We are testing B, O, I, L.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has more common letters. For example, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S. But T is a common letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know about T.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" is fine.\n\nBut let me think: the word has R in the second position and does not have C, A, N, E. So the word must be of the form _ R _ _ _\n\nWe are going to guess ""BROIL"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""BROIL"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).\n\nFor the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R as the second letter.\n- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Includes new common letters to maximize information (e.g., B, O, I, L, S, T).\n\nI considered words like ""BROIL"" (which uses B, O, I, L) and ""BRISK"" (which uses B, I, S, K). ""BROIL"" is a strong choice because it tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids known absent letters.\n\n<guess>broil</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: broil -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
First, I have the feedback from two previous guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane""  
   - Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
   This means:  
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).  
   - C, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess 2: ""broil""  
   - Feedback: B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)  
   This means:  
   - R is still correct in position 2 (as we already knew).  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (I assume position 3 based on ""broil"" being B-R-O-I-L).  
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
   - B is not in the word (which we didn't know before, but now we do).  
   - I is not in the word (new information).

So, summarizing what we know:

- The secret word has the form: _ R ? _ ? where:
  - Position 2 is R (confirmed).
  - Position 3 must be O, since O(✓) in ""broil"" position 3.
  - Position 5 must be L, since L(✓) in ""broil"" position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, I (from feedback: C(x), A(x), N(x), E(x), B(x), I(x)).
- So, absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ R O _ L

We need to fill in the first and fourth positions.

Letters we haven't used or tested yet: From the alphabet, excluding known absent letters and known present letters.

Known present and placed:
- R in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 5

We don't know about position 1 and position 4 yet.

Letters that could be present are ones not ruled out. Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Common vowels: U is not ruled out? We haven't tested U. Consonants like D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y, Z are possible.

But we need to form a valid English word of the form _ R O _ L.

What words fit this pattern? Let me list some 5-letter words ending with L and ""RO"" in positions 2-3.

Possible words:

- TROLL
- DROLL
- PROWL
- GROWL
- FROWL – is ""frowl"" a word? Not common; frown is 4-letter, so probably not.
- BROWL – not a word.
- CROWL – not common; crow is 4-letter.
- PROWL is valid.
- GROWL is valid.
- TROLL is valid.
- DROLL is valid.
- From above, position 1: could be T, D, P, G, etc.

Now, we need to consider the feedback that certain letters are absent.

For example, in ""broil"", B and I are absent, which we've noted.

We have to make a guess that might confirm position 1 and introduce a new letter for position 4.

But we know position 1 isn't B (from guess 2), and it can't be C, A, E, I, N from guess 1.

So position 1 possibilities: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Position 4 possibilities: similarly, we don't know much yet.

From guess 2 ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, so the fourth letter is not I, but it could be something else.

Possible words: let's list common ones.

- GROWL: G R O W L
- PROWL: P R O W L
- DROLL: D R O L L – wait, ""droll"" is D R O L L, so positions: D, R, O, L, L. So position 4 is L? But position 5 is L, so it has L in both positions. But that's possible.

In ""droll"", if secret word is ""droll"", and we guessed ""broil"", what would feedback be?

""broil"": B R O I L vs ""droll"": D R O L L

Position 2: R matches, so ✓

Position 3: O matches, so ✓

Position 1: B vs D – B is not in secret word (since D is there, but B not present), so x

Position 4: I vs L – L is in the word but not in position 4? Secret word has L in position 4 and 5. In ""broil"", position 4 is I, which is not in the word, so I(x). But L is in the word, but in different positions. Since we have L in position 5 (✓), but position 4 L might be revealed as present but wrong position if we guess something else.

But in actual feedback for guess 2, we have R(✓), O(✓), L(✓) which means L is correct in position 5. And I(x) means I is absent. B(x) absent. Also, in position 4 of guess was I, which is wrong.

Now back to possibilities for secret word: _ R O _ L

Position 1 could be: consonant, and position 4 could be a vowel or consonant.

Common words:

- Troll
- Droll
- Prowl
- Growl
- Froll isn't word
- Croll isn't word
- Stroll – S T R O L, but that's S(1), T(2)? No, pattern requires position 2 R, position 3 O, so ""stroll"" has S, T, R, O, L – so position 2 is T? Not R. So not matching.

We need position 2 to be R, position 3 to be O, position 5 to be L.

So ""troll"" has T, R, O, L, L? T R O L L? ""Troll"" is T-R-O-L-L? Five letters, so T(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). So yes.

Similarly, ""droll"" is D-R-O-L-L, same as troll but D.

But ""prowl"" is P-R-O-W-L, so positions P(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5).

""growl"" is G-R-O-W-L.

""scroll"" is S-C-R-O-L, but position 2 is C? Not R. ""Scroll"" has S(1), C(2), R(3), O(4), L(5), so positions don't match our pattern. We need R in pos 2 and O in pos 3.

Other possibilities: ""broil"" itself, but B is absent, so no. Or ""drool"", but ""drool"" is D-R-O-O-L, so D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). Is ""drool"" a word? Yes.

So possible secret words: 
- Troll: T R O L L
- Droll: D R O L L
- Drool: D R O O L
- Prowl: P R O W L
- Growl: G R O W L
- Frowl: F R O W L? Or ""frowl"" might not be common; let's check if it's valid. Yes, frowl can mean to frown or something, but less common.
- Scowl: S C O W L? Position 2 is C, not R. No.
- Propel: P R O P E L, but E is absent? E is ruled out from guess 1 feedback (E(x)), so E cannot be in the word. Thus, ""propel"" has E, which is absent, so it can't be.

Similarly, any word with E, A, N, etc., is invalid.

Potential words:
- With position 4 as L: troll, droll – but in these, position 4 is L, and position 5 is also L, so they have two L's.
- With position 4 as something else: prowl, growl, drool (position 4 O).

Drool: D R O O L, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5).

We need to guess a word that can distinguish these possibilities or confirm the letters.

For the third guess, since we know the form is _ R O _ L, and letters absent: A,B,C,E,I,N.

Good to test letters that appear in multiple options.

For example:
- If we guess ""troll"", it could be tested directly.
- But we don't know if position 1 is T or D or P, etc.

We can include a new letter for position 4.

Position 4 possibilities: in known options, it could be L (for troll/droll), W (for prowl/growl), O (for drool), etc.

We haven't tested W or L in position 4, but we know L is in the word at position 5.

In feedback, from ""broil"", L is ✓ in position 5, so L is in the word, but there could be another L? Or not.

Feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple instances; it only gives symbols per position.

In ""broil"", L is ✓, so correct position.

Now for the secret word, position 4 might be L or not.

To get information, we should guess a word where position 4 is a letter we haven't tested.

For example, guess ""prowl"" to test if position 1 is P and position 4 is W.

But if the secret word is ""troll"", and we guess ""prowl"", what happens?

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: P R O W L

Feedback:
Pos 2: R ✓
Pos 3: O ✓
Pos 5: L ✓ (since both have L in pos 5)
Pos 1: P vs T – P not in secret (assuming T is different), so P(x)? But secret has T, but position different? Secret has T in pos 1, guess has P. Since P is not in secret (only if secret has no P), but if secret is ""troll"", no P, so P(x). Pos 4: W vs L – L is in secret, but not in position 4; it's in position 5. So since L is present but wrong position, it would be (-) for W? No.

Clarify feedback rules:
- For each position, comparing guess to secret.

In this case, for position 4 of guess: guess is W, secret is L.
Secret has L, but not in position 4 (since L is in pos 5), so symbol for W:
Since W is not in secret at all (secret ""troll"" has T,R,O,L,L – no W), so if W not in word, it would be x.
But W is not present, so x.
And for L in the guess? Only positions matter separately. For position 4 in guess is W, not L.

Feedback per position position by position.

Assume secret ""troll"" and guess ""prowl"":
- Pos 1: P vs T → T is not P, but T is in word? Secret has T in position 1, guess has P there. P is not in secret (secret has T,R,O,L,L – letters T,R,O,L; no P), so P not present → symbol x
- Pos 2: R vs R → same → ✓
- Pos 3: O vs O → same → ✓
- Pos 4: W vs L → L is in secret, but position: secret pos 4 is L, guess pos 4 is W. W not present in secret, so symbol for W should be x, since W ≠ L and W not in word.
Secret word is T R O L L, so letters: T,R,O,L.
W is not among them, so symbol for W: x.
Similarly, for pos 5: L vs L → ✓
So feedback would be P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

In our case, we know O and R are already confirmed, so guessing ""prowl"" directly could help.

Similarly, if secret is ""prowl"", feedback would be different.

But we have multiple options.

Since we need to find position 1 and position 4.

Another word: ""drool"" – D R O O L

If we guess ""drool"", and secret is, say, ""troll"", then feedback: 
- Pos1: D vs T → D not present? Secret TROLL, letters T,R,O,L; D not present → D(x)? Symbols: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), O vs L? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. O is in secret (pos3), so O is present but not in pos4 (since it's in pos3). Also, secret has O only once? Assume no duplicate for simplicity unless specified.

Duplicates: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.

Example: secret ""DROOL"" guess ""TROLL"", but we don't have that.

General rule: for each guess position, if the letter matches exactly, ✓. If not, but the letter is in the word, and hasn't been accounted for, -. Otherwise x.

But for now, back to guessing.

For a smart guess, I should choose a word that includes letters not yet tested and can test possibilities for position 1 and 4.

We know L is in position 5, so we don't need to guess letters for position 5.

Position 1 candidates: D, G, P, T, W? From common options.

Position 4 candidates: W (as in prowl), O (as in drool), L (as in troll, droll).

Letters not yet used: from previous guesses, we have used C,R,A,N,E in guess1, and B,R,O,I,L in guess2. So all letters: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,I,L.

So unused common letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,S,T,U,W,Y,Z, etc.

To maximize information, guess a word like ""prowl"" or ""troll"".

But if I guess ""troll"", for example:
- If the word is ""troll"", I win.
- If not, I get feedback.

Similarly.

But perhaps ""prowl"" is better because it introduces W.

Since we have multiple options, I can guess a word that tests the fourth position.

For example, the fourth position could be:
- In ""troll"" and ""droll"", it's L
- In ""prowl"" and ""growl"", it's W
- In ""drool"", it's O

And letters like L and O we already know are present (O at pos3, L at pos5), but position 4 might be different or same.

To distinguish, I need to include a letter for position 4 that isn't L or O, or test it.

Guess a word where position 4 is not L or O, but a new letter, like W.

But in ""prowl"", position 4 is W.

Position 1 could be P as well.

Another idea: guess ""grown"", but N is absent? From guess1, N(x), so cannot use N. Also, ""grown"" is 5 letters? G R O W N, but N is absent, and position 5 should be L, not N.

We know position 5 is L, so any guess must have L in position 5 to confirm or get feedback.

In guess, I can guess a different word, but since position 5 is confirmed L, it's efficient to guess L.

But position 1 and 4 need to be found.

So for guess 3, I should guess a word of the pattern _ R O _ L, with new letters.

For example:
- If I guess ""growl"", if position 1 is G and position 4 is W, it might be correct or not.
- Similarly with ""prowl"".

Since ""broil"" had O(✓) and L(✓), we know O and L are fixed.

Now, what about position 4? It wasn't tested since I was x.

So let's list all possible words fitting _ R O _ L with no forbidden letters.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,I,N

Possible words:
1. DROLL (if four letters: D,R,O,L,L, it's D R O L L with repeated L)
2. DROOL (D R O O L, with repeated O)
3. PROWL (P R O W L)
4. GROWL (G R O W L)
5. TROLL (T R O L L with repeated L)
6. Others like FROWL (F R O W L), but less common; BROIL is not due to B absent; SHOWL not word, etc.

Common are likely DROLL, DROOL, PROWL, GROWL, TROLL.

Now, to guess: I can choose one that includes letters we haven't tested yet.

For instance, DROLL uses D, L; but L we know is present.
PROWL uses P and W; W not tested.
GROWL uses G and W; similar.
TROLL uses T.

W hasn't been tested, so it's better to include W to see if it's present.

Similarly, we can test position 1.

Since we only have 4 tries left (since 2 done), we need to be efficient.

Guess ""prowl"" to test:
- If correct, we win or get info.
- If not, feedback will help.

Suppose secret is T R O L L, and we guess P R O W L, feedback as above: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

Then we know position 1 is not P, position 4 is not W, and W not in word.

Similarly, if secret is DROOL, guess PROWL: P R O W L vs D R O O L
Pos1: P vs D → P not present (secret letter D), so if P not in word, P(x)
Pos4: W vs O → O is in word, but not in pos4; W not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L no W, so W(x)
Pos5 L ✓
So similar to above.

But it would reveal that position 4 is not W, etc.

Alternatively, if I guess a word where position 4 is L, like ""troll"", and it is correct, good, or if wrong, feedback.

But since position 5 is L, guessing L at position 4 might cause duplicate issue.

To avoid that, perhaps guess ""drool"", which has O at position 4.

""drool"" is D R O O L

If I guess ""drool"":
- Position 4 O, but we know O is already in position 3.

If secret is ""drool"", it works.
If secret is ""troll"", guess ""drool"": D R O O L vs T R O L L
Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret T,R,O,L,L, so D(x)
Pos2 R✓
Pos3 O✓
Pos4 O vs L → L is in secret, not in pos4; O is in secret but O in secret is only pos3? If secret has one O, O present but not pos4.

Secret ""troll"" has letters T,R,O,L – O appears once at pos3.
Guess pos4 is O, which is not in secret at pos4, and O is present but at pos3, so it might show - for position 4? But position 4 symbol for O: O is in word but wrong position, since it should be at pos3.

Similarly, position 4 secret is L, guess is O.

So symbol for O at pos4: - (since O is in word but not at pos4)
Then pos5 both L, ✓

Symbols: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)? For pos4 O(-) meaning O present but wrong position.

But we already know O is in pos3, so this might be redundant.

To simplify, for the third guess, I'll guess ""prowl"" to test a new letter W.

So guess ""prowl"".

If feedback shows W(-), it means position 4 has something else but W is in word, etc.

Or if it's W(✓), then good.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- For ""crane"": R is in position 2 and correct. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- For ""broil"": R (position 2) is correct, O (position 3) is correct, L (position 5) is correct, and B and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form _ R O _ L.  
- Position 2 is R, position 3 is O, position 5 is L.  
- Letters not in the word: A, B, C, E, I, N (from feedback).  
- Letters to test: Position 1 needs a consonant like D, G, P, T, or W, and position 4 needs to be filled. Since ""broil"" indicated ""I"" is absent in position 4, we need a new letter there.

Possible candidate words include:
- PROWL (if position 1 is P and position 4 is W)
- GROWL (G and W)
- TROLL (T and L, but L is already at position 5)
- DROLL (D and L, same as TROLL)
- DROOL (D and O, but O is at position 3)

To maximize information, we should guess a word that tests less common letters and avoids redundant checks. ""PROWL"" introduces W, a new untested letter, and positions 1 and 4 are fresh. If not correct, feedback on P or W will help narrow down options (e.g., if P is absent, we consider G or D for position 1; if W is absent, position 4 might be something else like L or O).

Thus, ""prowl"" is an efficient guess to distinguish between possibilities like GROWL, TROLL, etc.

<guess>prowl</guess>",prowl,"First, I have the feedback from two previous guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane""  
   - Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
   This means:  
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).  
   - C, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess 2: ""broil""  
   - Feedback: B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)  
   This means:  
   - R is still correct in position 2 (as we already knew).  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (I assume position 3 based on ""broil"" being B-R-O-I-L).  
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
   - B is not in the word (which we didn't know before, but now we do).  
   - I is not in the word (new information).

So, summarizing what we know:

- The secret word has the form: _ R ? _ ? where:
  - Position 2 is R (confirmed).
  - Position 3 must be O, since O(✓) in ""broil"" position 3.
  - Position 5 must be L, since L(✓) in ""broil"" position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, I (from feedback: C(x), A(x), N(x), E(x), B(x), I(x)).
- So, absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ R O _ L

We need to fill in the first and fourth positions.

Letters we haven't used or tested yet: From the alphabet, excluding known absent letters and known present letters.

Known present and placed:
- R in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 5

We don't know about position 1 and position 4 yet.

Letters that could be present are ones not ruled out. Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Common vowels: U is not ruled out? We haven't tested U. Consonants like D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y, Z are possible.

But we need to form a valid English word of the form _ R O _ L.

What words fit this pattern? Let me list some 5-letter words ending with L and ""RO"" in positions 2-3.

Possible words:

- TROLL
- DROLL
- PROWL
- GROWL
- FROWL – is ""frowl"" a word? Not common; frown is 4-letter, so probably not.
- BROWL – not a word.
- CROWL – not common; crow is 4-letter.
- PROWL is valid.
- GROWL is valid.
- TROLL is valid.
- DROLL is valid.
- From above, position 1: could be T, D, P, G, etc.

Now, we need to consider the feedback that certain letters are absent.

For example, in ""broil"", B and I are absent, which we've noted.

We have to make a guess that might confirm position 1 and introduce a new letter for position 4.

But we know position 1 isn't B (from guess 2), and it can't be C, A, E, I, N from guess 1.

So position 1 possibilities: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Position 4 possibilities: similarly, we don't know much yet.

From guess 2 ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, so the fourth letter is not I, but it could be something else.

Possible words: let's list common ones.

- GROWL: G R O W L
- PROWL: P R O W L
- DROLL: D R O L L – wait, ""droll"" is D R O L L, so positions: D, R, O, L, L. So position 4 is L? But position 5 is L, so it has L in both positions. But that's possible.

In ""droll"", if secret word is ""droll"", and we guessed ""broil"", what would feedback be?

""broil"": B R O I L vs ""droll"": D R O L L

Position 2: R matches, so ✓

Position 3: O matches, so ✓

Position 1: B vs D – B is not in secret word (since D is there, but B not present), so x

Position 4: I vs L – L is in the word but not in position 4? Secret word has L in position 4 and 5. In ""broil"", position 4 is I, which is not in the word, so I(x). But L is in the word, but in different positions. Since we have L in position 5 (✓), but position 4 L might be revealed as present but wrong position if we guess something else.

But in actual feedback for guess 2, we have R(✓), O(✓), L(✓) which means L is correct in position 5. And I(x) means I is absent. B(x) absent. Also, in position 4 of guess was I, which is wrong.

Now back to possibilities for secret word: _ R O _ L

Position 1 could be: consonant, and position 4 could be a vowel or consonant.

Common words:

- Troll
- Droll
- Prowl
- Growl
- Froll isn't word
- Croll isn't word
- Stroll – S T R O L, but that's S(1), T(2)? No, pattern requires position 2 R, position 3 O, so ""stroll"" has S, T, R, O, L – so position 2 is T? Not R. So not matching.

We need position 2 to be R, position 3 to be O, position 5 to be L.

So ""troll"" has T, R, O, L, L? T R O L L? ""Troll"" is T-R-O-L-L? Five letters, so T(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). So yes.

Similarly, ""droll"" is D-R-O-L-L, same as troll but D.

But ""prowl"" is P-R-O-W-L, so positions P(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5).

""growl"" is G-R-O-W-L.

""scroll"" is S-C-R-O-L, but position 2 is C? Not R. ""Scroll"" has S(1), C(2), R(3), O(4), L(5), so positions don't match our pattern. We need R in pos 2 and O in pos 3.

Other possibilities: ""broil"" itself, but B is absent, so no. Or ""drool"", but ""drool"" is D-R-O-O-L, so D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). Is ""drool"" a word? Yes.

So possible secret words: 
- Troll: T R O L L
- Droll: D R O L L
- Drool: D R O O L
- Prowl: P R O W L
- Growl: G R O W L
- Frowl: F R O W L? Or ""frowl"" might not be common; let's check if it's valid. Yes, frowl can mean to frown or something, but less common.
- Scowl: S C O W L? Position 2 is C, not R. No.
- Propel: P R O P E L, but E is absent? E is ruled out from guess 1 feedback (E(x)), so E cannot be in the word. Thus, ""propel"" has E, which is absent, so it can't be.

Similarly, any word with E, A, N, etc., is invalid.

Potential words:
- With position 4 as L: troll, droll – but in these, position 4 is L, and position 5 is also L, so they have two L's.
- With position 4 as something else: prowl, growl, drool (position 4 O).

Drool: D R O O L, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5).

We need to guess a word that can distinguish these possibilities or confirm the letters.

For the third guess, since we know the form is _ R O _ L, and letters absent: A,B,C,E,I,N.

Good to test letters that appear in multiple options.

For example:
- If we guess ""troll"", it could be tested directly.
- But we don't know if position 1 is T or D or P, etc.

We can include a new letter for position 4.

Position 4 possibilities: in known options, it could be L (for troll/droll), W (for prowl/growl), O (for drool), etc.

We haven't tested W or L in position 4, but we know L is in the word at position 5.

In feedback, from ""broil"", L is ✓ in position 5, so L is in the word, but there could be another L? Or not.

Feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple instances; it only gives symbols per position.

In ""broil"", L is ✓, so correct position.

Now for the secret word, position 4 might be L or not.

To get information, we should guess a word where position 4 is a letter we haven't tested.

For example, guess ""prowl"" to test if position 1 is P and position 4 is W.

But if the secret word is ""troll"", and we guess ""prowl"", what happens?

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: P R O W L

Feedback:
Pos 2: R ✓
Pos 3: O ✓
Pos 5: L ✓ (since both have L in pos 5)
Pos 1: P vs T – P not in secret (assuming T is different), so P(x)? But secret has T, but position different? Secret has T in pos 1, guess has P. Since P is not in secret (only if secret has no P), but if secret is ""troll"", no P, so P(x). Pos 4: W vs L – L is in secret, but not in position 4; it's in position 5. So since L is present but wrong position, it would be (-) for W? No.

Clarify feedback rules:
- For each position, comparing guess to secret.

In this case, for position 4 of guess: guess is W, secret is L.
Secret has L, but not in position 4 (since L is in pos 5), so symbol for W:
Since W is not in secret at all (secret ""troll"" has T,R,O,L,L – no W), so if W not in word, it would be x.
But W is not present, so x.
And for L in the guess? Only positions matter separately. For position 4 in guess is W, not L.

Feedback per position position by position.

Assume secret ""troll"" and guess ""prowl"":
- Pos 1: P vs T → T is not P, but T is in word? Secret has T in position 1, guess has P there. P is not in secret (secret has T,R,O,L,L – letters T,R,O,L; no P), so P not present → symbol x
- Pos 2: R vs R → same → ✓
- Pos 3: O vs O → same → ✓
- Pos 4: W vs L → L is in secret, but position: secret pos 4 is L, guess pos 4 is W. W not present in secret, so symbol for W should be x, since W ≠ L and W not in word.
Secret word is T R O L L, so letters: T,R,O,L.
W is not among them, so symbol for W: x.
Similarly, for pos 5: L vs L → ✓
So feedback would be P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

In our case, we know O and R are already confirmed, so guessing ""prowl"" directly could help.

Similarly, if secret is ""prowl"", feedback would be different.

But we have multiple options.

Since we need to find position 1 and position 4.

Another word: ""drool"" – D R O O L

If we guess ""drool"", and secret is, say, ""troll"", then feedback: 
- Pos1: D vs T → D not present? Secret TROLL, letters T,R,O,L; D not present → D(x)? Symbols: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), O vs L? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. O is in secret (pos3), so O is present but not in pos4 (since it's in pos3). Also, secret has O only once? Assume no duplicate for simplicity unless specified.

Duplicates: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.

Example: secret ""DROOL"" guess ""TROLL"", but we don't have that.

General rule: for each guess position, if the letter matches exactly, ✓. If not, but the letter is in the word, and hasn't been accounted for, -. Otherwise x.

But for now, back to guessing.

For a smart guess, I should choose a word that includes letters not yet tested and can test possibilities for position 1 and 4.

We know L is in position 5, so we don't need to guess letters for position 5.

Position 1 candidates: D, G, P, T, W? From common options.

Position 4 candidates: W (as in prowl), O (as in drool), L (as in troll, droll).

Letters not yet used: from previous guesses, we have used C,R,A,N,E in guess1, and B,R,O,I,L in guess2. So all letters: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,I,L.

So unused common letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,S,T,U,W,Y,Z, etc.

To maximize information, guess a word like ""prowl"" or ""troll"".

But if I guess ""troll"", for example:
- If the word is ""troll"", I win.
- If not, I get feedback.

Similarly.

But perhaps ""prowl"" is better because it introduces W.

Since we have multiple options, I can guess a word that tests the fourth position.

For example, the fourth position could be:
- In ""troll"" and ""droll"", it's L
- In ""prowl"" and ""growl"", it's W
- In ""drool"", it's O

And letters like L and O we already know are present (O at pos3, L at pos5), but position 4 might be different or same.

To distinguish, I need to include a letter for position 4 that isn't L or O, or test it.

Guess a word where position 4 is not L or O, but a new letter, like W.

But in ""prowl"", position 4 is W.

Position 1 could be P as well.

Another idea: guess ""grown"", but N is absent? From guess1, N(x), so cannot use N. Also, ""grown"" is 5 letters? G R O W N, but N is absent, and position 5 should be L, not N.

We know position 5 is L, so any guess must have L in position 5 to confirm or get feedback.

In guess, I can guess a different word, but since position 5 is confirmed L, it's efficient to guess L.

But position 1 and 4 need to be found.

So for guess 3, I should guess a word of the pattern _ R O _ L, with new letters.

For example:
- If I guess ""growl"", if position 1 is G and position 4 is W, it might be correct or not.
- Similarly with ""prowl"".

Since ""broil"" had O(✓) and L(✓), we know O and L are fixed.

Now, what about position 4? It wasn't tested since I was x.

So let's list all possible words fitting _ R O _ L with no forbidden letters.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,I,N

Possible words:
1. DROLL (if four letters: D,R,O,L,L, it's D R O L L with repeated L)
2. DROOL (D R O O L, with repeated O)
3. PROWL (P R O W L)
4. GROWL (G R O W L)
5. TROLL (T R O L L with repeated L)
6. Others like FROWL (F R O W L), but less common; BROIL is not due to B absent; SHOWL not word, etc.

Common are likely DROLL, DROOL, PROWL, GROWL, TROLL.

Now, to guess: I can choose one that includes letters we haven't tested yet.

For instance, DROLL uses D, L; but L we know is present.
PROWL uses P and W; W not tested.
GROWL uses G and W; similar.
TROLL uses T.

W hasn't been tested, so it's better to include W to see if it's present.

Similarly, we can test position 1.

Since we only have 4 tries left (since 2 done), we need to be efficient.

Guess ""prowl"" to test:
- If correct, we win or get info.
- If not, feedback will help.

Suppose secret is T R O L L, and we guess P R O W L, feedback as above: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

Then we know position 1 is not P, position 4 is not W, and W not in word.

Similarly, if secret is DROOL, guess PROWL: P R O W L vs D R O O L
Pos1: P vs D → P not present (secret letter D), so if P not in word, P(x)
Pos4: W vs O → O is in word, but not in pos4; W not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L no W, so W(x)
Pos5 L ✓
So similar to above.

But it would reveal that position 4 is not W, etc.

Alternatively, if I guess a word where position 4 is L, like ""troll"", and it is correct, good, or if wrong, feedback.

But since position 5 is L, guessing L at position 4 might cause duplicate issue.

To avoid that, perhaps guess ""drool"", which has O at position 4.

""drool"" is D R O O L

If I guess ""drool"":
- Position 4 O, but we know O is already in position 3.

If secret is ""drool"", it works.
If secret is ""troll"", guess ""drool"": D R O O L vs T R O L L
Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret T,R,O,L,L, so D(x)
Pos2 R✓
Pos3 O✓
Pos4 O vs L → L is in secret, not in pos4; O is in secret but O in secret is only pos3? If secret has one O, O present but not pos4.

Secret ""troll"" has letters T,R,O,L – O appears once at pos3.
Guess pos4 is O, which is not in secret at pos4, and O is present but at pos3, so it might show - for position 4? But position 4 symbol for O: O is in word but wrong position, since it should be at pos3.

Similarly, position 4 secret is L, guess is O.

So symbol for O at pos4: - (since O is in word but not at pos4)
Then pos5 both L, ✓

Symbols: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)? For pos4 O(-) meaning O present but wrong position.

But we already know O is in pos3, so this might be redundant.

To simplify, for the third guess, I'll guess ""prowl"" to test a new letter W.

So guess ""prowl"".

If feedback shows W(-), it means position 4 has something else but W is in word, etc.

Or if it's W(✓), then good.Based on the previous feedback:

- For ""crane"": R is in position 2 and correct. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- For ""broil"": R (position 2) is correct, O (position 3) is correct, L (position 5) is correct, and B and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form _ R O _ L.  
- Position 2 is R, position 3 is O, position 5 is L.  
- Letters not in the word: A, B, C, E, I, N (from feedback).  
- Letters to test: Position 1 needs a consonant like D, G, P, T, or W, and position 4 needs to be filled. Since ""broil"" indicated ""I"" is absent in position 4, we need a new letter there.

Possible candidate words include:
- PROWL (if position 1 is P and position 4 is W)
- GROWL (G and W)
- TROLL (T and L, but L is already at position 5)
- DROLL (D and L, same as TROLL)
- DROOL (D and O, but O is at position 3)

To maximize information, we should guess a word that tests less common letters and avoids redundant checks. ""PROWL"" introduces W, a new untested letter, and positions 1 and 4 are fresh. If not correct, feedback on P or W will help narrow down options (e.g., if P is absent, we consider G or D for position 1; if W is absent, position 4 might be something else like L or O).

Thus, ""prowl"" is an efficient guess to distinguish between possibilities like GROWL, TROLL, etc.",Guess 3: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,drool,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have to guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries.
 Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We need to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 Commonly, starting words with a mix of common consonants and vowels are chosen to cover frequent letters.
 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
 Let's use that as our first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

We have to make a second guess. We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter (since we know it's in the correct position).
- Does not contain C, A, N, E (because they are not in the word).

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words with R in the second position:

- TRY: words like ""BRICK"", ""BRISK"", ""BROWN"", ""FRUIT"", ""GRASP"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINT"", etc.

But note: we cannot use A (from ""GRASP"") because A is not in the word. Similarly, we cannot use E (from ""PRINT"") because E is not in the word.

So, we must avoid A, C, E, N.

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""BROWN"": B, R (fixed), O, W, N -> but N is not allowed? Wait, N is in the word? No, feedback said N is not in the word. So we cannot use N? Actually, we can use any letters in our guess, but if we use a letter that we know is not in the word, it might not be optimal because it won't help us find the word. However, we are allowed to guess words with letters we know are not in the word? But it's better to avoid them to get more information about other letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that C, A, N, E are not in the word. So we should avoid them to test new letters.

So, for the second guess, we want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Uses letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to form a word without A, C, E, N.

Some options:
- ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all new letters.
- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> but S and H are new.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word, but we can still use it? However, using a letter we know is not in the word would waste a slot. So better to avoid.

We should avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (C, A, N, E) because they won't help us get new information.

So, let's choose a word without those.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good candidate: 
- B: new
- R: fixed in position 2
- O: new
- I: new
- L: new

Alternatively, ""BRISK"": 
- B: new
- R: fixed
- I: new
- S: new
- K: new

But we don't know if these letters are in the word or not.

Another option: ""PRISM"": 
- P: new
- R: fixed
- I: new
- S: new
- M: new

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a valid word.

But let me check: BROIL means to cook with direct heat.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRYST"": 
- T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T.

But we want to cover more letters. ""BROIL"" has 5 distinct letters.

Another common word: ""FRUIT"" -> but it has U and I, but also F. However, we know from the first guess that the word does not have A, C, E, N. But ""FRUIT"" has F, R, U, I, T. But R is fixed. However, the first letter F is new.

But note: we are not restricted to not use letters we haven't tried, but we should avoid the ones we know are absent.

So, ""FRUIT"" is acceptable? But we don't know if F is in the word or not.

But we are trying to get information. So using F, U, I, T is good.

However, we have to have R in the second position.

I think ""BROIL"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

Alternatively, ""PRICK"": but that has C? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid.

Wait, ""PRICK"" has C, which we know is not in the word. So we shouldn't use it.

Similarly, ""BRICK"" has C.

So, let's avoid words with C, A, N, E.

Another word: ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. But we don't know about G, U, M, P.

But ""GRUMP"" is a word? Grump means a grumpy person.

But I think ""BROIL"" is more common.

Another: ""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S. All new.

But we don't know if D, O, P, S are in the word.

I think ""DROPS"" is a good one too.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""BROIL"" because it has common vowels and consonants.

So, second guess: BROIL

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word. We are testing B, O, I, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common letters. For example, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S. But T is a common letter.

But we don't know about T.

I think ""BROIL"" is fine.

But let me think: the word has R in the second position and does not have C, A, N, E. So the word must be of the form _ R _ _ _

We are going to guess ""BROIL"".

So, the guess is ""BROIL"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes new common letters to maximize information (e.g., B, O, I, L, S, T).

I considered words like ""BROIL"" (which uses B, O, I, L) and ""BRISK"" (which uses B, I, S, K). ""BROIL"" is a strong choice because it tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids known absent letters.

   - R is still correct in position 2 (as we already knew).  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (I assume position 3 based on ""broil"" being B-R-O-I-L).  
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
   - B is not in the word (which we didn't know before, but now we do).  
   - I is not in the word (new information).

So, summarizing what we know:

- The secret word has the form: _ R ? _ ? where:
  - Position 2 is R (confirmed).
  - Position 3 must be O, since O(✓) in ""broil"" position 3.
  - Position 5 must be L, since L(✓) in ""broil"" position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, I (from feedback: C(x), A(x), N(x), E(x), B(x), I(x)).
- So, absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ R O _ L

We need to fill in the first and fourth positions.

Letters we haven't used or tested yet: From the alphabet, excluding known absent letters and known present letters.

Known present and placed:
- R in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 5

We don't know about position 1 and position 4 yet.

Letters that could be present are ones not ruled out. Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Common vowels: U is not ruled out? We haven't tested U. Consonants like D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y, Z are possible.

But we need to form a valid English word of the form _ R O _ L.

What words fit this pattern? Let me list some 5-letter words ending with L and ""RO"" in positions 2-3.

Possible words:

- TROLL
- DROLL
- PROWL
- GROWL
- FROWL – is ""frowl"" a word? Not common; frown is 4-letter, so probably not.
- BROWL – not a word.
- CROWL – not common; crow is 4-letter.
- PROWL is valid.
- GROWL is valid.
- TROLL is valid.
- DROLL is valid.
- From above, position 1: could be T, D, P, G, etc.

Now, we need to consider the feedback that certain letters are absent.

For example, in ""broil"", B and I are absent, which we've noted.

We have to make a guess that might confirm position 1 and introduce a new letter for position 4.

But we know position 1 isn't B (from guess 2), and it can't be C, A, E, I, N from guess 1.

So position 1 possibilities: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Position 4 possibilities: similarly, we don't know much yet.

From guess 2 ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, so the fourth letter is not I, but it could be something else.

Possible words: let's list common ones.

- GROWL: G R O W L
- PROWL: P R O W L
- DROLL: D R O L L – wait, ""droll"" is D R O L L, so positions: D, R, O, L, L. So position 4 is L? But position 5 is L, so it has L in both positions. But that's possible.

In ""droll"", if secret word is ""droll"", and we guessed ""broil"", what would feedback be?

""broil"": B R O I L vs ""droll"": D R O L L

Position 2: R matches, so ✓

Position 3: O matches, so ✓

Position 1: B vs D – B is not in secret word (since D is there, but B not present), so x

Position 4: I vs L – L is in the word but not in position 4? Secret word has L in position 4 and 5. In ""broil"", position 4 is I, which is not in the word, so I(x). But L is in the word, but in different positions. Since we have L in position 5 (✓), but position 4 L might be revealed as present but wrong position if we guess something else.

But in actual feedback for guess 2, we have R(✓), O(✓), L(✓) which means L is correct in position 5. And I(x) means I is absent. B(x) absent. Also, in position 4 of guess was I, which is wrong.

Now back to possibilities for secret word: _ R O _ L

Position 1 could be: consonant, and position 4 could be a vowel or consonant.

Common words:

- Troll
- Droll
- Prowl
- Growl
- Froll isn't word
- Croll isn't word
- Stroll – S T R O L, but that's S(1), T(2)? No, pattern requires position 2 R, position 3 O, so ""stroll"" has S, T, R, O, L – so position 2 is T? Not R. So not matching.

We need position 2 to be R, position 3 to be O, position 5 to be L.

So ""troll"" has T, R, O, L, L? T R O L L? ""Troll"" is T-R-O-L-L? Five letters, so T(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). So yes.

Similarly, ""droll"" is D-R-O-L-L, same as troll but D.

But ""prowl"" is P-R-O-W-L, so positions P(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5).

""growl"" is G-R-O-W-L.

""scroll"" is S-C-R-O-L, but position 2 is C? Not R. ""Scroll"" has S(1), C(2), R(3), O(4), L(5), so positions don't match our pattern. We need R in pos 2 and O in pos 3.

Other possibilities: ""broil"" itself, but B is absent, so no. Or ""drool"", but ""drool"" is D-R-O-O-L, so D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). Is ""drool"" a word? Yes.

So possible secret words: 
- Troll: T R O L L
- Droll: D R O L L
- Drool: D R O O L
- Prowl: P R O W L
- Growl: G R O W L
- Frowl: F R O W L? Or ""frowl"" might not be common; let's check if it's valid. Yes, frowl can mean to frown or something, but less common.
- Scowl: S C O W L? Position 2 is C, not R. No.
- Propel: P R O P E L, but E is absent? E is ruled out from guess 1 feedback (E(x)), so E cannot be in the word. Thus, ""propel"" has E, which is absent, so it can't be.

Similarly, any word with E, A, N, etc., is invalid.

Potential words:
- With position 4 as L: troll, droll – but in these, position 4 is L, and position 5 is also L, so they have two L's.
- With position 4 as something else: prowl, growl, drool (position 4 O).

Drool: D R O O L, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5).

We need to guess a word that can distinguish these possibilities or confirm the letters.

For the third guess, since we know the form is _ R O _ L, and letters absent: A,B,C,E,I,N.

Good to test letters that appear in multiple options.

For example:
- If we guess ""troll"", it could be tested directly.
- But we don't know if position 1 is T or D or P, etc.

We can include a new letter for position 4.

Position 4 possibilities: in known options, it could be L (for troll/droll), W (for prowl/growl), O (for drool), etc.

We haven't tested W or L in position 4, but we know L is in the word at position 5.

In feedback, from ""broil"", L is ✓ in position 5, so L is in the word, but there could be another L? Or not.

Feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple instances; it only gives symbols per position.

In ""broil"", L is ✓, so correct position.

Now for the secret word, position 4 might be L or not.

To get information, we should guess a word where position 4 is a letter we haven't tested.

For example, guess ""prowl"" to test if position 1 is P and position 4 is W.

But if the secret word is ""troll"", and we guess ""prowl"", what happens?

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: P R O W L

Feedback:
Pos 2: R ✓
Pos 3: O ✓
Pos 5: L ✓ (since both have L in pos 5)
Pos 1: P vs T – P not in secret (assuming T is different), so P(x)? But secret has T, but position different? Secret has T in pos 1, guess has P. Since P is not in secret (only if secret has no P), but if secret is ""troll"", no P, so P(x). Pos 4: W vs L – L is in secret, but not in position 4; it's in position 5. So since L is present but wrong position, it would be (-) for W? No.

Clarify feedback rules:
- For each position, comparing guess to secret.

In this case, for position 4 of guess: guess is W, secret is L.
Secret has L, but not in position 4 (since L is in pos 5), so symbol for W:
Since W is not in secret at all (secret ""troll"" has T,R,O,L,L – no W), so if W not in word, it would be x.
But W is not present, so x.
And for L in the guess? Only positions matter separately. For position 4 in guess is W, not L.

Feedback per position position by position.

Assume secret ""troll"" and guess ""prowl"":
- Pos 1: P vs T → T is not P, but T is in word? Secret has T in position 1, guess has P there. P is not in secret (secret has T,R,O,L,L – letters T,R,O,L; no P), so P not present → symbol x
- Pos 2: R vs R → same → ✓
- Pos 3: O vs O → same → ✓
- Pos 4: W vs L → L is in secret, but position: secret pos 4 is L, guess pos 4 is W. W not present in secret, so symbol for W should be x, since W ≠ L and W not in word.
Secret word is T R O L L, so letters: T,R,O,L.
W is not among them, so symbol for W: x.
Similarly, for pos 5: L vs L → ✓
So feedback would be P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

In our case, we know O and R are already confirmed, so guessing ""prowl"" directly could help.

Similarly, if secret is ""prowl"", feedback would be different.

But we have multiple options.

Since we need to find position 1 and position 4.

Another word: ""drool"" – D R O O L

If we guess ""drool"", and secret is, say, ""troll"", then feedback: 
- Pos1: D vs T → D not present? Secret TROLL, letters T,R,O,L; D not present → D(x)? Symbols: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), O vs L? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. O is in secret (pos3), so O is present but not in pos4 (since it's in pos3). Also, secret has O only once? Assume no duplicate for simplicity unless specified.

Duplicates: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.

Example: secret ""DROOL"" guess ""TROLL"", but we don't have that.

General rule: for each guess position, if the letter matches exactly, ✓. If not, but the letter is in the word, and hasn't been accounted for, -. Otherwise x.

But for now, back to guessing.

For a smart guess, I should choose a word that includes letters not yet tested and can test possibilities for position 1 and 4.

We know L is in position 5, so we don't need to guess letters for position 5.

Position 1 candidates: D, G, P, T, W? From common options.

Position 4 candidates: W (as in prowl), O (as in drool), L (as in troll, droll).

Letters not yet used: from previous guesses, we have used C,R,A,N,E in guess1, and B,R,O,I,L in guess2. So all letters: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,I,L.

So unused common letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,S,T,U,W,Y,Z, etc.

To maximize information, guess a word like ""prowl"" or ""troll"".

But if I guess ""troll"", for example:
- If the word is ""troll"", I win.
- If not, I get feedback.

Similarly.

But perhaps ""prowl"" is better because it introduces W.

Since we have multiple options, I can guess a word that tests the fourth position.

For example, the fourth position could be:
- In ""troll"" and ""droll"", it's L
- In ""prowl"" and ""growl"", it's W
- In ""drool"", it's O

And letters like L and O we already know are present (O at pos3, L at pos5), but position 4 might be different or same.

To distinguish, I need to include a letter for position 4 that isn't L or O, or test it.

Guess a word where position 4 is not L or O, but a new letter, like W.

But in ""prowl"", position 4 is W.

Position 1 could be P as well.

Another idea: guess ""grown"", but N is absent? From guess1, N(x), so cannot use N. Also, ""grown"" is 5 letters? G R O W N, but N is absent, and position 5 should be L, not N.

We know position 5 is L, so any guess must have L in position 5 to confirm or get feedback.

In guess, I can guess a different word, but since position 5 is confirmed L, it's efficient to guess L.

But position 1 and 4 need to be found.

So for guess 3, I should guess a word of the pattern _ R O _ L, with new letters.

For example:
- If I guess ""growl"", if position 1 is G and position 4 is W, it might be correct or not.
- Similarly with ""prowl"".

Since ""broil"" had O(✓) and L(✓), we know O and L are fixed.

Now, what about position 4? It wasn't tested since I was x.

So let's list all possible words fitting _ R O _ L with no forbidden letters.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,I,N

Possible words:
1. DROLL (if four letters: D,R,O,L,L, it's D R O L L with repeated L)
2. DROOL (D R O O L, with repeated O)
3. PROWL (P R O W L)
4. GROWL (G R O W L)
5. TROLL (T R O L L with repeated L)
6. Others like FROWL (F R O W L), but less common; BROIL is not due to B absent; SHOWL not word, etc.

Common are likely DROLL, DROOL, PROWL, GROWL, TROLL.

Now, to guess: I can choose one that includes letters we haven't tested yet.

For instance, DROLL uses D, L; but L we know is present.
PROWL uses P and W; W not tested.
GROWL uses G and W; similar.
TROLL uses T.

W hasn't been tested, so it's better to include W to see if it's present.

Similarly, we can test position 1.

Since we only have 4 tries left (since 2 done), we need to be efficient.

Guess ""prowl"" to test:
- If correct, we win or get info.
- If not, feedback will help.

Suppose secret is T R O L L, and we guess P R O W L, feedback as above: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

Then we know position 1 is not P, position 4 is not W, and W not in word.

Similarly, if secret is DROOL, guess PROWL: P R O W L vs D R O O L
Pos1: P vs D → P not present (secret letter D), so if P not in word, P(x)
Pos4: W vs O → O is in word, but not in pos4; W not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L no W, so W(x)
Pos5 L ✓
So similar to above.

But it would reveal that position 4 is not W, etc.

Alternatively, if I guess a word where position 4 is L, like ""troll"", and it is correct, good, or if wrong, feedback.

But since position 5 is L, guessing L at position 4 might cause duplicate issue.

To avoid that, perhaps guess ""drool"", which has O at position 4.

""drool"" is D R O O L

If I guess ""drool"":
- Position 4 O, but we know O is already in position 3.

If secret is ""drool"", it works.
If secret is ""troll"", guess ""drool"": D R O O L vs T R O L L
Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret T,R,O,L,L, so D(x)
Pos2 R✓
Pos3 O✓
Pos4 O vs L → L is in secret, not in pos4; O is in secret but O in secret is only pos3? If secret has one O, O present but not pos4.

Secret ""troll"" has letters T,R,O,L – O appears once at pos3.
Guess pos4 is O, which is not in secret at pos4, and O is present but at pos3, so it might show - for position 4? But position 4 symbol for O: O is in word but wrong position, since it should be at pos3.

Similarly, position 4 secret is L, guess is O.

So symbol for O at pos4: - (since O is in word but not at pos4)
Then pos5 both L, ✓

Symbols: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)? For pos4 O(-) meaning O present but wrong position.

But we already know O is in pos3, so this might be redundant.

To simplify, for the third guess, I'll guess ""prowl"" to test a new letter W.

So guess ""prowl"".

If feedback shows W(-), it means position 4 has something else but W is in word, etc.

Or if it's W(✓), then good.Based on the previous feedback:

- For ""crane"": R is in position 2 and correct. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- For ""broil"": R (position 2) is correct, O (position 3) is correct, L (position 5) is correct, and B and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form _ R O _ L.  
- Position 2 is R, position 3 is O, position 5 is L.  
- Letters not in the word: A, B, C, E, I, N (from feedback).  
- Letters to test: Position 1 needs a consonant like D, G, P, T, or W, and position 4 needs to be filled. Since ""broil"" indicated ""I"" is absent in position 4, we need a new letter there.

Possible candidate words include:
- PROWL (if position 1 is P and position 4 is W)
- GROWL (G and W)
- TROLL (T and L, but L is already at position 5)
- DROLL (D and L, same as TROLL)
- DROOL (D and O, but O is at position 3)

To maximize information, we should guess a word that tests less common letters and avoids redundant checks. ""PROWL"" introduces W, a new untested letter, and positions 1 and 4 are fresh. If not correct, feedback on P or W will help narrow down options (e.g., if P is absent, we consider G or D for position 1; if W is absent, position 4 might be something else like L or O).

Thus, ""prowl"" is an efficient guess to distinguish between possibilities like GROWL, TROLL, etc.

Wait, N is in the word? No, feedback said N is not in the word. So we cannot use N? Actually, we can use any letters in our guess, but if we use a letter that we know is not in the word, it might not be optimal because it won\'t help us find the word. However, we are allowed to guess words with letters we know are not in the word?

And we don\'t know about T.\n\nBut we want to cover more letters. ""BROIL"" has 5 distinct letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""FRUIT"" -> but it has U and I, but also F. However, we know from the first guess that the word does not have A, C, E, N. But ""FRUIT"" has F, R, U, I, T. But R is fixed. However, the first letter F is new.\n\nBut note: we are not restricted to not use letters we haven\'t tried, but we should avoid the ones we know are absent.\n\nSo, ""FRUIT"" is acceptable? But we don\'t know if F is in the word or not.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. So using F, U, I, T is good.\n\nHowever, we have to have R in the second position.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRICK"": but that has C? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid.\n\nWait, ""PRICK"" has C, which we know is not in the word. So we shouldn\'t use it.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRICK"" has C.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with C, A, N, E.\n\nAnother word: ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. But we don\'t know about G, U, M, P.\n\nBut ""GRUMP"" is a word? Grump means a grumpy person.\n\nBut I think ""BROIL"" is more common.\n\nAnother: ""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S. All new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D, O, P, S are in the word.\n\nI think ""DROPS"" is a good one too.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BROIL"" because it has common vowels and consonants.\n\nSo, second guess: BROIL\n\nBut note: we are not sure if B is in the word. We are testing B, O, I, L.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has more common letters. For example, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S. But T is a common letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know about T.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" is fine.\n\nBut let me think: the word has R in the second position and does not have C, A, N, E.

Guess 2: ""broil""  \n   - Feedback: B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)  \n   This means:  \n   - R is still correct in position 2 (as we already knew).  \n   - O is in the word and in the correct position (I assume position 3 based on ""broil"" being B-R-O-I-L).  \n   - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  \n   - B is not in the word (which we didn\'t know before, but now we do).  \n   - I is not in the word (new information).\n\nSo, summarizing what we know:\n\n- The secret word has the form: _ R ? _ ? where:\n  - Position 2 is R (confirmed).\n  - Position 3 must be O, since O(✓) in ""broil"" position 3.\n  - Position 5 must be L, since L(✓) in ""broil"" position 5.\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, I (from feedback: C(x), A(x), N(x), E(x), B(x), I(x)).\n- So, absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N.\n\nNow, the secret word is of the form: _ R O _ L\n\nWe need to fill in the first and fourth positions.\n\nLetters we haven\'t used or tested yet: From the alphabet, excluding known absent letters and known present letters.\n\nKnown present and placed:\n- R in position 2\n- O in position 3\n- L in position 5\n\nWe don\'t know about position 1 and position 4 yet.\n\nLetters that could be present are ones not ruled out. Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N.\n\nCommon vowels: U is not ruled out? We haven\'t tested U. Consonants like D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y, Z are possible.\n\nBut we need to form a valid English word of the form _ R O _ L.\n\nWhat words fit this pattern? Let me list some 5-letter words ending with L and ""RO"" in positions 2-3.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- TROLL\n- DROLL\n- PROWL\n- GROWL\n- FROWL – is ""frowl"" a word? Not common; frown is 4-letter, so probably not.\n- BROWL – not a word.\n- CROWL – not common; crow is 4-letter.\n- PROWL is valid.\n- GROWL is valid.\n- TROLL is valid.\n- DROLL is valid.\n- From above, position 1: could be T, D, P, G, etc.\n\nNow, we need to consider the feedback that certain letters are absent.\n\nFor example, in ""broil"", B and I are absent, which we\'ve noted.\n\nWe have to make a guess that might confirm position 1 and introduce a new letter for position 4.\n\nBut we know position 1 isn\'t B (from guess 2), and it can\'t be C, A, E, I, N from guess 1.\n\nSo position 1 possibilities: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, etc.\n\nPosition 4 possibilities: similarly, we don\'t know much yet.\n\nFrom guess 2 ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, so the fourth letter is not I, but it could be something else.\n\nPossible words: let\'s list common ones.\n\n- GROWL: G R O W L\n- PROWL: P R O W L\n- DROLL: D R O L L – wait, ""droll"" is D R O L L, so positions: D, R, O, L, L. So position 4 is L? But position 5 is L, so it has L in both positions. But that\'s possible.\n\nIn ""droll"", if secret word is ""droll"", and we guessed ""broil"", what would feedback be?\n\n""broil"": B R O I L vs ""droll"": D R O L L\n\nPosition 2: R matches, so ✓\n\nPosition 3: O matches, so ✓\n\nPosition 1: B vs D – B is not in secret word (since D is there, but B not present), so x\n\nPosition 4: I vs L – L is in the word but not in position 4? Secret word has L in position 4 and 5. In ""broil"", position 4 is I, which is not in the word, so I(x). But L is in the word, but in different positions. Since we have L in position 5 (✓), but position 4 L might be revealed as present but wrong position if we guess something else.\n\nBut in actual feedback for guess 2, we have R(✓), O(✓), L(✓) which means L is correct in position 5. And I(x) means I is absent. B(x) absent. Also, in position 4 of guess was I, which is wrong.\n\nNow back to possibilities for secret word: _ R O _ L\n\nPosition 1 could be: consonant, and position 4 could be a vowel or consonant.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- Troll\n- Droll\n- Prowl\n- Growl\n- Froll isn\'t word\n- Croll isn\'t word\n- Stroll – S T R O L, but that\'s S(1), T(2)? No, pattern requires position 2 R, position 3 O, so ""stroll"" has S, T, R, O, L – so position 2 is T? Not R. So not matching.\n\nWe need position 2 to be R, position 3 to be O, position 5 to be L.\n\nSo ""troll"" has T, R, O, L, L? T R O L L? ""Troll"" is T-R-O-L-L? Five letters, so T(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). So yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""droll"" is D-R-O-L-L, same as troll but D.\n\nBut ""prowl"" is P-R-O-W-L, so positions P(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5).\n\n""growl"" is G-R-O-W-L.\n\n""scroll"" is S-C-R-O-L, but position 2 is C? Not R. ""Scroll"" has S(1), C(2), R(3), O(4), L(5), so positions don\'t match our pattern. We need R in pos 2 and O in pos 3.\n\nOther possibilities: ""broil"" itself, but B is absent, so no. Or ""drool"", but ""drool"" is D-R-O-O-L, so D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). Is ""drool"" a word? Yes.\n\nSo possible secret words: \n- Troll: T R O L L\n- Droll: D R O L L\n- Drool: D R O O L\n- Prowl: P R O W L\n- Growl: G R O W L\n- Frowl: F R O W L? Or ""frowl"" might not be common; let\'s check if it\'s valid. Yes, frowl can mean to frown or something, but less common.\n- Scowl: S C O W L? Position 2 is C, not R. No.\n- Propel: P R O P E L, but E is absent? E is ruled out from guess 1 feedback (E(x)), so E cannot be in the word. Thus, ""propel"" has E, which is absent, so it can\'t be.\n\nSimilarly, any word with E, A, N, etc., is invalid.\n\nPotential words:\n- With position 4 as L: troll, droll – but in these, position 4 is L, and position 5 is also L, so they have two L\'s.\n- With position 4 as something else: prowl, growl, drool (position 4 O).\n\nDrool: D R O O L, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5).\n\nWe need to guess a word that can distinguish these possibilities or confirm the letters.\n\nFor the third guess, since we know the form is _ R O _ L, and letters absent: A,B,C,E,I,N.\n\nGood to test letters that appear in multiple options.\n\nFor example:\n- If we guess ""troll"", it could be tested directly.\n- But we don\'t know if position 1 is T or D or P, etc.\n\nWe can include a new letter for position 4.\n\nPosition 4 possibilities: in known options, it could be L (for troll/droll), W (for prowl/growl), O (for drool), etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested W or L in position 4, but we know L is in the word at position 5.\n\nIn feedback, from ""broil"", L is ✓ in position 5, so L is in the word, but there could be another L? Or not.\n\nFeedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple instances; it only gives symbols per position.\n\nIn ""broil"", L is ✓, so correct position.\n\nNow for the secret word, position 4 might be L or not.\n\nTo get information, we should guess a word where position 4 is a letter we haven\'t tested.\n\nFor example, guess ""prowl"" to test if position 1 is P and position 4 is W.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""troll"", and we guess ""prowl"", what happens?\n\nSecret: T R O L L\nGuess: P R O W L\n\nFeedback:\nPos 2: R ✓\nPos 3: O ✓\nPos 5: L ✓ (since both have L in pos 5)\nPos 1: P vs T – P not in secret (assuming T is different), so P(x)? But secret has T, but position different? Secret has T in pos 1, guess has P. Since P is not in secret (only if secret has no P), but if secret is ""troll"", no P, so P(x). Pos 4: W vs L – L is in secret, but not in position 4; it\'s in position 5. So since L is present but wrong position, it would be (-) for W? No.\n\nClarify feedback rules:\n- For each position, comparing guess to secret.\n\nIn this case, for position 4 of guess: guess is W, secret is L.\nSecret has L, but not in position 4 (since L is in pos 5), so symbol for W:\nSince W is not in secret at all (secret ""troll"" has T,R,O,L,L – no W), so if W not in word, it would be x.\nBut W is not present, so x.\nAnd for L in the guess? Only positions matter separately. For position 4 in guess is W, not L.\n\nFeedback per position position by position.\n\nAssume secret ""troll"" and guess ""prowl"":\n- Pos 1: P vs T → T is not P, but T is in word? Secret has T in position 1, guess has P there. P is not in secret (secret has T,R,O,L,L – letters T,R,O,L; no P), so P not present → symbol x\n- Pos 2: R vs R → same → ✓\n- Pos 3: O vs O → same → ✓\n- Pos 4: W vs L → L is in secret, but position: secret pos 4 is L, guess pos 4 is W. W not present in secret, so symbol for W should be x, since W ≠ L and W not in word.\nSecret word is T R O L L, so letters: T,R,O,L.\nW is not among them, so symbol for W: x.\nSimilarly, for pos 5: L vs L → ✓\nSo feedback would be P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n\nIn our case, we know O and R are already confirmed, so guessing ""prowl"" directly could help.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""prowl"", feedback would be different.\n\nBut we have multiple options.\n\nSince we need to find position 1 and position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""drool"" – D R O O L\n\nIf we guess ""drool"", and secret is, say, ""troll"", then feedback: \n- Pos1: D vs T → D not present? Secret TROLL, letters T,R,O,L; D not present → D(x)? Symbols: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), O vs L? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. O is in secret (pos3), so O is present but not in pos4 (since it\'s in pos3). Also, secret has O only once? Assume no duplicate for simplicity unless specified.\n\nDuplicates: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.\n\nExample: secret ""DROOL"" guess ""TROLL"", but we don\'t have that.\n\nGeneral rule: for each guess position, if the letter matches exactly, ✓. If not, but the letter is in the word, and hasn\'t been accounted for, -. Otherwise x.\n\nBut for now, back to guessing.\n\nFor a smart guess, I should choose a word that includes letters not yet tested and can test possibilities for position 1 and 4.\n\nWe know L is in position 5, so we don\'t need to guess letters for position 5.\n\nPosition 1 candidates: D, G, P, T, W? From common options.\n\nPosition 4 candidates: W (as in prowl), O (as in drool), L (as in troll, droll).\n\nLetters not yet used: from previous guesses, we have used C,R,A,N,E in guess1, and B,R,O,I,L in guess2. So all letters: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,I,L.\n\nSo unused common letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,S,T,U,W,Y,Z, etc.\n\nTo maximize information, guess a word like ""prowl"" or ""troll"".\n\nBut if I guess ""troll"", for example:\n- If the word is ""troll"", I win.\n- If not, I get feedback.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut perhaps ""prowl"" is better because it introduces W.\n\nSince we have multiple options, I can guess a word that tests the fourth position.\n\nFor example, the fourth position could be:\n- In ""troll"" and ""droll"", it\'s L\n- In ""prowl"" and ""growl"", it\'s W\n- In ""drool"", it\'s O\n\nAnd letters like L and O we already know are present (O at pos3, L at pos5), but position 4 might be different or same.\n\nTo distinguish, I need to include a letter for position 4 that isn\'t L or O, or test it.\n\nGuess a word where position 4 is not L or O, but a new letter, like W.\n\nBut in ""prowl"", position 4 is W.\n\nPosition 1 could be P as well.\n\nAnother idea: guess ""grown"", but N is absent? From guess1, N(x), so cannot use N. Also, ""grown"" is 5 letters? G R O W N, but N is absent, and position 5 should be L, not N.\n\nWe know position 5 is L, so any guess must have L in position 5 to confirm or get feedback.\n\nIn guess, I can guess a different word, but since position 5 is confirmed L, it\'s efficient to guess L.\n\nBut position 1 and 4 need to be found.\n\nSo for guess 3, I should guess a word of the pattern _ R O _ L, with new letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If I guess ""growl"", if position 1 is G and position 4 is W, it might be correct or not.\n- Similarly with ""prowl"".\n\nSince ""broil"" had O(✓) and L(✓), we know O and L are fixed.\n\nNow, what about position 4? It wasn\'t tested since I was x.\n\nSo let\'s list all possible words fitting _ R O _ L with no forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden: A,B,C,E,I,N\n\nPossible words:\n1. DROLL (if four letters: D,R,O,L,L, it\'s D R O L L with repeated L)\n2. DROOL (D R O O L, with repeated O)\n3. PROWL (P R O W L)\n4. GROWL (G R O W L)\n5. TROLL (T R O L L with repeated L)\n6. Others like FROWL (F R O W L), but less common; BROIL is not due to B absent; SHOWL not word, etc.\n\nCommon are likely DROLL, DROOL, PROWL, GROWL, TROLL.\n\nNow, to guess: I can choose one that includes letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nFor instance, DROLL uses D, L; but L we know is present.\nPROWL uses P and W; W not tested.\nGROWL uses G and W; similar.\nTROLL uses T.\n\nW hasn\'t been tested, so it\'s better to include W to see if it\'s present.\n\nSimilarly, we can test position 1.\n\nSince we only have 4 tries left (since 2 done), we need to be efficient.\n\nGuess ""prowl"" to test:\n- If correct, we win or get info.\n- If not, feedback will help.\n\nSuppose secret is T R O L L, and we guess P R O W L, feedback as above: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n\nThen we know position 1 is not P, position 4 is not W, and W not in word.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is DROOL, guess PROWL: P R O W L vs D R O O L\nPos1: P vs D → P not present (secret letter D), so if P not in word, P(x)\nPos4: W vs O → O is in word, but not in pos4; W not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L no W, so W(x)\nPos5 L ✓\nSo similar to above.\n\nBut it would reveal that position 4 is not W, etc.\n\nAlternatively, if I guess a word where position 4 is L, like ""troll"", and it is correct, good, or if wrong, feedback.\n\nBut since position 5 is L, guessing L at position 4 might cause duplicate issue.\n\nTo avoid that, perhaps guess ""drool"", which has O at position 4.\n\n""drool"" is D R O O L\n\nIf I guess ""drool"":\n- Position 4 O, but we know O is already in position 3.\n\nIf secret is ""drool"", it works.\nIf secret is ""troll"", guess ""drool"": D R O O L vs T R O L L\nPos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret T,R,O,L,L, so D(x)\nPos2 R✓\nPos3 O✓\nPos4 O vs L → L is in secret, not in pos4; O is in secret but O in secret is only pos3? If secret has one O, O present but not pos4.\n\nSecret ""troll"" has letters T,R,O,L – O appears once at pos3.\nGuess pos4 is O, which is not in secret at pos4, and O is present but at pos3, so it might show - for position 4? But position 4 symbol for O: O is in word but wrong position, since it should be at pos3.\n\nSimilarly, position 4 secret is L, guess is O.\n\nSo symbol for O at pos4: - (since O is in word but not at pos4)\nThen pos5 both L, ✓\n\nSymbols: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)? For pos4 O(-) meaning O present but wrong position.\n\nBut we already know O is in pos3, so this might be redundant.\n\nTo simplify, for the third guess, I\'ll guess ""prowl"" to test a new letter W.\n\nSo guess ""prowl"".\n\nIf feedback shows W(-), it means position 4 has something else but W is in word, etc.\n\nOr if it\'s W(✓), then good.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- For ""crane"": R is in position 2 and correct. C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- For ""broil"": R (position 2) is correct, O (position 3) is correct, L (position 5) is correct, and B and I are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be of the form _ R O _ L.  \n- Position 2 is R, position 3 is O, position 5 is L.  \n- Letters not in the word: A, B, C, E, I, N (from feedback).  \n- Letters to test: Position 1 needs a consonant like D, G, P, T, or W, and position 4 needs to be filled. Since ""broil"" indicated ""I"" is absent in position 4, we need a new letter there.\n\nPossible candidate words include:\n- PROWL (if position 1 is P and position 4 is W)\n- GROWL (G and W)\n- TROLL (T and L, but L is already at position 5)\n- DROLL (D and L, same as TROLL)\n- DROOL (D and O, but O is at position 3)\n\nTo maximize information, we should guess a word that tests less common letters and avoids redundant checks. ""PROWL"" introduces W, a new untested letter, and positions 1 and 4 are fresh. If not correct, feedback on P or W will help narrow down options (e.g., if P is absent, we consider G or D for position 1; if W is absent, position 4 might be something else like L or O).\n\nThus, ""prowl"" is an efficient guess to distinguish between possibilities like GROWL, TROLL, etc.\n\n<guess>prowl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: broil -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) L(✓)\nGuess 3: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""broil"": B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - L is correct in position 5.
   - B and I are not in the word.

3. ""prowl"": P(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - L is correct in position 5.
   - P and W are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R O _ L
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 5: L (fixed)
- We need to find the first and fourth letters.

Absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W (from the feedback above).

Therefore, the first and fourth letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, S, T, U, V, Y, etc. (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R O _ L and use only the allowed letters:

- ""DROLL"": D R O L L
- ""DROOL"": D R O O L
- ""GROWL"": G R O W L, but W is absent (from guess 3), so not possible.
- ""TROLL"": T R O L L
- ""FROWL"": F R O W L, but W is absent, so not possible.
- ""GROSS"" doesn't fit pattern.
- ""PROWL"" was guessed and P and W are absent, so not the word.
- ""BROIL"" was guessed and B and I absent.

Since W is absent, words like ""growl"" and ""frowl"" are invalid.

Now, ""DROLL"" and ""TROLL"" both have the fourth letter as L. But note that in ""DROLL"" and ""TROLL"", the word has two L's: one in position 4 and one in position 5.

In ""DROOL"", the fourth letter is O, which is already in position 3.

We also have to consider if there are other words, like ""DROID"" but that has I and D, but I is absent, and pattern must end with L.

Another possibility: ""DROUK"" is not a common word.

Common words: ""troll"", ""droll"", ""drool"".

But ""drool"" has O in position 4, which is a duplicate of position 3.

Now, from the feedback of ""prowl"", we know W is absent, so no W in the word.

Also, in ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, and we have no information about the fourth letter yet.

For the fourth guess, we need to choose between these possibilities.

We can guess ""troll"" to test if it's the word.

If we guess ""troll"":
- If it is correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback that might help.

But let's see what feedback we would get if the word is ""droll"" and we guess ""troll"":

Secret: D R O L L
Guess: T R O L L

Feedback:
- Position 1: T vs D → T is not in secret (if secret is ""droll"", no T), so T(x)
- Position 2: R ✓
- Position 3: O ✓
- Position 4: L vs L → ✓ (since both have L)
- Position 5: L ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓)

But we already know R, O, L are correct, so the new information is T(x) and L(✓) in position 4.

Similarly, if we guess ""droll"" and secret is ""troll"", same thing: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓)

But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a different fourth letter to test.

For example, guess ""drool"" to see if position 4 is O.

If we guess ""drool"" and secret is ""troll"":

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: D R O O L

Feedback:
- Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret has T,R,O,L; no D, so D(x)
- Pos2: R ✓
- Pos3: O ✓
- Pos4: O vs L → O is in secret (pos3), but not in pos4; L is in secret but not in pos4? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. So O is present but wrong position (since it should be at pos3), and L is not at pos4 in guess? 

Actually, for pos4: guess is O, secret is L. 
- O is in the word (at pos3), so O should get a ""-"" for being present but wrong position.
- But also, the secret has L at pos4, which is not matched.

Symbol for pos4: O is present but not in this position, so O(-)

Then pos5: L ✓

So feedback: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)

This tells us that O is in the word but not in position 4, which we already know since O is fixed at pos3. So it doesn't give new info about position 4.

Therefore, to distinguish between ""troll"", ""droll"", and ""drool"", we need to test the first letter.

Since we have limited guesses, I think guessing ""troll"" is a good idea because it tests T for position 1 and L for position 4.

If it's not ""troll"", we get T(x) and L(✓) for position 4, meaning position 4 is L, and position 1 is not T, so it must be D for ""droll"" or something else.

But what about ""drool""? If position 4 is O, not L.

In ""drool"", position 4 is O.

So if we guess ""troll"" and the word is ""drool"", then:

Secret: D R O O L
Guess: T R O L L

Feedback:
- Pos1: T vs D → T not in secret (secret has D,R,O,O,L; no T), so T(x)
- Pos2: R ✓
- Pos3: O ✓
- Pos4: L vs O → L is in secret (pos5), but not in pos4; O is in secret at pos4? Secret pos4 is O, guess pos4 is L. L is present in secret (at pos5), so L should be marked as present but wrong position for pos4? 

For pos4: guess is L, secret is O.
- L is in the word (at pos5), so L should get a ""-"" for being present but wrong position.
- O is not being guessed here, so no issue.

Symbol for pos4: L(-) because L is in the word but not in position 4.

Pos5: L ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓)

This tells us that L is in the word but not in position 4, which is new information.

Similarly, if the word is ""droll"" and we guess ""troll"", as before, we get L(✓) for position 4.

So by guessing ""troll"", we can distinguish:

- If we get L(✓) in position 4, then the word is either ""troll"" or ""droll"", and since T is x, it must be ""droll"" if T(x), or if T(✓) it's ""troll"".
- If we get L(-) in position 4, then position 4 is not L, so it must be ""drool"" (since O is the only other common possibility, and W is absent).

Therefore, guessing ""troll"" is efficient.

We can also consider ""droll"" similarly.

But let's go with ""troll"".

So for the fourth guess, I'll guess ""troll"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- The secret word is of the form `_ R O _ L` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as R, O, and L, respectively).
- Absent letters (not in the word): A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W (from feedback on ""crane,"" ""broil,"" and ""prowl"").
- The unknown positions are 1 and 4, which must be filled with letters from the remaining possibilities (e.g., D, F, G, H, K, M, S, T, U, V, Y, etc.).

Common English words fitting this pattern include:
- **TROLL**: T (position 1), L (position 4)
- **DROLL**: D (position 1), L (position 4)
- **DROOL**: D (position 1), O (position 4)

To efficiently narrow down the options, we choose ""troll"" as the next guess. This tests:
- Position 1: T (if correct, the word is ""troll""; if absent, it rules out T and suggests D for position 1).
- Position 4: L (if correct, it supports ""troll"" or ""droll""; if present but wrong position, it suggests ""drool"" with O in position 4).

This guess maximizes information gain by targeting common letters and distinguishing between the most likely candidates.

<guess>troll</guess>",troll,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""broil"": B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - L is correct in position 5.
   - B and I are not in the word.

3. ""prowl"": P(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - L is correct in position 5.
   - P and W are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R O _ L
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 5: L (fixed)
- We need to find the first and fourth letters.

Absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W (from the feedback above).

Therefore, the first and fourth letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, S, T, U, V, Y, etc. (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R O _ L and use only the allowed letters:

- ""DROLL"": D R O L L
- ""DROOL"": D R O O L
- ""GROWL"": G R O W L, but W is absent (from guess 3), so not possible.
- ""TROLL"": T R O L L
- ""FROWL"": F R O W L, but W is absent, so not possible.
- ""GROSS"" doesn't fit pattern.
- ""PROWL"" was guessed and P and W are absent, so not the word.
- ""BROIL"" was guessed and B and I absent.

Since W is absent, words like ""growl"" and ""frowl"" are invalid.

Now, ""DROLL"" and ""TROLL"" both have the fourth letter as L. But note that in ""DROLL"" and ""TROLL"", the word has two L's: one in position 4 and one in position 5.

In ""DROOL"", the fourth letter is O, which is already in position 3.

We also have to consider if there are other words, like ""DROID"" but that has I and D, but I is absent, and pattern must end with L.

Another possibility: ""DROUK"" is not a common word.

Common words: ""troll"", ""droll"", ""drool"".

But ""drool"" has O in position 4, which is a duplicate of position 3.

Now, from the feedback of ""prowl"", we know W is absent, so no W in the word.

Also, in ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, and we have no information about the fourth letter yet.

For the fourth guess, we need to choose between these possibilities.

We can guess ""troll"" to test if it's the word.

If we guess ""troll"":
- If it is correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback that might help.

But let's see what feedback we would get if the word is ""droll"" and we guess ""troll"":

Secret: D R O L L
Guess: T R O L L

Feedback:
- Position 1: T vs D → T is not in secret (if secret is ""droll"", no T), so T(x)
- Position 2: R ✓
- Position 3: O ✓
- Position 4: L vs L → ✓ (since both have L)
- Position 5: L ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓)

But we already know R, O, L are correct, so the new information is T(x) and L(✓) in position 4.

Similarly, if we guess ""droll"" and secret is ""troll"", same thing: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓)

But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a different fourth letter to test.

For example, guess ""drool"" to see if position 4 is O.

If we guess ""drool"" and secret is ""troll"":

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: D R O O L

Feedback:
- Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret has T,R,O,L; no D, so D(x)
- Pos2: R ✓
- Pos3: O ✓
- Pos4: O vs L → O is in secret (pos3), but not in pos4; L is in secret but not in pos4? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. So O is present but wrong position (since it should be at pos3), and L is not at pos4 in guess? 

Actually, for pos4: guess is O, secret is L. 
- O is in the word (at pos3), so O should get a ""-"" for being present but wrong position.
- But also, the secret has L at pos4, which is not matched.

Symbol for pos4: O is present but not in this position, so O(-)

Then pos5: L ✓

So feedback: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)

This tells us that O is in the word but not in position 4, which we already know since O is fixed at pos3. So it doesn't give new info about position 4.

Therefore, to distinguish between ""troll"", ""droll"", and ""drool"", we need to test the first letter.

Since we have limited guesses, I think guessing ""troll"" is a good idea because it tests T for position 1 and L for position 4.

If it's not ""troll"", we get T(x) and L(✓) for position 4, meaning position 4 is L, and position 1 is not T, so it must be D for ""droll"" or something else.

But what about ""drool""? If position 4 is O, not L.

In ""drool"", position 4 is O.

So if we guess ""troll"" and the word is ""drool"", then:

Secret: D R O O L
Guess: T R O L L

Feedback:
- Pos1: T vs D → T not in secret (secret has D,R,O,O,L; no T), so T(x)
- Pos2: R ✓
- Pos3: O ✓
- Pos4: L vs O → L is in secret (pos5), but not in pos4; O is in secret at pos4? Secret pos4 is O, guess pos4 is L. L is present in secret (at pos5), so L should be marked as present but wrong position for pos4? 

For pos4: guess is L, secret is O.
- L is in the word (at pos5), so L should get a ""-"" for being present but wrong position.
- O is not being guessed here, so no issue.

Symbol for pos4: L(-) because L is in the word but not in position 4.

Pos5: L ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓)

This tells us that L is in the word but not in position 4, which is new information.

Similarly, if the word is ""droll"" and we guess ""troll"", as before, we get L(✓) for position 4.

So by guessing ""troll"", we can distinguish:

- If we get L(✓) in position 4, then the word is either ""troll"" or ""droll"", and since T is x, it must be ""droll"" if T(x), or if T(✓) it's ""troll"".
- If we get L(-) in position 4, then position 4 is not L, so it must be ""drool"" (since O is the only other common possibility, and W is absent).

Therefore, guessing ""troll"" is efficient.

We can also consider ""droll"" similarly.

But let's go with ""troll"".

So for the fourth guess, I'll guess ""troll"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- The secret word is of the form `_ R O _ L` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as R, O, and L, respectively).
- Absent letters (not in the word): A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W (from feedback on ""crane,"" ""broil,"" and ""prowl"").
- The unknown positions are 1 and 4, which must be filled with letters from the remaining possibilities (e.g., D, F, G, H, K, M, S, T, U, V, Y, etc.).

Common English words fitting this pattern include:
- **TROLL**: T (position 1), L (position 4)
- **DROLL**: D (position 1), L (position 4)
- **DROOL**: D (position 1), O (position 4)

To efficiently narrow down the options, we choose ""troll"" as the next guess. This tests:
- Position 1: T (if correct, the word is ""troll""; if absent, it rules out T and suggests D for position 1).
- Position 4: L (if correct, it supports ""troll"" or ""droll""; if present but wrong position, it suggests ""drool"" with O in position 4).

This guess maximizes information gain by targeting common letters and distinguishing between the most likely candidates.",Guess 4: troll -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,drool,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have to guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries.
 Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We need to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 Commonly, starting words with a mix of common consonants and vowels are chosen to cover frequent letters.
 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
 Let's use that as our first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

We have to make a second guess. We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter (since we know it's in the correct position).
- Does not contain C, A, N, E (because they are not in the word).

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words with R in the second position:

- TRY: words like ""BRICK"", ""BRISK"", ""BROWN"", ""FRUIT"", ""GRASP"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINT"", etc.

But note: we cannot use A (from ""GRASP"") because A is not in the word. Similarly, we cannot use E (from ""PRINT"") because E is not in the word.

So, we must avoid A, C, E, N.

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""BROWN"": B, R (fixed), O, W, N -> but N is not allowed? Wait, N is in the word? No, feedback said N is not in the word. So we cannot use N? Actually, we can use any letters in our guess, but if we use a letter that we know is not in the word, it might not be optimal because it won't help us find the word. However, we are allowed to guess words with letters we know are not in the word? But it's better to avoid them to get more information about other letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that C, A, N, E are not in the word. So we should avoid them to test new letters.

So, for the second guess, we want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Uses letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to form a word without A, C, E, N.

Some options:
- ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all new letters.
- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> but S and H are new.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word, but we can still use it? However, using a letter we know is not in the word would waste a slot. So better to avoid.

We should avoid using letters that we know are not in the word (C, A, N, E) because they won't help us get new information.

So, let's choose a word without those.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good candidate: 
- B: new
- R: fixed in position 2
- O: new
- I: new
- L: new

Alternatively, ""BRISK"": 
- B: new
- R: fixed
- I: new
- S: new
- K: new

But we don't know if these letters are in the word or not.

Another option: ""PRISM"": 
- P: new
- R: fixed
- I: new
- S: new
- M: new

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a valid word.

But let me check: BROIL means to cook with direct heat.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRYST"": 
- T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T.

But we want to cover more letters. ""BROIL"" has 5 distinct letters.

Another common word: ""FRUIT"" -> but it has U and I, but also F. However, we know from the first guess that the word does not have A, C, E, N. But ""FRUIT"" has F, R, U, I, T. But R is fixed. However, the first letter F is new.

But note: we are not restricted to not use letters we haven't tried, but we should avoid the ones we know are absent.

So, ""FRUIT"" is acceptable? But we don't know if F is in the word or not.

But we are trying to get information. So using F, U, I, T is good.

However, we have to have R in the second position.

I think ""BROIL"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

Alternatively, ""PRICK"": but that has C? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid.

Wait, ""PRICK"" has C, which we know is not in the word. So we shouldn't use it.

Similarly, ""BRICK"" has C.

So, let's avoid words with C, A, N, E.

Another word: ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. But we don't know about G, U, M, P.

But ""GRUMP"" is a word? Grump means a grumpy person.

But I think ""BROIL"" is more common.

Another: ""DROPS"": D, R, O, P, S. All new.

But we don't know if D, O, P, S are in the word.

I think ""DROPS"" is a good one too.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""BROIL"" because it has common vowels and consonants.

So, second guess: BROIL

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word. We are testing B, O, I, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common letters. For example, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S. But T is a common letter.

But we don't know about T.

I think ""BROIL"" is fine.

But let me think: the word has R in the second position and does not have C, A, N, E. So the word must be of the form _ R _ _ _

We are going to guess ""BROIL"".

So, the guess is ""BROIL"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes new common letters to maximize information (e.g., B, O, I, L, S, T).

I considered words like ""BROIL"" (which uses B, O, I, L) and ""BRISK"" (which uses B, I, S, K). ""BROIL"" is a strong choice because it tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids known absent letters.

<guess>broil</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: broil -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I have the feedback from two previous guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane""  
   - Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
   This means:  
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).  
   - C, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess 2: ""broil""  
   - Feedback: B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)  
   This means:  
   - R is still correct in position 2 (as we already knew).  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (I assume position 3 based on ""broil"" being B-R-O-I-L).  
   - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
   - B is not in the word (which we didn't know before, but now we do).  
   - I is not in the word (new information).

So, summarizing what we know:

- The secret word has the form: _ R ? _ ? where:
  - Position 2 is R (confirmed).
  - Position 3 must be O, since O(✓) in ""broil"" position 3.
  - Position 5 must be L, since L(✓) in ""broil"" position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, I (from feedback: C(x), A(x), N(x), E(x), B(x), I(x)).
- So, absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ R O _ L

We need to fill in the first and fourth positions.

Letters we haven't used or tested yet: From the alphabet, excluding known absent letters and known present letters.

Known present and placed:
- R in position 2
- O in position 3
- L in position 5

We don't know about position 1 and position 4 yet.

Letters that could be present are ones not ruled out. Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N.

Common vowels: U is not ruled out? We haven't tested U. Consonants like D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y, Z are possible.

But we need to form a valid English word of the form _ R O _ L.

What words fit this pattern? Let me list some 5-letter words ending with L and ""RO"" in positions 2-3.

Possible words:

- TROLL
- DROLL
- PROWL
- GROWL
- FROWL – is ""frowl"" a word? Not common; frown is 4-letter, so probably not.
- BROWL – not a word.
- CROWL – not common; crow is 4-letter.
- PROWL is valid.
- GROWL is valid.
- TROLL is valid.
- DROLL is valid.
- From above, position 1: could be T, D, P, G, etc.

Now, we need to consider the feedback that certain letters are absent.

For example, in ""broil"", B and I are absent, which we've noted.

We have to make a guess that might confirm position 1 and introduce a new letter for position 4.

But we know position 1 isn't B (from guess 2), and it can't be C, A, E, I, N from guess 1.

So position 1 possibilities: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Position 4 possibilities: similarly, we don't know much yet.

From guess 2 ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, so the fourth letter is not I, but it could be something else.

Possible words: let's list common ones.

- GROWL: G R O W L
- PROWL: P R O W L
- DROLL: D R O L L – wait, ""droll"" is D R O L L, so positions: D, R, O, L, L. So position 4 is L? But position 5 is L, so it has L in both positions. But that's possible.

In ""droll"", if secret word is ""droll"", and we guessed ""broil"", what would feedback be?

""broil"": B R O I L vs ""droll"": D R O L L

Position 2: R matches, so ✓

Position 3: O matches, so ✓

Position 1: B vs D – B is not in secret word (since D is there, but B not present), so x

Position 4: I vs L – L is in the word but not in position 4? Secret word has L in position 4 and 5. In ""broil"", position 4 is I, which is not in the word, so I(x). But L is in the word, but in different positions. Since we have L in position 5 (✓), but position 4 L might be revealed as present but wrong position if we guess something else.

But in actual feedback for guess 2, we have R(✓), O(✓), L(✓) which means L is correct in position 5. And I(x) means I is absent. B(x) absent. Also, in position 4 of guess was I, which is wrong.

Now back to possibilities for secret word: _ R O _ L

Position 1 could be: consonant, and position 4 could be a vowel or consonant.

Common words:

- Troll
- Droll
- Prowl
- Growl
- Froll isn't word
- Croll isn't word
- Stroll – S T R O L, but that's S(1), T(2)? No, pattern requires position 2 R, position 3 O, so ""stroll"" has S, T, R, O, L – so position 2 is T? Not R. So not matching.

We need position 2 to be R, position 3 to be O, position 5 to be L.

So ""troll"" has T, R, O, L, L? T R O L L? ""Troll"" is T-R-O-L-L? Five letters, so T(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). So yes.

Similarly, ""droll"" is D-R-O-L-L, same as troll but D.

But ""prowl"" is P-R-O-W-L, so positions P(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5).

""growl"" is G-R-O-W-L.

""scroll"" is S-C-R-O-L, but position 2 is C? Not R. ""Scroll"" has S(1), C(2), R(3), O(4), L(5), so positions don't match our pattern. We need R in pos 2 and O in pos 3.

Other possibilities: ""broil"" itself, but B is absent, so no. Or ""drool"", but ""drool"" is D-R-O-O-L, so D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). Is ""drool"" a word? Yes.

So possible secret words: 
- Troll: T R O L L
- Droll: D R O L L
- Drool: D R O O L
- Prowl: P R O W L
- Growl: G R O W L
- Frowl: F R O W L? Or ""frowl"" might not be common; let's check if it's valid. Yes, frowl can mean to frown or something, but less common.
- Scowl: S C O W L? Position 2 is C, not R. No.
- Propel: P R O P E L, but E is absent? E is ruled out from guess 1 feedback (E(x)), so E cannot be in the word. Thus, ""propel"" has E, which is absent, so it can't be.

Similarly, any word with E, A, N, etc., is invalid.

Potential words:
- With position 4 as L: troll, droll – but in these, position 4 is L, and position 5 is also L, so they have two L's.
- With position 4 as something else: prowl, growl, drool (position 4 O).

Drool: D R O O L, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5).

We need to guess a word that can distinguish these possibilities or confirm the letters.

For the third guess, since we know the form is _ R O _ L, and letters absent: A,B,C,E,I,N.

Good to test letters that appear in multiple options.

For example:
- If we guess ""troll"", it could be tested directly.
- But we don't know if position 1 is T or D or P, etc.

We can include a new letter for position 4.

Position 4 possibilities: in known options, it could be L (for troll/droll), W (for prowl/growl), O (for drool), etc.

We haven't tested W or L in position 4, but we know L is in the word at position 5.

In feedback, from ""broil"", L is ✓ in position 5, so L is in the word, but there could be another L? Or not.

Feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple instances; it only gives symbols per position.

In ""broil"", L is ✓, so correct position.

Now for the secret word, position 4 might be L or not.

To get information, we should guess a word where position 4 is a letter we haven't tested.

For example, guess ""prowl"" to test if position 1 is P and position 4 is W.

But if the secret word is ""troll"", and we guess ""prowl"", what happens?

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: P R O W L

Feedback:
Pos 2: R ✓
Pos 3: O ✓
Pos 5: L ✓ (since both have L in pos 5)
Pos 1: P vs T – P not in secret (assuming T is different), so P(x)? But secret has T, but position different? Secret has T in pos 1, guess has P. Since P is not in secret (only if secret has no P), but if secret is ""troll"", no P, so P(x). Pos 4: W vs L – L is in secret, but not in position 4; it's in position 5. So since L is present but wrong position, it would be (-) for W? No.

Clarify feedback rules:
- For each position, comparing guess to secret.

In this case, for position 4 of guess: guess is W, secret is L.
Secret has L, but not in position 4 (since L is in pos 5), so symbol for W:
Since W is not in secret at all (secret ""troll"" has T,R,O,L,L – no W), so if W not in word, it would be x.
But W is not present, so x.
And for L in the guess? Only positions matter separately. For position 4 in guess is W, not L.

Feedback per position position by position.

Assume secret ""troll"" and guess ""prowl"":
- Pos 1: P vs T → T is not P, but T is in word? Secret has T in position 1, guess has P there. P is not in secret (secret has T,R,O,L,L – letters T,R,O,L; no P), so P not present → symbol x
- Pos 2: R vs R → same → ✓
- Pos 3: O vs O → same → ✓
- Pos 4: W vs L → L is in secret, but position: secret pos 4 is L, guess pos 4 is W. W not present in secret, so symbol for W should be x, since W ≠ L and W not in word.
Secret word is T R O L L, so letters: T,R,O,L.
W is not among them, so symbol for W: x.
Similarly, for pos 5: L vs L → ✓
So feedback would be P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

In our case, we know O and R are already confirmed, so guessing ""prowl"" directly could help.

Similarly, if secret is ""prowl"", feedback would be different.

But we have multiple options.

Since we need to find position 1 and position 4.

Another word: ""drool"" – D R O O L

If we guess ""drool"", and secret is, say, ""troll"", then feedback: 
- Pos1: D vs T → D not present? Secret TROLL, letters T,R,O,L; D not present → D(x)? Symbols: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), O vs L? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. O is in secret (pos3), so O is present but not in pos4 (since it's in pos3). Also, secret has O only once? Assume no duplicate for simplicity unless specified.

Duplicates: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.

Example: secret ""DROOL"" guess ""TROLL"", but we don't have that.

General rule: for each guess position, if the letter matches exactly, ✓. If not, but the letter is in the word, and hasn't been accounted for, -. Otherwise x.

But for now, back to guessing.

For a smart guess, I should choose a word that includes letters not yet tested and can test possibilities for position 1 and 4.

We know L is in position 5, so we don't need to guess letters for position 5.

Position 1 candidates: D, G, P, T, W? From common options.

Position 4 candidates: W (as in prowl), O (as in drool), L (as in troll, droll).

Letters not yet used: from previous guesses, we have used C,R,A,N,E in guess1, and B,R,O,I,L in guess2. So all letters: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,I,L.

So unused common letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,S,T,U,W,Y,Z, etc.

To maximize information, guess a word like ""prowl"" or ""troll"".

But if I guess ""troll"", for example:
- If the word is ""troll"", I win.
- If not, I get feedback.

Similarly.

But perhaps ""prowl"" is better because it introduces W.

Since we have multiple options, I can guess a word that tests the fourth position.

For example, the fourth position could be:
- In ""troll"" and ""droll"", it's L
- In ""prowl"" and ""growl"", it's W
- In ""drool"", it's O

And letters like L and O we already know are present (O at pos3, L at pos5), but position 4 might be different or same.

To distinguish, I need to include a letter for position 4 that isn't L or O, or test it.

Guess a word where position 4 is not L or O, but a new letter, like W.

But in ""prowl"", position 4 is W.

Position 1 could be P as well.

Another idea: guess ""grown"", but N is absent? From guess1, N(x), so cannot use N. Also, ""grown"" is 5 letters? G R O W N, but N is absent, and position 5 should be L, not N.

We know position 5 is L, so any guess must have L in position 5 to confirm or get feedback.

In guess, I can guess a different word, but since position 5 is confirmed L, it's efficient to guess L.

But position 1 and 4 need to be found.

So for guess 3, I should guess a word of the pattern _ R O _ L, with new letters.

For example:
- If I guess ""growl"", if position 1 is G and position 4 is W, it might be correct or not.
- Similarly with ""prowl"".

Since ""broil"" had O(✓) and L(✓), we know O and L are fixed.

Now, what about position 4? It wasn't tested since I was x.

So let's list all possible words fitting _ R O _ L with no forbidden letters.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,I,N

Possible words:
1. DROLL (if four letters: D,R,O,L,L, it's D R O L L with repeated L)
2. DROOL (D R O O L, with repeated O)
3. PROWL (P R O W L)
4. GROWL (G R O W L)
5. TROLL (T R O L L with repeated L)
6. Others like FROWL (F R O W L), but less common; BROIL is not due to B absent; SHOWL not word, etc.

Common are likely DROLL, DROOL, PROWL, GROWL, TROLL.

Now, to guess: I can choose one that includes letters we haven't tested yet.

For instance, DROLL uses D, L; but L we know is present.
PROWL uses P and W; W not tested.
GROWL uses G and W; similar.
TROLL uses T.

W hasn't been tested, so it's better to include W to see if it's present.

Similarly, we can test position 1.

Since we only have 4 tries left (since 2 done), we need to be efficient.

Guess ""prowl"" to test:
- If correct, we win or get info.
- If not, feedback will help.

Suppose secret is T R O L L, and we guess P R O W L, feedback as above: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)

Then we know position 1 is not P, position 4 is not W, and W not in word.

Similarly, if secret is DROOL, guess PROWL: P R O W L vs D R O O L
Pos1: P vs D → P not present (secret letter D), so if P not in word, P(x)
Pos4: W vs O → O is in word, but not in pos4; W not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L no W, so W(x)
Pos5 L ✓
So similar to above.

But it would reveal that position 4 is not W, etc.

Alternatively, if I guess a word where position 4 is L, like ""troll"", and it is correct, good, or if wrong, feedback.

But since position 5 is L, guessing L at position 4 might cause duplicate issue.

To avoid that, perhaps guess ""drool"", which has O at position 4.

""drool"" is D R O O L

If I guess ""drool"":
- Position 4 O, but we know O is already in position 3.

If secret is ""drool"", it works.
If secret is ""troll"", guess ""drool"": D R O O L vs T R O L L
Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret T,R,O,L,L, so D(x)
Pos2 R✓
Pos3 O✓
Pos4 O vs L → L is in secret, not in pos4; O is in secret but O in secret is only pos3? If secret has one O, O present but not pos4.

Secret ""troll"" has letters T,R,O,L – O appears once at pos3.
Guess pos4 is O, which is not in secret at pos4, and O is present but at pos3, so it might show - for position 4? But position 4 symbol for O: O is in word but wrong position, since it should be at pos3.

Similarly, position 4 secret is L, guess is O.

So symbol for O at pos4: - (since O is in word but not at pos4)
Then pos5 both L, ✓

Symbols: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)? For pos4 O(-) meaning O present but wrong position.

But we already know O is in pos3, so this might be redundant.

To simplify, for the third guess, I'll guess ""prowl"" to test a new letter W.

So guess ""prowl"".

If feedback shows W(-), it means position 4 has something else but W is in word, etc.

Or if it's W(✓), then good.Based on the previous feedback:

- For ""crane"": R is in position 2 and correct. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- For ""broil"": R (position 2) is correct, O (position 3) is correct, L (position 5) is correct, and B and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form _ R O _ L.  
- Position 2 is R, position 3 is O, position 5 is L.  
- Letters not in the word: A, B, C, E, I, N (from feedback).  
- Letters to test: Position 1 needs a consonant like D, G, P, T, or W, and position 4 needs to be filled. Since ""broil"" indicated ""I"" is absent in position 4, we need a new letter there.

Possible candidate words include:
- PROWL (if position 1 is P and position 4 is W)
- GROWL (G and W)
- TROLL (T and L, but L is already at position 5)
- DROLL (D and L, same as TROLL)
- DROOL (D and O, but O is at position 3)

To maximize information, we should guess a word that tests less common letters and avoids redundant checks. ""PROWL"" introduces W, a new untested letter, and positions 1 and 4 are fresh. If not correct, feedback on P or W will help narrow down options (e.g., if P is absent, we consider G or D for position 1; if W is absent, position 4 might be something else like L or O).

Thus, ""prowl"" is an efficient guess to distinguish between possibilities like GROWL, TROLL, etc.

<guess>prowl</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: broil -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) L(✓)
Guess 3: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""broil"": B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - L is correct in position 5.
   - B and I are not in the word.

3. ""prowl"": P(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - L is correct in position 5.
   - P and W are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R O _ L
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 5: L (fixed)
- We need to find the first and fourth letters.

Absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W (from the feedback above).

Therefore, the first and fourth letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, S, T, U, V, Y, etc. (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R O _ L and use only the allowed letters:

- ""DROLL"": D R O L L
- ""DROOL"": D R O O L
- ""GROWL"": G R O W L, but W is absent (from guess 3), so not possible.
- ""TROLL"": T R O L L
- ""FROWL"": F R O W L, but W is absent, so not possible.
- ""GROSS"" doesn't fit pattern.
- ""PROWL"" was guessed and P and W are absent, so not the word.
- ""BROIL"" was guessed and B and I absent.

Since W is absent, words like ""growl"" and ""frowl"" are invalid.

Now, ""DROLL"" and ""TROLL"" both have the fourth letter as L. But note that in ""DROLL"" and ""TROLL"", the word has two L's: one in position 4 and one in position 5.

In ""DROOL"", the fourth letter is O, which is already in position 3.

We also have to consider if there are other words, like ""DROID"" but that has I and D, but I is absent, and pattern must end with L.

Another possibility: ""DROUK"" is not a common word.

Common words: ""troll"", ""droll"", ""drool"".

But ""drool"" has O in position 4, which is a duplicate of position 3.

Now, from the feedback of ""prowl"", we know W is absent, so no W in the word.

Also, in ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, and we have no information about the fourth letter yet.

For the fourth guess, we need to choose between these possibilities.

We can guess ""troll"" to test if it's the word.

If we guess ""troll"":
- If it is correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback that might help.

But let's see what feedback we would get if the word is ""droll"" and we guess ""troll"":

Secret: D R O L L
Guess: T R O L L

Feedback:
- Position 1: T vs D → T is not in secret (if secret is ""droll"", no T), so T(x)
- Position 2: R ✓
- Position 3: O ✓
- Position 4: L vs L → ✓ (since both have L)
- Position 5: L ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓)

But we already know R, O, L are correct, so the new information is T(x) and L(✓) in position 4.

Similarly, if we guess ""droll"" and secret is ""troll"", same thing: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓)

But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has a different fourth letter to test.

For example, guess ""drool"" to see if position 4 is O.

If we guess ""drool"" and secret is ""troll"":

Secret: T R O L L
Guess: D R O O L

Feedback:
- Pos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret has T,R,O,L; no D, so D(x)
- Pos2: R ✓
- Pos3: O ✓
- Pos4: O vs L → O is in secret (pos3), but not in pos4; L is in secret but not in pos4? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. So O is present but wrong position (since it should be at pos3), and L is not at pos4 in guess? 

Actually, for pos4: guess is O, secret is L. 
- O is in the word (at pos3), so O should get a ""-"" for being present but wrong position.
- But also, the secret has L at pos4, which is not matched.

Symbol for pos4: O is present but not in this position, so O(-)

Then pos5: L ✓

So feedback: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)

This tells us that O is in the word but not in position 4, which we already know since O is fixed at pos3. So it doesn't give new info about position 4.

Therefore, to distinguish between ""troll"", ""droll"", and ""drool"", we need to test the first letter.

Since we have limited guesses, I think guessing ""troll"" is a good idea because it tests T for position 1 and L for position 4.

If it's not ""troll"", we get T(x) and L(✓) for position 4, meaning position 4 is L, and position 1 is not T, so it must be D for ""droll"" or something else.

But what about ""drool""? If position 4 is O, not L.

In ""drool"", position 4 is O.

So if we guess ""troll"" and the word is ""drool"", then:

Secret: D R O O L
Guess: T R O L L

Feedback:
- Pos1: T vs D → T not in secret (secret has D,R,O,O,L; no T), so T(x)
- Pos2: R ✓
- Pos3: O ✓
- Pos4: L vs O → L is in secret (pos5), but not in pos4; O is in secret at pos4? Secret pos4 is O, guess pos4 is L. L is present in secret (at pos5), so L should be marked as present but wrong position for pos4? 

For pos4: guess is L, secret is O.
- L is in the word (at pos5), so L should get a ""-"" for being present but wrong position.
- O is not being guessed here, so no issue.

Symbol for pos4: L(-) because L is in the word but not in position 4.

Pos5: L ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓)

This tells us that L is in the word but not in position 4, which is new information.

Similarly, if the word is ""droll"" and we guess ""troll"", as before, we get L(✓) for position 4.

So by guessing ""troll"", we can distinguish:

- If we get L(✓) in position 4, then the word is either ""troll"" or ""droll"", and since T is x, it must be ""droll"" if T(x), or if T(✓) it's ""troll"".
- If we get L(-) in position 4, then position 4 is not L, so it must be ""drool"" (since O is the only other common possibility, and W is absent).

Therefore, guessing ""troll"" is efficient.

We can also consider ""droll"" similarly.

But let's go with ""troll"".

So for the fourth guess, I'll guess ""troll"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- The secret word is of the form `_ R O _ L` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as R, O, and L, respectively).
- Absent letters (not in the word): A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W (from feedback on ""crane,"" ""broil,"" and ""prowl"").
- The unknown positions are 1 and 4, which must be filled with letters from the remaining possibilities (e.g., D, F, G, H, K, M, S, T, U, V, Y, etc.).

Common English words fitting this pattern include:
- **TROLL**: T (position 1), L (position 4)
- **DROLL**: D (position 1), L (position 4)
- **DROOL**: D (position 1), O (position 4)

To efficiently narrow down the options, we choose ""troll"" as the next guess. This tests:
- Position 1: T (if correct, the word is ""troll""; if absent, it rules out T and suggests D for position 1).
- Position 4: L (if correct, it supports ""troll"" or ""droll""; if present but wrong position, it suggests ""drool"" with O in position 4).

This guess maximizes information gain by targeting common letters and distinguishing between the most likely candidates.

Guess 2: ""broil""  \n   - Feedback: B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)  \n   This means:  \n   - R is still correct in position 2 (as we already knew).  \n   - O is in the word and in the correct position (I assume position 3 based on ""broil"" being B-R-O-I-L).  \n   - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  \n   - B is not in the word (which we didn\'t know before, but now we do).  \n   - I is not in the word (new information).\n\nSo, summarizing what we know:\n\n- The secret word has the form: _ R ? _ ? where:\n  - Position 2 is R (confirmed).\n  - Position 3 must be O, since O(✓) in ""broil"" position 3.\n  - Position 5 must be L, since L(✓) in ""broil"" position 5.\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, I (from feedback: C(x), A(x), N(x), E(x), B(x), I(x)).\n- So, absent letters: A, B, C, E, I, N.\n\nNow, the secret word is of the form: _ R O _ L\n\nWe need to fill in the first and fourth positions.\n\nLetters we haven\'t used or tested yet: From the alphabet, excluding known absent letters and known present letters.\n\nKnown present and placed:\n- R in position 2\n- O in position 3\n- L in position 5\n\nWe don\'t know about position 1 and position 4 yet.\n\nLetters that could be present are ones not ruled out. Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N.\n\nCommon vowels: U is not ruled out? We haven\'t tested U. Consonants like D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y, Z are possible.\n\nBut we need to form a valid English word of the form _ R O _ L.\n\nWhat words fit this pattern? Let me list some 5-letter words ending with L and ""RO"" in positions 2-3.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- TROLL\n- DROLL\n- PROWL\n- GROWL\n- FROWL – is ""frowl"" a word? Not common; frown is 4-letter, so probably not.\n- BROWL – not a word.\n- CROWL – not common; crow is 4-letter.\n- PROWL is valid.\n- GROWL is valid.\n- TROLL is valid.\n- DROLL is valid.\n- From above, position 1: could be T, D, P, G, etc.\n\nNow, we need to consider the feedback that certain letters are absent.\n\nFor example, in ""broil"", B and I are absent, which we\'ve noted.\n\nWe have to make a guess that might confirm position 1 and introduce a new letter for position 4.\n\nBut we know position 1 isn\'t B (from guess 2), and it can\'t be C, A, E, I, N from guess 1.\n\nSo position 1 possibilities: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, etc.\n\nPosition 4 possibilities: similarly, we don\'t know much yet.\n\nFrom guess 2 ""broil"", position 4 was I, which is absent, so the fourth letter is not I, but it could be something else.\n\nPossible words: let\'s list common ones.\n\n- GROWL: G R O W L\n- PROWL: P R O W L\n- DROLL: D R O L L – wait, ""droll"" is D R O L L, so positions: D, R, O, L, L. So position 4 is L? But position 5 is L, so it has L in both positions. But that\'s possible.\n\nIn ""droll"", if secret word is ""droll"", and we guessed ""broil"", what would feedback be?\n\n""broil"": B R O I L vs ""droll"": D R O L L\n\nPosition 2: R matches, so ✓\n\nPosition 3: O matches, so ✓\n\nPosition 1: B vs D – B is not in secret word (since D is there, but B not present), so x\n\nPosition 4: I vs L – L is in the word but not in position 4? Secret word has L in position 4 and 5. In ""broil"", position 4 is I, which is not in the word, so I(x). But L is in the word, but in different positions. Since we have L in position 5 (✓), but position 4 L might be revealed as present but wrong position if we guess something else.\n\nBut in actual feedback for guess 2, we have R(✓), O(✓), L(✓) which means L is correct in position 5. And I(x) means I is absent. B(x) absent. Also, in position 4 of guess was I, which is wrong.\n\nNow back to possibilities for secret word: _ R O _ L\n\nPosition 1 could be: consonant, and position 4 could be a vowel or consonant.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- Troll\n- Droll\n- Prowl\n- Growl\n- Froll isn\'t word\n- Croll isn\'t word\n- Stroll – S T R O L, but that\'s S(1), T(2)? No, pattern requires position 2 R, position 3 O, so ""stroll"" has S, T, R, O, L – so position 2 is T? Not R. So not matching.\n\nWe need position 2 to be R, position 3 to be O, position 5 to be L.\n\nSo ""troll"" has T, R, O, L, L? T R O L L? ""Troll"" is T-R-O-L-L? Five letters, so T(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5). So yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""droll"" is D-R-O-L-L, same as troll but D.\n\nBut ""prowl"" is P-R-O-W-L, so positions P(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5).\n\n""growl"" is G-R-O-W-L.\n\n""scroll"" is S-C-R-O-L, but position 2 is C? Not R. ""Scroll"" has S(1), C(2), R(3), O(4), L(5), so positions don\'t match our pattern. We need R in pos 2 and O in pos 3.\n\nOther possibilities: ""broil"" itself, but B is absent, so no. Or ""drool"", but ""drool"" is D-R-O-O-L, so D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). Is ""drool"" a word? Yes.\n\nSo possible secret words: \n- Troll: T R O L L\n- Droll: D R O L L\n- Drool: D R O O L\n- Prowl: P R O W L\n- Growl: G R O W L\n- Frowl: F R O W L? Or ""frowl"" might not be common; let\'s check if it\'s valid. Yes, frowl can mean to frown or something, but less common.\n- Scowl: S C O W L? Position 2 is C, not R. No.\n- Propel: P R O P E L, but E is absent? E is ruled out from guess 1 feedback (E(x)), so E cannot be in the word. Thus, ""propel"" has E, which is absent, so it can\'t be.\n\nSimilarly, any word with E, A, N, etc., is invalid.\n\nPotential words:\n- With position 4 as L: troll, droll – but in these, position 4 is L, and position 5 is also L, so they have two L\'s.\n- With position 4 as something else: prowl, growl, drool (position 4 O).\n\nDrool: D R O O L, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5).\n\nWe need to guess a word that can distinguish these possibilities or confirm the letters.\n\nFor the third guess, since we know the form is _ R O _ L, and letters absent: A,B,C,E,I,N.\n\nGood to test letters that appear in multiple options.\n\nFor example:\n- If we guess ""troll"", it could be tested directly.\n- But we don\'t know if position 1 is T or D or P, etc.\n\nWe can include a new letter for position 4.\n\nPosition 4 possibilities: in known options, it could be L (for troll/droll), W (for prowl/growl), O (for drool), etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested W or L in position 4, but we know L is in the word at position 5.\n\nIn feedback, from ""broil"", L is ✓ in position 5, so L is in the word, but there could be another L? Or not.\n\nFeedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple instances; it only gives symbols per position.\n\nIn ""broil"", L is ✓, so correct position.\n\nNow for the secret word, position 4 might be L or not.\n\nTo get information, we should guess a word where position 4 is a letter we haven\'t tested.\n\nFor example, guess ""prowl"" to test if position 1 is P and position 4 is W.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""troll"", and we guess ""prowl"", what happens?\n\nSecret: T R O L L\nGuess: P R O W L\n\nFeedback:\nPos 2: R ✓\nPos 3: O ✓\nPos 5: L ✓ (since both have L in pos 5)\nPos 1: P vs T – P not in secret (assuming T is different), so P(x)? But secret has T, but position different? Secret has T in pos 1, guess has P. Since P is not in secret (only if secret has no P), but if secret is ""troll"", no P, so P(x). Pos 4: W vs L – L is in secret, but not in position 4; it\'s in position 5. So since L is present but wrong position, it would be (-) for W? No.\n\nClarify feedback rules:\n- For each position, comparing guess to secret.\n\nIn this case, for position 4 of guess: guess is W, secret is L.\nSecret has L, but not in position 4 (since L is in pos 5), so symbol for W:\nSince W is not in secret at all (secret ""troll"" has T,R,O,L,L – no W), so if W not in word, it would be x.\nBut W is not present, so x.\nAnd for L in the guess? Only positions matter separately. For position 4 in guess is W, not L.\n\nFeedback per position position by position.\n\nAssume secret ""troll"" and guess ""prowl"":\n- Pos 1: P vs T → T is not P, but T is in word? Secret has T in position 1, guess has P there. P is not in secret (secret has T,R,O,L,L – letters T,R,O,L; no P), so P not present → symbol x\n- Pos 2: R vs R → same → ✓\n- Pos 3: O vs O → same → ✓\n- Pos 4: W vs L → L is in secret, but position: secret pos 4 is L, guess pos 4 is W. W not present in secret, so symbol for W should be x, since W ≠ L and W not in word.\nSecret word is T R O L L, so letters: T,R,O,L.\nW is not among them, so symbol for W: x.\nSimilarly, for pos 5: L vs L → ✓\nSo feedback would be P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n\nIn our case, we know O and R are already confirmed, so guessing ""prowl"" directly could help.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""prowl"", feedback would be different.\n\nBut we have multiple options.\n\nSince we need to find position 1 and position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""drool"" – D R O O L\n\nIf we guess ""drool"", and secret is, say, ""troll"", then feedback: \n- Pos1: D vs T → D not present? Secret TROLL, letters T,R,O,L; D not present → D(x)? Symbols: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), O vs L? Secret pos4 is L, guess pos4 is O. O is in secret (pos3), so O is present but not in pos4 (since it\'s in pos3). Also, secret has O only once? Assume no duplicate for simplicity unless specified.\n\nDuplicates: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.\n\nExample: secret ""DROOL"" guess ""TROLL"", but we don\'t have that.\n\nGeneral rule: for each guess position, if the letter matches exactly, ✓. If not, but the letter is in the word, and hasn\'t been accounted for, -. Otherwise x.\n\nBut for now, back to guessing.\n\nFor a smart guess, I should choose a word that includes letters not yet tested and can test possibilities for position 1 and 4.\n\nWe know L is in position 5, so we don\'t need to guess letters for position 5.\n\nPosition 1 candidates: D, G, P, T, W? From common options.\n\nPosition 4 candidates: W (as in prowl), O (as in drool), L (as in troll, droll).\n\nLetters not yet used: from previous guesses, we have used C,R,A,N,E in guess1, and B,R,O,I,L in guess2. So all letters: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,I,L.\n\nSo unused common letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,S,T,U,W,Y,Z, etc.\n\nTo maximize information, guess a word like ""prowl"" or ""troll"".\n\nBut if I guess ""troll"", for example:\n- If the word is ""troll"", I win.\n- If not, I get feedback.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut perhaps ""prowl"" is better because it introduces W.\n\nSince we have multiple options, I can guess a word that tests the fourth position.\n\nFor example, the fourth position could be:\n- In ""troll"" and ""droll"", it\'s L\n- In ""prowl"" and ""growl"", it\'s W\n- In ""drool"", it\'s O\n\nAnd letters like L and O we already know are present (O at pos3, L at pos5), but position 4 might be different or same.\n\nTo distinguish, I need to include a letter for position 4 that isn\'t L or O, or test it.\n\nGuess a word where position 4 is not L or O, but a new letter, like W.\n\nBut in ""prowl"", position 4 is W.\n\nPosition 1 could be P as well.\n\nAnother idea: guess ""grown"", but N is absent? From guess1, N(x), so cannot use N. Also, ""grown"" is 5 letters? G R O W N, but N is absent, and position 5 should be L, not N.\n\nWe know position 5 is L, so any guess must have L in position 5 to confirm or get feedback.\n\nIn guess, I can guess a different word, but since position 5 is confirmed L, it\'s efficient to guess L.\n\nBut position 1 and 4 need to be found.\n\nSo for guess 3, I should guess a word of the pattern _ R O _ L, with new letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If I guess ""growl"", if position 1 is G and position 4 is W, it might be correct or not.\n- Similarly with ""prowl"".\n\nSince ""broil"" had O(✓) and L(✓), we know O and L are fixed.\n\nNow, what about position 4? It wasn\'t tested since I was x.\n\nSo let\'s list all possible words fitting _ R O _ L with no forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden: A,B,C,E,I,N\n\nPossible words:\n1. DROLL (if four letters: D,R,O,L,L, it\'s D R O L L with repeated L)\n2. DROOL (D R O O L, with repeated O)\n3. PROWL (P R O W L)\n4. GROWL (G R O W L)\n5. TROLL (T R O L L with repeated L)\n6. Others like FROWL (F R O W L), but less common; BROIL is not due to B absent; SHOWL not word, etc.\n\nCommon are likely DROLL, DROOL, PROWL, GROWL, TROLL.\n\nNow, to guess: I can choose one that includes letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nFor instance, DROLL uses D, L; but L we know is present.\nPROWL uses P and W; W not tested.\nGROWL uses G and W; similar.\nTROLL uses T.\n\nW hasn\'t been tested, so it\'s better to include W to see if it\'s present.\n\nSimilarly, we can test position 1.\n\nSince we only have 4 tries left (since 2 done), we need to be efficient.\n\nGuess ""prowl"" to test:\n- If correct, we win or get info.\n- If not, feedback will help.\n\nSuppose secret is T R O L L, and we guess P R O W L, feedback as above: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n\nThen we know position 1 is not P, position 4 is not W, and W not in word.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is DROOL, guess PROWL: P R O W L vs D R O O L\nPos1: P vs D → P not present (secret letter D), so if P not in word, P(x)\nPos4: W vs O → O is in word, but not in pos4; W not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L no W, so W(x)\nPos5 L ✓\nSo similar to above.\n\nBut it would reveal that position 4 is not W, etc.\n\nAlternatively, if I guess a word where position 4 is L, like ""troll"", and it is correct, good, or if wrong, feedback.\n\nBut since position 5 is L, guessing L at position 4 might cause duplicate issue.\n\nTo avoid that, perhaps guess ""drool"", which has O at position 4.\n\n""drool"" is D R O O L\n\nIf I guess ""drool"":\n- Position 4 O, but we know O is already in position 3.\n\nIf secret is ""drool"", it works.\nIf secret is ""troll"", guess ""drool"": D R O O L vs T R O L L\nPos1: D vs T → D not in secret? Secret T,R,O,L,L, so D(x)\nPos2 R✓\nPos3 O✓\nPos4 O vs L → L is in secret, not in pos4; O is in secret but O in secret is only pos3? If secret has one O, O present but not pos4.\n\nSecret ""troll"" has letters T,R,O,L – O appears once at pos3.\nGuess pos4 is O, which is not in secret at pos4, and O is present but at pos3, so it might show - for position 4? But position 4 symbol for O: O is in word but wrong position, since it should be at pos3.\n\nSimilarly, position 4 secret is L, guess is O.\n\nSo symbol for O at pos4: - (since O is in word but not at pos4)\nThen pos5 both L, ✓\n\nSymbols: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓)? For pos4 O(-) meaning O present but wrong position.\n\nBut we already know O is in pos3, so this might be redundant.\n\nTo simplify, for the third guess, I\'ll guess ""prowl"" to test a new letter W.\n\nSo guess ""prowl"".\n\nIf feedback shows W(-), it means position 4 has something else but W is in word, etc.\n\nOr if it\'s W(✓), then good.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- For ""crane"": R is in position 2 and correct. C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- For ""broil"": R (position 2) is correct, O (position 3) is correct, L (position 5) is correct, and B and I are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be of the form _ R O _ L.  \n- Position 2 is R, position 3 is O, position 5 is L.  \n- Letters not in the word: A, B, C, E, I, N (from feedback).  \n- Letters to test: Position 1 needs a consonant like D, G, P, T, or W, and position 4 needs to be filled. Since ""broil"" indicated ""I"" is absent in position 4, we need a new letter there.\n\nPossible candidate words include:\n- PROWL (if position 1 is P and position 4 is W)\n- GROWL (G and W)\n- TROLL (T and L, but L is already at position 5)\n- DROLL (D and L, same as TROLL)\n- DROOL (D and O, but O is at position 3)\n\nTo maximize information, we should guess a word that tests less common letters and avoids redundant checks. ""PROWL"" introduces W, a new untested letter, and positions 1 and 4 are fresh. If not correct, feedback on P or W will help narrow down options (e.g., if P is absent, we consider G or D for position 1; if W is absent, position 4 might be something else like L or O).\n\nThus, ""prowl"" is an efficient guess to distinguish between possibilities like GROWL, TROLL, etc.\n\n<guess>prowl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: broil -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) L(✓)\nGuess 3: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - R is in position 2 and correct.
   - C, A, N, E are absent.

2. ""broil"": B(x), R(✓), O(✓), I(x), L(✓)
   - R is correct (position 2), O is correct (position 3), L is correct (position 5).
   - B and I are absent.

3. ""prowl"": P(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(✓)
   - R, O, L are correct (positions 2, 3, 5).
   - P and W are absent.

4. ""troll"": T(x), R(✓), O(✓), L(-), L(✓)
   - R is correct (position 2), O is correct (position 3), L is correct (position 5).
   - T is absent.
   - The first L (position 4) is marked as (-), meaning L is in the word but in the wrong position.

Key insights from all feedback:
- The word is _ R O _ L (positions 2, 3, 5 fixed as R, O, L).
- Position 5 has L, which is confirmed multiple times.
- Position 4 was guessed as L in ""troll"", but the feedback L(-) indicates that L is present but not in position 4. However, we already know L is in position 5, so this suggests that the word has only one L? Or not? 

Wait, the L(-) mark for position 4: Since the secret word has L only in position 5 (as it's fixed there), and position 4 is not L, the L in the guess at position 4 is correct in letter but wrong in position, but note that position 5 is also L and already accounted for. However, in the feedback system, each instance is checked separately. Here, the symbol L(-) for position 4 means that L is in the word, but not at that position. But since we know L is at position 5, this is consistent.

However, the L at position 5 is already matched, so the L at position 4 must be referring to the same or another L? But the feedback tells us that for position 4, L is not correct there but is in the word elsewhere.

But we know it exists at position 5. So, no new information really, except that position 4 is not L.

Additionally, T is absent.

Absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, I, N, P, W, T.

Known: R, O, L are in the word, with positions fixed.

From the L(-) at position 4, we can deduce that position 4 is not L.

Also, it confirms that there is no duplicate L? Not necessarily; it could have duplicate L, but if the secret had L at position 4 and 5, then guessing L at position 4 would have been ✓. But here it's (-), meaning that L is in the word but not at position 4, and we know it's at position 5. Since position 5 is fixed L, it implies that there is no other L? Or if there were, it might be marked differently, but in standard Wordle, duplicates can cause issues. In this feedback, since L at position 5 is matched, the L at position 4 is considered extra and not needed, so it gets (-) if there is no other L? Actually, no: the feedback rule says if the letter is in the word and not yet accounted for, it gets (-). In this case, L is already accounted for at position 5, so the L at position 4 has no unmatched L in secret? Hence, it gets x? But here it's (-), which is inconsistent.

Clarify the duplicate handling:

Suppose the secret word has one L at position 5. Guess ""troll"" has L at both position 4 and 5. Then:
- Position 5: L matches -> ✓
- Position 4: L exists in secret? Yes, but only once and that one is used for position 5? So guess position 4 should get x? But in our feedback, it's L(-).

But here the feedback says L(-) for position 4. This implies that there is another L in the word that is not yet accounted for? But we know L is at position 5 and matched.

Alternatively, if the secret has two L's, then position 4 might be L but not matched? Only if the secret has L at position 4 too.

But in this feedback, for ""troll"": L at position 4 gets (-), meaning L is in the word but not at this position.

Given that secret has L at position 5, and if there's no other L, then L in position 4 should be marked as x? But it's marked as (-), so that implies there must be an additional instance of L in the secret word? Or it could be a misinterpretation.

However, looking back at the feedback description: ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols: ✓ if correct position, - if present but wrong position, x if not present.""

So for position 4 of ""troll"": the letter is L. If the secret has L at position 4, it would be ✓. If not, but L is elsewhere, it should be -. So here, L(-) means L is present but not at position 4, which is consistent because L is at position 5.

But it doesn't imply a duplicate; it's just that L is in the word but not at position 4.

So, from this, we know that position 4 is not L.

Therefore, the secret word remains _ R O _ L, with position 4 not L.

From absent letters, we know it can't be C, A, N, E, B, I, P, W, T.

Now, position 1 is not T and not any absent letters.

The only common possibilities were:
- TROLL (now ruled out by T(x) and L(-) meaning position 4 not L? Wait, in ""troll"", position 4 was L and got -, so position 4 is not L.)
- DROLL: D at pos1, L at pos4 — but since pos4 cannot be L? No, in DROLL, position 4 is L. But now, after guessing ""troll"", with L at position 4 getting -, we know that position 4 is not L. So DROLL would have L at pos4, but if secret is ""droll"", and we guess ""troll"", position 4 would be L in both, so ✓? Why wasn't it ✓?

If secret were ""DROLL"" (D R O L L), and guess is ""TROLL"" (T R O L L), then:
- Pos4: L vs L -> ✓
But actual feedback for guess4 was L(-) for pos4? That doesn't match.

Contradiction.

Therefore, secret cannot be ""droll"" because then pos4 would be L and matched, giving L(✓).

Similarly, if secret is ""troll"", it would be L(✓) at pos4.

But here, feedback for ""troll"" guess has L(-) at pos4.

Therefore, the secret word does not have L at position 4.

So words like TROLL, DROLL are impossible.

Then the only remaining common option is DROOL: D R O O L.

Position 1: D, position 4: O.

But we guessed ""troll"", with pos4 L(-), but in ""drool"", position 4 is O.

We also have other possibilities? For example, GROWL but W is absent, or others.

Is there any other word? For example, ""drool"" has position 4 O.

Or ""growl"" has W, absent.

What about ""troop""? But ends with P, not L.

Or ""droit"" is 5-letter? D R O I T, but ends with T, not L.

So DROOL is the most likely.

Confirm with the feedback.

If secret is ""drool"" (D R O O L), guess ""troll"" (T R O L L):

- Pos1: T vs D -> T not present? Secret has D,R,O,O,L; letters {D,R,O,L}. T not present -> T(x)
- Pos2: R✓
- Pos3: O✓
- Pos4: L vs O -> L is in secret (at pos5), so L present but not at pos4 -> L(-)
- Pos5: L vs L -> ✓

So feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) exactly as given.

Thus, secret is likely ""drool"".

But we haven't guessed ""drool"" yet.

For word guess 5, we can guess ""drool"".

If correct, we win.

If not, then there might be another word, but it seems unlikely.

Other possibilities: with absent letters ruled out.

Letters remaining: D, F, G, H, K, M, S, U, V, Y, etc.

Is there another word ending with L: _ R O _ L? For example, ""frosh"" not ending L; ""dross"" not pattern; ""group"" not L.

""droob""? Not a word.

""droop"" ends with P, not L.

So ""drool"" seems to be the only common English word fitting the pattern without absent letters.

Therefore, guess ""drool"".

But let's be precise.

In the feedback of ""troll"", we see that for position 4, L got (-), which fits with ""drool"" having O at pos4.

And position 1 must be D, since T and others ruled out.

Absent letters include T, P, W, B, etc., and D is not tried.

So guess ""drool"".

Numbering: this is guess 5.

If wrong, we have another guess.

But probably correct.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have compiled the following information:

- **Pattern**: The secret word is _ R O _ L (R in position 2, O in position 3, L in position 5).
- **Correct and known letters**: R (position 2), O (position 3), L (position 5).
- **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, I, N, P, T, W (confirmed via ""crane,"" ""broil,"" ""prowl,"" and ""troll"" feedback).
- **Position 4 analysis**: The feedback for ""troll"" had L(-) at position 4, meaning L is present (at position 5) but not here. Thus, position 4 cannot be L.
- **Remaining possibilities**: Position 1 must be a letter not absent or already confirmed (e.g., D, F, G, H, K, M, S, U, V, Y). Position 4 must avoid L and absent letters. Existing words fitting the pattern include:
  - DROOL (D at position 1, O at position 4)
  - Less common options like GROWL/FROWL are ruled out due to W absence (from ""prowl"" feedback).

After testing T in position 1 (absent) and L in position 4 (wrong position but present elsewhere), DROOL emerges as the best candidate:
- It uses D (untested for position 1) and O (already known at position 3).
- If correct, it solves; if incorrect, feedback will confirm/deny position 1 or 4 alternatives.

Thus, ""drool"" is the optimal guess for maximizing information and solving the puzzle.
