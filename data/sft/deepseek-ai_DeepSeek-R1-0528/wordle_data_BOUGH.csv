We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a word that gives me good information.
 Common wisdom in Wordle is to start with a word that has a mix of common consonants and vowels, and no repeating letters.
 I will choose a word that has common letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, etc.
 Let me pick ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E' — common letters.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so I'll pick something different for maximum information.

 Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". But let me think about feedback: I want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that covers five common letters? But maybe not everyone knows it.

 Since we need a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Why ""RAISE""? It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E being one of the most common vowels). Actually, E is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" — common and hits two vowels and three consonants.

 Note: We are allowed to choose any valid word. Let me choose ""RAISE"".

 After this, we get feedback and can adjust.

 For the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".
</think>
Starting with a word that uses common letters to maximize potential feedback is a solid strategy. ""RAISE"" includes frequent vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S), which helps test multiple positions efficiently without repeating letters. This should provide useful information about which letters are present and their possible positions for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"": R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: R, A, I, S, E.

Since it's the second guess, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't include R, A, I, S, or E.

We should look for common letters that were not in the first guess. Some other common letters are: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information we get, so we include as many of these common letters as possible without repeating.

Let me think of words without R,A,I,S,E.

For example: 
- ""count"": uses C, O, U, N, T -> but U may not be ideal since it appears less frequently.
- ""donut"": D,O,N,U,T -> again has U.
- ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> good letters? M, O, N, T, H.

Alternatively, ""lotus"" has L,O,T,U,S -> but S is eliminated.

Since S is out, we avoid S.

Another word: ""point"" but P,O,I,N,T -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.

We cannot use I because it was x.

So we need a word without R,A,I,S,E.

Let me try ""cloud"": C,L,O,U,D -> includes U, which might not be common.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T -> I is eliminated.

""young"": Y,O,U,N,G -> has U and Y is not very common.

""crown"": C,R,O,W,N -> R is eliminated.

We must avoid R,A,I,S,E completely.

Consider the word ""mount"": M,O,U,N,T -> has U.

""bench"": B,E,N,C,H -> E is eliminated.

""lunch"": L,U,N,C,H -> U again.

We might have to accept using U or less common letters.

Another idea: ""could"" -> C,O,U,L,D -> still U.

Perhaps ""tonic"": T,O,N,I,C -> I is eliminated.

""topic"": T,O,P,I,C -> I eliminated.

We should avoid vowels? The only vowels left are O and U? And sometimes Y.

Vowels: Since E and A and I are eliminated, only O, U, and Y are possible for vowels.

But Y as vowel in ""hymn"" or ""crypt"".

It's challenging. Let's aim for words with O and possibly Y.

""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E eliminated.

""thong"": T,H,O,N,G -> that's T,H,O,N,G. None of R,A,I,S,E! Valid word?

""thong"" is a valid English word. Letters: T,H,O,N,G.

Alternatively, ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> letters M,O,N,T,H.

Which is better? ""thong"" and ""month"" both have T,H,O,N but one has G and the other M.

M is more common than G? Probably.

Another option: ""donut"" no, because U and S is out.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K -> B,L,O,C,K. L and O, C, K. That's good.

""block"": letters B,L,O,C,K. None are in the eliminated set R,A,I,S,E.

Is ""block"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common one: ""plump"" but P,L,U,M,P -> U and repeated P? ""plump"" has P twice? Wait, P,L,U,M,P — no, it's P,L,U,M,P? That can't be right. Word is ""PLUMP"" but it has 5 letters: P-L-U-M-P? Two P's? Only one P? Wait, let me check: P-L-U-M-P. That's 5 letters but P repeated? Actually, words can have repeated letters? But in our case, the secret word is 5 distinct? The rules don't specify distinct letters, but note that the feedback symbols handle duplicates.

In the rules, it says: ""Each letter in your guess"" can get different symbols. But the feedback doesn't mention anything about duplicates. For example, if secret has one L and you guess two L's, one might be correct or present.

But in this case, since our first guess had all unique letters, and feedback showed all absent, probably the secret word doesn't have duplicates? But we cannot be sure.

However, to be safe, we should assume that duplicates are possible, but since we have no evidence, we avoid duplicates to maximize information.

For our second guess, we want to test new letters, so avoid repeated letters if possible.

So ""block"": B (new), L (new), O (vowel), C (new), K (new). That tests 5 new letters without duplicates.

Similarly, ""thong"": T,H,O,N,G — five distinct new letters.

""month"": M,O,N,T,H — M,O,N,T,H — distinct.

Now, among these, which has the most common letters?

Common letters in English: T, N, O from our remaining set.

""month"": contains T,N,O — all common, plus M and H.

H is somewhat common.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K — O is common, but B,L,C,K are less common than T and N.

Thus, ""month"" seems better: T, N, O are very common.

Another choice could be ""clout"", but U is not ideal and C,L,O,U,T — U is less common than T,N.

So ""month"" is a good candidate.

But ""month"" does not use a Y or U. It sticks to more common consonants.

We can also consider ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G — letters Y,O,U,N,G. O and N are common but Y and U are less common.

So ""month"" appears superior.

Is there a word with Y? For example, ""horny"" — but H,O,R,N,Y — R is eliminated.

""downy"": D,O,W,N,Y — D,O,W,N,Y. Eliminated? R,A,I,S,E no. So D,O,W,N,Y are all new.

But W and Y are not as common as M and T? Wait, D,O,N are common.

Compare to ""month"": 

For ""month"": letters M,O,N,T,H — frequency: T high, O high, N high, M medium, H medium.

For ""downy"": D medium, O high, W medium, N high, Y medium-low.

So ""month"" has more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""pound"" — P,O,U,N,D — U, which is medium-low frequency.

Thus, ""month"" is a good choice.

We'll go with ""month"".

So guess ""month"".

Then we'll get feedback.

But note: If we guess ""month"" and we get feedback, we can deduce which letters are present.

In case the word has duplicates? But unlikely with these letters.

So let's choose ""month"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are present in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, I, S, E).

For the second guess, I need to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. Common consonants like T, N, O, L, C, H, M, D, P, B, and vowels like O, U, or Y are strong candidates. After considering options, ""month"" is ideal:
- Uses M, O, N, T, H—all new, untested letters.
- Includes high-frequency consonants (T, N) and the vowel O.
- Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters, ensuring efficient information gain.
- If the word contains O, N, T, M, or H, the feedback will help narrow possibilities significantly.

 Common wisdom in Wordle is to start with a word that has a mix of common consonants and vowels, and no repeating letters.
 I will choose a word that has common letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, etc.
 Let me pick ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E' — common letters.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so I'll pick something different for maximum information.

 Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". But let me think about feedback: I want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that covers five common letters? But maybe not everyone knows it.

 Since we need a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Why ""RAISE""? It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E being one of the most common vowels). Actually, E is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" — common and hits two vowels and three consonants.

 Note: We are allowed to choose any valid word. Let me choose ""RAISE"".

 After this, we get feedback and can adjust.

 For the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".Starting with a word that uses common letters to maximize potential feedback is a solid strategy. ""RAISE"" includes frequent vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S), which helps test multiple positions efficiently without repeating letters. This should provide useful information about which letters are present and their possible positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"": R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: R, A, I, S, E.

Since it's the second guess, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't include R, A, I, S, or E.

We should look for common letters that were not in the first guess. Some other common letters are: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information we get, so we include as many of these common letters as possible without repeating.

Let me think of words without R,A,I,S,E.

For example: 
- ""count"": uses C, O, U, N, T -> but U may not be ideal since it appears less frequently.
- ""donut"": D,O,N,U,T -> again has U.
- ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> good letters? M, O, N, T, H.

Alternatively, ""lotus"" has L,O,T,U,S -> but S is eliminated.

Since S is out, we avoid S.

Another word: ""point"" but P,O,I,N,T -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.

We cannot use I because it was x.

So we need a word without R,A,I,S,E.

Let me try ""cloud"": C,L,O,U,D -> includes U, which might not be common.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T -> I is eliminated.

""young"": Y,O,U,N,G -> has U and Y is not very common.

""crown"": C,R,O,W,N -> R is eliminated.

We must avoid R,A,I,S,E completely.

Consider the word ""mount"": M,O,U,N,T -> has U.

""bench"": B,E,N,C,H -> E is eliminated.

""lunch"": L,U,N,C,H -> U again.

We might have to accept using U or less common letters.

Another idea: ""could"" -> C,O,U,L,D -> still U.

Perhaps ""tonic"": T,O,N,I,C -> I is eliminated.

""topic"": T,O,P,I,C -> I eliminated.

We should avoid vowels? The only vowels left are O and U? And sometimes Y.

Vowels: Since E and A and I are eliminated, only O, U, and Y are possible for vowels.

But Y as vowel in ""hymn"" or ""crypt"".

It's challenging. Let's aim for words with O and possibly Y.

""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E eliminated.

""thong"": T,H,O,N,G -> that's T,H,O,N,G. None of R,A,I,S,E! Valid word?

""thong"" is a valid English word. Letters: T,H,O,N,G.

Alternatively, ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> letters M,O,N,T,H.

Which is better? ""thong"" and ""month"" both have T,H,O,N but one has G and the other M.

M is more common than G? Probably.

Another option: ""donut"" no, because U and S is out.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K -> B,L,O,C,K. L and O, C, K. That's good.

""block"": letters B,L,O,C,K. None are in the eliminated set R,A,I,S,E.

Is ""block"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common one: ""plump"" but P,L,U,M,P -> U and repeated P? ""plump"" has P twice? Wait, P,L,U,M,P — no, it's P,L,U,M,P? That can't be right. Word is ""PLUMP"" but it has 5 letters: P-L-U-M-P? Two P's? Only one P? Wait, let me check: P-L-U-M-P. That's 5 letters but P repeated? Actually, words can have repeated letters? But in our case, the secret word is 5 distinct? The rules don't specify distinct letters, but note that the feedback symbols handle duplicates.

In the rules, it says: ""Each letter in your guess"" can get different symbols. But the feedback doesn't mention anything about duplicates. For example, if secret has one L and you guess two L's, one might be correct or present.

But in this case, since our first guess had all unique letters, and feedback showed all absent, probably the secret word doesn't have duplicates? But we cannot be sure.

However, to be safe, we should assume that duplicates are possible, but since we have no evidence, we avoid duplicates to maximize information.

For our second guess, we want to test new letters, so avoid repeated letters if possible.

So ""block"": B (new), L (new), O (vowel), C (new), K (new). That tests 5 new letters without duplicates.

Similarly, ""thong"": T,H,O,N,G — five distinct new letters.

""month"": M,O,N,T,H — M,O,N,T,H — distinct.

Now, among these, which has the most common letters?

Common letters in English: T, N, O from our remaining set.

""month"": contains T,N,O — all common, plus M and H.

H is somewhat common.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K — O is common, but B,L,C,K are less common than T and N.

Thus, ""month"" seems better: T, N, O are very common.

Another choice could be ""clout"", but U is not ideal and C,L,O,U,T — U is less common than T,N.

So ""month"" is a good candidate.

But ""month"" does not use a Y or U. It sticks to more common consonants.

We can also consider ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G — letters Y,O,U,N,G. O and N are common but Y and U are less common.

So ""month"" appears superior.

Is there a word with Y? For example, ""horny"" — but H,O,R,N,Y — R is eliminated.

""downy"": D,O,W,N,Y — D,O,W,N,Y. Eliminated? R,A,I,S,E no. So D,O,W,N,Y are all new.

But W and Y are not as common as M and T? Wait, D,O,N are common.

Compare to ""month"": 

For ""month"": letters M,O,N,T,H — frequency: T high, O high, N high, M medium, H medium.

For ""downy"": D medium, O high, W medium, N high, Y medium-low.

So ""month"" has more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""pound"" — P,O,U,N,D — U, which is medium-low frequency.

Thus, ""month"" is a good choice.

We'll go with ""month"".

So guess ""month"".

Then we'll get feedback.

But note: If we guess ""month"" and we get feedback, we can deduce which letters are present.

In case the word has duplicates? But unlikely with these letters.

So let's choose ""month"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are present in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, I, S, E).

For the second guess, I need to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. Common consonants like T, N, O, L, C, H, M, D, P, B, and vowels like O, U, or Y are strong candidates. After considering options, ""month"" is ideal:
- Uses M, O, N, T, H—all new, untested letters.
- Includes high-frequency consonants (T, N) and the vowel O.
- Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters, ensuring efficient information gain.
- If the word contains O, N, T, M, or H, the feedback will help narrow possibilities significantly.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""raise"" -> all letters absent: R, A, I, S, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""month"" -> M(x), O(✓), N(x), T(x), H(✓)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""month"" is M-O-N-T-H, so O is the second letter).
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since H is the fifth letter).
- M, N, T are absent from the word entirely.

So, we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The fifth letter is H.
- The word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters, so the pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] H

And letter1, letter3, letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: L, C, D, P, U, G, etc.

We know the positions for O and H, so we can try to fill the other positions.

But we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We should try a word that uses common consonants and perhaps a vowel if needed. The only vowels left are U and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). But we don't have A, E, I, so we might have U or Y as vowels.

Possible words:

- Could we have ""cough""? C O U G H -> but G is in position 4? Let's see: positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H. But we have H at position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if U and G are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.

But ""cough"" has U and G.

Similarly, ""dough"": D O U G H.

""rough"": R is eliminated, so no.

""tough"": T is eliminated, no.

""bough"": B O U G H.

But we don't know if U or G are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Another idea: ""locus"" but S is eliminated.

""focus"": F O C U S -> S eliminated.

""vouch"": V O U C H -> positions: 1:V, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:H. This could be a candidate.

But we have position 5 H, so it fits.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H.

""couch"": C O U C H -> has two C's? C-O-U-C-H, so C at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can have them.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters not in the eliminated set.

We also know that O and H are fixed at positions 2 and 5.

So the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters from B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Common letters: C, L, D, P, U, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to use a word that has U in position 3, since U is a common vowel and might be needed.

But we don't know if U is in the word.

Alternatively, we can use a word without U to test other letters.

But if we avoid U, we might have words like ""polyp"" but P O L Y P, and Y is at position 4, and H at 5? But ""polyp"" ends with P, not H.

We need the last letter to be H.

So words ending with ""O?H"" pattern.

Common endings: like ""ough"" as above, but we have O at 2 and H at 5, so the third and fourth letters are between.

For example, words like: cough, dough, tough, bough, rough, but rough has R eliminated, tough has T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough.

But we don't know if C, D, B, or G are in the word.

We could try ""gouge"" but ends with E, eliminated.

""lough"" - a word? L-O-U-G-H, meaning a lake, but not common.

""dough"" is common.

But we need to get information about other letters.

Since we have two positions fixed, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word that has different letters in positions 1,3,4 to test.

For example, ""vouch"": V O U C H

This tests V, U, C.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H

Or ""couch"": C O U C H, but has two C's, which might not be ideal for testing.

""bylaw"" but no H at end.

We need the pattern _ O _ _ H.

List of possible words ending with O?H:

- With O in second and H in fifth: so the word must be of the form ?O??H

Common words: 
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- rough (R O U G H) but R eliminated
- tough (T O U G H) but T eliminated
- lough (L O U G H) - less common
- sough (S O U G H) but S eliminated

So only cough, dough, bough are possible from common words? But we don't know if U and G are present.

We could try ""youth"" but Y O U T H -> T is eliminated, and position 4 is T, which is absent.

""youth"" has T, which is eliminated.

""booth"" B O O T H -> but O at position 2 and 3? Then position 3 is O, but we have O only at position 2? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple O's, but we don't know.

In ""month"", O was correct at position 2, but that doesn't prevent O from being elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""month"" had O(✓) meaning that O is in the word and in position 2, but it doesn't say if there are other O's. However, since we have no other information, we should not assume multiple O's.

But in the secret word, O might be only at position 2, or it might be elsewhere too? But in the feedback, for ""month"", we have O(✓) for position 2, and for other positions, we don't know.

But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""month"", we guessed O at position 2 and it was correct, so we know position 2 is O. We also know that if there were another O, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere. But since we have no evidence, we can assume for now that there is only one O, but it might not be true.

To be safe, we should consider the possibility of multiple O's, but for guessing, we can start with the common case.

But in the pattern, we have position 2 fixed as O, so for position 3 and 4, we can have other letters.

Back to the word list: we have cough, dough, bough as candidates, but we don't want to guess one of them directly because if it's wrong, we get less information.

We should guess a word that tests letters that are not in these, to narrow down.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we can eliminate more.

But we have to use the pattern: _ O _ _ H

So let's think of other words that fit this pattern.

For example:
- ""pooch"": P O O C H -> but O at position 3? Then position 3 is O, and position 4 is C, position 5 H. But we have O at position 2 and 3? Possible.

""pooch"" is P-O-O-C-H.

But we don't know if there is a double O.

Similarly, ""broth"" but B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""goth"" is 4 letters.

""moth"" M O T H -> M and T eliminated, and only 4 letters? M-O-T-H is 4, not 5.

5-letter words only.

""booth"" B O O T H -> T eliminated.

""sooth"" S O O T H -> S and T eliminated.

""tooth"" T O O T H -> T eliminated.

""woosh"" W O O S H -> S eliminated.

""push"" is 4 letters.

""bush"" is 4.

""cushy"" not ending with H.

Another word: ""lunch"" L U N C H -> N eliminated.

""punch"" P U N C H -> N eliminated.

""hunch"" H U N C H -> but position 1 is H, but we have H at position 5, and H might be only at 5? But we don't know.

""hunch"" has H at position 1 and 5, but we have H at position 5 correct, so if we guess ""hunch"", position 1 H might be present or not.

But we are not guessing ""hunch"" now.

We need a word with pattern ?O??H.

""vouch"" V O U C H

""pouch"" P O U C H

""couch"" C O U C H

""touch"" T O U C H -> T eliminated.

""mouch"" M O U C H -> M eliminated.

So only vouch, pouch, couch are possible without eliminated letters.

But we also have ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogah"" not a word.

""bogus"" not ending with H.

Perhaps ""loung"" not a word.

""dough"" is D O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

Similarly, ""cough"" C O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

U is not eliminated.

But we have many words with U and G.

To get more information, we could guess a word that doesn't have U, to see if U is present.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that doesn't have U?

For instance, ""booth"" has T and double O, but T eliminated.

""coach"" C O A C H -> A eliminated.

""poach"" P O A C H -> A eliminated.

""roach"" R O A C H -> R and A eliminated.

""loath"" L O A T H -> A and T eliminated.

""broth"" B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""gawky"" not ending with H.

""jolly"" not H.

It seems that most common words with ?O??H have U in position 3, like in the ""ough"" words.

There is ""bothy"" B O T H Y -> T eliminated and not H at end.

""comfy"" not H.

""dopey"" not H.

So it's hard to find a word without U.

Another possibility: ""koph"" not 5 letters.

""yodh"" not 5.

So perhaps U is very likely in position 3.

But we don't know.

We could guess a word that has U in a different position to test.

But in the pattern, position 3 is free, so we can put U there or not.

Since we have to use the pattern, we might as well include U to see if it's present.

But to maximize information, we should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

For example, in ""vouch"", we test V, U, C.

V is not very common.

In ""pouch"", we test P, U, C.

P and C are common.

In ""couch"", we test C, U, but C twice, so only two letters.

""couch"" has C at 1 and 4, so if C is not in the word, we get two x's, but if it is, we might get one or two marks.

But it's better to have distinct letters.

So ""pouch"" or ""vouch"".

""dough"" tests D, U, G.

G is common.

""bough"" tests B, U, G.

B is medium common.

""cough"" tests C, U, G.

C and G are common.

Among these, ""cough"" has C and G, both common.

But we also have ""lough"" which tests L, U, G.

L is very common.

So let's list the letters we can test:

- For position 1: we can use B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but U is better in position 3.

Typically, position 1 is a consonant.

Position 3 can be a vowel or consonant.

Position 4 is a consonant in these words.

So for position 1, we want to test a common consonant: like L, C, P, D, B, F, etc.

Position 3: likely U, but we can try other vowels? But the only vowel left is U or Y, and Y can be used.

For example, is there a word like ""goyim"" not H.

""boyla"" not.

So probably U is the only vowel possibility for position 3.

We can have Y in position 3 or 4.

For example, ""toyon"" not H.

""royal"" not H.

""payed"" not H.

It's difficult.

Another word: ""bylaw"" not H.

So let's accept that position 3 is likely U for common words.

Then position 4 can be G, C, etc.

So for our guess, we can choose ""pouch"" to test P, U, C.

Or ""cough"" to test C, U, G.

Or ""dough"" for D, U, G.

Since we have no information on these, we should choose one that has letters that are more common.

C is more common than P or D or G? Let's see letter frequencies.

In English, common consonants: T, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, M, F, etc. But we have eliminated T, N, S, R, M, and H is already placed.

Remaining: D, L, C, F, P, G, B, etc.

C is more common than D, P, G.

According to frequency, C is about 2.78%, D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D is more common than C, P, G.

D is 4.25%, L is 4.03%, C is 2.78%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D and L are more common.

But in ""dough"", we test D, U, G.

In ""cough"", C, U, G.

In ""lough"", L, U, G.

""lough"" is a valid word, meaning a lake or arm of the sea.

Similarly, ""cough"" and ""dough"" are common.

We also have ""bough"" with B, U, G.

B is 1.49%, less common.

So ""dough"" or ""lough"" might be better.

But ""lough"" is less common, but valid.

To be safe, let's use ""dough"" to test D and G.

But we also have U, which is common.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have U in position 3 to see if U is present, but as we saw, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""polyp"" not ending with H.

""lymph"" L Y M P H -> M eliminated.

""nymph"" N Y M P H -> N and M eliminated.

""wryly"" not H.

So no.

Perhaps ""gulph"" variant of gulf, not common.

So we might have to go with a word that has U.

But we can choose one that tests letters we are unsure of.

Since we have to make a guess, let's pick ""dough"" to test D and G.

Then, if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have position 1 and position 4 to consider.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 is U, position 4 is G.

If we guess ""dough"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like D(x or -), U(x or -), G(x or -).

But since O and H are fixed, we know they are correct.

So the feedback will be for D, U, G.

Similarly for other guesses.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the potential solution if possible, but we don't know.

Another thought: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and the eliminated letters.

Possible words: ?O??H with no R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T.

Letters available: B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But the word must be valid.

Common words:
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- lough (L O U G H)
- pouch (P O U C H)
- couch (C O U C H) - but double C
- vouch (V O U C H)
- gouge not H
- touch T eliminated
- etc.

Also, ""rough"" R eliminated, ""tough"" T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough, lough, pouch, couch, vouch.

Couch has two C's, so it might not be ideal.

Vouch has V, which is less common.

Lough is less common.

So the most common are cough, dough, bough, pouch.

Pouch has P and C.

Cough has C and G.

Dough has D and G.

Bough has B and G.

We can choose one that tests letters we want.

Since we have no information on C, D, G, P, etc., we can pick ""pouch"" to test P and C, as C is common.

Or ""cough"" for C and G.

But ""cough"" has C and G, both to test.

Similarly, ""pouch"" has P and C.

D has higher frequency, so ""dough"" might be better.

But let's see the position.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 U, position 4 G.

If we guess ""dough"", and the feedback shows:

- If D is in the word but wrong position, we get D(-)
- If U is in the word but wrong position, U(-), but U is at position 3, if it's not correct, it might be absent or elsewhere, but since we have no other U, it might be absent or present elsewhere.

But we don't have other positions for U yet.

Similarly for G.

To save guesses, we could guess a word that is likely, but we don't know.

Another idea: guess a word that has Y or other letters to test more.

For example, ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogic"" not H.

""comic"" not H.

So hard.

Perhaps ""fouth"" not a common word.

I think we have to choose from the list.

Let's pick ""cough"" as it is common and tests C and G.

So guess ""cough"".

Then we can see.

But ""cough"" is C O U G H.

Feedback will tell us about C, U, G.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we know which of C, U, G are in the word.

Similarly for other guesses.

Since we are at guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, it's ok.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more letters.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that has L or F or other common letters.

""lough"" has L, U, G.

""fouth"" is not common, meaning abundance, but rare.

""pough"" not a word.

""wough"" not.

So ""lough"" is an option.

L is common, so ""lough"" tests L, U, G.

Similarly, ""dough"" tests D, U, G.

D is more common than L? D 4.25%, L 4.03%, very close.

But in word games, L is very common.

I think ""dough"" or ""cough"" is fine.

Let's go with ""dough"".

So guess ""dough"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

From guess 2: O and H are correct at positions 2 and 5.

So in ""dough"", O and H will be correct, and we get feedback on D, U, G.

Similarly for any guess with O at 2 and H at 5.

So for guess 3, I'll choose ""dough"".

<guess>dough</guess>

But the user might expect the guess in the format.

In the previous, we had <guess>raise</guess> etc.

So for this, <guess>dough</guess>

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another word: ""bough"" is similar.

Or ""cough"".

But I think ""dough"" is good.

Perhaps ""pouch"" to test P and C, which are different.

But D is more common than P.

D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, so D is better.

So ""dough"" it is.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""raise""): All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent from the secret word.
- Guess 2 (""month""): O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5. M, N, and T are absent.

The secret word must:
- Be 5 letters long.
- Have O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter (pattern: _ O _ _ H).
- Exclude the letters R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T (since they are absent).
- Use only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to test common remaining letters (like D, U, G, C, L, P) while fitting the pattern. ""Dough"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (D O U G H) and tests three new common letters: D (high frequency), U (vowel), and G. This will provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>dough</guess>",dough,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""raise"" -> all letters absent: R, A, I, S, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""month"" -> M(x), O(✓), N(x), T(x), H(✓)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""month"" is M-O-N-T-H, so O is the second letter).
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since H is the fifth letter).
- M, N, T are absent from the word entirely.

So, we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The fifth letter is H.
- The word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters, so the pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] H

And letter1, letter3, letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: L, C, D, P, U, G, etc.

We know the positions for O and H, so we can try to fill the other positions.

But we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We should try a word that uses common consonants and perhaps a vowel if needed. The only vowels left are U and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). But we don't have A, E, I, so we might have U or Y as vowels.

Possible words:

- Could we have ""cough""? C O U G H -> but G is in position 4? Let's see: positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H. But we have H at position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if U and G are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.

But ""cough"" has U and G.

Similarly, ""dough"": D O U G H.

""rough"": R is eliminated, so no.

""tough"": T is eliminated, no.

""bough"": B O U G H.

But we don't know if U or G are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Another idea: ""locus"" but S is eliminated.

""focus"": F O C U S -> S eliminated.

""vouch"": V O U C H -> positions: 1:V, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:H. This could be a candidate.

But we have position 5 H, so it fits.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H.

""couch"": C O U C H -> has two C's? C-O-U-C-H, so C at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can have them.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters not in the eliminated set.

We also know that O and H are fixed at positions 2 and 5.

So the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters from B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Common letters: C, L, D, P, U, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to use a word that has U in position 3, since U is a common vowel and might be needed.

But we don't know if U is in the word.

Alternatively, we can use a word without U to test other letters.

But if we avoid U, we might have words like ""polyp"" but P O L Y P, and Y is at position 4, and H at 5? But ""polyp"" ends with P, not H.

We need the last letter to be H.

So words ending with ""O?H"" pattern.

Common endings: like ""ough"" as above, but we have O at 2 and H at 5, so the third and fourth letters are between.

For example, words like: cough, dough, tough, bough, rough, but rough has R eliminated, tough has T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough.

But we don't know if C, D, B, or G are in the word.

We could try ""gouge"" but ends with E, eliminated.

""lough"" - a word? L-O-U-G-H, meaning a lake, but not common.

""dough"" is common.

But we need to get information about other letters.

Since we have two positions fixed, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word that has different letters in positions 1,3,4 to test.

For example, ""vouch"": V O U C H

This tests V, U, C.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H

Or ""couch"": C O U C H, but has two C's, which might not be ideal for testing.

""bylaw"" but no H at end.

We need the pattern _ O _ _ H.

List of possible words ending with O?H:

- With O in second and H in fifth: so the word must be of the form ?O??H

Common words: 
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- rough (R O U G H) but R eliminated
- tough (T O U G H) but T eliminated
- lough (L O U G H) - less common
- sough (S O U G H) but S eliminated

So only cough, dough, bough are possible from common words? But we don't know if U and G are present.

We could try ""youth"" but Y O U T H -> T is eliminated, and position 4 is T, which is absent.

""youth"" has T, which is eliminated.

""booth"" B O O T H -> but O at position 2 and 3? Then position 3 is O, but we have O only at position 2? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple O's, but we don't know.

In ""month"", O was correct at position 2, but that doesn't prevent O from being elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""month"" had O(✓) meaning that O is in the word and in position 2, but it doesn't say if there are other O's. However, since we have no other information, we should not assume multiple O's.

But in the secret word, O might be only at position 2, or it might be elsewhere too? But in the feedback, for ""month"", we have O(✓) for position 2, and for other positions, we don't know.

But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""month"", we guessed O at position 2 and it was correct, so we know position 2 is O. We also know that if there were another O, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere. But since we have no evidence, we can assume for now that there is only one O, but it might not be true.

To be safe, we should consider the possibility of multiple O's, but for guessing, we can start with the common case.

But in the pattern, we have position 2 fixed as O, so for position 3 and 4, we can have other letters.

Back to the word list: we have cough, dough, bough as candidates, but we don't want to guess one of them directly because if it's wrong, we get less information.

We should guess a word that tests letters that are not in these, to narrow down.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we can eliminate more.

But we have to use the pattern: _ O _ _ H

So let's think of other words that fit this pattern.

For example:
- ""pooch"": P O O C H -> but O at position 3? Then position 3 is O, and position 4 is C, position 5 H. But we have O at position 2 and 3? Possible.

""pooch"" is P-O-O-C-H.

But we don't know if there is a double O.

Similarly, ""broth"" but B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""goth"" is 4 letters.

""moth"" M O T H -> M and T eliminated, and only 4 letters? M-O-T-H is 4, not 5.

5-letter words only.

""booth"" B O O T H -> T eliminated.

""sooth"" S O O T H -> S and T eliminated.

""tooth"" T O O T H -> T eliminated.

""woosh"" W O O S H -> S eliminated.

""push"" is 4 letters.

""bush"" is 4.

""cushy"" not ending with H.

Another word: ""lunch"" L U N C H -> N eliminated.

""punch"" P U N C H -> N eliminated.

""hunch"" H U N C H -> but position 1 is H, but we have H at position 5, and H might be only at 5? But we don't know.

""hunch"" has H at position 1 and 5, but we have H at position 5 correct, so if we guess ""hunch"", position 1 H might be present or not.

But we are not guessing ""hunch"" now.

We need a word with pattern ?O??H.

""vouch"" V O U C H

""pouch"" P O U C H

""couch"" C O U C H

""touch"" T O U C H -> T eliminated.

""mouch"" M O U C H -> M eliminated.

So only vouch, pouch, couch are possible without eliminated letters.

But we also have ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogah"" not a word.

""bogus"" not ending with H.

Perhaps ""loung"" not a word.

""dough"" is D O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

Similarly, ""cough"" C O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

U is not eliminated.

But we have many words with U and G.

To get more information, we could guess a word that doesn't have U, to see if U is present.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that doesn't have U?

For instance, ""booth"" has T and double O, but T eliminated.

""coach"" C O A C H -> A eliminated.

""poach"" P O A C H -> A eliminated.

""roach"" R O A C H -> R and A eliminated.

""loath"" L O A T H -> A and T eliminated.

""broth"" B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""gawky"" not ending with H.

""jolly"" not H.

It seems that most common words with ?O??H have U in position 3, like in the ""ough"" words.

There is ""bothy"" B O T H Y -> T eliminated and not H at end.

""comfy"" not H.

""dopey"" not H.

So it's hard to find a word without U.

Another possibility: ""koph"" not 5 letters.

""yodh"" not 5.

So perhaps U is very likely in position 3.

But we don't know.

We could guess a word that has U in a different position to test.

But in the pattern, position 3 is free, so we can put U there or not.

Since we have to use the pattern, we might as well include U to see if it's present.

But to maximize information, we should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

For example, in ""vouch"", we test V, U, C.

V is not very common.

In ""pouch"", we test P, U, C.

P and C are common.

In ""couch"", we test C, U, but C twice, so only two letters.

""couch"" has C at 1 and 4, so if C is not in the word, we get two x's, but if it is, we might get one or two marks.

But it's better to have distinct letters.

So ""pouch"" or ""vouch"".

""dough"" tests D, U, G.

G is common.

""bough"" tests B, U, G.

B is medium common.

""cough"" tests C, U, G.

C and G are common.

Among these, ""cough"" has C and G, both common.

But we also have ""lough"" which tests L, U, G.

L is very common.

So let's list the letters we can test:

- For position 1: we can use B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but U is better in position 3.

Typically, position 1 is a consonant.

Position 3 can be a vowel or consonant.

Position 4 is a consonant in these words.

So for position 1, we want to test a common consonant: like L, C, P, D, B, F, etc.

Position 3: likely U, but we can try other vowels? But the only vowel left is U or Y, and Y can be used.

For example, is there a word like ""goyim"" not H.

""boyla"" not.

So probably U is the only vowel possibility for position 3.

We can have Y in position 3 or 4.

For example, ""toyon"" not H.

""royal"" not H.

""payed"" not H.

It's difficult.

Another word: ""bylaw"" not H.

So let's accept that position 3 is likely U for common words.

Then position 4 can be G, C, etc.

So for our guess, we can choose ""pouch"" to test P, U, C.

Or ""cough"" to test C, U, G.

Or ""dough"" for D, U, G.

Since we have no information on these, we should choose one that has letters that are more common.

C is more common than P or D or G? Let's see letter frequencies.

In English, common consonants: T, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, M, F, etc. But we have eliminated T, N, S, R, M, and H is already placed.

Remaining: D, L, C, F, P, G, B, etc.

C is more common than D, P, G.

According to frequency, C is about 2.78%, D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D is more common than C, P, G.

D is 4.25%, L is 4.03%, C is 2.78%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D and L are more common.

But in ""dough"", we test D, U, G.

In ""cough"", C, U, G.

In ""lough"", L, U, G.

""lough"" is a valid word, meaning a lake or arm of the sea.

Similarly, ""cough"" and ""dough"" are common.

We also have ""bough"" with B, U, G.

B is 1.49%, less common.

So ""dough"" or ""lough"" might be better.

But ""lough"" is less common, but valid.

To be safe, let's use ""dough"" to test D and G.

But we also have U, which is common.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have U in position 3 to see if U is present, but as we saw, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""polyp"" not ending with H.

""lymph"" L Y M P H -> M eliminated.

""nymph"" N Y M P H -> N and M eliminated.

""wryly"" not H.

So no.

Perhaps ""gulph"" variant of gulf, not common.

So we might have to go with a word that has U.

But we can choose one that tests letters we are unsure of.

Since we have to make a guess, let's pick ""dough"" to test D and G.

Then, if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have position 1 and position 4 to consider.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 is U, position 4 is G.

If we guess ""dough"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like D(x or -), U(x or -), G(x or -).

But since O and H are fixed, we know they are correct.

So the feedback will be for D, U, G.

Similarly for other guesses.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the potential solution if possible, but we don't know.

Another thought: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and the eliminated letters.

Possible words: ?O??H with no R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T.

Letters available: B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But the word must be valid.

Common words:
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- lough (L O U G H)
- pouch (P O U C H)
- couch (C O U C H) - but double C
- vouch (V O U C H)
- gouge not H
- touch T eliminated
- etc.

Also, ""rough"" R eliminated, ""tough"" T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough, lough, pouch, couch, vouch.

Couch has two C's, so it might not be ideal.

Vouch has V, which is less common.

Lough is less common.

So the most common are cough, dough, bough, pouch.

Pouch has P and C.

Cough has C and G.

Dough has D and G.

Bough has B and G.

We can choose one that tests letters we want.

Since we have no information on C, D, G, P, etc., we can pick ""pouch"" to test P and C, as C is common.

Or ""cough"" for C and G.

But ""cough"" has C and G, both to test.

Similarly, ""pouch"" has P and C.

D has higher frequency, so ""dough"" might be better.

But let's see the position.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 U, position 4 G.

If we guess ""dough"", and the feedback shows:

- If D is in the word but wrong position, we get D(-)
- If U is in the word but wrong position, U(-), but U is at position 3, if it's not correct, it might be absent or elsewhere, but since we have no other U, it might be absent or present elsewhere.

But we don't have other positions for U yet.

Similarly for G.

To save guesses, we could guess a word that is likely, but we don't know.

Another idea: guess a word that has Y or other letters to test more.

For example, ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogic"" not H.

""comic"" not H.

So hard.

Perhaps ""fouth"" not a common word.

I think we have to choose from the list.

Let's pick ""cough"" as it is common and tests C and G.

So guess ""cough"".

Then we can see.

But ""cough"" is C O U G H.

Feedback will tell us about C, U, G.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we know which of C, U, G are in the word.

Similarly for other guesses.

Since we are at guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, it's ok.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more letters.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that has L or F or other common letters.

""lough"" has L, U, G.

""fouth"" is not common, meaning abundance, but rare.

""pough"" not a word.

""wough"" not.

So ""lough"" is an option.

L is common, so ""lough"" tests L, U, G.

Similarly, ""dough"" tests D, U, G.

D is more common than L? D 4.25%, L 4.03%, very close.

But in word games, L is very common.

I think ""dough"" or ""cough"" is fine.

Let's go with ""dough"".

So guess ""dough"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

From guess 2: O and H are correct at positions 2 and 5.

So in ""dough"", O and H will be correct, and we get feedback on D, U, G.

Similarly for any guess with O at 2 and H at 5.

So for guess 3, I'll choose ""dough"".

<guess>dough</guess>

But the user might expect the guess in the format.

In the previous, we had <guess>raise</guess> etc.

So for this, <guess>dough</guess>

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another word: ""bough"" is similar.

Or ""cough"".

But I think ""dough"" is good.

Perhaps ""pouch"" to test P and C, which are different.

But D is more common than P.

D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, so D is better.

So ""dough"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""raise""): All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent from the secret word.
- Guess 2 (""month""): O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5. M, N, and T are absent.

The secret word must:
- Be 5 letters long.
- Have O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter (pattern: _ O _ _ H).
- Exclude the letters R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T (since they are absent).
- Use only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to test common remaining letters (like D, U, G, C, L, P) while fitting the pattern. ""Dough"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (D O U G H) and tests three new common letters: D (high frequency), U (vowel), and G. This will provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.",Guess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a word that gives me good information.
 Common wisdom in Wordle is to start with a word that has a mix of common consonants and vowels, and no repeating letters.
 I will choose a word that has common letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, etc.
 Let me pick ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E' — common letters.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so I'll pick something different for maximum information.

 Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". But let me think about feedback: I want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that covers five common letters? But maybe not everyone knows it.

 Since we need a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Why ""RAISE""? It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E being one of the most common vowels). Actually, E is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" — common and hits two vowels and three consonants.

 Note: We are allowed to choose any valid word. Let me choose ""RAISE"".

 After this, we get feedback and can adjust.

 For the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".Starting with a word that uses common letters to maximize potential feedback is a solid strategy. ""RAISE"" includes frequent vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S), which helps test multiple positions efficiently without repeating letters. This should provide useful information about which letters are present and their possible positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"": R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: R, A, I, S, E.

Since it's the second guess, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't include R, A, I, S, or E.

We should look for common letters that were not in the first guess. Some other common letters are: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information we get, so we include as many of these common letters as possible without repeating.

Let me think of words without R,A,I,S,E.

For example: 
- ""count"": uses C, O, U, N, T -> but U may not be ideal since it appears less frequently.
- ""donut"": D,O,N,U,T -> again has U.
- ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> good letters? M, O, N, T, H.

Alternatively, ""lotus"" has L,O,T,U,S -> but S is eliminated.

Since S is out, we avoid S.

Another word: ""point"" but P,O,I,N,T -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.

We cannot use I because it was x.

So we need a word without R,A,I,S,E.

Let me try ""cloud"": C,L,O,U,D -> includes U, which might not be common.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T -> I is eliminated.

""young"": Y,O,U,N,G -> has U and Y is not very common.

""crown"": C,R,O,W,N -> R is eliminated.

We must avoid R,A,I,S,E completely.

Consider the word ""mount"": M,O,U,N,T -> has U.

""bench"": B,E,N,C,H -> E is eliminated.

""lunch"": L,U,N,C,H -> U again.

We might have to accept using U or less common letters.

Another idea: ""could"" -> C,O,U,L,D -> still U.

Perhaps ""tonic"": T,O,N,I,C -> I is eliminated.

""topic"": T,O,P,I,C -> I eliminated.

We should avoid vowels? The only vowels left are O and U? And sometimes Y.

Vowels: Since E and A and I are eliminated, only O, U, and Y are possible for vowels.

But Y as vowel in ""hymn"" or ""crypt"".

It's challenging. Let's aim for words with O and possibly Y.

""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E eliminated.

""thong"": T,H,O,N,G -> that's T,H,O,N,G. None of R,A,I,S,E! Valid word?

""thong"" is a valid English word. Letters: T,H,O,N,G.

Alternatively, ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> letters M,O,N,T,H.

Which is better? ""thong"" and ""month"" both have T,H,O,N but one has G and the other M.

M is more common than G? Probably.

Another option: ""donut"" no, because U and S is out.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K -> B,L,O,C,K. L and O, C, K. That's good.

""block"": letters B,L,O,C,K. None are in the eliminated set R,A,I,S,E.

Is ""block"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common one: ""plump"" but P,L,U,M,P -> U and repeated P? ""plump"" has P twice? Wait, P,L,U,M,P — no, it's P,L,U,M,P? That can't be right. Word is ""PLUMP"" but it has 5 letters: P-L-U-M-P? Two P's? Only one P? Wait, let me check: P-L-U-M-P. That's 5 letters but P repeated? Actually, words can have repeated letters? But in our case, the secret word is 5 distinct? The rules don't specify distinct letters, but note that the feedback symbols handle duplicates.

In the rules, it says: ""Each letter in your guess"" can get different symbols. But the feedback doesn't mention anything about duplicates. For example, if secret has one L and you guess two L's, one might be correct or present.

But in this case, since our first guess had all unique letters, and feedback showed all absent, probably the secret word doesn't have duplicates? But we cannot be sure.

However, to be safe, we should assume that duplicates are possible, but since we have no evidence, we avoid duplicates to maximize information.

For our second guess, we want to test new letters, so avoid repeated letters if possible.

So ""block"": B (new), L (new), O (vowel), C (new), K (new). That tests 5 new letters without duplicates.

Similarly, ""thong"": T,H,O,N,G — five distinct new letters.

""month"": M,O,N,T,H — M,O,N,T,H — distinct.

Now, among these, which has the most common letters?

Common letters in English: T, N, O from our remaining set.

""month"": contains T,N,O — all common, plus M and H.

H is somewhat common.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K — O is common, but B,L,C,K are less common than T and N.

Thus, ""month"" seems better: T, N, O are very common.

Another choice could be ""clout"", but U is not ideal and C,L,O,U,T — U is less common than T,N.

So ""month"" is a good candidate.

But ""month"" does not use a Y or U. It sticks to more common consonants.

We can also consider ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G — letters Y,O,U,N,G. O and N are common but Y and U are less common.

So ""month"" appears superior.

Is there a word with Y? For example, ""horny"" — but H,O,R,N,Y — R is eliminated.

""downy"": D,O,W,N,Y — D,O,W,N,Y. Eliminated? R,A,I,S,E no. So D,O,W,N,Y are all new.

But W and Y are not as common as M and T? Wait, D,O,N are common.

Compare to ""month"": 

For ""month"": letters M,O,N,T,H — frequency: T high, O high, N high, M medium, H medium.

For ""downy"": D medium, O high, W medium, N high, Y medium-low.

So ""month"" has more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""pound"" — P,O,U,N,D — U, which is medium-low frequency.

Thus, ""month"" is a good choice.

We'll go with ""month"".

So guess ""month"".

Then we'll get feedback.

But note: If we guess ""month"" and we get feedback, we can deduce which letters are present.

In case the word has duplicates? But unlikely with these letters.

So let's choose ""month"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are present in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, I, S, E).

For the second guess, I need to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. Common consonants like T, N, O, L, C, H, M, D, P, B, and vowels like O, U, or Y are strong candidates. After considering options, ""month"" is ideal:
- Uses M, O, N, T, H—all new, untested letters.
- Includes high-frequency consonants (T, N) and the vowel O.
- Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters, ensuring efficient information gain.
- If the word contains O, N, T, M, or H, the feedback will help narrow possibilities significantly.

<guess>month</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: month -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) T(x) H(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""raise"" -> all letters absent: R, A, I, S, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""month"" -> M(x), O(✓), N(x), T(x), H(✓)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""month"" is M-O-N-T-H, so O is the second letter).
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since H is the fifth letter).
- M, N, T are absent from the word entirely.

So, we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The fifth letter is H.
- The word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters, so the pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] H

And letter1, letter3, letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: L, C, D, P, U, G, etc.

We know the positions for O and H, so we can try to fill the other positions.

But we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We should try a word that uses common consonants and perhaps a vowel if needed. The only vowels left are U and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). But we don't have A, E, I, so we might have U or Y as vowels.

Possible words:

- Could we have ""cough""? C O U G H -> but G is in position 4? Let's see: positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H. But we have H at position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if U and G are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.

But ""cough"" has U and G.

Similarly, ""dough"": D O U G H.

""rough"": R is eliminated, so no.

""tough"": T is eliminated, no.

""bough"": B O U G H.

But we don't know if U or G are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Another idea: ""locus"" but S is eliminated.

""focus"": F O C U S -> S eliminated.

""vouch"": V O U C H -> positions: 1:V, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:H. This could be a candidate.

But we have position 5 H, so it fits.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H.

""couch"": C O U C H -> has two C's? C-O-U-C-H, so C at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can have them.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters not in the eliminated set.

We also know that O and H are fixed at positions 2 and 5.

So the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters from B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Common letters: C, L, D, P, U, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to use a word that has U in position 3, since U is a common vowel and might be needed.

But we don't know if U is in the word.

Alternatively, we can use a word without U to test other letters.

But if we avoid U, we might have words like ""polyp"" but P O L Y P, and Y is at position 4, and H at 5? But ""polyp"" ends with P, not H.

We need the last letter to be H.

So words ending with ""O?H"" pattern.

Common endings: like ""ough"" as above, but we have O at 2 and H at 5, so the third and fourth letters are between.

For example, words like: cough, dough, tough, bough, rough, but rough has R eliminated, tough has T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough.

But we don't know if C, D, B, or G are in the word.

We could try ""gouge"" but ends with E, eliminated.

""lough"" - a word? L-O-U-G-H, meaning a lake, but not common.

""dough"" is common.

But we need to get information about other letters.

Since we have two positions fixed, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word that has different letters in positions 1,3,4 to test.

For example, ""vouch"": V O U C H

This tests V, U, C.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H

Or ""couch"": C O U C H, but has two C's, which might not be ideal for testing.

""bylaw"" but no H at end.

We need the pattern _ O _ _ H.

List of possible words ending with O?H:

- With O in second and H in fifth: so the word must be of the form ?O??H

Common words: 
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- rough (R O U G H) but R eliminated
- tough (T O U G H) but T eliminated
- lough (L O U G H) - less common
- sough (S O U G H) but S eliminated

So only cough, dough, bough are possible from common words? But we don't know if U and G are present.

We could try ""youth"" but Y O U T H -> T is eliminated, and position 4 is T, which is absent.

""youth"" has T, which is eliminated.

""booth"" B O O T H -> but O at position 2 and 3? Then position 3 is O, but we have O only at position 2? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple O's, but we don't know.

In ""month"", O was correct at position 2, but that doesn't prevent O from being elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""month"" had O(✓) meaning that O is in the word and in position 2, but it doesn't say if there are other O's. However, since we have no other information, we should not assume multiple O's.

But in the secret word, O might be only at position 2, or it might be elsewhere too? But in the feedback, for ""month"", we have O(✓) for position 2, and for other positions, we don't know.

But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""month"", we guessed O at position 2 and it was correct, so we know position 2 is O. We also know that if there were another O, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere. But since we have no evidence, we can assume for now that there is only one O, but it might not be true.

To be safe, we should consider the possibility of multiple O's, but for guessing, we can start with the common case.

But in the pattern, we have position 2 fixed as O, so for position 3 and 4, we can have other letters.

Back to the word list: we have cough, dough, bough as candidates, but we don't want to guess one of them directly because if it's wrong, we get less information.

We should guess a word that tests letters that are not in these, to narrow down.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we can eliminate more.

But we have to use the pattern: _ O _ _ H

So let's think of other words that fit this pattern.

For example:
- ""pooch"": P O O C H -> but O at position 3? Then position 3 is O, and position 4 is C, position 5 H. But we have O at position 2 and 3? Possible.

""pooch"" is P-O-O-C-H.

But we don't know if there is a double O.

Similarly, ""broth"" but B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""goth"" is 4 letters.

""moth"" M O T H -> M and T eliminated, and only 4 letters? M-O-T-H is 4, not 5.

5-letter words only.

""booth"" B O O T H -> T eliminated.

""sooth"" S O O T H -> S and T eliminated.

""tooth"" T O O T H -> T eliminated.

""woosh"" W O O S H -> S eliminated.

""push"" is 4 letters.

""bush"" is 4.

""cushy"" not ending with H.

Another word: ""lunch"" L U N C H -> N eliminated.

""punch"" P U N C H -> N eliminated.

""hunch"" H U N C H -> but position 1 is H, but we have H at position 5, and H might be only at 5? But we don't know.

""hunch"" has H at position 1 and 5, but we have H at position 5 correct, so if we guess ""hunch"", position 1 H might be present or not.

But we are not guessing ""hunch"" now.

We need a word with pattern ?O??H.

""vouch"" V O U C H

""pouch"" P O U C H

""couch"" C O U C H

""touch"" T O U C H -> T eliminated.

""mouch"" M O U C H -> M eliminated.

So only vouch, pouch, couch are possible without eliminated letters.

But we also have ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogah"" not a word.

""bogus"" not ending with H.

Perhaps ""loung"" not a word.

""dough"" is D O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

Similarly, ""cough"" C O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

U is not eliminated.

But we have many words with U and G.

To get more information, we could guess a word that doesn't have U, to see if U is present.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that doesn't have U?

For instance, ""booth"" has T and double O, but T eliminated.

""coach"" C O A C H -> A eliminated.

""poach"" P O A C H -> A eliminated.

""roach"" R O A C H -> R and A eliminated.

""loath"" L O A T H -> A and T eliminated.

""broth"" B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""gawky"" not ending with H.

""jolly"" not H.

It seems that most common words with ?O??H have U in position 3, like in the ""ough"" words.

There is ""bothy"" B O T H Y -> T eliminated and not H at end.

""comfy"" not H.

""dopey"" not H.

So it's hard to find a word without U.

Another possibility: ""koph"" not 5 letters.

""yodh"" not 5.

So perhaps U is very likely in position 3.

But we don't know.

We could guess a word that has U in a different position to test.

But in the pattern, position 3 is free, so we can put U there or not.

Since we have to use the pattern, we might as well include U to see if it's present.

But to maximize information, we should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

For example, in ""vouch"", we test V, U, C.

V is not very common.

In ""pouch"", we test P, U, C.

P and C are common.

In ""couch"", we test C, U, but C twice, so only two letters.

""couch"" has C at 1 and 4, so if C is not in the word, we get two x's, but if it is, we might get one or two marks.

But it's better to have distinct letters.

So ""pouch"" or ""vouch"".

""dough"" tests D, U, G.

G is common.

""bough"" tests B, U, G.

B is medium common.

""cough"" tests C, U, G.

C and G are common.

Among these, ""cough"" has C and G, both common.

But we also have ""lough"" which tests L, U, G.

L is very common.

So let's list the letters we can test:

- For position 1: we can use B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but U is better in position 3.

Typically, position 1 is a consonant.

Position 3 can be a vowel or consonant.

Position 4 is a consonant in these words.

So for position 1, we want to test a common consonant: like L, C, P, D, B, F, etc.

Position 3: likely U, but we can try other vowels? But the only vowel left is U or Y, and Y can be used.

For example, is there a word like ""goyim"" not H.

""boyla"" not.

So probably U is the only vowel possibility for position 3.

We can have Y in position 3 or 4.

For example, ""toyon"" not H.

""royal"" not H.

""payed"" not H.

It's difficult.

Another word: ""bylaw"" not H.

So let's accept that position 3 is likely U for common words.

Then position 4 can be G, C, etc.

So for our guess, we can choose ""pouch"" to test P, U, C.

Or ""cough"" to test C, U, G.

Or ""dough"" for D, U, G.

Since we have no information on these, we should choose one that has letters that are more common.

C is more common than P or D or G? Let's see letter frequencies.

In English, common consonants: T, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, M, F, etc. But we have eliminated T, N, S, R, M, and H is already placed.

Remaining: D, L, C, F, P, G, B, etc.

C is more common than D, P, G.

According to frequency, C is about 2.78%, D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D is more common than C, P, G.

D is 4.25%, L is 4.03%, C is 2.78%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D and L are more common.

But in ""dough"", we test D, U, G.

In ""cough"", C, U, G.

In ""lough"", L, U, G.

""lough"" is a valid word, meaning a lake or arm of the sea.

Similarly, ""cough"" and ""dough"" are common.

We also have ""bough"" with B, U, G.

B is 1.49%, less common.

So ""dough"" or ""lough"" might be better.

But ""lough"" is less common, but valid.

To be safe, let's use ""dough"" to test D and G.

But we also have U, which is common.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have U in position 3 to see if U is present, but as we saw, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""polyp"" not ending with H.

""lymph"" L Y M P H -> M eliminated.

""nymph"" N Y M P H -> N and M eliminated.

""wryly"" not H.

So no.

Perhaps ""gulph"" variant of gulf, not common.

So we might have to go with a word that has U.

But we can choose one that tests letters we are unsure of.

Since we have to make a guess, let's pick ""dough"" to test D and G.

Then, if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have position 1 and position 4 to consider.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 is U, position 4 is G.

If we guess ""dough"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like D(x or -), U(x or -), G(x or -).

But since O and H are fixed, we know they are correct.

So the feedback will be for D, U, G.

Similarly for other guesses.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the potential solution if possible, but we don't know.

Another thought: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and the eliminated letters.

Possible words: ?O??H with no R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T.

Letters available: B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But the word must be valid.

Common words:
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- lough (L O U G H)
- pouch (P O U C H)
- couch (C O U C H) - but double C
- vouch (V O U C H)
- gouge not H
- touch T eliminated
- etc.

Also, ""rough"" R eliminated, ""tough"" T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough, lough, pouch, couch, vouch.

Couch has two C's, so it might not be ideal.

Vouch has V, which is less common.

Lough is less common.

So the most common are cough, dough, bough, pouch.

Pouch has P and C.

Cough has C and G.

Dough has D and G.

Bough has B and G.

We can choose one that tests letters we want.

Since we have no information on C, D, G, P, etc., we can pick ""pouch"" to test P and C, as C is common.

Or ""cough"" for C and G.

But ""cough"" has C and G, both to test.

Similarly, ""pouch"" has P and C.

D has higher frequency, so ""dough"" might be better.

But let's see the position.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 U, position 4 G.

If we guess ""dough"", and the feedback shows:

- If D is in the word but wrong position, we get D(-)
- If U is in the word but wrong position, U(-), but U is at position 3, if it's not correct, it might be absent or elsewhere, but since we have no other U, it might be absent or present elsewhere.

But we don't have other positions for U yet.

Similarly for G.

To save guesses, we could guess a word that is likely, but we don't know.

Another idea: guess a word that has Y or other letters to test more.

For example, ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogic"" not H.

""comic"" not H.

So hard.

Perhaps ""fouth"" not a common word.

I think we have to choose from the list.

Let's pick ""cough"" as it is common and tests C and G.

So guess ""cough"".

Then we can see.

But ""cough"" is C O U G H.

Feedback will tell us about C, U, G.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we know which of C, U, G are in the word.

Similarly for other guesses.

Since we are at guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, it's ok.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more letters.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that has L or F or other common letters.

""lough"" has L, U, G.

""fouth"" is not common, meaning abundance, but rare.

""pough"" not a word.

""wough"" not.

So ""lough"" is an option.

L is common, so ""lough"" tests L, U, G.

Similarly, ""dough"" tests D, U, G.

D is more common than L? D 4.25%, L 4.03%, very close.

But in word games, L is very common.

I think ""dough"" or ""cough"" is fine.

Let's go with ""dough"".

So guess ""dough"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

From guess 2: O and H are correct at positions 2 and 5.

So in ""dough"", O and H will be correct, and we get feedback on D, U, G.

Similarly for any guess with O at 2 and H at 5.

So for guess 3, I'll choose ""dough"".

<guess>dough</guess>

But the user might expect the guess in the format.

In the previous, we had <guess>raise</guess> etc.

So for this, <guess>dough</guess>

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another word: ""bough"" is similar.

Or ""cough"".

But I think ""dough"" is good.

Perhaps ""pouch"" to test P and C, which are different.

But D is more common than P.

D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, so D is better.

So ""dough"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""raise""): All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent from the secret word.
- Guess 2 (""month""): O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5. M, N, and T are absent.

The secret word must:
- Be 5 letters long.
- Have O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter (pattern: _ O _ _ H).
- Exclude the letters R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T (since they are absent).
- Use only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to test common remaining letters (like D, U, G, C, L, P) while fitting the pattern. ""Dough"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (D O U G H) and tests three new common letters: D (high frequency), U (vowel), and G. This will provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

But maybe not everyone knows it.\n\n Since we need a valid English word, I\'ll pick ""RAISE"".\n\n Why ""RAISE""?

""RAISE"" includes frequent vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S), which helps test multiple positions efficiently without repeating letters.

Some other common letters are: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe want to maximize the information we get, so we include as many of these common letters as possible without repeating.\n\nLet me think of words without R,A,I,S,E.\n\nFor example: \n- ""count"": uses C, O, U, N, T -> but U may not be ideal since it appears less frequently.\n- ""donut"": D,O,N,U,T -> again has U.\n- ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> good letters?

The only vowels left are O and U? And sometimes Y.\n\nVowels: Since E and A and I are eliminated, only O, U, and Y are possible for vowels.\n\nBut Y as vowel in ""hymn"" or ""crypt"".\n\nIt\'s challenging. Let\'s aim for words with O and possibly Y.\n\n""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E eliminated.\n\n""thong"": T,H,O,N,G -> that\'s T,H,O,N,G. None of R,A,I,S,E! Valid word?\n\n""thong"" is a valid English word. Letters: T,H,O,N,G.\n\nAlternatively, ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> letters M,O,N,T,H.\n\nWhich is better? ""thong"" and ""month"" both have T,H,O,N but one has G and the other M.\n\nM is more common than G? Probably.\n\nAnother option: ""donut"" no, because U and S is out.\n\n""block"": B,L,O,C,K -> B,L,O,C,K. L and O, C, K. That\'s good.\n\n""block"": letters B,L,O,C,K. None are in the eliminated set R,A,I,S,E.\n\nIs ""block"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother common one: ""plump"" but P,L,U,M,P -> U and repeated P? ""plump"" has P twice? Wait, P,L,U,M,P — no, it\'s P,L,U,M,P? That can\'t be right. Word is ""PLUMP"" but it has 5 letters: P-L-U-M-P? Two P\'s? Only one P? Wait, let me check: P-L-U-M-P. That\'s 5 letters but P repeated? Actually, words can have repeated letters? But in our case, the secret word is 5 distinct? The rules don\'t specify distinct letters, but note that the feedback symbols handle duplicates.\n\nIn the rules, it says: ""Each letter in your guess"" can get different symbols. But the feedback doesn\'t mention anything about duplicates. For example, if secret has one L and you guess two L\'s, one might be correct or present.\n\nBut in this case, since our first guess had all unique letters, and feedback showed all absent, probably the secret word doesn\'t have duplicates? But we cannot be sure.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should assume that duplicates are possible, but since we have no evidence, we avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\nFor our second guess, we want to test new letters, so avoid repeated letters if possible.\n\nSo ""block"": B (new), L (new), O (vowel), C (new), K (new). That tests 5 new letters without duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""thong"": T,H,O,N,G — five distinct new letters.\n\n""month"": M,O,N,T,H — M,O,N,T,H — distinct.\n\nNow, among these, which has the most common letters?\n\nCommon letters in English: T, N, O from our remaining set.\n\n""month"": contains T,N,O — all common, plus M and H.\n\nH is somewhat common.\n\n""block"": B,L,O,C,K — O is common, but B,L,C,K are less common than T and N.\n\nThus, ""month"" seems better: T, N, O are very common.\n\nAnother choice could be ""clout"", but U is not ideal and C,L,O,U,T — U is less common than T,N.\n\nSo ""month"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut ""month"" does not use a Y or U. It sticks to more common consonants.\n\nWe can also consider ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G — letters Y,O,U,N,G. O and N are common but Y and U are less common.\n\nSo ""month"" appears superior.\n\nIs there a word with Y? For example, ""horny"" — but H,O,R,N,Y — R is eliminated.\n\n""downy"": D,O,W,N,Y — D,O,W,N,Y. Eliminated? R,A,I,S,E no. So D,O,W,N,Y are all new.\n\nBut W and Y are not as common as M and T? Wait, D,O,N are common.\n\nCompare to ""month"": \n\nFor ""month"": letters M,O,N,T,H — frequency: T high, O high, N high, M medium, H medium.\n\nFor ""downy"": D medium, O high, W medium, N high, Y medium-low.\n\nSo ""month"" has more high-frequency letters.\n\nAnother word: ""pound"" — P,O,U,N,D — U, which is medium-low frequency.\n\nThus, ""month"" is a good choice.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""month"".\n\nSo guess ""month"".\n\nThen we\'ll get feedback.\n\nBut note: If we guess ""month"" and we get feedback, we can deduce which letters are present.\n\nIn case the word has duplicates? But unlikely with these letters.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""month"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are present in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, I, S, E).\n\nFor the second guess, I need to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. Common consonants like T, N, O, L, C, H, M, D, P, B, and vowels like O, U, or Y are strong candidates. After considering options, ""month"" is ideal:\n- Uses M, O, N, T, H—all new, untested letters.\n- Includes high-frequency consonants (T, N) and the vowel O.\n- Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters, ensuring efficient information gain.\n- If the word contains O, N, T, M, or H, the feedback will help narrow possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>month</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: month -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) T(x) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can have them.\n\nHowever, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters not in the eliminated set.\n\nWe also know that O and H are fixed at positions 2 and 5.\n\nSo the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H\n\nWe need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters from B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we should avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nCommon letters: C, L, D, P, U, G, B, F, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has U in position 3, since U is a common vowel and might be needed.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word without U to test other letters.\n\nBut if we avoid U, we might have words like ""polyp"" but P O L Y P, and Y is at position 4, and H at 5? But ""polyp"" ends with P, not H.\n\nWe need the last letter to be H.\n\nSo words ending with ""O?H"" pattern.\n\nCommon endings: like ""ough"" as above, but we have O at 2 and H at 5, so the third and fourth letters are between.\n\nFor example, words like: cough, dough, tough, bough, rough, but rough has R eliminated, tough has T eliminated.\n\nSo possible: cough, dough, bough.\n\nBut we don\'t know if C, D, B, or G are in the word.\n\nWe could try ""gouge"" but ends with E, eliminated.\n\n""lough"" - a word? L-O-U-G-H, meaning a lake, but not common.\n\n""dough"" is common.\n\nBut we need to get information about other letters.\n\nSince we have two positions fixed, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has different letters in positions 1,3,4 to test.\n\nFor example, ""vouch"": V O U C H\n\nThis tests V, U, C.\n\nSimilarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H\n\nOr ""couch"": C O U C H, but has two C\'s, which might not be ideal for testing.\n\n""bylaw"" but no H at end.\n\nWe need the pattern _ O _ _ H.\n\nList of possible words ending with O?H:\n\n- With O in second and H in fifth: so the word must be of the form ?O??H\n\nCommon words: \n- cough (C O U G H)\n- dough (D O U G H)\n- bough (B O U G H)\n- rough (R O U G H) but R eliminated\n- tough (T O U G H) but T eliminated\n- lough (L O U G H) - less common\n- sough (S O U G H) but S eliminated\n\nSo only cough, dough, bough are possible from common words? But we don\'t know if U and G are present.\n\nWe could try ""youth"" but Y O U T H -> T is eliminated, and position 4 is T, which is absent.\n\n""youth"" has T, which is eliminated.\n\n""booth"" B O O T H -> but O at position 2 and 3? Then position 3 is O, but we have O only at position 2? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about multiple O\'s, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn ""month"", O was correct at position 2, but that doesn\'t prevent O from being elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""month"" had O(✓) meaning that O is in the word and in position 2, but it doesn\'t say if there are other O\'s. However, since we have no other information, we should not assume multiple O\'s.\n\nBut in the secret word, O might be only at position 2, or it might be elsewhere too? But in the feedback, for ""month"", we have O(✓) for position 2, and for other positions, we don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\nIn ""month"", we guessed O at position 2 and it was correct, so we know position 2 is O. We also know that if there were another O, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t guess it elsewhere. But since we have no evidence, we can assume for now that there is only one O, but it might not be true.\n\nTo be safe, we should consider the possibility of multiple O\'s, but for guessing, we can start with the common case.\n\nBut in the pattern, we have position 2 fixed as O, so for position 3 and 4, we can have other letters.\n\nBack to the word list: we have cough, dough, bough as candidates, but we don\'t want to guess one of them directly because if it\'s wrong, we get less information.\n\nWe should guess a word that tests letters that are not in these, to narrow down.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we can eliminate more.\n\nBut we have to use the pattern: _ O _ _ H\n\nSo let\'s think of other words that fit this pattern.\n\nFor example:\n- ""pooch"": P O O C H -> but O at position 3? Then position 3 is O, and position 4 is C, position 5 H. But we have O at position 2 and 3?

But the only vowel left is U or Y, and Y can be used.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""goyim"" not H.\n\n""boyla"" not.\n\nSo probably U is the only vowel possibility for position 3.\n\nWe can have Y in position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""toyon"" not H.\n\n""royal"" not H.\n\n""payed"" not H.\n\nIt\'s difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""bylaw"" not H.\n\nSo let\'s accept that position 3 is likely U for common words.\n\nThen position 4 can be G, C, etc.\n\nSo for our guess, we can choose ""pouch"" to test P, U, C.\n\nOr ""cough"" to test C, U, G.\n\nOr ""dough"" for D, U, G.\n\nSince we have no information on these, we should choose one that has letters that are more common.\n\nC is more common than P or D or G? Let\'s see letter frequencies.\n\nIn English, common consonants: T, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, M, F, etc. But we have eliminated T, N, S, R, M, and H is already placed.\n\nRemaining: D, L, C, F, P, G, B, etc.\n\nC is more common than D, P, G.\n\nAccording to frequency, C is about 2.78%, D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D is more common than C, P, G.\n\nD is 4.25%, L is 4.03%, C is 2.78%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D and L are more common.\n\nBut in ""dough"", we test D, U, G.\n\nIn ""cough"", C, U, G.\n\nIn ""lough"", L, U, G.\n\n""lough"" is a valid word, meaning a lake or arm of the sea.\n\nSimilarly, ""cough"" and ""dough"" are common.\n\nWe also have ""bough"" with B, U, G.\n\nB is 1.49%, less common.\n\nSo ""dough"" or ""lough"" might be better.\n\nBut ""lough"" is less common, but valid.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s use ""dough"" to test D and G.\n\nBut we also have U, which is common.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that doesn\'t have U in position 3 to see if U is present, but as we saw, it\'s hard to find such a word.\n\nFor example, ""polyp"" not ending with H.\n\n""lymph"" L Y M P H -> M eliminated.\n\n""nymph"" N Y M P H -> N and M eliminated.\n\n""wryly"" not H.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps ""gulph"" variant of gulf, not common.\n\nSo we might have to go with a word that has U.\n\nBut we can choose one that tests letters we are unsure of.\n\nSince we have to make a guess, let\'s pick ""dough"" to test D and G.\n\nThen, if we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut we also have position 1 and position 4 to consider.\n\nIn ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 is U, position 4 is G.\n\nIf we guess ""dough"", and it\'s not the word, we might get feedback like D(x or -), U(x or -), G(x or -).\n\nBut since O and H are fixed, we know they are correct.\n\nSo the feedback will be for D, U, G.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the potential solution if possible, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother thought: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and the eliminated letters.\n\nPossible words: ?O??H with no R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T.\n\nLetters available: B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut the word must be valid.\n\nCommon words:\n- cough (C O U G H)\n- dough (D O U G H)\n- bough (B O U G H)\n- lough (L O U G H)\n- pouch (P O U C H)\n- couch (C O U C H) - but double C\n- vouch (V O U C H)\n- gouge not H\n- touch T eliminated\n- etc.\n\nAlso, ""rough"" R eliminated, ""tough"" T eliminated.\n\nSo possible: cough, dough, bough, lough, pouch, couch, vouch.\n\nCouch has two C\'s, so it might not be ideal.\n\nVouch has V, which is less common.\n\nLough is less common.\n\nSo the most common are cough, dough, bough, pouch.\n\nPouch has P and C.\n\nCough has C and G.\n\nDough has D and G.\n\nBough has B and G.\n\nWe can choose one that tests letters we want.\n\nSince we have no information on C, D, G, P, etc., we can pick ""pouch"" to test P and C, as C is common.\n\nOr ""cough"" for C and G.\n\nBut ""cough"" has C and G, both to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""pouch"" has P and C.\n\nD has higher frequency, so ""dough"" might be better.\n\nBut let\'s see the position.\n\nIn ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 U, position 4 G.\n\nIf we guess ""dough"", and the feedback shows:\n\n- If D is in the word but wrong position, we get D(-)\n- If U is in the word but wrong position, U(-), but U is at position 3, if it\'s not correct, it might be absent or elsewhere, but since we have no other U, it might be absent or present elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t have other positions for U yet.\n\nSimilarly for G.\n\nTo save guesses, we could guess a word that is likely, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has Y or other letters to test more.\n\nFor example, ""youth"" but T eliminated.\n\n""yogic"" not H.\n\n""comic"" not H.\n\nSo hard.\n\nPerhaps ""fouth"" not a common word.\n\nI think we have to choose from the list.\n\nLet\'s pick ""cough"" as it is common and tests C and G.\n\nSo guess ""cough"".\n\nThen we can see.\n\nBut ""cough"" is C O U G H.\n\nFeedback will tell us about C, U, G.\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win.\n\nIf not, we know which of C, U, G are in the word.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nSince we are at guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, it\'s ok.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that tests more letters.\n\nFor example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that has L or F or other common letters.\n\n""lough"" has L, U, G.\n\n""fouth"" is not common, meaning abundance, but rare.\n\n""pough"" not a word.\n\n""wough"" not.\n\nSo ""lough"" is an option.\n\nL is common, so ""lough"" tests L, U, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""dough"" tests D, U, G.\n\nD is more common than L? D 4.25%, L 4.03%, very close.\n\nBut in word games, L is very common.\n\nI think ""dough"" or ""cough"" is fine.\n\nLet\'s go with ""dough"".\n\nSo guess ""dough"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we have.\n\nFrom guess 2: O and H are correct at positions 2 and 5.\n\nSo in ""dough"", O and H will be correct, and we get feedback on D, U, G.\n\nSimilarly for any guess with O at 2 and H at 5.\n\nSo for guess 3, I\'ll choose ""dough"".\n\n<guess>dough</guess>\n\nBut the user might expect the guess in the format.\n\nIn the previous, we had <guess>raise</guess> etc.\n\nSo for this, <guess>dough</guess>\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nAnother word: ""bough"" is similar.\n\nOr ""cough"".\n\nBut I think ""dough"" is good.\n\nPerhaps ""pouch"" to test P and C, which are different.\n\nBut D is more common than P.\n\nD is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, so D is better.\n\nSo ""dough"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1 (""raise""): All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent from the secret word.\n- Guess 2 (""month""): O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5.

Alright, I need to figure out the next guess based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me start by summarizing what we know so far.

The first guess was ""raise"" and all letters R, A, I, S, E got an ""x"", meaning none of them are in the secret word. 

Second guess was ""month"". Here's the breakdown:
- M: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

So we know the secret word has O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter. The pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Additionally, the letters M, N, T are also not in the word since they got an ""x"".

Third guess was ""dough"" with the feedback:
- D: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (already confirmed position 2)
- U: ✓ (present but wrong position? Wait, the symbol is ✓. Hmm... But the guess ""dough"" has U in position 3. Since it shows U(✓), that means U is correct and in the right position? Wait, but it's position 3.

Looking back at the rules: ✓ means ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.""

So for ""dough"", the U is position 3 and got a ✓. That means the third letter of the secret word is U!

Similarly, G in position 4 got a ✓, meaning the fourth letter is G.

And H was already known position 5.

So the feedback for ""dough"": D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓) tells us:
- D is absent
- O correct at position 2
- U now known to be correct at position 3
- G correct at position 4
- H correct at position 5

Therefore, the secret word is _ O U G H

Only the first letter is missing!

Putting it together, the word has:
- Second letter: O
- Third letter: U
- Fourth letter: G
- Fifth letter: H

Pattern: ? O U G H

Now, what could the first letter be?

Letters ruled out so far: From ""raise"" R,A,I,S,E all out. From ""month"" M,N,T out. From ""dough"" D is out.

Also, we know from previous guesses that R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D are not present.

So eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D

Remaining possibilities for the first letter: B,C,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

But at position 1, it needs to form a valid English word ending with OUGH.

Possible words ending with ""OUGH"":
- Could be ""BOUGH"" - a branch of a tree (valid word)
- ""COUGH"" - common word
- ""HOUGH"" - anatomical term, but might be rare
- ""LOUGH"" - Irish word for lake
- ""POUGH"" - not a valid word
- ""ROUGH"" - but R is eliminated
- ""TOUGH"" - T eliminated
- ""SOUGH"" - S eliminated
- ""DOUGH"" - already guessed, not correct
- ""FOUGH"" - not a word
- ""GOUGH"" - surname, might not be common
- Etc.

Given D is eliminated, ""dough"" isn't the word. R, T, S are out, so ""rough"", ""tough"", ""sough"" are invalid.

""Pough"" isn't a word. ""Yough"" isn't valid. ""Wough"" isn't likely.

That leaves:
- BOUGH
- COUGH
- HOUGH (less common but valid)
- LOUGH

However, HOUGH starts with H. But the word ends with H at position 5. Could H appear twice? Possible.

Similarly, G appears at position 4. Could G be elsewhere? In ""cough"", G is at position 4 only, ""bough"" same.

Now, we need to test the first letter.

Since most possibilities are B, C, H, L for the first letter, and we have six guesses, we can afford to test.

But ideally, we should guess one that covers more letters. However, since only one position is unknown, any valid word will reveal the answer.

But to play efficiently, we could guess ""cough"" to test C at position 1.

Similarly, ""bough"" tests B.

Since ""ough"" rhymes and common words known are cough, bough, dough (eliminated), etc.

Perhaps less common words exist, but we focus on possible ones.

Also, from eliminated letters, F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z haven't been tested, but words starting with them ending OUGH are unlikely or rare.

So likely candidates: BOUGH, COUGH.

Others possible but less common: HOUGH, LOUGH.

Given H and L are common letters, but H is already at position 5? Could H be at position 1 and 5? Duplicates allowed unless ruled out.

In previous feedback, is letter duplication an issue?

For example, in ""month"", if the word had multiple O's, but we didn't guess extra O, so we didn't know.

Similarly here, the secret word could have multiple H's or G's.

But in ""dough"", G was position 4 and marked ✓, but we don't know if G is elsewhere.

However, since position 4 is G, and for the first position, if we have BOUGH or others, the letters are different.

To confirm, since ""dough"" had U(✓) at position 3, G(✓) at 4, H(✓) at 5, only position 1 needs filling.

Possible words:
- BOUGH: B O U G H
- COUGH: C O U G H
- HOUGH: H O U G H (assuming H appears twice)
- LOUGH: L O U G H

Are there others? ""GOUGH"" - surname as in Matthew Gough, but might not be acceptable as common word.

Similarly, KOUGH? Probably not.

Let's check valid words.

Now, since we need to guess, we can choose ""bough"" to test B.

Or ""cough"" for C.

But ""rough"" is out due to R eliminated.

Same with tough, dough, sough already covered.

Since D is out, dough was guess 3 and not correct.

Now, feedback shows D(x), so ""dough"" isn't correct.

Therefore, among valid words, bough or cough are most likely.

We haven't tested C or B.

Therefore, guessing ""cough"" would be sensible. If correct, we win. If not, we know C is absent and can guess ""bough"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""bough"" and it's wrong, then B is absent.

So let's choose ""cough"" as the guess.

Thus, guess 4: ""cough""

So now, putting this into the response format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: R, A, I, S, E are all absent (x). None of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""month"")**: O is correct and in position 2 (✓), H is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, N, T are all absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (""dough"")**: 
  - D is absent (x).
  - O is confirmed correct in position 2 (✓).
  - U is correct and in position 3 (✓).
  - G is correct and in position 4 (✓).
  - H is confirmed correct in position 5 (✓).

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word must have the pattern: `_ O U G H` (second letter O, third letter U, fourth letter G, fifth letter H).
- Only the first letter remains unknown.
- Eliminated letters (all absent): R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T, D.
- Possible candidates for the first letter (from remaining letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) must form a valid English word with the pattern `?OUGH`.
- Likely valid words:
  - **COUGH**: Checks C (common untested consonant). 
  - **BOUGH**: Checks B (medium-frequency letter).
  - **HOUGH** (less common but valid anatomical term): Checks H, which could potentially duplicate since H is already confirmed at position 5.
  - **LOUGH** (Irish term for lake): Checks L (high-frequency letter).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only one position (first letter) is unknown, so testing any of the likely words will resolve the game soon.
- Since we have three remaining guesses, efficiency is achievable by testing the most common candidate, **""cough""**:
  - It tests C (a high-frequency consonant) which hasn't been evaluated.
  - If ""cough"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm C's absence, narrowing possibilities to ""bough"" or less common words like ""hough"" or ""lough"".
  - Guessing ""cough"" is low-risk because it directly addresses the most probable solution while leveraging English word patterns (common ""-ough"" endings).

If ""cough"" is correct, the game ends; if not, we eliminate C and can proceed with ""bough"" next. 

<guess>cough</guess>",cough,"Alright, I need to figure out the next guess based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me start by summarizing what we know so far.

The first guess was ""raise"" and all letters R, A, I, S, E got an ""x"", meaning none of them are in the secret word. 

Second guess was ""month"". Here's the breakdown:
- M: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

So we know the secret word has O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter. The pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Additionally, the letters M, N, T are also not in the word since they got an ""x"".

Third guess was ""dough"" with the feedback:
- D: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (already confirmed position 2)
- U: ✓ (present but wrong position? Wait, the symbol is ✓. Hmm... But the guess ""dough"" has U in position 3. Since it shows U(✓), that means U is correct and in the right position? Wait, but it's position 3.

Looking back at the rules: ✓ means ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.""

So for ""dough"", the U is position 3 and got a ✓. That means the third letter of the secret word is U!

Similarly, G in position 4 got a ✓, meaning the fourth letter is G.

And H was already known position 5.

So the feedback for ""dough"": D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓) tells us:
- D is absent
- O correct at position 2
- U now known to be correct at position 3
- G correct at position 4
- H correct at position 5

Therefore, the secret word is _ O U G H

Only the first letter is missing!

Putting it together, the word has:
- Second letter: O
- Third letter: U
- Fourth letter: G
- Fifth letter: H

Pattern: ? O U G H

Now, what could the first letter be?

Letters ruled out so far: From ""raise"" R,A,I,S,E all out. From ""month"" M,N,T out. From ""dough"" D is out.

Also, we know from previous guesses that R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D are not present.

So eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D

Remaining possibilities for the first letter: B,C,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

But at position 1, it needs to form a valid English word ending with OUGH.

Possible words ending with ""OUGH"":
- Could be ""BOUGH"" - a branch of a tree (valid word)
- ""COUGH"" - common word
- ""HOUGH"" - anatomical term, but might be rare
- ""LOUGH"" - Irish word for lake
- ""POUGH"" - not a valid word
- ""ROUGH"" - but R is eliminated
- ""TOUGH"" - T eliminated
- ""SOUGH"" - S eliminated
- ""DOUGH"" - already guessed, not correct
- ""FOUGH"" - not a word
- ""GOUGH"" - surname, might not be common
- Etc.

Given D is eliminated, ""dough"" isn't the word. R, T, S are out, so ""rough"", ""tough"", ""sough"" are invalid.

""Pough"" isn't a word. ""Yough"" isn't valid. ""Wough"" isn't likely.

That leaves:
- BOUGH
- COUGH
- HOUGH (less common but valid)
- LOUGH

However, HOUGH starts with H. But the word ends with H at position 5. Could H appear twice? Possible.

Similarly, G appears at position 4. Could G be elsewhere? In ""cough"", G is at position 4 only, ""bough"" same.

Now, we need to test the first letter.

Since most possibilities are B, C, H, L for the first letter, and we have six guesses, we can afford to test.

But ideally, we should guess one that covers more letters. However, since only one position is unknown, any valid word will reveal the answer.

But to play efficiently, we could guess ""cough"" to test C at position 1.

Similarly, ""bough"" tests B.

Since ""ough"" rhymes and common words known are cough, bough, dough (eliminated), etc.

Perhaps less common words exist, but we focus on possible ones.

Also, from eliminated letters, F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z haven't been tested, but words starting with them ending OUGH are unlikely or rare.

So likely candidates: BOUGH, COUGH.

Others possible but less common: HOUGH, LOUGH.

Given H and L are common letters, but H is already at position 5? Could H be at position 1 and 5? Duplicates allowed unless ruled out.

In previous feedback, is letter duplication an issue?

For example, in ""month"", if the word had multiple O's, but we didn't guess extra O, so we didn't know.

Similarly here, the secret word could have multiple H's or G's.

But in ""dough"", G was position 4 and marked ✓, but we don't know if G is elsewhere.

However, since position 4 is G, and for the first position, if we have BOUGH or others, the letters are different.

To confirm, since ""dough"" had U(✓) at position 3, G(✓) at 4, H(✓) at 5, only position 1 needs filling.

Possible words:
- BOUGH: B O U G H
- COUGH: C O U G H
- HOUGH: H O U G H (assuming H appears twice)
- LOUGH: L O U G H

Are there others? ""GOUGH"" - surname as in Matthew Gough, but might not be acceptable as common word.

Similarly, KOUGH? Probably not.

Let's check valid words.

Now, since we need to guess, we can choose ""bough"" to test B.

Or ""cough"" for C.

But ""rough"" is out due to R eliminated.

Same with tough, dough, sough already covered.

Since D is out, dough was guess 3 and not correct.

Now, feedback shows D(x), so ""dough"" isn't correct.

Therefore, among valid words, bough or cough are most likely.

We haven't tested C or B.

Therefore, guessing ""cough"" would be sensible. If correct, we win. If not, we know C is absent and can guess ""bough"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""bough"" and it's wrong, then B is absent.

So let's choose ""cough"" as the guess.

Thus, guess 4: ""cough""

So now, putting this into the response format.Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: R, A, I, S, E are all absent (x). None of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""month"")**: O is correct and in position 2 (✓), H is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, N, T are all absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (""dough"")**: 
  - D is absent (x).
  - O is confirmed correct in position 2 (✓).
  - U is correct and in position 3 (✓).
  - G is correct and in position 4 (✓).
  - H is confirmed correct in position 5 (✓).

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word must have the pattern: `_ O U G H` (second letter O, third letter U, fourth letter G, fifth letter H).
- Only the first letter remains unknown.
- Eliminated letters (all absent): R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T, D.
- Possible candidates for the first letter (from remaining letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) must form a valid English word with the pattern `?OUGH`.
- Likely valid words:
  - **COUGH**: Checks C (common untested consonant). 
  - **BOUGH**: Checks B (medium-frequency letter).
  - **HOUGH** (less common but valid anatomical term): Checks H, which could potentially duplicate since H is already confirmed at position 5.
  - **LOUGH** (Irish term for lake): Checks L (high-frequency letter).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only one position (first letter) is unknown, so testing any of the likely words will resolve the game soon.
- Since we have three remaining guesses, efficiency is achievable by testing the most common candidate, **""cough""**:
  - It tests C (a high-frequency consonant) which hasn't been evaluated.
  - If ""cough"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm C's absence, narrowing possibilities to ""bough"" or less common words like ""hough"" or ""lough"".
  - Guessing ""cough"" is low-risk because it directly addresses the most probable solution while leveraging English word patterns (common ""-ough"" endings).

If ""cough"" is correct, the game ends; if not, we eliminate C and can proceed with ""bough"" next.",Guess 4: cough -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a word that gives me good information.
 Common wisdom in Wordle is to start with a word that has a mix of common consonants and vowels, and no repeating letters.
 I will choose a word that has common letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, etc.
 Let me pick ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E' — common letters.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so I'll pick something different for maximum information.

 Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". But let me think about feedback: I want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that covers five common letters? But maybe not everyone knows it.

 Since we need a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Why ""RAISE""? It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E being one of the most common vowels). Actually, E is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" — common and hits two vowels and three consonants.

 Note: We are allowed to choose any valid word. Let me choose ""RAISE"".

 After this, we get feedback and can adjust.

 For the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".Starting with a word that uses common letters to maximize potential feedback is a solid strategy. ""RAISE"" includes frequent vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S), which helps test multiple positions efficiently without repeating letters. This should provide useful information about which letters are present and their possible positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"": R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: R, A, I, S, E.

Since it's the second guess, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't include R, A, I, S, or E.

We should look for common letters that were not in the first guess. Some other common letters are: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information we get, so we include as many of these common letters as possible without repeating.

Let me think of words without R,A,I,S,E.

For example: 
- ""count"": uses C, O, U, N, T -> but U may not be ideal since it appears less frequently.
- ""donut"": D,O,N,U,T -> again has U.
- ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> good letters? M, O, N, T, H.

Alternatively, ""lotus"" has L,O,T,U,S -> but S is eliminated.

Since S is out, we avoid S.

Another word: ""point"" but P,O,I,N,T -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.

We cannot use I because it was x.

So we need a word without R,A,I,S,E.

Let me try ""cloud"": C,L,O,U,D -> includes U, which might not be common.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T -> I is eliminated.

""young"": Y,O,U,N,G -> has U and Y is not very common.

""crown"": C,R,O,W,N -> R is eliminated.

We must avoid R,A,I,S,E completely.

Consider the word ""mount"": M,O,U,N,T -> has U.

""bench"": B,E,N,C,H -> E is eliminated.

""lunch"": L,U,N,C,H -> U again.

We might have to accept using U or less common letters.

Another idea: ""could"" -> C,O,U,L,D -> still U.

Perhaps ""tonic"": T,O,N,I,C -> I is eliminated.

""topic"": T,O,P,I,C -> I eliminated.

We should avoid vowels? The only vowels left are O and U? And sometimes Y.

Vowels: Since E and A and I are eliminated, only O, U, and Y are possible for vowels.

But Y as vowel in ""hymn"" or ""crypt"".

It's challenging. Let's aim for words with O and possibly Y.

""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E eliminated.

""thong"": T,H,O,N,G -> that's T,H,O,N,G. None of R,A,I,S,E! Valid word?

""thong"" is a valid English word. Letters: T,H,O,N,G.

Alternatively, ""month"": M,O,N,T,H -> letters M,O,N,T,H.

Which is better? ""thong"" and ""month"" both have T,H,O,N but one has G and the other M.

M is more common than G? Probably.

Another option: ""donut"" no, because U and S is out.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K -> B,L,O,C,K. L and O, C, K. That's good.

""block"": letters B,L,O,C,K. None are in the eliminated set R,A,I,S,E.

Is ""block"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common one: ""plump"" but P,L,U,M,P -> U and repeated P? ""plump"" has P twice? Wait, P,L,U,M,P — no, it's P,L,U,M,P? That can't be right. Word is ""PLUMP"" but it has 5 letters: P-L-U-M-P? Two P's? Only one P? Wait, let me check: P-L-U-M-P. That's 5 letters but P repeated? Actually, words can have repeated letters? But in our case, the secret word is 5 distinct? The rules don't specify distinct letters, but note that the feedback symbols handle duplicates.

In the rules, it says: ""Each letter in your guess"" can get different symbols. But the feedback doesn't mention anything about duplicates. For example, if secret has one L and you guess two L's, one might be correct or present.

But in this case, since our first guess had all unique letters, and feedback showed all absent, probably the secret word doesn't have duplicates? But we cannot be sure.

However, to be safe, we should assume that duplicates are possible, but since we have no evidence, we avoid duplicates to maximize information.

For our second guess, we want to test new letters, so avoid repeated letters if possible.

So ""block"": B (new), L (new), O (vowel), C (new), K (new). That tests 5 new letters without duplicates.

Similarly, ""thong"": T,H,O,N,G — five distinct new letters.

""month"": M,O,N,T,H — M,O,N,T,H — distinct.

Now, among these, which has the most common letters?

Common letters in English: T, N, O from our remaining set.

""month"": contains T,N,O — all common, plus M and H.

H is somewhat common.

""block"": B,L,O,C,K — O is common, but B,L,C,K are less common than T and N.

Thus, ""month"" seems better: T, N, O are very common.

Another choice could be ""clout"", but U is not ideal and C,L,O,U,T — U is less common than T,N.

So ""month"" is a good candidate.

But ""month"" does not use a Y or U. It sticks to more common consonants.

We can also consider ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G — letters Y,O,U,N,G. O and N are common but Y and U are less common.

So ""month"" appears superior.

Is there a word with Y? For example, ""horny"" — but H,O,R,N,Y — R is eliminated.

""downy"": D,O,W,N,Y — D,O,W,N,Y. Eliminated? R,A,I,S,E no. So D,O,W,N,Y are all new.

But W and Y are not as common as M and T? Wait, D,O,N are common.

Compare to ""month"": 

For ""month"": letters M,O,N,T,H — frequency: T high, O high, N high, M medium, H medium.

For ""downy"": D medium, O high, W medium, N high, Y medium-low.

So ""month"" has more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""pound"" — P,O,U,N,D — U, which is medium-low frequency.

Thus, ""month"" is a good choice.

We'll go with ""month"".

So guess ""month"".

Then we'll get feedback.

But note: If we guess ""month"" and we get feedback, we can deduce which letters are present.

In case the word has duplicates? But unlikely with these letters.

So let's choose ""month"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are present in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, I, S, E).

For the second guess, I need to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. Common consonants like T, N, O, L, C, H, M, D, P, B, and vowels like O, U, or Y are strong candidates. After considering options, ""month"" is ideal:
- Uses M, O, N, T, H—all new, untested letters.
- Includes high-frequency consonants (T, N) and the vowel O.
- Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters, ensuring efficient information gain.
- If the word contains O, N, T, M, or H, the feedback will help narrow possibilities significantly.

<guess>month</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: month -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) T(x) H(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""raise"" -> all letters absent: R, A, I, S, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""month"" -> M(x), O(✓), N(x), T(x), H(✓)

This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""month"" is M-O-N-T-H, so O is the second letter).
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since H is the fifth letter).
- M, N, T are absent from the word entirely.

So, we know:
- The second letter is O.
- The fifth letter is H.
- The word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters, so the pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] H

And letter1, letter3, letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: L, C, D, P, U, G, etc.

We know the positions for O and H, so we can try to fill the other positions.

But we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We should try a word that uses common consonants and perhaps a vowel if needed. The only vowels left are U and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). But we don't have A, E, I, so we might have U or Y as vowels.

Possible words:

- Could we have ""cough""? C O U G H -> but G is in position 4? Let's see: positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H. But we have H at position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if U and G are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.

But ""cough"" has U and G.

Similarly, ""dough"": D O U G H.

""rough"": R is eliminated, so no.

""tough"": T is eliminated, no.

""bough"": B O U G H.

But we don't know if U or G are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Another idea: ""locus"" but S is eliminated.

""focus"": F O C U S -> S eliminated.

""vouch"": V O U C H -> positions: 1:V, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:H. This could be a candidate.

But we have position 5 H, so it fits.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H.

""couch"": C O U C H -> has two C's? C-O-U-C-H, so C at position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can have them.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters not in the eliminated set.

We also know that O and H are fixed at positions 2 and 5.

So the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters from B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we should avoid using too many rare letters.

Common letters: C, L, D, P, U, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to use a word that has U in position 3, since U is a common vowel and might be needed.

But we don't know if U is in the word.

Alternatively, we can use a word without U to test other letters.

But if we avoid U, we might have words like ""polyp"" but P O L Y P, and Y is at position 4, and H at 5? But ""polyp"" ends with P, not H.

We need the last letter to be H.

So words ending with ""O?H"" pattern.

Common endings: like ""ough"" as above, but we have O at 2 and H at 5, so the third and fourth letters are between.

For example, words like: cough, dough, tough, bough, rough, but rough has R eliminated, tough has T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough.

But we don't know if C, D, B, or G are in the word.

We could try ""gouge"" but ends with E, eliminated.

""lough"" - a word? L-O-U-G-H, meaning a lake, but not common.

""dough"" is common.

But we need to get information about other letters.

Since we have two positions fixed, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word that has different letters in positions 1,3,4 to test.

For example, ""vouch"": V O U C H

This tests V, U, C.

Similarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H

Or ""couch"": C O U C H, but has two C's, which might not be ideal for testing.

""bylaw"" but no H at end.

We need the pattern _ O _ _ H.

List of possible words ending with O?H:

- With O in second and H in fifth: so the word must be of the form ?O??H

Common words: 
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- rough (R O U G H) but R eliminated
- tough (T O U G H) but T eliminated
- lough (L O U G H) - less common
- sough (S O U G H) but S eliminated

So only cough, dough, bough are possible from common words? But we don't know if U and G are present.

We could try ""youth"" but Y O U T H -> T is eliminated, and position 4 is T, which is absent.

""youth"" has T, which is eliminated.

""booth"" B O O T H -> but O at position 2 and 3? Then position 3 is O, but we have O only at position 2? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple O's, but we don't know.

In ""month"", O was correct at position 2, but that doesn't prevent O from being elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""month"" had O(✓) meaning that O is in the word and in position 2, but it doesn't say if there are other O's. However, since we have no other information, we should not assume multiple O's.

But in the secret word, O might be only at position 2, or it might be elsewhere too? But in the feedback, for ""month"", we have O(✓) for position 2, and for other positions, we don't know.

But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

In ""month"", we guessed O at position 2 and it was correct, so we know position 2 is O. We also know that if there were another O, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere. But since we have no evidence, we can assume for now that there is only one O, but it might not be true.

To be safe, we should consider the possibility of multiple O's, but for guessing, we can start with the common case.

But in the pattern, we have position 2 fixed as O, so for position 3 and 4, we can have other letters.

Back to the word list: we have cough, dough, bough as candidates, but we don't want to guess one of them directly because if it's wrong, we get less information.

We should guess a word that tests letters that are not in these, to narrow down.

For example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we can eliminate more.

But we have to use the pattern: _ O _ _ H

So let's think of other words that fit this pattern.

For example:
- ""pooch"": P O O C H -> but O at position 3? Then position 3 is O, and position 4 is C, position 5 H. But we have O at position 2 and 3? Possible.

""pooch"" is P-O-O-C-H.

But we don't know if there is a double O.

Similarly, ""broth"" but B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""goth"" is 4 letters.

""moth"" M O T H -> M and T eliminated, and only 4 letters? M-O-T-H is 4, not 5.

5-letter words only.

""booth"" B O O T H -> T eliminated.

""sooth"" S O O T H -> S and T eliminated.

""tooth"" T O O T H -> T eliminated.

""woosh"" W O O S H -> S eliminated.

""push"" is 4 letters.

""bush"" is 4.

""cushy"" not ending with H.

Another word: ""lunch"" L U N C H -> N eliminated.

""punch"" P U N C H -> N eliminated.

""hunch"" H U N C H -> but position 1 is H, but we have H at position 5, and H might be only at 5? But we don't know.

""hunch"" has H at position 1 and 5, but we have H at position 5 correct, so if we guess ""hunch"", position 1 H might be present or not.

But we are not guessing ""hunch"" now.

We need a word with pattern ?O??H.

""vouch"" V O U C H

""pouch"" P O U C H

""couch"" C O U C H

""touch"" T O U C H -> T eliminated.

""mouch"" M O U C H -> M eliminated.

So only vouch, pouch, couch are possible without eliminated letters.

But we also have ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogah"" not a word.

""bogus"" not ending with H.

Perhaps ""loung"" not a word.

""dough"" is D O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

Similarly, ""cough"" C O U G H.

G is not eliminated.

U is not eliminated.

But we have many words with U and G.

To get more information, we could guess a word that doesn't have U, to see if U is present.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that doesn't have U?

For instance, ""booth"" has T and double O, but T eliminated.

""coach"" C O A C H -> A eliminated.

""poach"" P O A C H -> A eliminated.

""roach"" R O A C H -> R and A eliminated.

""loath"" L O A T H -> A and T eliminated.

""broth"" B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.

""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.

""gawky"" not ending with H.

""jolly"" not H.

It seems that most common words with ?O??H have U in position 3, like in the ""ough"" words.

There is ""bothy"" B O T H Y -> T eliminated and not H at end.

""comfy"" not H.

""dopey"" not H.

So it's hard to find a word without U.

Another possibility: ""koph"" not 5 letters.

""yodh"" not 5.

So perhaps U is very likely in position 3.

But we don't know.

We could guess a word that has U in a different position to test.

But in the pattern, position 3 is free, so we can put U there or not.

Since we have to use the pattern, we might as well include U to see if it's present.

But to maximize information, we should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.

For example, in ""vouch"", we test V, U, C.

V is not very common.

In ""pouch"", we test P, U, C.

P and C are common.

In ""couch"", we test C, U, but C twice, so only two letters.

""couch"" has C at 1 and 4, so if C is not in the word, we get two x's, but if it is, we might get one or two marks.

But it's better to have distinct letters.

So ""pouch"" or ""vouch"".

""dough"" tests D, U, G.

G is common.

""bough"" tests B, U, G.

B is medium common.

""cough"" tests C, U, G.

C and G are common.

Among these, ""cough"" has C and G, both common.

But we also have ""lough"" which tests L, U, G.

L is very common.

So let's list the letters we can test:

- For position 1: we can use B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but U is better in position 3.

Typically, position 1 is a consonant.

Position 3 can be a vowel or consonant.

Position 4 is a consonant in these words.

So for position 1, we want to test a common consonant: like L, C, P, D, B, F, etc.

Position 3: likely U, but we can try other vowels? But the only vowel left is U or Y, and Y can be used.

For example, is there a word like ""goyim"" not H.

""boyla"" not.

So probably U is the only vowel possibility for position 3.

We can have Y in position 3 or 4.

For example, ""toyon"" not H.

""royal"" not H.

""payed"" not H.

It's difficult.

Another word: ""bylaw"" not H.

So let's accept that position 3 is likely U for common words.

Then position 4 can be G, C, etc.

So for our guess, we can choose ""pouch"" to test P, U, C.

Or ""cough"" to test C, U, G.

Or ""dough"" for D, U, G.

Since we have no information on these, we should choose one that has letters that are more common.

C is more common than P or D or G? Let's see letter frequencies.

In English, common consonants: T, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, M, F, etc. But we have eliminated T, N, S, R, M, and H is already placed.

Remaining: D, L, C, F, P, G, B, etc.

C is more common than D, P, G.

According to frequency, C is about 2.78%, D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D is more common than C, P, G.

D is 4.25%, L is 4.03%, C is 2.78%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D and L are more common.

But in ""dough"", we test D, U, G.

In ""cough"", C, U, G.

In ""lough"", L, U, G.

""lough"" is a valid word, meaning a lake or arm of the sea.

Similarly, ""cough"" and ""dough"" are common.

We also have ""bough"" with B, U, G.

B is 1.49%, less common.

So ""dough"" or ""lough"" might be better.

But ""lough"" is less common, but valid.

To be safe, let's use ""dough"" to test D and G.

But we also have U, which is common.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have U in position 3 to see if U is present, but as we saw, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""polyp"" not ending with H.

""lymph"" L Y M P H -> M eliminated.

""nymph"" N Y M P H -> N and M eliminated.

""wryly"" not H.

So no.

Perhaps ""gulph"" variant of gulf, not common.

So we might have to go with a word that has U.

But we can choose one that tests letters we are unsure of.

Since we have to make a guess, let's pick ""dough"" to test D and G.

Then, if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have position 1 and position 4 to consider.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 is U, position 4 is G.

If we guess ""dough"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like D(x or -), U(x or -), G(x or -).

But since O and H are fixed, we know they are correct.

So the feedback will be for D, U, G.

Similarly for other guesses.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the potential solution if possible, but we don't know.

Another thought: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and the eliminated letters.

Possible words: ?O??H with no R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T.

Letters available: B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But the word must be valid.

Common words:
- cough (C O U G H)
- dough (D O U G H)
- bough (B O U G H)
- lough (L O U G H)
- pouch (P O U C H)
- couch (C O U C H) - but double C
- vouch (V O U C H)
- gouge not H
- touch T eliminated
- etc.

Also, ""rough"" R eliminated, ""tough"" T eliminated.

So possible: cough, dough, bough, lough, pouch, couch, vouch.

Couch has two C's, so it might not be ideal.

Vouch has V, which is less common.

Lough is less common.

So the most common are cough, dough, bough, pouch.

Pouch has P and C.

Cough has C and G.

Dough has D and G.

Bough has B and G.

We can choose one that tests letters we want.

Since we have no information on C, D, G, P, etc., we can pick ""pouch"" to test P and C, as C is common.

Or ""cough"" for C and G.

But ""cough"" has C and G, both to test.

Similarly, ""pouch"" has P and C.

D has higher frequency, so ""dough"" might be better.

But let's see the position.

In ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 U, position 4 G.

If we guess ""dough"", and the feedback shows:

- If D is in the word but wrong position, we get D(-)
- If U is in the word but wrong position, U(-), but U is at position 3, if it's not correct, it might be absent or elsewhere, but since we have no other U, it might be absent or present elsewhere.

But we don't have other positions for U yet.

Similarly for G.

To save guesses, we could guess a word that is likely, but we don't know.

Another idea: guess a word that has Y or other letters to test more.

For example, ""youth"" but T eliminated.

""yogic"" not H.

""comic"" not H.

So hard.

Perhaps ""fouth"" not a common word.

I think we have to choose from the list.

Let's pick ""cough"" as it is common and tests C and G.

So guess ""cough"".

Then we can see.

But ""cough"" is C O U G H.

Feedback will tell us about C, U, G.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we know which of C, U, G are in the word.

Similarly for other guesses.

Since we are at guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, it's ok.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more letters.

For example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that has L or F or other common letters.

""lough"" has L, U, G.

""fouth"" is not common, meaning abundance, but rare.

""pough"" not a word.

""wough"" not.

So ""lough"" is an option.

L is common, so ""lough"" tests L, U, G.

Similarly, ""dough"" tests D, U, G.

D is more common than L? D 4.25%, L 4.03%, very close.

But in word games, L is very common.

I think ""dough"" or ""cough"" is fine.

Let's go with ""dough"".

So guess ""dough"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

From guess 2: O and H are correct at positions 2 and 5.

So in ""dough"", O and H will be correct, and we get feedback on D, U, G.

Similarly for any guess with O at 2 and H at 5.

So for guess 3, I'll choose ""dough"".

<guess>dough</guess>

But the user might expect the guess in the format.

In the previous, we had <guess>raise</guess> etc.

So for this, <guess>dough</guess>

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another word: ""bough"" is similar.

Or ""cough"".

But I think ""dough"" is good.

Perhaps ""pouch"" to test P and C, which are different.

But D is more common than P.

D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, so D is better.

So ""dough"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""raise""): All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent from the secret word.
- Guess 2 (""month""): O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5. M, N, and T are absent.

The secret word must:
- Be 5 letters long.
- Have O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter (pattern: _ O _ _ H).
- Exclude the letters R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T (since they are absent).
- Use only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to test common remaining letters (like D, U, G, C, L, P) while fitting the pattern. ""Dough"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (D O U G H) and tests three new common letters: D (high frequency), U (vowel), and G. This will provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>dough</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: month -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) T(x) H(✓)
Guess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, I need to figure out the next guess based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me start by summarizing what we know so far.

The first guess was ""raise"" and all letters R, A, I, S, E got an ""x"", meaning none of them are in the secret word. 

Second guess was ""month"". Here's the breakdown:
- M: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

So we know the secret word has O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter. The pattern is: _ O _ _ H

Additionally, the letters M, N, T are also not in the word since they got an ""x"".

Third guess was ""dough"" with the feedback:
- D: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (already confirmed position 2)
- U: ✓ (present but wrong position? Wait, the symbol is ✓. Hmm... But the guess ""dough"" has U in position 3. Since it shows U(✓), that means U is correct and in the right position? Wait, but it's position 3.

Looking back at the rules: ✓ means ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.""

So for ""dough"", the U is position 3 and got a ✓. That means the third letter of the secret word is U!

Similarly, G in position 4 got a ✓, meaning the fourth letter is G.

And H was already known position 5.

So the feedback for ""dough"": D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓) tells us:
- D is absent
- O correct at position 2
- U now known to be correct at position 3
- G correct at position 4
- H correct at position 5

Therefore, the secret word is _ O U G H

Only the first letter is missing!

Putting it together, the word has:
- Second letter: O
- Third letter: U
- Fourth letter: G
- Fifth letter: H

Pattern: ? O U G H

Now, what could the first letter be?

Letters ruled out so far: From ""raise"" R,A,I,S,E all out. From ""month"" M,N,T out. From ""dough"" D is out.

Also, we know from previous guesses that R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D are not present.

So eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D

Remaining possibilities for the first letter: B,C,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

But at position 1, it needs to form a valid English word ending with OUGH.

Possible words ending with ""OUGH"":
- Could be ""BOUGH"" - a branch of a tree (valid word)
- ""COUGH"" - common word
- ""HOUGH"" - anatomical term, but might be rare
- ""LOUGH"" - Irish word for lake
- ""POUGH"" - not a valid word
- ""ROUGH"" - but R is eliminated
- ""TOUGH"" - T eliminated
- ""SOUGH"" - S eliminated
- ""DOUGH"" - already guessed, not correct
- ""FOUGH"" - not a word
- ""GOUGH"" - surname, might not be common
- Etc.

Given D is eliminated, ""dough"" isn't the word. R, T, S are out, so ""rough"", ""tough"", ""sough"" are invalid.

""Pough"" isn't a word. ""Yough"" isn't valid. ""Wough"" isn't likely.

That leaves:
- BOUGH
- COUGH
- HOUGH (less common but valid)
- LOUGH

However, HOUGH starts with H. But the word ends with H at position 5. Could H appear twice? Possible.

Similarly, G appears at position 4. Could G be elsewhere? In ""cough"", G is at position 4 only, ""bough"" same.

Now, we need to test the first letter.

Since most possibilities are B, C, H, L for the first letter, and we have six guesses, we can afford to test.

But ideally, we should guess one that covers more letters. However, since only one position is unknown, any valid word will reveal the answer.

But to play efficiently, we could guess ""cough"" to test C at position 1.

Similarly, ""bough"" tests B.

Since ""ough"" rhymes and common words known are cough, bough, dough (eliminated), etc.

Perhaps less common words exist, but we focus on possible ones.

Also, from eliminated letters, F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z haven't been tested, but words starting with them ending OUGH are unlikely or rare.

So likely candidates: BOUGH, COUGH.

Others possible but less common: HOUGH, LOUGH.

Given H and L are common letters, but H is already at position 5? Could H be at position 1 and 5? Duplicates allowed unless ruled out.

In previous feedback, is letter duplication an issue?

For example, in ""month"", if the word had multiple O's, but we didn't guess extra O, so we didn't know.

Similarly here, the secret word could have multiple H's or G's.

But in ""dough"", G was position 4 and marked ✓, but we don't know if G is elsewhere.

However, since position 4 is G, and for the first position, if we have BOUGH or others, the letters are different.

To confirm, since ""dough"" had U(✓) at position 3, G(✓) at 4, H(✓) at 5, only position 1 needs filling.

Possible words:
- BOUGH: B O U G H
- COUGH: C O U G H
- HOUGH: H O U G H (assuming H appears twice)
- LOUGH: L O U G H

Are there others? ""GOUGH"" - surname as in Matthew Gough, but might not be acceptable as common word.

Similarly, KOUGH? Probably not.

Let's check valid words.

Now, since we need to guess, we can choose ""bough"" to test B.

Or ""cough"" for C.

But ""rough"" is out due to R eliminated.

Same with tough, dough, sough already covered.

Since D is out, dough was guess 3 and not correct.

Now, feedback shows D(x), so ""dough"" isn't correct.

Therefore, among valid words, bough or cough are most likely.

We haven't tested C or B.

Therefore, guessing ""cough"" would be sensible. If correct, we win. If not, we know C is absent and can guess ""bough"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""bough"" and it's wrong, then B is absent.

So let's choose ""cough"" as the guess.

Thus, guess 4: ""cough""

So now, putting this into the response format.Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: R, A, I, S, E are all absent (x). None of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""month"")**: O is correct and in position 2 (✓), H is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, N, T are all absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (""dough"")**: 
  - D is absent (x).
  - O is confirmed correct in position 2 (✓).
  - U is correct and in position 3 (✓).
  - G is correct and in position 4 (✓).
  - H is confirmed correct in position 5 (✓).

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word must have the pattern: `_ O U G H` (second letter O, third letter U, fourth letter G, fifth letter H).
- Only the first letter remains unknown.
- Eliminated letters (all absent): R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T, D.
- Possible candidates for the first letter (from remaining letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) must form a valid English word with the pattern `?OUGH`.
- Likely valid words:
  - **COUGH**: Checks C (common untested consonant). 
  - **BOUGH**: Checks B (medium-frequency letter).
  - **HOUGH** (less common but valid anatomical term): Checks H, which could potentially duplicate since H is already confirmed at position 5.
  - **LOUGH** (Irish term for lake): Checks L (high-frequency letter).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only one position (first letter) is unknown, so testing any of the likely words will resolve the game soon.
- Since we have three remaining guesses, efficiency is achievable by testing the most common candidate, **""cough""**:
  - It tests C (a high-frequency consonant) which hasn't been evaluated.
  - If ""cough"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm C's absence, narrowing possibilities to ""bough"" or less common words like ""hough"" or ""lough"".
  - Guessing ""cough"" is low-risk because it directly addresses the most probable solution while leveraging English word patterns (common ""-ough"" endings).

If ""cough"" is correct, the game ends; if not, we eliminate C and can proceed with ""bough"" next.

Actually, words can have repeated letters? But in our case, the secret word is 5 distinct? The rules don\'t specify distinct letters, but note that the feedback symbols handle duplicates.\n\nIn the rules, it says: ""Each letter in your guess"" can get different symbols. But the feedback doesn\'t mention anything about duplicates. For example, if secret has one L and you guess two L\'s, one might be correct or present.\n\nBut in this case, since our first guess had all unique letters, and feedback showed all absent, probably the secret word doesn\'t have duplicates? But we cannot be sure.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should assume that duplicates are possible, but since we have no evidence, we avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\nFor our second guess, we want to test new letters, so avoid repeated letters if possible.\n\nSo ""block"": B (new), L (new), O (vowel), C (new), K (new). That tests 5 new letters without duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""thong"": T,H,O,N,G — five distinct new letters.\n\n""month"": M,O,N,T,H — M,O,N,T,H — distinct.\n\nNow, among these, which has the most common letters?\n\nCommon letters in English: T, N, O from our remaining set.\n\n""month"": contains T,N,O — all common, plus M and H.\n\nH is somewhat common.\n\n""block"": B,L,O,C,K — O is common, but B,L,C,K are less common than T and N.\n\nThus, ""month"" seems better: T, N, O are very common.\n\nAnother choice could be ""clout"", but U is not ideal and C,L,O,U,T — U is less common than T,N.\n\nSo ""month"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut ""month"" does not use a Y or U. It sticks to more common consonants.\n\nWe can also consider ""young"": Y,O,U,N,G — letters Y,O,U,N,G. O and N are common but Y and U are less common.\n\nSo ""month"" appears superior.\n\nIs there a word with Y? For example, ""horny"" — but H,O,R,N,Y — R is eliminated.\n\n""downy"": D,O,W,N,Y — D,O,W,N,Y. Eliminated? R,A,I,S,E no. So D,O,W,N,Y are all new.\n\nBut W and Y are not as common as M and T? Wait, D,O,N are common.\n\nCompare to ""month"": \n\nFor ""month"": letters M,O,N,T,H — frequency: T high, O high, N high, M medium, H medium.\n\nFor ""downy"": D medium, O high, W medium, N high, Y medium-low.\n\nSo ""month"" has more high-frequency letters.\n\nAnother word: ""pound"" — P,O,U,N,D — U, which is medium-low frequency.\n\nThus, ""month"" is a good choice.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""month"".\n\nSo guess ""month"".\n\nThen we\'ll get feedback.\n\nBut note: If we guess ""month"" and we get feedback, we can deduce which letters are present.\n\nIn case the word has duplicates? But unlikely with these letters.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""month"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are present in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, I, S, E).\n\nFor the second guess, I need to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. Common consonants like T, N, O, L, C, H, M, D, P, B, and vowels like O, U, or Y are strong candidates. After considering options, ""month"" is ideal:\n- Uses M, O, N, T, H—all new, untested letters.\n- Includes high-frequency consonants (T, N) and the vowel O.\n- Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters, ensuring efficient information gain.\n- If the word contains O, N, T, M, or H, the feedback will help narrow possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>month</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: month -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) T(x) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can have them.\n\nHowever, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with letters not in the eliminated set.\n\nWe also know that O and H are fixed at positions 2 and 5.\n\nSo the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H\n\nWe need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters from B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we should avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nCommon letters: C, L, D, P, U, G, B, F, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has U in position 3, since U is a common vowel and might be needed.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word without U to test other letters.\n\nBut if we avoid U, we might have words like ""polyp"" but P O L Y P, and Y is at position 4, and H at 5? But ""polyp"" ends with P, not H.\n\nWe need the last letter to be H.\n\nSo words ending with ""O?H"" pattern.\n\nCommon endings: like ""ough"" as above, but we have O at 2 and H at 5, so the third and fourth letters are between.\n\nFor example, words like: cough, dough, tough, bough, rough, but rough has R eliminated, tough has T eliminated.\n\nSo possible: cough, dough, bough.\n\nBut we don\'t know if C, D, B, or G are in the word.\n\nWe could try ""gouge"" but ends with E, eliminated.\n\n""lough"" - a word? L-O-U-G-H, meaning a lake, but not common.\n\n""dough"" is common.\n\nBut we need to get information about other letters.\n\nSince we have two positions fixed, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has different letters in positions 1,3,4 to test.\n\nFor example, ""vouch"": V O U C H\n\nThis tests V, U, C.\n\nSimilarly, ""pouch"": P O U C H\n\nOr ""couch"": C O U C H, but has two C\'s, which might not be ideal for testing.\n\n""bylaw"" but no H at end.\n\nWe need the pattern _ O _ _ H.\n\nList of possible words ending with O?H:\n\n- With O in second and H in fifth: so the word must be of the form ?O??H\n\nCommon words: \n- cough (C O U G H)\n- dough (D O U G H)\n- bough (B O U G H)\n- rough (R O U G H) but R eliminated\n- tough (T O U G H) but T eliminated\n- lough (L O U G H) - less common\n- sough (S O U G H) but S eliminated\n\nSo only cough, dough, bough are possible from common words? But we don\'t know if U and G are present.\n\nWe could try ""youth"" but Y O U T H -> T is eliminated, and position 4 is T, which is absent.\n\n""youth"" has T, which is eliminated.\n\n""booth"" B O O T H -> but O at position 2 and 3? Then position 3 is O, but we have O only at position 2? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about multiple O\'s, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn ""month"", O was correct at position 2, but that doesn\'t prevent O from being elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""month"" had O(✓) meaning that O is in the word and in position 2, but it doesn\'t say if there are other O\'s. However, since we have no other information, we should not assume multiple O\'s.\n\nBut in the secret word, O might be only at position 2, or it might be elsewhere too? But in the feedback, for ""month"", we have O(✓) for position 2, and for other positions, we don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\nIn ""month"", we guessed O at position 2 and it was correct, so we know position 2 is O. We also know that if there were another O, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t guess it elsewhere. But since we have no evidence, we can assume for now that there is only one O, but it might not be true.\n\nTo be safe, we should consider the possibility of multiple O\'s, but for guessing, we can start with the common case.\n\nBut in the pattern, we have position 2 fixed as O, so for position 3 and 4, we can have other letters.\n\nBack to the word list: we have cough, dough, bough as candidates, but we don\'t want to guess one of them directly because if it\'s wrong, we get less information.\n\nWe should guess a word that tests letters that are not in these, to narrow down.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word that has different letters, we can eliminate more.\n\nBut we have to use the pattern: _ O _ _ H\n\nSo let\'s think of other words that fit this pattern.\n\nFor example:\n- ""pooch"": P O O C H -> but O at position 3? Then position 3 is O, and position 4 is C, position 5 H. But we have O at position 2 and 3? Possible.\n\n""pooch"" is P-O-O-C-H.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there is a double O.\n\nSimilarly, ""broth"" but B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.\n\n""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.\n\n""goth"" is 4 letters.\n\n""moth"" M O T H -> M and T eliminated, and only 4 letters? M-O-T-H is 4, not 5.\n\n5-letter words only.\n\n""booth"" B O O T H -> T eliminated.\n\n""sooth"" S O O T H -> S and T eliminated.\n\n""tooth"" T O O T H -> T eliminated.\n\n""woosh"" W O O S H -> S eliminated.\n\n""push"" is 4 letters.\n\n""bush"" is 4.\n\n""cushy"" not ending with H.\n\nAnother word: ""lunch"" L U N C H -> N eliminated.\n\n""punch"" P U N C H -> N eliminated.\n\n""hunch"" H U N C H -> but position 1 is H, but we have H at position 5, and H might be only at 5? But we don\'t know.\n\n""hunch"" has H at position 1 and 5, but we have H at position 5 correct, so if we guess ""hunch"", position 1 H might be present or not.\n\nBut we are not guessing ""hunch"" now.\n\nWe need a word with pattern ?O??H.\n\n""vouch"" V O U C H\n\n""pouch"" P O U C H\n\n""couch"" C O U C H\n\n""touch"" T O U C H -> T eliminated.\n\n""mouch"" M O U C H -> M eliminated.\n\nSo only vouch, pouch, couch are possible without eliminated letters.\n\nBut we also have ""youth"" but T eliminated.\n\n""yogah"" not a word.\n\n""bogus"" not ending with H.\n\nPerhaps ""loung"" not a word.\n\n""dough"" is D O U G H.\n\nG is not eliminated.\n\nSimilarly, ""cough"" C O U G H.\n\nG is not eliminated.\n\nU is not eliminated.\n\nBut we have many words with U and G.\n\nTo get more information, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have U, to see if U is present.\n\nFor example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that doesn\'t have U?\n\nFor instance, ""booth"" has T and double O, but T eliminated.\n\n""coach"" C O A C H -> A eliminated.\n\n""poach"" P O A C H -> A eliminated.\n\n""roach"" R O A C H -> R and A eliminated.\n\n""loath"" L O A T H -> A and T eliminated.\n\n""broth"" B R O T H -> R and T eliminated.\n\n""cloth"" C L O T H -> T eliminated.\n\n""gawky"" not ending with H.\n\n""jolly"" not H.\n\nIt seems that most common words with ?O??H have U in position 3, like in the ""ough"" words.\n\nThere is ""bothy"" B O T H Y -> T eliminated and not H at end.\n\n""comfy"" not H.\n\n""dopey"" not H.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word without U.\n\nAnother possibility: ""koph"" not 5 letters.\n\n""yodh"" not 5.\n\nSo perhaps U is very likely in position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nWe could guess a word that has U in a different position to test.\n\nBut in the pattern, position 3 is free, so we can put U there or not.\n\nSince we have to use the pattern, we might as well include U to see if it\'s present.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should choose a word with letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nFor example, in ""vouch"", we test V, U, C.\n\nV is not very common.\n\nIn ""pouch"", we test P, U, C.\n\nP and C are common.\n\nIn ""couch"", we test C, U, but C twice, so only two letters.\n\n""couch"" has C at 1 and 4, so if C is not in the word, we get two x\'s, but if it is, we might get one or two marks.\n\nBut it\'s better to have distinct letters.\n\nSo ""pouch"" or ""vouch"".\n\n""dough"" tests D, U, G.\n\nG is common.\n\n""bough"" tests B, U, G.\n\nB is medium common.\n\n""cough"" tests C, U, G.\n\nC and G are common.\n\nAmong these, ""cough"" has C and G, both common.\n\nBut we also have ""lough"" which tests L, U, G.\n\nL is very common.\n\nSo let\'s list the letters we can test:\n\n- For position 1: we can use B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but U is better in position 3.\n\nTypically, position 1 is a consonant.\n\nPosition 3 can be a vowel or consonant.\n\nPosition 4 is a consonant in these words.\n\nSo for position 1, we want to test a common consonant: like L, C, P, D, B, F, etc.\n\nPosition 3: likely U, but we can try other vowels? But the only vowel left is U or Y, and Y can be used.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""goyim"" not H.\n\n""boyla"" not.\n\nSo probably U is the only vowel possibility for position 3.\n\nWe can have Y in position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""toyon"" not H.\n\n""royal"" not H.\n\n""payed"" not H.\n\nIt\'s difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""bylaw"" not H.\n\nSo let\'s accept that position 3 is likely U for common words.\n\nThen position 4 can be G, C, etc.\n\nSo for our guess, we can choose ""pouch"" to test P, U, C.\n\nOr ""cough"" to test C, U, G.\n\nOr ""dough"" for D, U, G.\n\nSince we have no information on these, we should choose one that has letters that are more common.\n\nC is more common than P or D or G? Let\'s see letter frequencies.\n\nIn English, common consonants: T, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, M, F, etc. But we have eliminated T, N, S, R, M, and H is already placed.\n\nRemaining: D, L, C, F, P, G, B, etc.\n\nC is more common than D, P, G.\n\nAccording to frequency, C is about 2.78%, D is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D is more common than C, P, G.\n\nD is 4.25%, L is 4.03%, C is 2.78%, P is 1.93%, G is 2.02%, so D and L are more common.\n\nBut in ""dough"", we test D, U, G.\n\nIn ""cough"", C, U, G.\n\nIn ""lough"", L, U, G.\n\n""lough"" is a valid word, meaning a lake or arm of the sea.\n\nSimilarly, ""cough"" and ""dough"" are common.\n\nWe also have ""bough"" with B, U, G.\n\nB is 1.49%, less common.\n\nSo ""dough"" or ""lough"" might be better.\n\nBut ""lough"" is less common, but valid.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s use ""dough"" to test D and G.\n\nBut we also have U, which is common.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that doesn\'t have U in position 3 to see if U is present, but as we saw, it\'s hard to find such a word.\n\nFor example, ""polyp"" not ending with H.\n\n""lymph"" L Y M P H -> M eliminated.\n\n""nymph"" N Y M P H -> N and M eliminated.\n\n""wryly"" not H.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps ""gulph"" variant of gulf, not common.\n\nSo we might have to go with a word that has U.\n\nBut we can choose one that tests letters we are unsure of.\n\nSince we have to make a guess, let\'s pick ""dough"" to test D and G.\n\nThen, if we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut we also have position 1 and position 4 to consider.\n\nIn ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 is U, position 4 is G.\n\nIf we guess ""dough"", and it\'s not the word, we might get feedback like D(x or -), U(x or -), G(x or -).\n\nBut since O and H are fixed, we know they are correct.\n\nSo the feedback will be for D, U, G.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the potential solution if possible, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother thought: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and the eliminated letters.\n\nPossible words: ?O??H with no R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T.\n\nLetters available: B,C,D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut the word must be valid.\n\nCommon words:\n- cough (C O U G H)\n- dough (D O U G H)\n- bough (B O U G H)\n- lough (L O U G H)\n- pouch (P O U C H)\n- couch (C O U C H) - but double C\n- vouch (V O U C H)\n- gouge not H\n- touch T eliminated\n- etc.\n\nAlso, ""rough"" R eliminated, ""tough"" T eliminated.\n\nSo possible: cough, dough, bough, lough, pouch, couch, vouch.\n\nCouch has two C\'s, so it might not be ideal.\n\nVouch has V, which is less common.\n\nLough is less common.\n\nSo the most common are cough, dough, bough, pouch.\n\nPouch has P and C.\n\nCough has C and G.\n\nDough has D and G.\n\nBough has B and G.\n\nWe can choose one that tests letters we want.\n\nSince we have no information on C, D, G, P, etc., we can pick ""pouch"" to test P and C, as C is common.\n\nOr ""cough"" for C and G.\n\nBut ""cough"" has C and G, both to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""pouch"" has P and C.\n\nD has higher frequency, so ""dough"" might be better.\n\nBut let\'s see the position.\n\nIn ""dough"", position 1 is D, position 3 U, position 4 G.\n\nIf we guess ""dough"", and the feedback shows:\n\n- If D is in the word but wrong position, we get D(-)\n- If U is in the word but wrong position, U(-), but U is at position 3, if it\'s not correct, it might be absent or elsewhere, but since we have no other U, it might be absent or present elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t have other positions for U yet.\n\nSimilarly for G.\n\nTo save guesses, we could guess a word that is likely, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has Y or other letters to test more.\n\nFor example, ""youth"" but T eliminated.\n\n""yogic"" not H.\n\n""comic"" not H.\n\nSo hard.\n\nPerhaps ""fouth"" not a common word.\n\nI think we have to choose from the list.\n\nLet\'s pick ""cough"" as it is common and tests C and G.\n\nSo guess ""cough"".\n\nThen we can see.\n\nBut ""cough"" is C O U G H.\n\nFeedback will tell us about C, U, G.\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win.\n\nIf not, we know which of C, U, G are in the word.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nSince we are at guess 3, and we have 3 more guesses, it\'s ok.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that tests more letters.\n\nFor example, is there a word with pattern ?O??H that has L or F or other common letters.\n\n""lough"" has L, U, G.\n\n""fouth"" is not common, meaning abundance, but rare.\n\n""pough"" not a word.\n\n""wough"" not.\n\nSo ""lough"" is an option.\n\nL is common, so ""lough"" tests L, U, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""dough"" tests D, U, G.\n\nD is more common than L? D 4.25%, L 4.03%, very close.\n\nBut in word games, L is very common.\n\nI think ""dough"" or ""cough"" is fine.\n\nLet\'s go with ""dough"".\n\nSo guess ""dough"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we have.\n\nFrom guess 2: O and H are correct at positions 2 and 5.\n\nSo in ""dough"", O and H will be correct, and we get feedback on D, U, G.\n\nSimilarly for any guess with O at 2 and H at 5.\n\nSo for guess 3, I\'ll choose ""dough"".\n\n<guess>dough</guess>\n\nBut the user might expect the guess in the format.\n\nIn the previous, we had <guess>raise</guess> etc.\n\nSo for this, <guess>dough</guess>\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nAnother word: ""bough"" is similar.\n\nOr ""cough"".\n\nBut I think ""dough"" is good.\n\nPerhaps ""pouch"" to test P and C, which are different.\n\nBut D is more common than P.\n\nD is 4.25%, P is 1.93%, so D is better.\n\nSo ""dough"" it is.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1 (""raise""): All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent from the secret word.\n- Guess 2 (""month""): O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5. M, N, and T are absent.\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Be 5 letters long.\n- Have O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter (pattern: _ O _ _ H).\n- Exclude the letters R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T (since they are absent).\n- Use only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the third guess, I need to test common remaining letters (like D, U, G, C, L, P) while fitting the pattern. ""Dough"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (D O U G H) and tests three new common letters: D (high frequency), U (vowel), and G. This will provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>dough</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: month -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) T(x) H(✓)\nGuess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, I need to figure out the next guess based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me start by summarizing what we know so far.\n\nThe first guess was ""raise"" and all letters R, A, I, S, E got an ""x"", meaning none of them are in the secret word. \n\nSecond guess was ""month"". Here\'s the breakdown:\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- O: ✓ (correct and in position 2)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- H: ✓ (correct and in position 5)\n\nSo we know the secret word has O as the second letter and H as the fifth letter. The pattern is: _ O _ _ H\n\nAdditionally, the letters M, N, T are also not in the word since they got an ""x"".\n\nThird guess was ""dough"" with the feedback:\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- O: ✓ (already confirmed position 2)\n- U: ✓ (present but wrong position? Wait, the symbol is ✓. Hmm... But the guess ""dough"" has U in position 3. Since it shows U(✓), that means U is correct and in the right position? Wait, but it\'s position 3.\n\nLooking back at the rules: ✓ means ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.""\n\nSo for ""dough"", the U is position 3 and got a ✓. That means the third letter of the secret word is U!\n\nSimilarly, G in position 4 got a ✓, meaning the fourth letter is G.\n\nAnd H was already known position 5.\n\nSo the feedback for ""dough"": D(x) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓) tells us:\n- D is absent\n- O correct at position 2\n- U now known to be correct at position 3\n- G correct at position 4\n- H correct at position 5\n\nTherefore, the secret word is _ O U G H\n\nOnly the first letter is missing!\n\nPutting it together, the word has:\n- Second letter: O\n- Third letter: U\n- Fourth letter: G\n- Fifth letter: H\n\nPattern: ? O U G H\n\nNow, what could the first letter be?\n\nLetters ruled out so far: From ""raise"" R,A,I,S,E all out. From ""month"" M,N,T out. From ""dough"" D is out.\n\nAlso, we know from previous guesses that R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D are not present.\n\nSo eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D\n\nRemaining possibilities for the first letter: B,C,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut at position 1, it needs to form a valid English word ending with OUGH.\n\nPossible words ending with ""OUGH"":\n- Could be ""BOUGH"" - a branch of a tree (valid word)\n- ""COUGH"" - common word\n- ""HOUGH"" - anatomical term, but might be rare\n- ""LOUGH"" - Irish word for lake\n- ""POUGH"" - not a valid word\n- ""ROUGH"" - but R is eliminated\n- ""TOUGH"" - T eliminated\n- ""SOUGH"" - S eliminated\n- ""DOUGH"" - already guessed, not correct\n- ""FOUGH"" - not a word\n- ""GOUGH"" - surname, might not be common\n- Etc.\n\nGiven D is eliminated, ""dough"" isn\'t the word. R, T, S are out, so ""rough"", ""tough"", ""sough"" are invalid.\n\n""Pough"" isn\'t a word. ""Yough"" isn\'t valid. ""Wough"" isn\'t likely.\n\nThat leaves:\n- BOUGH\n- COUGH\n- HOUGH (less common but valid)\n- LOUGH\n\nHowever, HOUGH starts with H. But the word ends with H at position 5. Could H appear twice? Possible.\n\nSimilarly, G appears at position 4. Could G be elsewhere? In ""cough"", G is at position 4 only, ""bough"" same.\n\nNow, we need to test the first letter.\n\nSince most possibilities are B, C, H, L for the first letter, and we have six guesses, we can afford to test.\n\nBut ideally, we should guess one that covers more letters. However, since only one position is unknown, any valid word will reveal the answer.\n\nBut to play efficiently, we could guess ""cough"" to test C at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""bough"" tests B.\n\nSince ""ough"" rhymes and common words known are cough, bough, dough (eliminated), etc.\n\nPerhaps less common words exist, but we focus on possible ones.\n\nAlso, from eliminated letters, F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z haven\'t been tested, but words starting with them ending OUGH are unlikely or rare.\n\nSo likely candidates: BOUGH, COUGH.\n\nOthers possible but less common: HOUGH, LOUGH.\n\nGiven H and L are common letters, but H is already at position 5? Could H be at position 1 and 5? Duplicates allowed unless ruled out.\n\nIn previous feedback, is letter duplication an issue?\n\nFor example, in ""month"", if the word had multiple O\'s, but we didn\'t guess extra O, so we didn\'t know.\n\nSimilarly here, the secret word could have multiple H\'s or G\'s.\n\nBut in ""dough"", G was position 4 and marked ✓, but we don\'t know if G is elsewhere.\n\nHowever, since position 4 is G, and for the first position, if we have BOUGH or others, the letters are different.\n\nTo confirm, since ""dough"" had U(✓) at position 3, G(✓) at 4, H(✓) at 5, only position 1 needs filling.\n\nPossible words:\n- BOUGH: B O U G H\n- COUGH: C O U G H\n- HOUGH: H O U G H (assuming H appears twice)\n- LOUGH: L O U G H\n\nAre there others? ""GOUGH"" - surname as in Matthew Gough, but might not be acceptable as common word.\n\nSimilarly, KOUGH? Probably not.\n\nLet\'s check valid words.\n\nNow, since we need to guess, we can choose ""bough"" to test B.\n\nOr ""cough"" for C.\n\nBut ""rough"" is out due to R eliminated.\n\nSame with tough, dough, sough already covered.\n\nSince D is out, dough was guess 3 and not correct.\n\nNow, feedback shows D(x), so ""dough"" isn\'t correct.\n\nTherefore, among valid words, bough or cough are most likely.\n\nWe haven\'t tested C or B.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""cough"" would be sensible. If correct, we win.

We are given feedback from all four guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" → all letters absent: R, A, I, S, E are not in the secret word.
Guess 2: ""month"" → O is correct and in position 2, H is correct and in position 5; M, N, T are absent.
Guess 3: ""dough"" → D is absent; O, U, G, H are all correct: U in position 3, G in position 4, H in position 5.
Guess 4: ""cough"" → C is absent; O, U, G, H are correct (positions 2,3,4,5 as expected).

From Guess 3 and 4, we know the secret word is ? O U G H, with the first letter unknown.

From feedback:
- Eliminated letters (absolutely not in the word) so far: R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T, D, C.
  - These are from ""raise"" (R,A,I,S,E), ""month"" (M,N,T), ""dough"" (D), and ""cough"" (C).

Possible candidates for the first letter must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding these eliminated letters.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: G and H are already in the word (in positions 4 and 5). However, the first letter could be the same as G or H? But in feedback for ""dough"" and ""cough"", if there were duplicate letters, we might have seen indications? However, in the feedback rules, duplicates are handled separately. Since we didn't guess a duplicate for G or H in position 1, the absence of an indicator doesn't mean they can't be duplicated.

But in the pattern, we have:
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: O
Position 3: U
Position 4: G
Position 5: H

So the word is of the form X O U G H.

Now, we need a valid English word where X is one of the remaining letters, not eliminated.

Possible words:
- BOUGH: a branch of a tree. Valid word. B is not eliminated.
- HOUGH: the hock of an animal. Valid word. H is not eliminated, but we have H at position 5? Duplicates are allowed.
- LOUGH: Irish word for a lake or an arm of the sea. Valid word. L is not eliminated.
- GOUGH: a surname, might not be considered a common word? But possible.

Also, think of others:
- POUGH: not a standard word.
- VOUGH: not found.
- YOUGH: not common.
- WOUGH: not found.

More common ones: BOUGH, LOUGH, HOUGH.

But note: in feedback from Guess 2, we have H(✓) at position 5, but if H is duplicated, it's possible. Similarly, from Guess 3, we have G(✓) at position 4, so G could be duplicated if the word has two G's? But in this pattern, position 4 is G, and if the first letter were G, we'd have G O U G H. That would be ""gough"". Is that a word? It might be a surname or variant, but generally not considered a common English word.

Similarly, for H: H O U G H would be ""hough"", which is a valid word.

So possible words: BOUGH, HOUGH, LOUGH.

Other rare ones: ROUGH is eliminated because R is absent, similarly for others.

So we have three primary candidates: BOUGH, HOUGH, LOUGH.

Now, we need to choose one.

Since we are on guess 5 (this would be the fifth guess?), we can guess any of them and then use the next if wrong.

But to be efficient, we can choose the most common one.

In terms of frequency: BOUGH is a common word in specific contexts (like botany). LOUGH is less common, HOUGH is also less common.

Perhaps ""bough"" is used in phrases like ""bough of a tree"", so it might be the most likely.

We can test the letter B.

Similarly, L and H.

But H has been placed at position 5, so if we use ""hough"", we can test if it's correct and if H duplicate is possible.

But since we have limited guesses, let's list:

Eliminated letters: A,B? No, B not eliminated. Eliminated: R,A,I,S,E,M,N,T,D,C.

So B is available.

Thus, possible: BOUGH.

Similarly, L is available: LOUGH.

H is available: HOUGH.

Since L is a common consonant, perhaps ""lough"" might be less common.

I think ""bough"" is the most common among them.

Therefore, we can guess ""bough"".

If wrong, then try ""hough"" or ""lough"".

But we have two guesses left (guess 5 and 6).

So guess ""bough"".

Thus, the fifth guess should be ""bough"".

Then, if feedback shows B absent or wrong, we can adjust.

But in the pattern, position 1 is what we're testing.

So for guess 5: ""bough""

If correct: B(✓) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) H(✓)

If not, then B(x) and we try L or H.

So now, let's return.

But we are to make a new guess, so guess ""bough"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:  
- **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: Confirms R, A, I, S, E are absent (x).  
- **Guess 2 (""month"")**: Confirms O is in position 2 (✓) and H is in position 5 (✓), while M, N, T are absent (x).  
- **Guess 3 (""dough"")**: Confirms U is in position 3 (✓) and G is in position 4 (✓), while D is absent (x). Pattern is now `_ O U G H`.  
- **Guess 4 (""cough"")**: Confirms C is absent (x), while O, U, G, H positions remain unchanged.  

### Key Deductions:  
- The secret word has the fixed pattern `? O U G H`. Only the first letter is unknown.  
- Eliminated letters (absolutely absent): R, A, I, S, E, M, N, T, D, C.  
- Remaining possible letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Since duplicates are possible (e.g., G or H could appear elsewhere, though not observed in previous feedback), valid words include **BOUGH**, **HOUGH**, and **LOUGH**.  

### Strategy for Guess 5:  
- Testing **BOUGH** is optimal:  
  - B is a high-frequency consonant among remaining options and hasn't been tested.  
  - If correct (B✓), the game ends; if not, B is eliminated, narrowing options to HOUGH/LOUGH for the final guess.  
- ""Bough"" is a common English word (meaning a tree branch), making it a practical test candidate over rarer alternatives like ""hough"" or ""lough"".
