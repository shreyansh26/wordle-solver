We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and is generally a good starter.

 So, our first guess: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation of feedback:
- C: x → not in the secret word. So the secret word does not contain C.
- R: - → R is in the word, but not in the second position (where we put it).
- A: - → A is in the word, but not in the third position.
- N: x → not in the word. So no N.
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the fifth position. So the secret word ends with E.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (since E is in the fifth position and is correct).
- The word contains R and A, but not in the positions we guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- The word does not contain C or N.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.

For our second guess:
- We must include R and A (since they are in the word) but in different positions than before.
- We must not use C or N.
- The fifth letter must be E.

Moreover, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Let's reorganize:
- Position 5 is fixed as E: so the word is _ _ _ _ E
- We need to place R and A in positions 1,2,3, or 4, but not in the same positions as in the first guess? Actually, we know R is not in position 2 (from first guess). Similarly, A is not in position 3. But they could be in other positions.

Also, note: the R that we placed in position 2 is actually in the word but in a different position. Similarly, A in position 3 is in the word but in a different position.

So we have constraints:
- Avoid C and N.
- Word must contain R and A (at least one each) and E (at the end).

We should consider that R might appear only once? But we don't know, so we have to allow for multiple letters.

Given the secret word has E at the end and contains R and A, and we avoided C and N.

Possible words: Let's think of words ending in E with R and A and without C or N.

We need a word that doesn't put R in position 2 and doesn't put A in position 3? Actually, no: our next guess doesn't have to avoid these positions for R and A, because the secret word might have R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess we got R in position 2 marked as wrong position (meaning R is not in position 2 in the secret word). Similarly, A is not in position 3. So in the secret word, R is at position 1,3,4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R must be at 1,3, or4. Similarly, A must be at 1,2,4, or5? But position5 is E, so A must be at 1,2, or4.

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's try to use a word that has:
- E at the end: so pattern is ? ? ? ? E
- We should include R and A, but in different positions than the first guess for R and A? Actually, we should try them in new positions to test.

Also, we might include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. We haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, we can try a word that includes some of these.

But we must include R and A? Actually, we must include R and A because the feedback says they are in the word? Yes: R(-) and A(-) mean they are present.

So our next guess must include R and A? But wait: the feedback tells us that R and A are in the secret word. Therefore, our next guess must also include R and A? Actually, not necessarily: we can guess words without R and A? But that wouldn't help because we know they are in the word. It's better to use them to see at which positions they appear.

We need to try R and A in new positions.

Let me try to think of words ending in E that have R and A.

Common words: 
- BRAVE? But we don't know about B and V. But we must avoid C and N. BRAVE has B,R,A,V,E. Pattern: B R A V E.

But in BRAVE:
- Position 2 is R → but in the first feedback we know that R cannot be at position 2? Wait: no, in the first guess we had R at position2 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, from the first guess: the secret word does not have R in position2? Exactly, because we put R at position2 and got (-) meaning it is not at position2. Therefore, in BRAVE, if we put R at position2, that would be inconsistent with the secret word? Actually, in BRAVE, we are putting R at position2, but the secret word has R but not at position2. So if we guess BRAVE, then we are putting R at position2 again, which we know is wrong. So we would get - again? Unless we get a ✓ for R elsewhere? Actually, no: if the secret word does have R at position2, we would get ✓. But we already know R is not at position2? Actually, from the first feedback: our guess had R at position2 and it was marked as wrong position (so not at that position). Therefore, the secret word has R somewhere else.

Therefore, if we guess BRAVE, the R is at position2, so we expect to get (-) for R again? Because the secret word still has R but not at position2. And similarly, for A: in BRAVE, A is at position3, but we already know A is not at position3 (from first guess), so we'd expect to get (-) for A too? That doesn't break anything, but it doesn't give new information.

We want to test R and A in new positions.

So place R anywhere but position2: so positions1,3,4.
Similarly, A anywhere but position3: so positions1,2,4.

Also, the fifth letter is E.

Let me brainstorm words without C and N, ending with E, containing R and A.

Option: 
- PLACE? But has C → avoid (C is excluded).
- TRADE? T,R,A,D,E. Contains R and A? R at position2 → but we cannot put R at position2? Wait, we can put it, but since we know the secret word doesn't have R at position2, we would get (-) for R. But we want to test a new position? Therefore, avoid R at position2.

So let's avoid R in position2. Also avoid A in position3.

Possible words:
- Start with R: R at position1.
  - Words: R A ? ? E → e.g. ""RAPHE""? Not common. ""RAREE""? Uncommon.
  - How about ""RANGE""? But N is excluded → no.
  - ""RAISE"" ? R at1, A at2, I,S,E. Then E at end? So RAISE: R,A,I,S,E → positions: R1, A2, I3, S4, E5.

But wait, E must be at position5? Yes. So RAISE works? But now:
- If we use RAISE:
  - R at position1: which we haven't tested before? Before R was at2, now at1: so new position for R.
  - A at position2: which is a new position? In the first guess (crane) A was at position3, now we put A at position2: so it might be correct? or wrong? But we don't know.

However, let's see if RAISE meets the constraints:
- Contains R and A? Yes.
- Ends with E? Yes.
- Does not contain C or N? Yes.

But note: in the secret word, position5 is E, so RAISE's E at position5 is correct? But we already know that? Actually, we know the secret word has E at end, so in RAISE, E at position5 should be ✓.

But what about the other letters? We are testing R at1, A at2, I,S? We haven't tested I and S yet.

Another option: with R at position3 or4.

But RAISE seems decent.

Alternative: 
- Maybe ""PARSE""? P,A,R,S,E → then A at position1? Or ""PRAISE"" is six letters. 
- ""CRATE"" has C -> avoid.

Another idea: ""BEARE""? Not common.

Common words:
""RAISE"" is a common starting word in Wordle? But we can use it.

But wait: what about the E? In RAISE, E is at position5: we know it must be ✓. So we hope that R at1 and A at2 might be tested.

Alternatively, to test more letters, we could avoid repeating a position known to be wrong? But R at1 is new? And A at2 is new? So we can.

Another common word: ""SLATE"" → but T,E: but we have E at end? Yes. But SLATE: S,L,A,T,E → A at position3? Which we know is not correct? Actually, we know A is not at position3? Yes, so if we guess SLATE, A at position3? Then we expect (-) for A? Which would confirm that A is not at3? But that's already known? So not useful.

Instead, put A at position4? For example ""PLAIT"" doesn't end with E?

So back to RAISE.

But let's see: ""ROUSE""? R at1, O,U,S,E → then A is missing! We must include A? Because we know A is in the word. So we cannot leave out A? Therefore, our guess must contain A and R? Since we have been told they are in the word? Unless we want to get more info? But we know they are in the word.

So our second guess should include R and A? Because if we leave them out, we don't learn about their positions? Actually, we already know they are in the word, so we can include them to try to pinpoint the location.

Therefore, RAISE: 
- R at position1 (previously at2: so new position)
- A at position2 (previously at3: new position)
- I and S are new letters.

We'll get feedback on R, A, I, S, E.

But E we know will be ✓.

So let's guess RAISE.

But wait: what if the secret word has R at position1 and A at position2? Then we might get ✓ for both? But we don't know.

Alternatively, if we want to test a word that has R and A both in new positions? RAISE does that.

Another word: ""ARISE"" → but ARISE: A at1, R at2 → then R at position2: we know R cannot be at position2? Because we tried it and it was (-). So if we guess ARISE, then R is at position2 again? Then we know it's not there? But that's not efficient? Because we'd get (-) for R? So we'd waste the position for R.

Therefore, better to avoid putting guesses in known wrong positions? But the symbol won't be ✓? It would be - again? So we learn that R is still not at position2? That confirms the old info? But we want new info. So we should put R in a new position? Similarly for A.

Therefore, RAISE seems good: R at1 (new), A at2 (new). And I and S are new.

We can also consider ""SAFER"": S1,A2,F3,E4,R5? But R5: position5 is E? So we are forced to put E at5? Therefore, we cannot put R at5? Because position5 must be E? So R cannot be at position5? Because E is there? Exactly: R is at1,2,3,4? So SAFER would be S,A,F,E,R → but then position5 is R? But we know position5 is E? So SAFER would be wrong because it has R at5? So we can't guess SAFER.

Therefore, RAISE: R1, A2, I3, S4, E5.

Now, I3 and S4: we don't know.

So let's go with RAISE.

Alternatively, another word: ""PARSE""? P1,A2,R3,S4,E5 → here A at2 and R at3? Then R is at3? Which is a new position? So R at3? And A at2? Also avoid C and N? And E at5? Yes.

But PARSE: P,A,R,S,E — common letters? Yes.

But RAISE has I which is a vowel? So better? Or similar.

I think RAISE is fine.

We'll guess RAISE.

So our second guess: RAISE

But note: we know from first guess that R is not at position2 and A is not at position3? So in RAISE, if we put R at1 and A at2? They are both new positions? So feedback will tell us if they are correct? Or wrong?

So let's do it.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)):

- **E is confirmed** in the 5th position (the secret word ends with E).
- **R is in the word but not in position 2**.
- **A is in the word but not in position 3**.
- **C and N are not in the word**.

For the second guess:
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in E.
- It must include R and A (since they are present in the secret word), but placed in positions other than those already ruled out:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
  - A cannot be in position 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4 are possible).
- Avoid C and N entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to gather new information (e.g., testing unused vowels like I or consonants like S).

After considering words ending in E that fit these constraints, ""RAISE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It ends with E → confirms the known ✓ at position 5.
- It places R at position 1 (a new position) → tests if R is correctly placed here.
- It places A at position 2 (a new position) → tests if A is correctly placed here.
- Includes unused letters like I and S → provides new information.
- Avoids C and N.

So place R anywhere but position2: so positions1,3,4.
Similarly, A anywhere but position3: so positions1,2,4.

Also, the fifth letter is E.

We'll get feedback on R, A, I, S, E.

But E we know will be ✓.

So let's guess RAISE.

But wait: what if the secret word has R at position1 and A at position2? Then we might get ✓ for both? But we don't know.

Alternatively, if we want to test a word that has R and A both in new positions? RAISE does that.

Another word: ""ARISE"" → but ARISE: A at1, R at2 → then R at position2: we know R cannot be at position2? Because we tried it and it was (-). So if we guess ARISE, then R is at position2 again? Then we know it's not there? But that's not efficient? Because we'd get (-) for R? So we'd waste the position for R.

Therefore, better to avoid putting guesses in known wrong positions? But the symbol won't be ✓? It would be - again? So we learn that R is still not at position2? That confirms the old info? But we want new info. So we should put R in a new position? Similarly for A.

Therefore, RAISE seems good: R at1 (new), A at2 (new). And I and S are new.

We can also consider ""SAFER"": S1,A2,F3,E4,R5? But R5: position5 is E? So we are forced to put E at5? Therefore, we cannot put R at5? Because position5 must be E? So R cannot be at position5? Because E is there? Exactly: R is at1,2,3,4? So SAFER would be S,A,F,E,R → but then position5 is R? But we know position5 is E? So SAFER would be wrong because it has R at5? So we can't guess SAFER.

Therefore, RAISE: R1, A2, I3, S4, E5.

Now, I3 and S4: we don't know.

So let's go with RAISE.

Alternatively, another word: ""PARSE""? P1,A2,R3,S4,E5 → here A at2 and R at3? Then R is at3? Which is a new position? So R at3? And A at2? Also avoid C and N? And E at5? Yes.

But PARSE: P,A,R,S,E — common letters? Yes.

But RAISE has I which is a vowel? So better? Or similar.

I think RAISE is fine.

We'll guess RAISE.

So our second guess: RAISE

But note: we know from first guess that R is not at position2 and A is not at position3? So in RAISE, if we put R at1 and A at2? They are both new positions? So feedback will tell us if they are correct? Or wrong?

So let's do it.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)):

- **E is confirmed** in the 5th position (the secret word ends with E).
- **R is in the word but not in position 2**.
- **A is in the word but not in position 3**.
- **C and N are not in the word**.

For the second guess:
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in E.
- It must include R and A (since they are present in the secret word), but placed in positions other than those already ruled out:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
  - A cannot be in position 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4 are possible).
- Avoid C and N entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to gather new information (e.g., testing unused vowels like I or consonants like S).

After considering words ending in E that fit these constraints, ""RAISE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It ends with E → confirms the known ✓ at position 5.
- It places R at position 1 (a new position) → tests if R is correctly placed here.
- It places A at position 2 (a new position) → tests if A is correctly placed here.
- Includes unused letters like I and S → provides new information.
- Avoids C and N.",Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
