We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get (i.e., covers common letters and positions).

One strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants. A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me consider:

- We have 5 positions. We want letters that are frequent in English 5-letter words.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A good starting word might be one that uses distinct letters and includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

I recall that ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used sometimes but less common.

But let's choose a word that is familiar and covers common letters.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: vowel
- N: common consonant (appearing in many words)
- E: vowel

It has four distinct consonants and one vowel (plus R being both consonant and vowel-like). Actually, it has two vowels: A and E.

Another candidate is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

But since I have to pick one, I choose ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess: CRANE

We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and E, but not C, A, N.

We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

Now, since R is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that the secret word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We must exclude the letters C, A, N from our next guess.

For our second guess, we want to test positions for R and E and also try to include new common letters to gather more information.

Let me think of words that:
- Contain R and E (since they are in the word)
- Do not contain C, A, N (since they are out)
- Place R in a different position than 2, and E in a different position than 5.

Moreover, we should try to cover more vowels or common consonants. Since A is out, we can try other vowels: I, O, U (though U is less common).

Common consonants left: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.

One idea: we have R and E to include. We know R is not at position 2. Let's try placing R at the beginning or in the middle.

Also, E is not at the end. So E could be in the middle or beginning.

Try a word that starts with R? But we don't know if R is at position 1. Similarly, E might be placed earlier.

Some words that come to mind:

Option 1: Try ""ROTES"" - but note we have S, which is common.

But let's check: R at position 1 (so if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get correct, otherwise wrong position). However, in our feedback, R was marked wrong position but we don't know where it should be.

Another option: ""RESET"" - but it has E twice? The word must have distinct letters? Actually, words can have repeated letters, but in our feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback becomes tricky. So maybe avoid double letters for early guesses.

Better to use words with unique letters to avoid confusion.

So, ""ROTES"": R, O, T, E, S. This has R at position 1, and E at position 4 (so not position 5).

But what about the letter O? We don't have any information about it.

Also, ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. This has R at position 4 and E at position 5? Oh, but E at position 5 is forbidden? Wait, no: the feedback only said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So that doesn't prohibit E from being in position 5? Wait, let me re-examine:

The feedback: for ""CRANE"", E was in position 5 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1-4.

So in a new guess, if we put E at position 5 again, that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. But if we put E elsewhere, we might get new information.

Similarly, R cannot be at position 2.

In ""STORE"", we have R at position 4 and E at position 5. But we know E at position 5 is invalid? Actually, we know from the previous feedback that the secret word does have E, but not at position 5. So if we guess ""STORE"" and E is at 5, we might get ""-"" again if E is in the word but not at 5? Actually, if the secret word has exactly one E and we put E at 5, then it would be marked '-' meaning present but not at 5. This does not give new information since we already know E is not at 5.

So better to put E at a position we haven't tried. Position 5 has been tried and failed, so put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we haven't tried any of those.

Similarly for R, we know position 2 didn't work, so put R in 1,3,4,5? We have 4 positions to try. But we tried position 2 and it was wrong.

Now, let me consider possible words:

Option: ""SPIRE"" - has S,P,I,R,E. But P and I haven't been tested.

However, let me think of words that include R and E and other common letters.

""TRIES"": T, R, I, E, S.
In this, R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2 (from feedback: when R was at position 2, it wasn't correct). Therefore, we should avoid guessing R at position 2 again? Actually, the feedback only says that position 2 was not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, it would likely give '-' again (unless the secret word has two R's, which is less common). To avoid confusion, better not to test the same position again early on.

Therefore, let's choose a word without R at position 2.

Similarly, avoid E at position 5.

So ""TRIES"" has R at position 2, which we should avoid.

""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E. R at 1, E at 5. E at 5: we already know it's not at 5, so would give ""-"" again? But we might also test the new letters O,U,T.

But it's not efficient to re-test E at 5.

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N. But N was already eliminated (N is in the word? Wait, feedback said N not in word? Yes, in CRANE, N was at position 4 and marked x, so N is out. So we cannot use RESIN because it has N.)

Similarly, we must avoid C, A, N.

So avoid N.

Another word: ""PILER"" - but that's not common.

""RISER"": has two R's? Avoid.

How about ""STERN"": S, T, E, R, N. But N is eliminated? So no.

Get words without forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

We want to use E and R, and introduce new letters.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But among these, common in English words: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

Now, let me think of a word that includes R, E, and other common letters, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

For example:
- Place R at position 1: words like ROBES, ROPES, but we don't know about B,P, etc.

""ROPES"": R, O, P, E, S. R at 1, E at 4. And E not at 5. Also, introduces O,P,S.

But ""ROPES"" has E at 4? We can try E in position 4.

Another one: ""STREP"" - but that's less common.

Or ""ROGUE"": R, O, G, U, E. R at 1, E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5, so it would be marked '-', which doesn't tell us anything new about E's position. Also, we have U, which is less common. Maybe not ideal.

Better to choose a word with E not at 5 and R not at 2.

Another idea: Place E at position 1? Words like ""EUROS"", but E at 1.

""EUROS"": E, U, R, O, S. E at position 1 (which we haven't tested), R at position 3. Also, includes U,O,S.

This might be good because we test E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (3). And U, O, S are new letters.

Similarly, ""ESTER"" but has E twice? No, E appears twice? ""ESTER"": E,S,T,E,R - so two E's? In spelling, yes. But let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S, E, R, I, F. E at position 2, R at position 3. Position 2: we haven't tested E at position 2? No, in the previous guess, E was at 5, so position 2 is new for E.

Similarly, R is at position 3, which we haven't tested? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 3 might be right.

So ""SERIF"": 
- E at 2, R at 3? But the positions: letter1: S, letter2: E, letter3: R, letter4: I, letter5: F.

That should be fine.

But ""SERIF"" might be a bit obscure? Actually, serif is a term in typography, but it's valid.

More common words: How about ""BRIER""? But has two R's, and also B is not tested.

Another: ""TRIPE"" - T,R,I,P,E. R at position 2? We know position 2 is not for R? Wait, position 2: if R is in position 2 and we get '-' then we know R is in the word but not at 2? Actually, we already know R is not at position 2, so guessing R at 2 again would give '-' meaning the same thing? That doesn't help us locate R. Instead, we want to put R in a position we don't know about.

Therefore, avoid putting R at 2. In ""TRIPE"", R is at position 2: not good.

Same in ""CRANE"" R was at 2. So next guess: don't put R at 2.

Similarly, avoid E at 5.

Let me list possible words:
- Place R at position 1: E at position 2 or 3 or 4? But E at position 2: we can try.

Word with R at 1 and E at 2: ""REBUS"" (but has U, and S) — ""REBUS"" has E at 2? Position1: R, position2: E, position3: B, etc.

But ""REBUS"" is 5 letters? Yes: R-E-B-U-S.

Another: ""RESOW"" — not common.

""HELPS"" — but no R.

Maybe ""RICES"" — but C is eliminated? Wait, C is already eliminated? From the feedback, C is not in the word. So we cannot use C.

Thus, words containing C are banned.

So we cannot use words with C, A, N.

Back to ""EUROS"": E at position 1, R at position 3? Positions: E in pos1? If E is not in position 1, but in the word elsewhere, we'd get '-' for pos1 if it's not correct. But we don't know if E is at pos1 or not.

Similarly, R at pos3: might be correct.

Another common word: ""STORE"" but E is at 5: not good.

""ROBES"": R-O-B-E-S. R at 1, E at 4? Also includes B.

Or ""ROPED"": R-O-P-E-D. R at 1, E at 4.

But E at position 4.

To test multiple positions, let's pick a word that has E in a different slot and R in a different slot.

Since we don't have any position correct yet, we need to spread out new letters.

I think ""EUROS"" is acceptable: E, U, R, O, S.

Positions:
- E at 1: if the secret word has E at 1, it would be ✓, otherwise if E is in word but not at 1, then '-' (which tells us E is not at 1), but since we know E is in the word, we are trying to locate its position.
- R at 3: similarly, if not at 3 then '-', etc.

Another option: ""HOMER"" — but E is at position 5? No: H-O-M-E-R, E is at position 4? And R at 5? So E is at 4 (not 5) and R is at 5? But we don't know if R can be at 5 or not? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 5 is a new position for R.

But ""HOMER"" has H,O,M,E,R. We can try.

But ""EUROS"" seems better because it doesn't use two vowels? Actually, all are common letters.

But U is less common? Still, we need to test.

To maximize information, we can include frequent letters like S, T.

So perhaps ""TRIES"" is problematic because R is in position 2.

How about ""RITES"": R, I, T, E, S. R at position 1 (not 2), E at position 4? And also tests I,T,S.

But ""RITES"" is a valid word.

Compared to ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? But F might be less common than T? So ""RITES"" might be better with T.

Let's choose ""RITES"": R in position 1 (new), E in position 4 (new, not tried), and introduces I,T,S.

Also, avoids forbidden C,A,N.

So, my second guess: RITES

But note: in ""CRANE"", we had R and E shown to be in the word, but with no correct position.

In ""RITES"", R is at position 1, E at position 4.

If the secret word has R at position 1, it would be marked ✓. Similarly for E at position 4.

If not, we get '-' for them, meaning they are present but not in those positions.

We also test I, T, S: if any are present or not.

Let me confirm: we haven't tried any positions except in ""CRANE"" we tried R at 2 and E at 5.

Positions:
- Position 1: C was tried and not present (x), but we know nothing about other letters at position 1? We tried C at 1: marked x, meaning whatever is at position 1 is not C, but could be other letters.
Similarly, position 2: R was tried: not correct, so it's some other letter? But we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

Similarly, position 3: A was tried and not present? A was tried at 3? In ""CRANE"", positions: C at 1 (x), R at 2 (-), A at 3 (x), N at 4 (x), E at 5 (-). So position 3: A was tried and not present (x), so the letter at position 3 is not A. But we don't know what it is.

Position 4: N was tried and not present.

Position 5: E was tried and present but wrong position? E at 5: present but wrong position, so position 5 is occupied by a letter that is not E? Meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? Therefore, the letter at position 5 is not E, since E is elsewhere.

Similarly, position 2: R was present but not at position 2, so position 2 is not R.

Therefore, for our next guess:
- We can try to fill position 1 with something else, since we know it's not C.

Similarly, position 2 is not R? And position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, position 5 is not E? So the actual letters are unknown.

Therefore, when guessing ""RITES"" at position 1: R - if R is the correct letter for position 1, then ✓, otherwise if R is in the secret word but not here then it will be '-', or if R is not in secret at all? Wait we know R is in the secret word? Yes, because ""CRANE"" had R marked '-', meaning R is present.

Similarly, E is present.

So:
Position 1: if we put R and secret's position 1 is not R, then we get '-' meaning R is in word but not here, or if it is R then ✓.

Similarly for E at position 4: if secret's position 4 is E, then ✓, otherwise '-' meaning E exists but not at position 4.

Moreover, if we get 'x' for I, T, S that means they are not in word? But we don't know their presence.

Therefore, I think ""RITES"" is a decent guess.

Alternatively, ""STORE"" but E is at 5? Avoid.

Or ""SEDGE"" — but E is repeated.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""RITES"".

Guess: RITES

Response format: <guess>RITES</guess>

But for the thought process, I have it above.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C:❌, R:➖, A:❌, N:❌, E:➖), we deduced the following:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but their positions are not yet known (R was not in position 2, E was not in position 5).
- Letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word's positions are still largely unknown: Position 1 is not C, position 2 is not R, position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, and position 5 is not E.

For the second guess, we chose **RITES** because:
- It includes the known letters **R** and **E** from the secret word.
- **R** is placed in position 1 (a new position tested) and **E** in position 4 (a position not tested yet). This helps narrow down their locations.
- It introduces three new common letters (**I**, **T**, **S**) to gather more information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **A**, **N**) and repeated letters.
- By positioning **R** and **E** differently from the first guess, we maximize the feedback potential for locating them.

The word ""RITES"" is a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""R"" (e.g., plural of rite, meaning ceremonies or customs). Now, we await feedback to refine our next move.

<guess>RITES</guess>",RITES,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and E, but not C, A, N.

We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

Now, since R is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that the secret word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We must exclude the letters C, A, N from our next guess.

For our second guess, we want to test positions for R and E and also try to include new common letters to gather more information.

Let me think of words that:
- Contain R and E (since they are in the word)
- Do not contain C, A, N (since they are out)
- Place R in a different position than 2, and E in a different position than 5.

Moreover, we should try to cover more vowels or common consonants. Since A is out, we can try other vowels: I, O, U (though U is less common).

Common consonants left: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.

One idea: we have R and E to include. We know R is not at position 2. Let's try placing R at the beginning or in the middle.

Also, E is not at the end. So E could be in the middle or beginning.

Try a word that starts with R? But we don't know if R is at position 1. Similarly, E might be placed earlier.

Some words that come to mind:

Option 1: Try ""ROTES"" - but note we have S, which is common.

But let's check: R at position 1 (so if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get correct, otherwise wrong position). However, in our feedback, R was marked wrong position but we don't know where it should be.

Another option: ""RESET"" - but it has E twice? The word must have distinct letters? Actually, words can have repeated letters, but in our feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback becomes tricky. So maybe avoid double letters for early guesses.

Better to use words with unique letters to avoid confusion.

So, ""ROTES"": R, O, T, E, S. This has R at position 1, and E at position 4 (so not position 5).

But what about the letter O? We don't have any information about it.

Also, ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. This has R at position 4 and E at position 5? Oh, but E at position 5 is forbidden? Wait, no: the feedback only said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So that doesn't prohibit E from being in position 5? Wait, let me re-examine:

The feedback: for ""CRANE"", E was in position 5 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1-4.

So in a new guess, if we put E at position 5 again, that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. But if we put E elsewhere, we might get new information.

Similarly, R cannot be at position 2.

In ""STORE"", we have R at position 4 and E at position 5. But we know E at position 5 is invalid? Actually, we know from the previous feedback that the secret word does have E, but not at position 5. So if we guess ""STORE"" and E is at 5, we might get ""-"" again if E is in the word but not at 5? Actually, if the secret word has exactly one E and we put E at 5, then it would be marked '-' meaning present but not at 5. This does not give new information since we already know E is not at 5.

So better to put E at a position we haven't tried. Position 5 has been tried and failed, so put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we haven't tried any of those.

Similarly for R, we know position 2 didn't work, so put R in 1,3,4,5? We have 4 positions to try. But we tried position 2 and it was wrong.

Now, let me consider possible words:

Option: ""SPIRE"" - has S,P,I,R,E. But P and I haven't been tested.

However, let me think of words that include R and E and other common letters.

""TRIES"": T, R, I, E, S.
In this, R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2 (from feedback: when R was at position 2, it wasn't correct). Therefore, we should avoid guessing R at position 2 again? Actually, the feedback only says that position 2 was not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, it would likely give '-' again (unless the secret word has two R's, which is less common). To avoid confusion, better not to test the same position again early on.

Therefore, let's choose a word without R at position 2.

Similarly, avoid E at position 5.

So ""TRIES"" has R at position 2, which we should avoid.

""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E. R at 1, E at 5. E at 5: we already know it's not at 5, so would give ""-"" again? But we might also test the new letters O,U,T.

But it's not efficient to re-test E at 5.

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N. But N was already eliminated (N is in the word? Wait, feedback said N not in word? Yes, in CRANE, N was at position 4 and marked x, so N is out. So we cannot use RESIN because it has N.)

Similarly, we must avoid C, A, N.

So avoid N.

Another word: ""PILER"" - but that's not common.

""RISER"": has two R's? Avoid.

How about ""STERN"": S, T, E, R, N. But N is eliminated? So no.

Get words without forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

We want to use E and R, and introduce new letters.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But among these, common in English words: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

Now, let me think of a word that includes R, E, and other common letters, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

For example:
- Place R at position 1: words like ROBES, ROPES, but we don't know about B,P, etc.

""ROPES"": R, O, P, E, S. R at 1, E at 4. And E not at 5. Also, introduces O,P,S.

But ""ROPES"" has E at 4? We can try E in position 4.

Another one: ""STREP"" - but that's less common.

Or ""ROGUE"": R, O, G, U, E. R at 1, E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5, so it would be marked '-', which doesn't tell us anything new about E's position. Also, we have U, which is less common. Maybe not ideal.

Better to choose a word with E not at 5 and R not at 2.

Another idea: Place E at position 1? Words like ""EUROS"", but E at 1.

""EUROS"": E, U, R, O, S. E at position 1 (which we haven't tested), R at position 3. Also, includes U,O,S.

This might be good because we test E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (3). And U, O, S are new letters.

Similarly, ""ESTER"" but has E twice? No, E appears twice? ""ESTER"": E,S,T,E,R - so two E's? In spelling, yes. But let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S, E, R, I, F. E at position 2, R at position 3. Position 2: we haven't tested E at position 2? No, in the previous guess, E was at 5, so position 2 is new for E.

Similarly, R is at position 3, which we haven't tested? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 3 might be right.

So ""SERIF"": 
- E at 2, R at 3? But the positions: letter1: S, letter2: E, letter3: R, letter4: I, letter5: F.

That should be fine.

But ""SERIF"" might be a bit obscure? Actually, serif is a term in typography, but it's valid.

More common words: How about ""BRIER""? But has two R's, and also B is not tested.

Another: ""TRIPE"" - T,R,I,P,E. R at position 2? We know position 2 is not for R? Wait, position 2: if R is in position 2 and we get '-' then we know R is in the word but not at 2? Actually, we already know R is not at position 2, so guessing R at 2 again would give '-' meaning the same thing? That doesn't help us locate R. Instead, we want to put R in a position we don't know about.

Therefore, avoid putting R at 2. In ""TRIPE"", R is at position 2: not good.

Same in ""CRANE"" R was at 2. So next guess: don't put R at 2.

Similarly, avoid E at 5.

Let me list possible words:
- Place R at position 1: E at position 2 or 3 or 4? But E at position 2: we can try.

Word with R at 1 and E at 2: ""REBUS"" (but has U, and S) — ""REBUS"" has E at 2? Position1: R, position2: E, position3: B, etc.

But ""REBUS"" is 5 letters? Yes: R-E-B-U-S.

Another: ""RESOW"" — not common.

""HELPS"" — but no R.

Maybe ""RICES"" — but C is eliminated? Wait, C is already eliminated? From the feedback, C is not in the word. So we cannot use C.

Thus, words containing C are banned.

So we cannot use words with C, A, N.

Back to ""EUROS"": E at position 1, R at position 3? Positions: E in pos1? If E is not in position 1, but in the word elsewhere, we'd get '-' for pos1 if it's not correct. But we don't know if E is at pos1 or not.

Similarly, R at pos3: might be correct.

Another common word: ""STORE"" but E is at 5: not good.

""ROBES"": R-O-B-E-S. R at 1, E at 4? Also includes B.

Or ""ROPED"": R-O-P-E-D. R at 1, E at 4.

But E at position 4.

To test multiple positions, let's pick a word that has E in a different slot and R in a different slot.

Since we don't have any position correct yet, we need to spread out new letters.

I think ""EUROS"" is acceptable: E, U, R, O, S.

Positions:
- E at 1: if the secret word has E at 1, it would be ✓, otherwise if E is in word but not at 1, then '-' (which tells us E is not at 1), but since we know E is in the word, we are trying to locate its position.
- R at 3: similarly, if not at 3 then '-', etc.

Another option: ""HOMER"" — but E is at position 5? No: H-O-M-E-R, E is at position 4? And R at 5? So E is at 4 (not 5) and R is at 5? But we don't know if R can be at 5 or not? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 5 is a new position for R.

But ""HOMER"" has H,O,M,E,R. We can try.

But ""EUROS"" seems better because it doesn't use two vowels? Actually, all are common letters.

But U is less common? Still, we need to test.

To maximize information, we can include frequent letters like S, T.

So perhaps ""TRIES"" is problematic because R is in position 2.

How about ""RITES"": R, I, T, E, S. R at position 1 (not 2), E at position 4? And also tests I,T,S.

But ""RITES"" is a valid word.

Compared to ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? But F might be less common than T? So ""RITES"" might be better with T.

Let's choose ""RITES"": R in position 1 (new), E in position 4 (new, not tried), and introduces I,T,S.

Also, avoids forbidden C,A,N.

So, my second guess: RITES

But note: in ""CRANE"", we had R and E shown to be in the word, but with no correct position.

In ""RITES"", R is at position 1, E at position 4.

If the secret word has R at position 1, it would be marked ✓. Similarly for E at position 4.

If not, we get '-' for them, meaning they are present but not in those positions.

We also test I, T, S: if any are present or not.

Let me confirm: we haven't tried any positions except in ""CRANE"" we tried R at 2 and E at 5.

Positions:
- Position 1: C was tried and not present (x), but we know nothing about other letters at position 1? We tried C at 1: marked x, meaning whatever is at position 1 is not C, but could be other letters.
Similarly, position 2: R was tried: not correct, so it's some other letter? But we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

Similarly, position 3: A was tried and not present? A was tried at 3? In ""CRANE"", positions: C at 1 (x), R at 2 (-), A at 3 (x), N at 4 (x), E at 5 (-). So position 3: A was tried and not present (x), so the letter at position 3 is not A. But we don't know what it is.

Position 4: N was tried and not present.

Position 5: E was tried and present but wrong position? E at 5: present but wrong position, so position 5 is occupied by a letter that is not E? Meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? Therefore, the letter at position 5 is not E, since E is elsewhere.

Similarly, position 2: R was present but not at position 2, so position 2 is not R.

Therefore, for our next guess:
- We can try to fill position 1 with something else, since we know it's not C.

Similarly, position 2 is not R? And position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, position 5 is not E? So the actual letters are unknown.

Therefore, when guessing ""RITES"" at position 1: R - if R is the correct letter for position 1, then ✓, otherwise if R is in the secret word but not here then it will be '-', or if R is not in secret at all? Wait we know R is in the secret word? Yes, because ""CRANE"" had R marked '-', meaning R is present.

Similarly, E is present.

So:
Position 1: if we put R and secret's position 1 is not R, then we get '-' meaning R is in word but not here, or if it is R then ✓.

Similarly for E at position 4: if secret's position 4 is E, then ✓, otherwise '-' meaning E exists but not at position 4.

Moreover, if we get 'x' for I, T, S that means they are not in word? But we don't know their presence.

Therefore, I think ""RITES"" is a decent guess.

Alternatively, ""STORE"" but E is at 5? Avoid.

Or ""SEDGE"" — but E is repeated.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""RITES"".

Guess: RITES

Response format: <guess>RITES</guess>

But for the thought process, I have it above.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C:❌, R:➖, A:❌, N:❌, E:➖), we deduced the following:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but their positions are not yet known (R was not in position 2, E was not in position 5).
- Letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word's positions are still largely unknown: Position 1 is not C, position 2 is not R, position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, and position 5 is not E.

For the second guess, we chose **RITES** because:
- It includes the known letters **R** and **E** from the secret word.
- **R** is placed in position 1 (a new position tested) and **E** in position 4 (a position not tested yet). This helps narrow down their locations.
- It introduces three new common letters (**I**, **T**, **S**) to gather more information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **A**, **N**) and repeated letters.
- By positioning **R** and **E** differently from the first guess, we maximize the feedback potential for locating them.

The word ""RITES"" is a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""R"" (e.g., plural of rite, meaning ceremonies or customs). Now, we await feedback to refine our next move.",Guess 2: RITES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) T(x) E(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,skier,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get (i.e., covers common letters and positions).

One strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants. A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me consider:

- We have 5 positions. We want letters that are frequent in English 5-letter words.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A good starting word might be one that uses distinct letters and includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

I recall that ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used sometimes but less common.

But let's choose a word that is familiar and covers common letters.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: vowel
- N: common consonant (appearing in many words)
- E: vowel

It has four distinct consonants and one vowel (plus R being both consonant and vowel-like). Actually, it has two vowels: A and E.

Another candidate is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

But since I have to pick one, I choose ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess: CRANE

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and E, but not C, A, N.

We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

Now, since R is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that the secret word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We must exclude the letters C, A, N from our next guess.

For our second guess, we want to test positions for R and E and also try to include new common letters to gather more information.

Let me think of words that:
- Contain R and E (since they are in the word)
- Do not contain C, A, N (since they are out)
- Place R in a different position than 2, and E in a different position than 5.

Moreover, we should try to cover more vowels or common consonants. Since A is out, we can try other vowels: I, O, U (though U is less common).

Common consonants left: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.

One idea: we have R and E to include. We know R is not at position 2. Let's try placing R at the beginning or in the middle.

Also, E is not at the end. So E could be in the middle or beginning.

Try a word that starts with R? But we don't know if R is at position 1. Similarly, E might be placed earlier.

Some words that come to mind:

Option 1: Try ""ROTES"" - but note we have S, which is common.

But let's check: R at position 1 (so if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get correct, otherwise wrong position). However, in our feedback, R was marked wrong position but we don't know where it should be.

Another option: ""RESET"" - but it has E twice? The word must have distinct letters? Actually, words can have repeated letters, but in our feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback becomes tricky. So maybe avoid double letters for early guesses.

Better to use words with unique letters to avoid confusion.

So, ""ROTES"": R, O, T, E, S. This has R at position 1, and E at position 4 (so not position 5).

But what about the letter O? We don't have any information about it.

Also, ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. This has R at position 4 and E at position 5? Oh, but E at position 5 is forbidden? Wait, no: the feedback only said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So that doesn't prohibit E from being in position 5? Wait, let me re-examine:

The feedback: for ""CRANE"", E was in position 5 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1-4.

So in a new guess, if we put E at position 5 again, that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. But if we put E elsewhere, we might get new information.

Similarly, R cannot be at position 2.

In ""STORE"", we have R at position 4 and E at position 5. But we know E at position 5 is invalid? Actually, we know from the previous feedback that the secret word does have E, but not at position 5. So if we guess ""STORE"" and E is at 5, we might get ""-"" again if E is in the word but not at 5? Actually, if the secret word has exactly one E and we put E at 5, then it would be marked '-' meaning present but not at 5. This does not give new information since we already know E is not at 5.

So better to put E at a position we haven't tried. Position 5 has been tried and failed, so put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we haven't tried any of those.

Similarly for R, we know position 2 didn't work, so put R in 1,3,4,5? We have 4 positions to try. But we tried position 2 and it was wrong.

Now, let me consider possible words:

Option: ""SPIRE"" - has S,P,I,R,E. But P and I haven't been tested.

However, let me think of words that include R and E and other common letters.

""TRIES"": T, R, I, E, S.
In this, R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2 (from feedback: when R was at position 2, it wasn't correct). Therefore, we should avoid guessing R at position 2 again? Actually, the feedback only says that position 2 was not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, it would likely give '-' again (unless the secret word has two R's, which is less common). To avoid confusion, better not to test the same position again early on.

Therefore, let's choose a word without R at position 2.

Similarly, avoid E at position 5.

So ""TRIES"" has R at position 2, which we should avoid.

""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E. R at 1, E at 5. E at 5: we already know it's not at 5, so would give ""-"" again? But we might also test the new letters O,U,T.

But it's not efficient to re-test E at 5.

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N. But N was already eliminated (N is in the word? Wait, feedback said N not in word? Yes, in CRANE, N was at position 4 and marked x, so N is out. So we cannot use RESIN because it has N.)

Similarly, we must avoid C, A, N.

So avoid N.

Another word: ""PILER"" - but that's not common.

""RISER"": has two R's? Avoid.

How about ""STERN"": S, T, E, R, N. But N is eliminated? So no.

Get words without forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

We want to use E and R, and introduce new letters.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But among these, common in English words: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

Now, let me think of a word that includes R, E, and other common letters, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

For example:
- Place R at position 1: words like ROBES, ROPES, but we don't know about B,P, etc.

""ROPES"": R, O, P, E, S. R at 1, E at 4. And E not at 5. Also, introduces O,P,S.

But ""ROPES"" has E at 4? We can try E in position 4.

Another one: ""STREP"" - but that's less common.

Or ""ROGUE"": R, O, G, U, E. R at 1, E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5, so it would be marked '-', which doesn't tell us anything new about E's position. Also, we have U, which is less common. Maybe not ideal.

Better to choose a word with E not at 5 and R not at 2.

Another idea: Place E at position 1? Words like ""EUROS"", but E at 1.

""EUROS"": E, U, R, O, S. E at position 1 (which we haven't tested), R at position 3. Also, includes U,O,S.

This might be good because we test E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (3). And U, O, S are new letters.

Similarly, ""ESTER"" but has E twice? No, E appears twice? ""ESTER"": E,S,T,E,R - so two E's? In spelling, yes. But let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S, E, R, I, F. E at position 2, R at position 3. Position 2: we haven't tested E at position 2? No, in the previous guess, E was at 5, so position 2 is new for E.

Similarly, R is at position 3, which we haven't tested? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 3 might be right.

So ""SERIF"": 
- E at 2, R at 3? But the positions: letter1: S, letter2: E, letter3: R, letter4: I, letter5: F.

That should be fine.

But ""SERIF"" might be a bit obscure? Actually, serif is a term in typography, but it's valid.

More common words: How about ""BRIER""? But has two R's, and also B is not tested.

Another: ""TRIPE"" - T,R,I,P,E. R at position 2? We know position 2 is not for R? Wait, position 2: if R is in position 2 and we get '-' then we know R is in the word but not at 2? Actually, we already know R is not at position 2, so guessing R at 2 again would give '-' meaning the same thing? That doesn't help us locate R. Instead, we want to put R in a position we don't know about.

Therefore, avoid putting R at 2. In ""TRIPE"", R is at position 2: not good.

Same in ""CRANE"" R was at 2. So next guess: don't put R at 2.

Similarly, avoid E at 5.

Let me list possible words:
- Place R at position 1: E at position 2 or 3 or 4? But E at position 2: we can try.

Word with R at 1 and E at 2: ""REBUS"" (but has U, and S) — ""REBUS"" has E at 2? Position1: R, position2: E, position3: B, etc.

But ""REBUS"" is 5 letters? Yes: R-E-B-U-S.

Another: ""RESOW"" — not common.

""HELPS"" — but no R.

Maybe ""RICES"" — but C is eliminated? Wait, C is already eliminated? From the feedback, C is not in the word. So we cannot use C.

Thus, words containing C are banned.

So we cannot use words with C, A, N.

Back to ""EUROS"": E at position 1, R at position 3? Positions: E in pos1? If E is not in position 1, but in the word elsewhere, we'd get '-' for pos1 if it's not correct. But we don't know if E is at pos1 or not.

Similarly, R at pos3: might be correct.

Another common word: ""STORE"" but E is at 5: not good.

""ROBES"": R-O-B-E-S. R at 1, E at 4? Also includes B.

Or ""ROPED"": R-O-P-E-D. R at 1, E at 4.

But E at position 4.

To test multiple positions, let's pick a word that has E in a different slot and R in a different slot.

Since we don't have any position correct yet, we need to spread out new letters.

I think ""EUROS"" is acceptable: E, U, R, O, S.

Positions:
- E at 1: if the secret word has E at 1, it would be ✓, otherwise if E is in word but not at 1, then '-' (which tells us E is not at 1), but since we know E is in the word, we are trying to locate its position.
- R at 3: similarly, if not at 3 then '-', etc.

Another option: ""HOMER"" — but E is at position 5? No: H-O-M-E-R, E is at position 4? And R at 5? So E is at 4 (not 5) and R is at 5? But we don't know if R can be at 5 or not? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 5 is a new position for R.

But ""HOMER"" has H,O,M,E,R. We can try.

But ""EUROS"" seems better because it doesn't use two vowels? Actually, all are common letters.

But U is less common? Still, we need to test.

To maximize information, we can include frequent letters like S, T.

So perhaps ""TRIES"" is problematic because R is in position 2.

How about ""RITES"": R, I, T, E, S. R at position 1 (not 2), E at position 4? And also tests I,T,S.

But ""RITES"" is a valid word.

Compared to ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? But F might be less common than T? So ""RITES"" might be better with T.

Let's choose ""RITES"": R in position 1 (new), E in position 4 (new, not tried), and introduces I,T,S.

Also, avoids forbidden C,A,N.

So, my second guess: RITES

But note: in ""CRANE"", we had R and E shown to be in the word, but with no correct position.

In ""RITES"", R is at position 1, E at position 4.

If the secret word has R at position 1, it would be marked ✓. Similarly for E at position 4.

If not, we get '-' for them, meaning they are present but not in those positions.

We also test I, T, S: if any are present or not.

Let me confirm: we haven't tried any positions except in ""CRANE"" we tried R at 2 and E at 5.

Positions:
- Position 1: C was tried and not present (x), but we know nothing about other letters at position 1? We tried C at 1: marked x, meaning whatever is at position 1 is not C, but could be other letters.
Similarly, position 2: R was tried: not correct, so it's some other letter? But we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

Similarly, position 3: A was tried and not present? A was tried at 3? In ""CRANE"", positions: C at 1 (x), R at 2 (-), A at 3 (x), N at 4 (x), E at 5 (-). So position 3: A was tried and not present (x), so the letter at position 3 is not A. But we don't know what it is.

Position 4: N was tried and not present.

Position 5: E was tried and present but wrong position? E at 5: present but wrong position, so position 5 is occupied by a letter that is not E? Meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? Therefore, the letter at position 5 is not E, since E is elsewhere.

Similarly, position 2: R was present but not at position 2, so position 2 is not R.

Therefore, for our next guess:
- We can try to fill position 1 with something else, since we know it's not C.

Similarly, position 2 is not R? And position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, position 5 is not E? So the actual letters are unknown.

Therefore, when guessing ""RITES"" at position 1: R - if R is the correct letter for position 1, then ✓, otherwise if R is in the secret word but not here then it will be '-', or if R is not in secret at all? Wait we know R is in the secret word? Yes, because ""CRANE"" had R marked '-', meaning R is present.

Similarly, E is present.

So:
Position 1: if we put R and secret's position 1 is not R, then we get '-' meaning R is in word but not here, or if it is R then ✓.

Similarly for E at position 4: if secret's position 4 is E, then ✓, otherwise '-' meaning E exists but not at position 4.

Moreover, if we get 'x' for I, T, S that means they are not in word? But we don't know their presence.

Therefore, I think ""RITES"" is a decent guess.

Alternatively, ""STORE"" but E is at 5? Avoid.

Or ""SEDGE"" — but E is repeated.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""RITES"".

Guess: RITES

Response format: <guess>RITES</guess>

But for the thought process, I have it above.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C:❌, R:➖, A:❌, N:❌, E:➖), we deduced the following:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but their positions are not yet known (R was not in position 2, E was not in position 5).
- Letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word's positions are still largely unknown: Position 1 is not C, position 2 is not R, position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, and position 5 is not E.

For the second guess, we chose **RITES** because:
- It includes the known letters **R** and **E** from the secret word.
- **R** is placed in position 1 (a new position tested) and **E** in position 4 (a position not tested yet). This helps narrow down their locations.
- It introduces three new common letters (**I**, **T**, **S**) to gather more information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **A**, **N**) and repeated letters.
- By positioning **R** and **E** differently from the first guess, we maximize the feedback potential for locating them.

The word ""RITES"" is a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""R"" (e.g., plural of rite, meaning ceremonies or customs). Now, we await feedback to refine our next move.

Since it\'s the first guess, we don\'t have any prior information. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get (i.e., covers common letters and positions).\n\nOne strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants. A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me consider:\n\n- We have 5 positions. We want letters that are frequent in English 5-letter words.\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U\nCommon consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.\n\nA good starting word might be one that uses distinct letters and includes a mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nI recall that ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used sometimes but less common.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that is familiar and covers common letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n- C: common consonant\n- R: common consonant\n- A: vowel\n- N: common consonant (appearing in many words)\n- E: vowel\n\nIt has four distinct consonants and one vowel (plus R being both consonant and vowel-like). Actually, it has two vowels: A and E.\n\nAnother candidate is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.\n\nBut since I have to pick one, I choose ""CRANE"".\n\nSo, my first guess: CRANE\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""CRANE"").\n- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""CRANE"").\n- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains R and E, but not C, A, N.\n\nWe also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.\n\nNow, since R is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that the secret word is 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe must exclude the letters C, A, N from our next guess.\n\nFor our second guess, we want to test positions for R and E and also try to include new common letters to gather more information.\n\nLet me think of words that:\n- Contain R and E (since they are in the word)\n- Do not contain C, A, N (since they are out)\n- Place R in a different position than 2, and E in a different position than 5.\n\nMoreover, we should try to cover more vowels or common consonants. Since A is out, we can try other vowels: I, O, U (though U is less common).\n\nCommon consonants left: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.\n\nOne idea: we have R and E to include. We know R is not at position 2. Let\'s try placing R at the beginning or in the middle.\n\nAlso, E is not at the end. So E could be in the middle or beginning.\n\nTry a word that starts with R? But we don\'t know if R is at position 1. Similarly, E might be placed earlier.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\nOption 1: Try ""ROTES"" - but note we have S, which is common.\n\nBut let\'s check: R at position 1 (so if the secret word has R at position 1, we\'ll get correct, otherwise wrong position). However, in our feedback, R was marked wrong position but we don\'t know where it should be.\n\nAnother option: ""RESET"" - but it has E twice? The word must have distinct letters? Actually, words can have repeated letters, but in our feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback becomes tricky. So maybe avoid double letters for early guesses.\n\nBetter to use words with unique letters to avoid confusion.\n\nSo, ""ROTES"": R, O, T, E, S. This has R at position 1, and E at position 4 (so not position 5).\n\nBut what about the letter O? We don\'t have any information about it.\n\nAlso, ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. This has R at position 4 and E at position 5? Oh, but E at position 5 is forbidden? Wait, no: the feedback only said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So that doesn\'t prohibit E from being in position 5? Wait, let me re-examine:\n\nThe feedback: for ""CRANE"", E was in position 5 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1-4.\n\nSo in a new guess, if we put E at position 5 again, that would be wasteful because we already know it\'s not there. But if we put E elsewhere, we might get new information.\n\nSimilarly, R cannot be at position 2.\n\nIn ""STORE"", we have R at position 4 and E at position 5. But we know E at position 5 is invalid? Actually, we know from the previous feedback that the secret word does have E, but not at position 5. So if we guess ""STORE"" and E is at 5, we might get ""-"" again if E is in the word but not at 5? Actually, if the secret word has exactly one E and we put E at 5, then it would be marked \'-\' meaning present but not at 5. This does not give new information since we already know E is not at 5.\n\nSo better to put E at a position we haven\'t tried. Position 5 has been tried and failed, so put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we haven\'t tried any of those.\n\nSimilarly for R, we know position 2 didn\'t work, so put R in 1,3,4,5? We have 4 positions to try. But we tried position 2 and it was wrong.\n\nNow, let me consider possible words:\n\nOption: ""SPIRE"" - has S,P,I,R,E. But P and I haven\'t been tested.\n\nHowever, let me think of words that include R and E and other common letters.\n\n""TRIES"": T, R, I, E, S.\nIn this, R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2 (from feedback: when R was at position 2, it wasn\'t correct). Therefore, we should avoid guessing R at position 2 again? Actually, the feedback only says that position 2 was not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, it would likely give \'-\' again (unless the secret word has two R\'s, which is less common). To avoid confusion, better not to test the same position again early on.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose a word without R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid E at position 5.\n\nSo ""TRIES"" has R at position 2, which we should avoid.\n\n""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E. R at 1, E at 5. E at 5: we already know it\'s not at 5, so would give ""-"" again? But we might also test the new letters O,U,T.\n\nBut it\'s not efficient to re-test E at 5.\n\n""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N. But N was already eliminated (N is in the word? Wait, feedback said N not in word? Yes, in CRANE, N was at position 4 and marked x, so N is out. So we cannot use RESIN because it has N.)\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid C, A, N.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nAnother word: ""PILER"" - but that\'s not common.\n\n""RISER"": has two R\'s? Avoid.\n\nHow about ""STERN"": S, T, E, R, N. But N is eliminated? So no.\n\nGet words without forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden letters: C, A, N.\n\nWe want to use E and R, and introduce new letters.\n\nPossible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But among these, common in English words: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\nNow, let me think of a word that includes R, E, and other common letters, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nFor example:\n- Place R at position 1: words like ROBES, ROPES, but we don\'t know about B,P, etc.\n\n""ROPES"": R, O, P, E, S. R at 1, E at 4. And E not at 5. Also, introduces O,P,S.\n\nBut ""ROPES"" has E at 4? We can try E in position 4.\n\nAnother one: ""STREP"" - but that\'s less common.\n\nOr ""ROGUE"": R, O, G, U, E. R at 1, E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5, so it would be marked \'-\', which doesn\'t tell us anything new about E\'s position. Also, we have U, which is less common. Maybe not ideal.\n\nBetter to choose a word with E not at 5 and R not at 2.\n\nAnother idea: Place E at position 1? Words like ""EUROS"", but E at 1.\n\n""EUROS"": E, U, R, O, S. E at position 1 (which we haven\'t tested), R at position 3. Also, includes U,O,S.\n\nThis might be good because we test E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (3). And U, O, S are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ESTER"" but has E twice? No, E appears twice? ""ESTER"": E,S,T,E,R - so two E\'s? In spelling, yes. But let\'s avoid repeated letters if possible.\n\nAnother word: ""SERIF"": S, E, R, I, F. E at position 2, R at position 3. Position 2: we haven\'t tested E at position 2? No, in the previous guess, E was at 5, so position 2 is new for E.\n\nSimilarly, R is at position 3, which we haven\'t tested? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 3 might be right.\n\nSo ""SERIF"": \n- E at 2, R at 3? But the positions: letter1: S, letter2: E, letter3: R, letter4: I, letter5: F.\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nBut ""SERIF"" might be a bit obscure? Actually, serif is a term in typography, but it\'s valid.\n\nMore common words: How about ""BRIER""? But has two R\'s, and also B is not tested.\n\nAnother: ""TRIPE"" - T,R,I,P,E. R at position 2? We know position 2 is not for R? Wait, position 2: if R is in position 2 and we get \'-\' then we know R is in the word but not at 2? Actually, we already know R is not at position 2, so guessing R at 2 again would give \'-\' meaning the same thing? That doesn\'t help us locate R. Instead, we want to put R in a position we don\'t know about.\n\nTherefore, avoid putting R at 2. In ""TRIPE"", R is at position 2: not good.\n\nSame in ""CRANE"" R was at 2. So next guess: don\'t put R at 2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid E at 5.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- Place R at position 1: E at position 2 or 3 or 4? But E at position 2: we can try.\n\nWord with R at 1 and E at 2: ""REBUS"" (but has U, and S) — ""REBUS"" has E at 2? Position1: R, position2: E, position3: B, etc.\n\nBut ""REBUS"" is 5 letters? Yes: R-E-B-U-S.\n\nAnother: ""RESOW"" — not common.\n\n""HELPS"" — but no R.\n\nMaybe ""RICES"" — but C is eliminated? Wait, C is already eliminated? From the feedback, C is not in the word. So we cannot use C.\n\nThus, words containing C are banned.\n\nSo we cannot use words with C, A, N.\n\nBack to ""EUROS"": E at position 1, R at position 3? Positions: E in pos1? If E is not in position 1, but in the word elsewhere, we\'d get \'-\' for pos1 if it\'s not correct. But we don\'t know if E is at pos1 or not.\n\nSimilarly, R at pos3: might be correct.\n\nAnother common word: ""STORE"" but E is at 5: not good.\n\n""ROBES"": R-O-B-E-S. R at 1, E at 4? Also includes B.\n\nOr ""ROPED"": R-O-P-E-D. R at 1, E at 4.\n\nBut E at position 4.\n\nTo test multiple positions, let\'s pick a word that has E in a different slot and R in a different slot.\n\nSince we don\'t have any position correct yet, we need to spread out new letters.\n\nI think ""EUROS"" is acceptable: E, U, R, O, S.\n\nPositions:\n- E at 1: if the secret word has E at 1, it would be ✓, otherwise if E is in word but not at 1, then \'-\' (which tells us E is not at 1), but since we know E is in the word, we are trying to locate its position.\n- R at 3: similarly, if not at 3 then \'-\', etc.\n\nAnother option: ""HOMER"" — but E is at position 5? No: H-O-M-E-R, E is at position 4? And R at 5? So E is at 4 (not 5) and R is at 5? But we don\'t know if R can be at 5 or not? Previously R was at 2, which was wrong, so position 5 is a new position for R.\n\nBut ""HOMER"" has H,O,M,E,R. We can try.\n\nBut ""EUROS"" seems better because it doesn\'t use two vowels? Actually, all are common letters.\n\nBut U is less common? Still, we need to test.\n\nTo maximize information, we can include frequent letters like S, T.\n\nSo perhaps ""TRIES"" is problematic because R is in position 2.\n\nHow about ""RITES"": R, I, T, E, S. R at position 1 (not 2), E at position 4? And also tests I,T,S.\n\nBut ""RITES"" is a valid word.\n\nCompared to ""SERIF"": S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5? But F might be less common than T? So ""RITES"" might be better with T.\n\nLet\'s choose ""RITES"": R in position 1 (new), E in position 4 (new, not tried), and introduces I,T,S.\n\nAlso, avoids forbidden C,A,N.\n\nSo, my second guess: RITES\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", we had R and E shown to be in the word, but with no correct position.\n\nIn ""RITES"", R is at position 1, E at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 1, it would be marked ✓. Similarly for E at position 4.\n\nIf not, we get \'-\' for them, meaning they are present but not in those positions.\n\nWe also test I, T, S: if any are present or not.\n\nLet me confirm: we haven\'t tried any positions except in ""CRANE"" we tried R at 2 and E at 5.\n\nPositions:\n- Position 1: C was tried and not present (x), but we know nothing about other letters at position 1? We tried C at 1: marked x, meaning whatever is at position 1 is not C, but could be other letters.\nSimilarly, position 2: R was tried: not correct, so it\'s some other letter? But we know R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: A was tried and not present? A was tried at 3? In ""CRANE"", positions: C at 1 (x), R at 2 (-), A at 3 (x), N at 4 (x), E at 5 (-). So position 3: A was tried and not present (x), so the letter at position 3 is not A. But we don\'t know what it is.\n\nPosition 4: N was tried and not present.\n\nPosition 5: E was tried and present but wrong position? E at 5: present but wrong position, so position 5 is occupied by a letter that is not E? Meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? Therefore, the letter at position 5 is not E, since E is elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, position 2: R was present but not at position 2, so position 2 is not R.\n\nTherefore, for our next guess:\n- We can try to fill position 1 with something else, since we know it\'s not C.\n\nSimilarly, position 2 is not R? And position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, position 5 is not E? So the actual letters are unknown.\n\nTherefore, when guessing ""RITES"" at position 1: R - if R is the correct letter for position 1, then ✓, otherwise if R is in the secret word but not here then it will be \'-\', or if R is not in secret at all? Wait we know R is in the secret word? Yes, because ""CRANE"" had R marked \'-\', meaning R is present.\n\nSimilarly, E is present.\n\nSo:\nPosition 1: if we put R and secret\'s position 1 is not R, then we get \'-\' meaning R is in word but not here, or if it is R then ✓.\n\nSimilarly for E at position 4: if secret\'s position 4 is E, then ✓, otherwise \'-\' meaning E exists but not at position 4.\n\nMoreover, if we get \'x\' for I, T, S that means they are not in word? But we don\'t know their presence.\n\nTherefore, I think ""RITES"" is a decent guess.\n\nAlternatively, ""STORE"" but E is at 5? Avoid.\n\nOr ""SEDGE"" — but E is repeated.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""RITES"".\n\nGuess: RITES\n\nResponse format: <guess>RITES</guess>\n\nBut for the thought process, I have it above.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C:❌, R:➖, A:❌, N:❌, E:➖), we deduced the following:\n- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but their positions are not yet known (R was not in position 2, E was not in position 5).\n- Letters **C**, **A**, and **N** are **not** in the secret word.\n- The secret word\'s positions are still largely unknown: Position 1 is not C, position 2 is not R, position 3 is not A, position 4 is not N, and position 5 is not E.\n\nFor the second guess, we chose **RITES** because:\n- It includes the known letters **R** and **E** from the secret word.\n- **R** is placed in position 1 (a new position tested) and **E** in position 4 (a position not tested yet).

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, A, N: not in the word.
- R: in the word, but not in position 2.
- E: in the word, but not in position 5.

Guess 2: RITES -> R(-) I(-) T(x) E(✓) S(-)
Meaning:
- R: in the word, but not in position 1 (since it's '-').
- I: in the word, but not in position 2 (since feedback gives '-' for I at position 2).
- T: not in the word (x).
- E: in the word and in the CORRECT position! So E is at position 4. Because in RITES, E is in position 4 and we got ✓.
- S: in the word, but not in position 5 (since feedback gives '-' for S at position 5).

Summary of knowns:
- E is in position 4. (Confirmed by the ✓ in RITES)
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5.
- I is in the word, but not in position 2 (from RITES). Since we haven't tested position 3 or 5 for I, it could be in either.
- S is in the word, but not in position 5 (from RITES). So S is in some position other than 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, T, and from earlier, we also exclude others we haven't used but can infer.
- We have confirmed presence of: R, E, I, S, and one more unknown letter (since word is 5 letters).

We also know:
- From first guess: position 1 is not C (but C is out anyway), position 2 cannot be R, position 3 cannot be A, position 4 cannot be N (but now we know E is at position 4), position 5 cannot be E (but E is at position 4).
- From second guess: position 1 cannot be R (but R is not at position 1), position 2 cannot be I, position 3: T was guessed and is not in word (so position 3 is not T and T is absent), position 4 is E (confirmed), position 5 cannot be S.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- R is present and must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2 excluded).
- I is present and not in position 2, so possibly positions 1,3, or 5. But position 4 is E, so only positions 1,3,5 for I.
- S is present and not in position 5, so possibly positions 1,2,3.

The remaining letter: Since we have R, E, I, S in the word, and the word is 5 letters, there must be one more letter. We don't know what it is yet.

We have only used letters: C,R,A,N,E (first guess) and R,I,T,E,S (second guess). So forbidden: C, A, N, T.
Present: R, E, I, S, and one unknown.

Possible positions for R: only 3 or 5.
For I: 1,3,5 (but note, only one letter per position).
For S: 1,2,3.

We need to form a word that has E at position 4.

Also, since R is at 3 or 5, and I at 1,3,5, and S at 1,2,3, note that positions 3 and 5 are candidates for multiple letters.

If R is at position 3, then position 3 cannot be I or S. So I would have to be at 1 or 5, S at 1 or 2.
If R is at position 5, then position 3 is free for I or S.

We also need to guess a word that includes all these constraints.

Moreover, we haven't tested position 1 much. We tried C (not present) and R (not position 1). Similarly position 2: tried R (not), and I (not).

We need to check position 3: we tried A (not present) in first guess, but in second guess we tried T? Position 3 of RITES was T? And T was marked ""x"", meaning T not present in word? So position 3's letter is not T, but we don't know what it is.

To disambiguate, we should guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4 (fixed)
- Includes R, I, S
- The fifth letter must be one of the unused letters (excluding C,A,N,T)

Possible words:

First, let's consider possibilities for the fifth letter. We have 5-letter word without C,A,N,T.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, since R can be at position 3 or 5, we need to try to resolve that.

Option: Guess a word that forces R to show its position.

If R is at position 3, then position 5 must be something else. If R at position 5, then position 3 is another letter.

Similarly for I and S.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that tests multiple hypotheses.

Case 1: R at position 3
- Then word has: positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?
- But position 5 cannot be S (feedback said S not in position 5) and cannot be E. So position 5 is one of the unknown letters? But word must have S and I somewhere. S can be at 1 or 2, I can be at 1 or 5? Or position 5 could be another letter.

Let’s list possible structures:

Word pattern: __ __ ? E __

Where position 3 is either R or not R.

If position 3 is R, then:
- Word: ? ? R E ?
- Must contain I and S, and one more letter (since R,E,I,S and one more). The letters at positions 1,2,5: two of which must be I and S? Or position 1 and 2? And position 5 is the unknown or I/S.

But position 1 cannot have R (we know from RITES feedback that R not at 1), position 2 cannot be R or I? Position 2 also cannot be S? Not necessarily: we don't know position 2 constraints except that position 2 is not R (from first guess) and not I (from second guess).

So for position 2, we have tried: first guess R (not), second guess I (not). So position 2 is neither R nor I. What else? It could be a new letter or S? But S is allowed? But we haven't succeeded.

In this case, if position 3 is R:
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: E
- Positions 1,2,5: one must be I, one S, and the fifth letter is a new one. Also, S cannot be at position 5 (from RITES), so S must be at position 1 or 2.
- I must be at position 1 or 5? Since position 2 cannot be I (tried and not), position 3 is R, position 4 is E, so I can be at 1 or 5.

Now, position 1: cannot be R (already feedback), and what we tried: C (not). There is no constraint on a letter at position 1 except it must be one of the letters in the word.

Similarly, position 5: cannot be E and cannot be S? Cannot be S? From RITES, S at position 5 was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? No: in RITES, position 5 is S, and feedback for S is '-', meaning S is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore, position 5 cannot be S? Yes: but S must be in the word, just not at position 5. So position 5 of the secret word is not S. Similarly, not E.

So position 5 can be I or the new letter.

But I could also be at position 1.

Similarly, if we don't assume R at position 3.

To avoid assumption, let's think of a word that has:
- E at position 4
- Includes R, I, S
- Doesn't include forbidden letters: C, A, N, T
- And new fifth letter

Also, we need to position R at either 3 or 5.

Similarly, I not at position 2, S not at position 5.

Possible word: Position 5 must be filled. If we put R at position 5, then it might be correct? Or if not, we get '-'.

Similarly, if we put I at position 1, etc.

Common word: ""RISE"" is 4 letter? No, need 5-letter.

""PRISE"": P,R,I,S,E
But E at position 5? We need E at position 4.

In ""PRISE"": P at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Not E at 4? So no.

Need a word with E at 4.

For example:
- ...?E pattern.

Words: BRISE? Not common. ORDIE? No.

""OXIDE"": O,X,I,D,E -> positions: O at1, X at2, I at3, D at4, E at5? Not E at4.

E at position 4: so the ending is ...E? No, position 4 is E.

So pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, E, letter5

For example: "" SPIRE "" S,P,I,R,E -> S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5? Not E at4.

But we need E at position 4, so in SPIRE, E is at position 5? That's wrong.

Correct pattern: positions 1,2,3, E (at4),5.

So words like: BRINE? But N is forbidden? And E at4 is not, because BRINE: B-R-I-N-E, position4 is N? Not E.

More carefully: E must be at the fourth position.

Word: ? ? ? E ?

Examples: 
- TIMES: T,I,M,E,S? Positions: T1, I2, M3, E4, S5? Yes, E at position 4.

Similarly, ""LIVES"": L1,I2,V3,E4,S5? Not necessarily valid? But let's see.

""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S

However, in our case, T is forbidden? From previous feedback? In guess 2, T was in ""RITES"" at position 3? And marked x, meaning T is not in the word. So we cannot have TIMES because it contains T and has E at 4.

Forbidden: C,A,N,T.

So avoid T.

Another word: ""RIDES"": R,I,D,E,S? Positions: R1, I2, D3, E4, S5? But position 1: R? But from RITES feedback, R is not at position 1, so RIDES has R at position 1: it would be incorrect since R not at position 1. Hence, it would be wasteful? Because we know R not at position 1.

Similarly, we want to avoid position 1 being R? Or we can guess but it will likely get '-' meaning present but wrong position, which we know? So that doesn't give new position? Similarly, position 2 cannot be I? Also known.

So for third guess, we want to test new positions for R, I, S.

Specifically:
- Since we know E is fixed at position 4, we can focus on positions 1,2,3,5 for R,I,S, and the fifth letter.

Where:
- R: should be at position 3 or 5
- I: can be at position 1,3,5? But not position 2.
- S: can be at position 1,2,3? Not position 5.

Now, position 3 is a candidate for multiple: it could be R, I, S, or the fifth letter.

Similarly, the fifth letter is unknown.

To maximize information, we want to test R at position 3 or 5? And I and S at new positions.

For example:
- Guess a word that has R at position 5? Since position 5 has not been tested much? Previously we tried E at 5? But E was '-', meaning not there? But position 5 contents unknown.

If we put R at position 5 and it's correct? Then R would be ✓, else '-' meaning not at position 5? But then if it gets '-', we know R must be at position 3.

Similarly, we should test position 3: put a letter there that could be I or S? But we don't want to confuse.

Since S cannot be at position 5, put S at position 1 or 2? Test one.

Similarly, I cannot at position 2? So test I at position 1 or 3? Or 5.

Let's pick a word that has:
- Position 3: R? Or put I? etc.

Word: ""? ? ? E E""? But repeated letters? Avoid.

Specific: ""SINCE""? But C and E repeat and C forbidden? No.

""SHIRE"": S,H,I,R,E? Positions: S1, H2, I3, R4? But E is not at position 4: E at position 5? Wrong.

Need E at 4: ""SHIRE"" is S,H,I,R,E -> positions: S1, H2, I3, R4, E5? Not E at position 4.

Words with E at 4: for example, ""ABODE""? A forbidden.

""CRUDE""? C forbidden.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? Positions: G1, R2, I3, M4, E5? No, position 4 is M? Not E.

""DRIVE"": D,R,I,V,E? Same, E at position 5.

We need position 4 to be E? So pattern: ___ E _

For example: ""CA USE"" separated? Single word: FUDGE? But G at 4? Not E.

Common words with E at 4: 
- TIMES? But T forbidden.
- LIVES? Might work: L,I,V,E,S? But E is at position 4? L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, S at5? Yes? But E at position 4? Yes, position 4 is E.

Similarly, ""DINES"": D,I,N,E,S? But N is forbidden? We cannot use N.

""WIPES"": W,I,P,E,S? Positions: W1, I2, P3, E4, S5? Yes.

But does it have different letters? Yes. And forbidden letters: C,A,N,T are not included? W,I,P,E,S — all allowed? We haven't used W,P before, but not forbidden.

In ""WIPES"", we have I at position 2? But we know I cannot be at position 2? From RITES feedback: I was at position 2? In RITES: positions: R1, I2, T3, E4, S5? And I was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, ""WIPES"" has I at position 2 again? But position 2 is not I? So guessing I at position 2 again would give '-' meaning present but wrong position, which doesn't tell us anything new. It re-tests the same information? We know I is not at position 2, so avoid.

Similarly, we should avoid placing I at position 2 or R at position 1 or 2? R position 1 already tested and not, so avoid putting R at 1.

In ""WIPES"", I is at position 2? That's the same slot we know is wrong? So don't do that.

Instead, put I at a new position: position 1, or 3, or 5.

Similarly for R.

Let me find a word with E at 4 and the configuration.

For example: ""BR I S E""? But B,R,I,S,E? Positions: B1, R2, I3, S4? Not E at4.

Wrong.

""H E R O S""? H1,E2,R3,O4,S5? Not E at4.

Need E at position 4: for example: ""  ... K E D "" but no, E must be fourth.

Another word: ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R? Positions: O1, L2, D3, E4? E is at position 4? Then R at5? R at position 5? And we don't have I? Or S? But the word doesn't contain I or S? But we know I and S must be in the word? So this word wouldn't work? Because it doesn't include I and S.

We must include I and S? Since they are in the word.

So the fifth letter is one more letter? But the word has E,R,I,S, and one more? And we need to include I and S.

So our guess must have I and S? Or not, but we know they are in the word, so guessing without them would be inefficient? Because if we don't include, we might miss them.

We should include R, I, S, and E (already fixed at 4), and one new letter? In the word, we have R,I,S,E, and one more letter.

For third guess, guess a word that contains R,I,S,E,X where X is a new letter? Or use one of them at multiple positions? But better distinct.

So ideal: a word with E at position 4, and including R, I, S.

Now, positions:
- E fixed at 4.
- R at position? We want to test position 5 for R? Or position 3.
- I at position? Not position 2? So position 1,3,5.
- S at position? Not position 5? So position 1,2,3.

If we put at position 5: we can put R there? To test if R is position 5.

Similarly, put S at position 1 and I at position 3? Etc.

Another word: ""RINSE""? R1,I2,N3,E4,S5? But N is forbidden? And we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""RUSES""? Doesn't have E? At 4? R,U,S,E,S? Repeated S? And E at position 4: yes? But has two S's? Forbidden? Not necessarily, but could make feedback messy.

Examples: ""U R I S E"" - but no single word.

"" P R I S E "": P,R,I,S,E? But E is at position 5? Not 4.

There is ""PRISE"" but spelled P-R-I-S-E? Positions: P1, R2, I3, S4, E5? Again E at5.

Ah, consistently the ending.

Consider ""QUIRE""? Q,U,I,R,E? Positions: Q1, U2, I3, R4, E5? Not E at4.

Difficult?

Let me think of words ending with E as the fourth letter? Meaning fifth letter after.

For example: ""AGILE"" A at1, G at2, I at3, L at4, E at5? Not.

Words where E is fourth: ""AISLE"" A1,I2,S3,L4,E5? No, position 4 is L.

Better: many words ending in  a E  at the fourth position?: for example, ""PLANE"" but N forbidden.

""PHAGE""? H at3, E at4? P,H,A,G,E? Positions: P1, H2, A? A forbidden.

Wait, common words: ""TIMES"" T forbidden.

""LIKES"" L1,I2,K3,E4,S5? E at position 4? Yes: position 1:L,2:I,3:K,4:E,5:S? But I at position 2? We know I is not at position 2? So guessing I at position 2 again would be bad.

Similarly, we need to avoid I at position 2.

How about ""SKIED""? S,K,I,E,D? Positions: S1,K2,I3,E4,D5? Yes, E at position 4! And I at position 3? Not at 2.

This might work: ""SKIED"" 
- S at position 1, K new, I at position 3, E at position 4, D new.

But K and D are new letters.

Now, does it include I, S, E? Yes? But also K and D.

But we must include R? Oh, I forgot R. The secret word has R, so we must include R in our guess to test its position? Otherwise, if we omit R, then even if the word is say ""SKIED"", the R position won't be tested? But we know R is in the word, so how can we guess without R? It might be valid? But the secret has R, so if we guess ""SKIED"", and it has no R, then R will be marked? But that could confuse? Also, we are trying to find the secret.

We know R is in the word, so any valid guess must include R? Not necessarily? But if we don't, then the feedback might show R as missing? But since it's present, it would be strange? No: if we guess ""SKIED"", and the secret has R, then the R in secret would be inferred as missing in our guess? But the feedback will show that our guess has letters that might be correct or not.

But specifically, if the secret has R and we don't guess it, then the feedback won't reveal anything about R. Since we only have 4 guesses left? It's better to include R to pin it down.

So we should include R in our guess.

Therefore, ""SKIED"" omits R? So not ideal.

Word that includes R,E at4, I,S? And fifth letter.

And E at position 4.

For example: ""BRIES""? B,R,I,E,S? But E at position 4? Positions: B1,R2,I3,E4,S5? Yes!

""BRIES"": B at position 1, R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? From first guess. In ""CRANE"" R at position 2 was marked '-' meaning not there? But was the position wrong? Or the letter? So position 2 is not R? Therefore, if we guess ""BRIES"" with R at position 2, it would give '-' again? Meaning present but wrong position? Which is redundant? So avoid.

Similarly, I at position 3: we haven't tested position 3 for I? So it could be.

S at position 5: but we know S is not at position 5? From RITES feedback? S at position 5: marked '-' meaning in word but not at 5? So if we put S at position 5 again, it would be '-'? So also redundant.

In ""BRIES"": position 2 is R (forbidden for R), position 5 is S (forbidden for S)? So both will be '-' but not new information? So not good.

""DRIVE"" has E at 5? No.

Another word: ""OWRIE""? Not common.

""ORRIS""? Repeated R.

""PERIS"": P,E,R,I,S? E at position 2? Not at4.

Hard.

Let me think of ""R"" at position 5: so word like ? ? ? E R

But also includes I and S? ? ? ? E R

And S and I must be placed.

For example: ""VISER""? V,I,S,E,R? Positions: V1, I2, S3, E4, R5? Yes! E at position 4, R at position 5.

But I at position 2? Position 2 cannot be I? So if we guess I at position 2, it would be a waste? It will be marked '-' which we already know.

But it tests S at position 3 and R at position 5.

And introduces V.

Similarly, the secret word has I, so I must be with a different position? Here I am forced to be at 2? Which is bad.

""USERI""? Not word.

""RISEN"" has N? Forbidden.

""FRIES"": F,R,I,E,S? Positions: F1,R2,I3,E4,S5? R at position 2: not allowed? S at position 5: not allowed? Same issues.

To avoid position 2 for I and R, position 5 for S, we need to place R at position 3 or 5? And I at position 1,3, or 5? S at position 1,2,3.

Put R at position 5 (as above), then S must be at position 1,2, or 3, and I at position 1 or 3.

Then we can guess ""??I E R"" but I at position 3? Then word: position 1,2,3=I,4=E,5=R.

But the letter at position 3 would be I? But R at position 5.

For instance, ""??IER"" words: ""PREIER"" not word.

""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Positions: P1, L2, I3, E4, R5? Yes! E at position 4, R at position 5, I at position 3.

But we need to include S? Where is S? This word ""PLIER"" does not include S? But S is in the secret word? So we must have S in our guess? Otherwise, it will be missing.

The secret has S, so if we guess ""PLIER"", and the secret has S, then S will be marked as missing in feedback? But that doesn't help us find its position? And we will know that the guess is wrong because S is not included.

But we can do that? However, it's inefficient because we're not testing S at all.

Instead, let's choose a word that includes S, for example: ""SLIER"": S,L,I,E,R? Positions: S1, L2, I3, E4, R5.

But S at position 1? We haven't tested that? I at position 3? Not position 2.

R at position 5: we want to test if R is at 5.

Also, includes L (new).

G2 feedback: I is in the word but not at position 2, so I at position 3 is new? S at position 1: new? And S at position 1: if not correct, then '-', meaning S present but not there.

So ""SLIER"" seems good? Or ""S LI E R"".

But ""SLIER"" is a valid word? Slier means more sly? Yes, adjective.

Similarly, feedback: position 3: I? If the secret has I at position 3, then we get ✓, else '-'.

Similarly, position 1: S? If secret position 1 is S, then ✓, else if S is in word but not here, then '-'.

Position 5: R? If secret position 5 is R, then ✓, else '-'.

If we get ✓ for R at position 5, great? Or if not, we know R is at position 3? Since the only other option.

Also, we use distinct letters: S,L,I,E,R? E fixed at 4? Yes.

And no forbidden letters? Yes. L is new.

So I think ""SLIER"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""SHIER"": S,H,I,E,R? Same as above, but H instead of L? S1,H2,I3,E4,R5? But position 2: H? We haven't tested position 2? We tried R and I, but H is new. But if I at position 3 is the same.

But position 2: we have no constraints, so H is fine.

But ""SHIER"" has I at position 3? And E at4, R at5.

Also valid? Yes.

But ""SLIER"" or ""SHIER"" both are possible? Or ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? K a new letter.

But ""SKIER"" is common.

We can use any? I'll pick ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? Positions: S1, K2, I3, E4, R5.

So we test:
- S at position 1: may be correct or show it's elsewhere.
- I at position 3: may be correct or not.
- R at position 5: may be correct or not? If not, we know R must be at position 3? But position 3 is taken by I in this guess? So if secret R is at position 3, then in ""SKIER"", R is at position 5? Which would be marked '-' (not position 5), and I at position 3: if R is at position 3, I won't be at position 3? But we know both I and R are in the word? How can position 3 have both? So they cannot both be at 3? Thus, if R is at position 3, then in ""SKIER"", position 3 is I, which might be wrong? So feedback might show I at position 3 as 'x'? Meaning not in word? But I is in the word? Or '-' if it is in the word but not at 3.

But if secret has position 3: R, then when we put I at position 3, it could be '-' for I, meaning I is in word but not at position 3.

Similarly, R at position 5 would be '-' meaning in word but not at 5? Then we know R must be at 3.

Similarly, if R is at position 5 in secret, then putting R at 5 will be ✓, etc.

Also, we will find out if S at position 1 is correct.

So even if it overlaps, the feedback will clarify.

Moreover, it covers all required: R, I, S, E.

So good word: ""SKIER""

Thus, our third guess: SKIER

<guess>SKIER</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(❌) R(➖) A(❌) N(❌) E(➖)  
  Meaning:  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
  - R and E are present but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: RITES** → R(➖) I(➖) T(❌) E(✓) S(➖)  
  Meaning:  
  - T is absent.  
  - R is present but not in position 1.  
  - I is present but not in position 2.  
  - E is correct and in position 4.  
  - S is present but not in position 5.  

### Deductions:
1. **E is fixed at position 4** (E at position 4 is ✓).  
2. **R must be at position 3 or 5** (all other positions ruled out: ❌ at 1 from RITES, ❌ at 2 from CRANE).  
3. **I cannot be at position 2** (➖ from RITES) and must be at position 1, 3, or 5.  
4. **S cannot be at position 5** (➖ from RITES) and must be at position 1, 2, or 3.  
5. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T (confirmed ❌ from both guesses).  
   - Avoid using these in future guesses.  
6. **Present letters (known)**: R, E (fixed at position 4), I, S.  
   - The secret word contains one additional unknown letter (since it has five distinct letters so far).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on resolving R's position (position 3 or 5) and narrowing down positions for I and S.  
- Test a word that:  
  - Keeps E at position 4.  
  - Includes R, I, and S to probe their positions.  
  - Introduces a new letter to gather more information.  
- To maximize information:  
  - Place R at position 5 to test if it belongs there (✓ would confirm; ➖ would imply R is at position 3).  
  - Place I at position 3 to test its position (uncharted slot).  
  - Place S at position 1 to test its position (uncharted slot).  
- Avoid forbidden positions:  
  - No R at position 1 or 2.  
  - No I at position 2.  
  - No S at position 5.  

Selected word: **SKIER** (S at position 1, K at position 2, I at position 3, E at position 4, R at position 5).  
- Why?  
  - Valid 5-letter word (e.g., ""skier,"" relating to skiing).  
  - Tests key positions: R at 5, I at 3, S at 1 (all new).  
  - Uses all known present letters (R, I, S, E) plus K (new letter, common).  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, T).  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - Feedback will quickly resolve R's position (position 5 or, if ➖, position 3).  
  - Clarifies positions for I and S.  
  - K provides additional coverage.  

<guess>SKIER</guess>",SKIER,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, A, N: not in the word.
- R: in the word, but not in position 2.
- E: in the word, but not in position 5.

Guess 2: RITES -> R(-) I(-) T(x) E(✓) S(-)
Meaning:
- R: in the word, but not in position 1 (since it's '-').
- I: in the word, but not in position 2 (since feedback gives '-' for I at position 2).
- T: not in the word (x).
- E: in the word and in the CORRECT position! So E is at position 4. Because in RITES, E is in position 4 and we got ✓.
- S: in the word, but not in position 5 (since feedback gives '-' for S at position 5).

Summary of knowns:
- E is in position 4. (Confirmed by the ✓ in RITES)
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5.
- I is in the word, but not in position 2 (from RITES). Since we haven't tested position 3 or 5 for I, it could be in either.
- S is in the word, but not in position 5 (from RITES). So S is in some position other than 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, T, and from earlier, we also exclude others we haven't used but can infer.
- We have confirmed presence of: R, E, I, S, and one more unknown letter (since word is 5 letters).

We also know:
- From first guess: position 1 is not C (but C is out anyway), position 2 cannot be R, position 3 cannot be A, position 4 cannot be N (but now we know E is at position 4), position 5 cannot be E (but E is at position 4).
- From second guess: position 1 cannot be R (but R is not at position 1), position 2 cannot be I, position 3: T was guessed and is not in word (so position 3 is not T and T is absent), position 4 is E (confirmed), position 5 cannot be S.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- R is present and must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2 excluded).
- I is present and not in position 2, so possibly positions 1,3, or 5. But position 4 is E, so only positions 1,3,5 for I.
- S is present and not in position 5, so possibly positions 1,2,3.

The remaining letter: Since we have R, E, I, S in the word, and the word is 5 letters, there must be one more letter. We don't know what it is yet.

We have only used letters: C,R,A,N,E (first guess) and R,I,T,E,S (second guess). So forbidden: C, A, N, T.
Present: R, E, I, S, and one unknown.

Possible positions for R: only 3 or 5.
For I: 1,3,5 (but note, only one letter per position).
For S: 1,2,3.

We need to form a word that has E at position 4.

Also, since R is at 3 or 5, and I at 1,3,5, and S at 1,2,3, note that positions 3 and 5 are candidates for multiple letters.

If R is at position 3, then position 3 cannot be I or S. So I would have to be at 1 or 5, S at 1 or 2.
If R is at position 5, then position 3 is free for I or S.

We also need to guess a word that includes all these constraints.

Moreover, we haven't tested position 1 much. We tried C (not present) and R (not position 1). Similarly position 2: tried R (not), and I (not).

We need to check position 3: we tried A (not present) in first guess, but in second guess we tried T? Position 3 of RITES was T? And T was marked ""x"", meaning T not present in word? So position 3's letter is not T, but we don't know what it is.

To disambiguate, we should guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4 (fixed)
- Includes R, I, S
- The fifth letter must be one of the unused letters (excluding C,A,N,T)

Possible words:

First, let's consider possibilities for the fifth letter. We have 5-letter word without C,A,N,T.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, since R can be at position 3 or 5, we need to try to resolve that.

Option: Guess a word that forces R to show its position.

If R is at position 3, then position 5 must be something else. If R at position 5, then position 3 is another letter.

Similarly for I and S.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that tests multiple hypotheses.

Case 1: R at position 3
- Then word has: positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?
- But position 5 cannot be S (feedback said S not in position 5) and cannot be E. So position 5 is one of the unknown letters? But word must have S and I somewhere. S can be at 1 or 2, I can be at 1 or 5? Or position 5 could be another letter.

Let’s list possible structures:

Word pattern: __ __ ? E __

Where position 3 is either R or not R.

If position 3 is R, then:
- Word: ? ? R E ?
- Must contain I and S, and one more letter (since R,E,I,S and one more). The letters at positions 1,2,5: two of which must be I and S? Or position 1 and 2? And position 5 is the unknown or I/S.

But position 1 cannot have R (we know from RITES feedback that R not at 1), position 2 cannot be R or I? Position 2 also cannot be S? Not necessarily: we don't know position 2 constraints except that position 2 is not R (from first guess) and not I (from second guess).

So for position 2, we have tried: first guess R (not), second guess I (not). So position 2 is neither R nor I. What else? It could be a new letter or S? But S is allowed? But we haven't succeeded.

In this case, if position 3 is R:
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: E
- Positions 1,2,5: one must be I, one S, and the fifth letter is a new one. Also, S cannot be at position 5 (from RITES), so S must be at position 1 or 2.
- I must be at position 1 or 5? Since position 2 cannot be I (tried and not), position 3 is R, position 4 is E, so I can be at 1 or 5.

Now, position 1: cannot be R (already feedback), and what we tried: C (not). There is no constraint on a letter at position 1 except it must be one of the letters in the word.

Similarly, position 5: cannot be E and cannot be S? Cannot be S? From RITES, S at position 5 was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? No: in RITES, position 5 is S, and feedback for S is '-', meaning S is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore, position 5 cannot be S? Yes: but S must be in the word, just not at position 5. So position 5 of the secret word is not S. Similarly, not E.

So position 5 can be I or the new letter.

But I could also be at position 1.

Similarly, if we don't assume R at position 3.

To avoid assumption, let's think of a word that has:
- E at position 4
- Includes R, I, S
- Doesn't include forbidden letters: C, A, N, T
- And new fifth letter

Also, we need to position R at either 3 or 5.

Similarly, I not at position 2, S not at position 5.

Possible word: Position 5 must be filled. If we put R at position 5, then it might be correct? Or if not, we get '-'.

Similarly, if we put I at position 1, etc.

Common word: ""RISE"" is 4 letter? No, need 5-letter.

""PRISE"": P,R,I,S,E
But E at position 5? We need E at position 4.

In ""PRISE"": P at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Not E at 4? So no.

Need a word with E at 4.

For example:
- ...?E pattern.

Words: BRISE? Not common. ORDIE? No.

""OXIDE"": O,X,I,D,E -> positions: O at1, X at2, I at3, D at4, E at5? Not E at4.

E at position 4: so the ending is ...E? No, position 4 is E.

So pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, E, letter5

For example: "" SPIRE "" S,P,I,R,E -> S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5? Not E at4.

But we need E at position 4, so in SPIRE, E is at position 5? That's wrong.

Correct pattern: positions 1,2,3, E (at4),5.

So words like: BRINE? But N is forbidden? And E at4 is not, because BRINE: B-R-I-N-E, position4 is N? Not E.

More carefully: E must be at the fourth position.

Word: ? ? ? E ?

Examples: 
- TIMES: T,I,M,E,S? Positions: T1, I2, M3, E4, S5? Yes, E at position 4.

Similarly, ""LIVES"": L1,I2,V3,E4,S5? Not necessarily valid? But let's see.

""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S

However, in our case, T is forbidden? From previous feedback? In guess 2, T was in ""RITES"" at position 3? And marked x, meaning T is not in the word. So we cannot have TIMES because it contains T and has E at 4.

Forbidden: C,A,N,T.

So avoid T.

Another word: ""RIDES"": R,I,D,E,S? Positions: R1, I2, D3, E4, S5? But position 1: R? But from RITES feedback, R is not at position 1, so RIDES has R at position 1: it would be incorrect since R not at position 1. Hence, it would be wasteful? Because we know R not at position 1.

Similarly, we want to avoid position 1 being R? Or we can guess but it will likely get '-' meaning present but wrong position, which we know? So that doesn't give new position? Similarly, position 2 cannot be I? Also known.

So for third guess, we want to test new positions for R, I, S.

Specifically:
- Since we know E is fixed at position 4, we can focus on positions 1,2,3,5 for R,I,S, and the fifth letter.

Where:
- R: should be at position 3 or 5
- I: can be at position 1,3,5? But not position 2.
- S: can be at position 1,2,3? Not position 5.

Now, position 3 is a candidate for multiple: it could be R, I, S, or the fifth letter.

Similarly, the fifth letter is unknown.

To maximize information, we want to test R at position 3 or 5? And I and S at new positions.

For example:
- Guess a word that has R at position 5? Since position 5 has not been tested much? Previously we tried E at 5? But E was '-', meaning not there? But position 5 contents unknown.

If we put R at position 5 and it's correct? Then R would be ✓, else '-' meaning not at position 5? But then if it gets '-', we know R must be at position 3.

Similarly, we should test position 3: put a letter there that could be I or S? But we don't want to confuse.

Since S cannot be at position 5, put S at position 1 or 2? Test one.

Similarly, I cannot at position 2? So test I at position 1 or 3? Or 5.

Let's pick a word that has:
- Position 3: R? Or put I? etc.

Word: ""? ? ? E E""? But repeated letters? Avoid.

Specific: ""SINCE""? But C and E repeat and C forbidden? No.

""SHIRE"": S,H,I,R,E? Positions: S1, H2, I3, R4? But E is not at position 4: E at position 5? Wrong.

Need E at 4: ""SHIRE"" is S,H,I,R,E -> positions: S1, H2, I3, R4, E5? Not E at position 4.

Words with E at 4: for example, ""ABODE""? A forbidden.

""CRUDE""? C forbidden.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? Positions: G1, R2, I3, M4, E5? No, position 4 is M? Not E.

""DRIVE"": D,R,I,V,E? Same, E at position 5.

We need position 4 to be E? So pattern: ___ E _

For example: ""CA USE"" separated? Single word: FUDGE? But G at 4? Not E.

Common words with E at 4: 
- TIMES? But T forbidden.
- LIVES? Might work: L,I,V,E,S? But E is at position 4? L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, S at5? Yes? But E at position 4? Yes, position 4 is E.

Similarly, ""DINES"": D,I,N,E,S? But N is forbidden? We cannot use N.

""WIPES"": W,I,P,E,S? Positions: W1, I2, P3, E4, S5? Yes.

But does it have different letters? Yes. And forbidden letters: C,A,N,T are not included? W,I,P,E,S — all allowed? We haven't used W,P before, but not forbidden.

In ""WIPES"", we have I at position 2? But we know I cannot be at position 2? From RITES feedback: I was at position 2? In RITES: positions: R1, I2, T3, E4, S5? And I was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, ""WIPES"" has I at position 2 again? But position 2 is not I? So guessing I at position 2 again would give '-' meaning present but wrong position, which doesn't tell us anything new. It re-tests the same information? We know I is not at position 2, so avoid.

Similarly, we should avoid placing I at position 2 or R at position 1 or 2? R position 1 already tested and not, so avoid putting R at 1.

In ""WIPES"", I is at position 2? That's the same slot we know is wrong? So don't do that.

Instead, put I at a new position: position 1, or 3, or 5.

Similarly for R.

Let me find a word with E at 4 and the configuration.

For example: ""BR I S E""? But B,R,I,S,E? Positions: B1, R2, I3, S4? Not E at4.

Wrong.

""H E R O S""? H1,E2,R3,O4,S5? Not E at4.

Need E at position 4: for example: ""  ... K E D "" but no, E must be fourth.

Another word: ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R? Positions: O1, L2, D3, E4? E is at position 4? Then R at5? R at position 5? And we don't have I? Or S? But the word doesn't contain I or S? But we know I and S must be in the word? So this word wouldn't work? Because it doesn't include I and S.

We must include I and S? Since they are in the word.

So the fifth letter is one more letter? But the word has E,R,I,S, and one more? And we need to include I and S.

So our guess must have I and S? Or not, but we know they are in the word, so guessing without them would be inefficient? Because if we don't include, we might miss them.

We should include R, I, S, and E (already fixed at 4), and one new letter? In the word, we have R,I,S,E, and one more letter.

For third guess, guess a word that contains R,I,S,E,X where X is a new letter? Or use one of them at multiple positions? But better distinct.

So ideal: a word with E at position 4, and including R, I, S.

Now, positions:
- E fixed at 4.
- R at position? We want to test position 5 for R? Or position 3.
- I at position? Not position 2? So position 1,3,5.
- S at position? Not position 5? So position 1,2,3.

If we put at position 5: we can put R there? To test if R is position 5.

Similarly, put S at position 1 and I at position 3? Etc.

Another word: ""RINSE""? R1,I2,N3,E4,S5? But N is forbidden? And we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""RUSES""? Doesn't have E? At 4? R,U,S,E,S? Repeated S? And E at position 4: yes? But has two S's? Forbidden? Not necessarily, but could make feedback messy.

Examples: ""U R I S E"" - but no single word.

"" P R I S E "": P,R,I,S,E? But E is at position 5? Not 4.

There is ""PRISE"" but spelled P-R-I-S-E? Positions: P1, R2, I3, S4, E5? Again E at5.

Ah, consistently the ending.

Consider ""QUIRE""? Q,U,I,R,E? Positions: Q1, U2, I3, R4, E5? Not E at4.

Difficult?

Let me think of words ending with E as the fourth letter? Meaning fifth letter after.

For example: ""AGILE"" A at1, G at2, I at3, L at4, E at5? Not.

Words where E is fourth: ""AISLE"" A1,I2,S3,L4,E5? No, position 4 is L.

Better: many words ending in  a E  at the fourth position?: for example, ""PLANE"" but N forbidden.

""PHAGE""? H at3, E at4? P,H,A,G,E? Positions: P1, H2, A? A forbidden.

Wait, common words: ""TIMES"" T forbidden.

""LIKES"" L1,I2,K3,E4,S5? E at position 4? Yes: position 1:L,2:I,3:K,4:E,5:S? But I at position 2? We know I is not at position 2? So guessing I at position 2 again would be bad.

Similarly, we need to avoid I at position 2.

How about ""SKIED""? S,K,I,E,D? Positions: S1,K2,I3,E4,D5? Yes, E at position 4! And I at position 3? Not at 2.

This might work: ""SKIED"" 
- S at position 1, K new, I at position 3, E at position 4, D new.

But K and D are new letters.

Now, does it include I, S, E? Yes? But also K and D.

But we must include R? Oh, I forgot R. The secret word has R, so we must include R in our guess to test its position? Otherwise, if we omit R, then even if the word is say ""SKIED"", the R position won't be tested? But we know R is in the word, so how can we guess without R? It might be valid? But the secret has R, so if we guess ""SKIED"", and it has no R, then R will be marked? But that could confuse? Also, we are trying to find the secret.

We know R is in the word, so any valid guess must include R? Not necessarily? But if we don't, then the feedback might show R as missing? But since it's present, it would be strange? No: if we guess ""SKIED"", and the secret has R, then the R in secret would be inferred as missing in our guess? But the feedback will show that our guess has letters that might be correct or not.

But specifically, if the secret has R and we don't guess it, then the feedback won't reveal anything about R. Since we only have 4 guesses left? It's better to include R to pin it down.

So we should include R in our guess.

Therefore, ""SKIED"" omits R? So not ideal.

Word that includes R,E at4, I,S? And fifth letter.

And E at position 4.

For example: ""BRIES""? B,R,I,E,S? But E at position 4? Positions: B1,R2,I3,E4,S5? Yes!

""BRIES"": B at position 1, R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? From first guess. In ""CRANE"" R at position 2 was marked '-' meaning not there? But was the position wrong? Or the letter? So position 2 is not R? Therefore, if we guess ""BRIES"" with R at position 2, it would give '-' again? Meaning present but wrong position? Which is redundant? So avoid.

Similarly, I at position 3: we haven't tested position 3 for I? So it could be.

S at position 5: but we know S is not at position 5? From RITES feedback? S at position 5: marked '-' meaning in word but not at 5? So if we put S at position 5 again, it would be '-'? So also redundant.

In ""BRIES"": position 2 is R (forbidden for R), position 5 is S (forbidden for S)? So both will be '-' but not new information? So not good.

""DRIVE"" has E at 5? No.

Another word: ""OWRIE""? Not common.

""ORRIS""? Repeated R.

""PERIS"": P,E,R,I,S? E at position 2? Not at4.

Hard.

Let me think of ""R"" at position 5: so word like ? ? ? E R

But also includes I and S? ? ? ? E R

And S and I must be placed.

For example: ""VISER""? V,I,S,E,R? Positions: V1, I2, S3, E4, R5? Yes! E at position 4, R at position 5.

But I at position 2? Position 2 cannot be I? So if we guess I at position 2, it would be a waste? It will be marked '-' which we already know.

But it tests S at position 3 and R at position 5.

And introduces V.

Similarly, the secret word has I, so I must be with a different position? Here I am forced to be at 2? Which is bad.

""USERI""? Not word.

""RISEN"" has N? Forbidden.

""FRIES"": F,R,I,E,S? Positions: F1,R2,I3,E4,S5? R at position 2: not allowed? S at position 5: not allowed? Same issues.

To avoid position 2 for I and R, position 5 for S, we need to place R at position 3 or 5? And I at position 1,3, or 5? S at position 1,2,3.

Put R at position 5 (as above), then S must be at position 1,2, or 3, and I at position 1 or 3.

Then we can guess ""??I E R"" but I at position 3? Then word: position 1,2,3=I,4=E,5=R.

But the letter at position 3 would be I? But R at position 5.

For instance, ""??IER"" words: ""PREIER"" not word.

""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Positions: P1, L2, I3, E4, R5? Yes! E at position 4, R at position 5, I at position 3.

But we need to include S? Where is S? This word ""PLIER"" does not include S? But S is in the secret word? So we must have S in our guess? Otherwise, it will be missing.

The secret has S, so if we guess ""PLIER"", and the secret has S, then S will be marked as missing in feedback? But that doesn't help us find its position? And we will know that the guess is wrong because S is not included.

But we can do that? However, it's inefficient because we're not testing S at all.

Instead, let's choose a word that includes S, for example: ""SLIER"": S,L,I,E,R? Positions: S1, L2, I3, E4, R5.

But S at position 1? We haven't tested that? I at position 3? Not position 2.

R at position 5: we want to test if R is at 5.

Also, includes L (new).

G2 feedback: I is in the word but not at position 2, so I at position 3 is new? S at position 1: new? And S at position 1: if not correct, then '-', meaning S present but not there.

So ""SLIER"" seems good? Or ""S LI E R"".

But ""SLIER"" is a valid word? Slier means more sly? Yes, adjective.

Similarly, feedback: position 3: I? If the secret has I at position 3, then we get ✓, else '-'.

Similarly, position 1: S? If secret position 1 is S, then ✓, else if S is in word but not here, then '-'.

Position 5: R? If secret position 5 is R, then ✓, else '-'.

If we get ✓ for R at position 5, great? Or if not, we know R is at position 3? Since the only other option.

Also, we use distinct letters: S,L,I,E,R? E fixed at 4? Yes.

And no forbidden letters? Yes. L is new.

So I think ""SLIER"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""SHIER"": S,H,I,E,R? Same as above, but H instead of L? S1,H2,I3,E4,R5? But position 2: H? We haven't tested position 2? We tried R and I, but H is new. But if I at position 3 is the same.

But position 2: we have no constraints, so H is fine.

But ""SHIER"" has I at position 3? And E at4, R at5.

Also valid? Yes.

But ""SLIER"" or ""SHIER"" both are possible? Or ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? K a new letter.

But ""SKIER"" is common.

We can use any? I'll pick ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? Positions: S1, K2, I3, E4, R5.

So we test:
- S at position 1: may be correct or show it's elsewhere.
- I at position 3: may be correct or not.
- R at position 5: may be correct or not? If not, we know R must be at position 3? But position 3 is taken by I in this guess? So if secret R is at position 3, then in ""SKIER"", R is at position 5? Which would be marked '-' (not position 5), and I at position 3: if R is at position 3, I won't be at position 3? But we know both I and R are in the word? How can position 3 have both? So they cannot both be at 3? Thus, if R is at position 3, then in ""SKIER"", position 3 is I, which might be wrong? So feedback might show I at position 3 as 'x'? Meaning not in word? But I is in the word? Or '-' if it is in the word but not at 3.

But if secret has position 3: R, then when we put I at position 3, it could be '-' for I, meaning I is in word but not at position 3.

Similarly, R at position 5 would be '-' meaning in word but not at 5? Then we know R must be at 3.

Similarly, if R is at position 5 in secret, then putting R at 5 will be ✓, etc.

Also, we will find out if S at position 1 is correct.

So even if it overlaps, the feedback will clarify.

Moreover, it covers all required: R, I, S, E.

So good word: ""SKIER""

Thus, our third guess: SKIER

<guess>SKIER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(❌) R(➖) A(❌) N(❌) E(➖)  
  Meaning:  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
  - R and E are present but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: RITES** → R(➖) I(➖) T(❌) E(✓) S(➖)  
  Meaning:  
  - T is absent.  
  - R is present but not in position 1.  
  - I is present but not in position 2.  
  - E is correct and in position 4.  
  - S is present but not in position 5.  

### Deductions:
1. **E is fixed at position 4** (E at position 4 is ✓).  
2. **R must be at position 3 or 5** (all other positions ruled out: ❌ at 1 from RITES, ❌ at 2 from CRANE).  
3. **I cannot be at position 2** (➖ from RITES) and must be at position 1, 3, or 5.  
4. **S cannot be at position 5** (➖ from RITES) and must be at position 1, 2, or 3.  
5. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T (confirmed ❌ from both guesses).  
   - Avoid using these in future guesses.  
6. **Present letters (known)**: R, E (fixed at position 4), I, S.  
   - The secret word contains one additional unknown letter (since it has five distinct letters so far).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on resolving R's position (position 3 or 5) and narrowing down positions for I and S.  
- Test a word that:  
  - Keeps E at position 4.  
  - Includes R, I, and S to probe their positions.  
  - Introduces a new letter to gather more information.  
- To maximize information:  
  - Place R at position 5 to test if it belongs there (✓ would confirm; ➖ would imply R is at position 3).  
  - Place I at position 3 to test its position (uncharted slot).  
  - Place S at position 1 to test its position (uncharted slot).  
- Avoid forbidden positions:  
  - No R at position 1 or 2.  
  - No I at position 2.  
  - No S at position 5.  

Selected word: **SKIER** (S at position 1, K at position 2, I at position 3, E at position 4, R at position 5).  
- Why?  
  - Valid 5-letter word (e.g., ""skier,"" relating to skiing).  
  - Tests key positions: R at 5, I at 3, S at 1 (all new).  
  - Uses all known present letters (R, I, S, E) plus K (new letter, common).  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, T).  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - Feedback will quickly resolve R's position (position 5 or, if ➖, position 3).  
  - Clarifies positions for I and S.  
  - K provides additional coverage.",Guess 3: SKIER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) I(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
