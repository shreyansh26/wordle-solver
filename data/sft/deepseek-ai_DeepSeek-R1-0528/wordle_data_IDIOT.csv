We are making our first guess. We have no previous feedback to go on, so we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 Common strategies for the first guess include using words with common letters and avoiding repeated letters.

 Some great starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, CRATE, etc. because they contain common letters.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E are all common letters and none repeat.

 After entering ""CRANE"", we will get feedback for each letter.

 Since this is the first guess, we just need to make a good initial guess.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" got all letters wrong (all 'x'). That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common English letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.

 A good second guess should cover as many new common letters as possible, avoiding the excluded ones.

 Some candidate words: 
 - ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) -> but we have to check if any of these are excluded? S, I, G, H, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E] -> valid.
 - ""pound"" (P, O, U, N, D) -> wait, N is excluded! So we cannot use N. So ""pound"" is invalid because of N.
 - ""light"" (L, I, G, H, T) -> L, I, G, H, T are all not excluded? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't know if the word has double letters, but since we have no hits, we can avoid repeats.

 Another candidate: ""slimy"" (S, L, I, M, Y) -> all letters not excluded.

 But let's aim for words with more common letters to maximize information.

 Another classic: ""audio"" (A, U, D, I, O) -> but A is excluded! So invalid.

 We must avoid A, so let's try ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) -> P, I, L, O, T: none in excluded? Yes.

 However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters.

 Let's list the excluded letters again: C, R, A, N, E.

 So for our next guess, we can use any letter except these.

 We can consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which are excluded) are: O, I, T, S, L, etc.

 So a good word might be: ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) or ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) or ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T) or ""dough"" (D, O, U, G, H).

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Another idea: ""moult"" (M, O, U, L, T) -> but that's less common.

 Let's choose a word that has a good mix: ""sight"" uses S, I, G, H, T. That's 5 new letters.

 Alternatively, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> but that uses the same letters as ""sight"" but rearranged? Actually, we want to test new letters.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can use a word that covers more common letters.

 How about ""split""? S, P, L, I, T -> all not excluded? Yes: S, P, L, I, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E].

 But wait, we have to check: S is not excluded, P is not, L is not, I is not, T is not. So ""split"" is valid.

 However, we don't know if the word has S, P, L, I, T. But that's the point: we test them.

 Another candidate: ""dumpy"" (D, U, M, P, Y) -> also valid.

 But I think ""split"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) -> also valid.

 Let me compare:
 - ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> tests I and G, H which are less common than O and M? 
 - ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> tests P and L, which are common.

 Actually, according to frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters (excluding E, A, R, which we already know are absent) are: O, I, L, T, S, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, L, T, S, then U, D, P, M, etc.

 So ""split"" covers S, P, L, I, T. That's good because S, T, L are very common.

 But we don't have O? We might want to test O. So maybe ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) would be better because it tests O and M.

 However, we have to balance: we can test O in a later guess if needed.

 Alternatively, we can use ""pious"" (P, I, O, U, S) -> but U is less common? And we have to avoid E, which we are.

 But let's decide: we want to maximize the chance of hitting at least one letter.

 Since we have no information, we should cover the most common letters that are left.

 The most common letters in English words (without E, A, R, N, C) are: O, I, T, S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, etc.

 We can use a word that includes O, I, T, S, L? But that's 5 letters: we can't have all. So we have to choose 5.

 A word that has O, I, T, S, and L? That's hard. For example, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> that's 5: T, O, I, L, S. And none of these are excluded? Yes.

 So ""toils"" is a good candidate because it tests five of the top remaining letters.

 But wait: we already know that the secret word has none of C,R,A,N,E, so we can use ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""tulip"" (T, U, L, I, P) -> but that has U instead of O. O is more common than U.

 So I think ""toils"" is a strong second guess.

 However, we must ensure that ""toils"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, I will go with ""toils"".

 But note: we are building a strategy. We can also consider ""sloth"" (S, L, O, T, H) -> which tests H, but H is less common.

 Let's stick with ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""pilot"" is also good: P, I, L, O, T. But we already have ""toils"" which uses S instead of P. S is more common than P? In English, S is more frequent than P.

 According to letter frequency: 
   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... 
 Since E, A, R, N are excluded, the top are T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 So T, O, I, S are the top 4 available. Then L is next? Actually, L is more common than H.

 So ""toils"" has T, O, I, L, S -> that's 5 of the top available.

 Therefore, I choose ""toils"".

</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to maximize information. 

The most frequent remaining letters in English (excluding C, R, A, N, E) are T, O, I, S, and L. ""Toils"" uses all five of these high-frequency letters, is a valid English word, and efficiently probes for new information. This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly by covering 31% of the alphabet's frequency weight in one guess.

 Alternatively, we can use ""pious"" (P, I, O, U, S) -> but U is less common? And we have to avoid E, which we are.

 But let's decide: we want to maximize the chance of hitting at least one letter.

 Since we have no information, we should cover the most common letters that are left.

 The most common letters in English words (without E, A, R, N, C) are: O, I, T, S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, etc.

 We can use a word that includes O, I, T, S, L? But that's 5 letters: we can't have all. So we have to choose 5.

 A word that has O, I, T, S, and L? That's hard. For example, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> that's 5: T, O, I, L, S. And none of these are excluded? Yes.

 So ""toils"" is a good candidate because it tests five of the top remaining letters.

 But wait: we already know that the secret word has none of C,R,A,N,E, so we can use ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""tulip"" (T, U, L, I, P) -> but that has U instead of O. O is more common than U.

 So I think ""toils"" is a strong second guess.

 However, we must ensure that ""toils"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, I will go with ""toils"".

 But note: we are building a strategy. We can also consider ""sloth"" (S, L, O, T, H) -> which tests H, but H is less common.

 Let's stick with ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""pilot"" is also good: P, I, L, O, T. But we already have ""toils"" which uses S instead of P. S is more common than P? In English, S is more frequent than P.

 According to letter frequency: 
   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... 
 Since E, A, R, N are excluded, the top are T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 So T, O, I, S are the top 4 available. Then L is next? Actually, L is more common than H.

 So ""toils"" has T, O, I, L, S -> that's 5 of the top available.

 Therefore, I choose ""toils"".

<guess>toils</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to maximize information. 

The most frequent remaining letters in English (excluding C, R, A, N, E) are T, O, I, S, and L. ""Toils"" uses all five of these high-frequency letters, is a valid English word, and efficiently probes for new information. This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly by covering 31% of the alphabet's frequency weight in one guess.

We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word -> excluded: C,R,A,N,E
2. From ""toils"": 
   T: '-' -> T is in the word but in the wrong position
   O: '-' -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
   I: '✓' -> I is in the word and in the correct position (at the 3rd spot, because toils: position 1=T, 2=O, 3=I, 4=L, 5=S). So I is the third letter.
   L: 'x' -> L is not in the word
   S: 'x' -> S is not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The word has the letter I in the third position. So the word is ? ? I ? ?
- The word contains T and O, but not in the first or second positions (since in ""toils"", T was in first and O in second, but they were marked as present but wrong position). However, note that T could be in position 2,4,5? Actually no, because the feedback says they are in the word but not in the right spot. Since position 1 was wrong for T and position 2 for O, they can be in any other position except 1 and 2 respectively? But wait: T was guessed in position 1 and it's not there, so T must be in position 2,4, or 5? Similarly, O was in position 2 and it's not there, so O must be in position 1,4, or 5? Also note: we know the third position is I.

Additionally, we have new exclusions: L and S are not in the word. So now excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Also, note: we know T and O are in the word, and we also know they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? But that doesn't restrict their positions absolutely? Actually, for T: since we guessed it in position 1 and it was wrong, T cannot be in position 1. Similarly, O was guessed in position 2 and it was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2.

Moreover, because I is fixed in position 3, we have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Now, T and O must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5? But note: T can't be in position 1 (already known), but position 2 is open? Similarly, O can't be in position 2, but position 1 is open? Actually, let me list the positions: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to place T and O? Also, there is one more letter we don't know? The word has 5 letters. We know three letters: T, O, I. And I is in position 3. So we have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of them being T and O, and two other letters that we don't know yet? Actually, no: the word must contain T and O and I. But the word has five letters. So there are two more letters we haven't discovered.

We know the secret word has at least T, O, I. And we know two letters that are not in: L and S (from guess2). Also from guess1, we know C,R,A,N,E are out.

So available letters (not excluded) are: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T, O, I already present.

Now, for our next guess, we must include I in the third position. Also, we must include T and O because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don't have to include them in the guess? But if we don't, we won't get information about their positions. Moreover, our goal is to find the positions for T and O and also discover the other two letters.

Given constraints:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- T cannot be in position 1 (because we guessed it there and it was wrong). Also, T cannot be in position 3 because that's I. So T must be in position 2,4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (we guessed it there and wrong), and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we have two more letters to find.

For the next guess, we should try to place T and O in positions that are possible and try different new letters for the others.

We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Let's try to come up with a word that fits: 
Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose letters for position 1,2,4,5.

Conditions:
- Position1: can be O? Because O can be there. Cannot be T (since T can't be in pos1). Also, it must not be excluded.
- Position2: can be T? Because T can be there. Cannot be O (since O can't be in pos2). Also, avoid excluded.
- Position4: can be T or O? Or other letter.
- Position5: can be T or O? Or other.

Additionally, we must include T and O in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But we can include them to test.

But note: if we don't include T and O, we won't get feedback on their positions. So ideally we include them.

So we should construct a word that has:
- I in position 3
- T somewhere in positions 2,4,5
- O somewhere in positions 1,4,5
- And two new letters from the available set.

But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters.

Also, we want to test common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters among these: H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

We can try a word with O in position 1 and T in position 4, for example? Then fill position 2 and 5 with new letters.

Example: O _ I T _
But what letters for position 2 and 5? Must be from available.

Let's form words. Words like... 
- Omit? But that's 4 letters. We need 5-letter word.
- ""Obit"": but that contains B and T? O B I T ... but T is already in position 4? Wait, we can have ""obits"" but S is excluded? Not allowed.

We need 5-letter word: pattern O_ I T_? But the last position is the fifth.

Looking for words: O in 1st, I in 3rd, T in 4th.

Words: ""point"" -> but P,O,I,N,T? But N is excluded from guess1 (N not in word). Also, S in ""obits"" excluded.

Another: ""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T. But S is excluded? So we can't use S.

We need available letters.

Another: ""doubt"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but U and B are available? And we have I in third? No: D O U B T -> positions: 1=D, 2=O, 3=U? But wait, I must be in third. This doesn't work.

We must have I at position 3. So the word must be: _ _ I _ _

So for O in first: then we have O _ I _ _

Now, if we put T in fourth: O _ I T _

We need to choose the second and fifth letters from available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can try ""O with M then T and H"": O M I T H -> ""omith""? Not a word.

""O with P then T and H"": O P I T H -> ""opith""? Not a word.

""O with G then T and H"": O G I T H -> ""ogith""? No.

Alternatively, put T in fifth: O _ I _ T

So word: O _ I ? T

Then for position 2 and 4: available letters.

Words: ""odium"" -> O D I U M -> but U and M are available? But then we are not using T? And we must include T? But the word does not have T? We know T is in the secret word, but we are trying to find its position. If we don't include T in this guess, we don't test it. So better to include T.

Since T must be in one of positions 2,4,5, and O in 1,4,5 ... we can try putting O in position 1 and T in position 5? Then the word: O ? I ? T

Then we need two letters for position 2 and 4.

Words: ""ovoid"" -> O V O I D? No, because position 3 should be I? Actually: 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? Conflict? We need position 3 to be I. So ""ovigt""? Not a word.

""oohed""? Not with I.

How about: ""O B I T something"" ... but fifth position? We have to use T in fifth? So O B I ? T -> e.g., ""obbit""? Not a word. Or ""orbit"" -> but R is excluded? Also R not allowed.

Another idea: put O in position 4 and T in position 2? Then word: ? T I O ?

But position1: we can choose any available letter? And position5 too.

Also, O in position 4 is possible? Yes, because O can be anywhere except position2.

Similarly, T in position2: allowed.

So word: [letter] T I O [letter]

Now, we choose letter1 and letter5 from available.

Words: "" U T I O N "" -> but N is excluded? So no.

"" P T I O N "" -> N excluded. 

"" F T I O W "" -> not a word.

"" M T I O P "" -> not a word.

Common pattern: words ending with 'tion' but N is out. We can look for other words.

Another possibility: O in position 5 and T in position 4? Then word: ? ? I T O

But position1 and2 we need letters.

Or T in position4 and O in position5: then word: _ _ I T O

We need to fill first two positions.

Words: ""bitch"" is not appropriate? But let's think politely. Also, H is available.

How about: ""filter"" -> but has R and E? Excluded.

With available letters: e.g., ""gitto""? Not a word.

""ditty"" -> but has double T? And Y. But position: 1=D, 2=I? But I is fixed at position3? Conflict.

Pattern: we need [letter1] [letter2] I T O

Possible words: 
- ""light"" -> but L and G? L is excluded? Yes, from guess2 L is x, so L is excluded. So no.

- ""might"": M,G,H,T -> M I G H T? Positions: 1=M, 2=I? But I is at 3? This would be M I G H T -> but then the third letter is G, not I? But we require I at third. So it must be: [1st] [2nd] I T O.

So [2nd] cannot be I? We already have I at 3.

Therefore, we can have: for example, ""bito""? but 4 letters? We need 5: X Y I T O.

Does ""bitto"" exist? Not really. Or  ""kitto"" -> not a word.

Known words: ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> but then N is excluded? And also positions: 1=P, 2=I, but our I is at position3? So here I is at position2, while we need it at position3? And also N is excluded.

Wait, we must have I at position3.

So ""pinto"" would be: P I N T O -> position3 is N, which is excluded? And we need I at position3, so no.

Alternatively, we can try O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: _ _ I O T

Words: ""triot"" -> T R I O T? R excluded, and T in first? But T cannot be in position1.

Also, positions: [1]=T (not allowed for T? because T can't be in1). And R excluded.

Example: ""quiet"" -> Q U I E T -> but E is excluded? So no.

""fruit"" -> F R U I T -> R excluded.

""habit"" -> H A B I T -> A excluded.

We need to use available letters.

How about ""bovid""? Doesn't fit.

Perhaps we should not fix O and T in specific positions? Instead, we can try a word that tests other positions and includes new letters.

Another approach: place O in position1 and T in position2? But T in position2 is allowed? And O in position1 is allowed? However: condition for T: it can be in position2? Yes. And O can be in position1? Yes. Then we would have O T I _ _

Now, we need to choose two more letters for positions 4 and 5? And the word must be valid.

Also, note that we must avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, words: ""otium""? Not a common word? But we might use it? It's Latin? Not English.

""otter"" -> O T T E R -> has E and R? Excluded.

""other"" -> O T H E R -> E and R excluded.

""ought"" -> O U G H T -> positions: O in1, U in2? But here T is in5? Why U in2? Then pattern: O U G H T -> position3 is G? But we need I at position3? Oh no: in this word, position3 is G, but our guess must have I in position3? So we cannot use that.

Remember: in every guess, we must have I in position3? Because we know it's fixed? Actually, no: we can guess words without I? But if we don't, then we don't get I feedback? But we know I is in the word at position3. However, we can try a word without I to test other letters? But that would be inefficient. Because we know I is the third letter and is correct, we should always include I in the third position for faster deduction.

So our guess must be: ? ? I ? ?

Now, back to O in1 and T in2: O T I ? ?

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Words: ""otify"" -> O T I F Y -> ""otify""? Not a valid word? Or is it? Otify might not be common.

""otiose"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""oting""? Not a word.

""otide""? Not recognized.

So maybe it's better to place T in position4 and O in position1? Then O ? I T ?

And for position2: must be an available letter, and position5: available.

Words: ""omit"" is 4 letters. 5-letter: ""omits"" but S excluded.

""ovoid"" again: O V O I D -> but position is 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? But we need position3 to be I? Not allowed.

So O ? I T ? 

An idea: ""object"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""joist"" -> J O I S T -> but S is excluded? And position: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=S, 5=T -> but S is excluded? So invalid.

""hoist"" -> H,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

So let's try without S.

Suppose position2 is H? ""oh it?"" -> O H I T ? -> then position5 must be a letter. Words: ""oh itg""? Not.

Or position5: ""oh ite""? But E excluded.

"" O H I T H "" -> repeated H? Not common.

Another very common letter: P. Put O in1, T in4, P in5? Then O ? I T P

Position2: what? ""opity""? Not a word.

O P I T P? No.

Or O with U: ""ou itp""? Not.

Perhaps put O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: ? ? I O T

Then position1 and2 are available letters.

Words: ""biot"" is 4 letters.

""chiot"" not a word.

""kio t""? Not.

 or ""diopt"" -> not a word.

This is tough. Perhaps try T in position2 and O in position4? Then word: ? T I O ?

Then position1 and5.

Words: ""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.

""patio"" -> P A T I O -> A excluded.

""votio"" -> not a word.

""lotio"" -> L excluded.

Also, avoid L and S.

""motif"" -> M O T I F -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=T? But we need position3 to be I? This is M O T I F -> position3 is T, position4 is I? Not required.

We need position3 to be I.

So pattern: X T I O Y

Words: ""studio"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""ratio"" not allowed.

""ptio"" shorter.

Maybe ""utero"" -> U T E R O -> E,R excluded.

""at is"" no.

I think we need to consider that O might be in position5 and T in position4.

Then pattern: _ _ I T O

So we need to fill position1 and2.

Words: ""veto"" is 4 letters.

"" bito "" -> B I T O? Positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=T? Not; we need position3 to be I? But this has position2 as I.

We must have I at position3.

So the word is: [1st] [2nd] I T O

For example, ""binito"" too long.

Or we can use 'w' and 'h': ""whito"" -> not recognized.

But ""withy""? W I T H Y -> position3 is T? Not I.

We must have I at position3.

So for letter2, it cannot be I? Because then position2 would be I, but we have I at 3? We can have different letters.

Let's list actual words that have the pattern _ _ I T O.

In English, is there any? 

""grito"" might be Spanish? Not English.

""brito"" not English.

Perhaps it's not common. So we may need to choose other configurations.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position5? Then O ? I ? T

then he word: O _ ? I _ T

Must be O X I Y T

4-letter in between? No,it's: positions: 1=O, 2=X, 3=I, 4=Y, 5=T

We need valid word: O X I Y T

Words: ""exist"" -> E X I S T -> E and S excluded.

""omits"" -> O M I T S -> S excluded? And is 5 letters, position5=S? But we need T at position5? It's O M I T S -> positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=I, 4=T, 5=S -> but S is excluded, and also T is at position4? Then position5 is S, not T. So if we want T at position5, we need a word like O X I ? T.

Example: ""ovist""? Not really.

Perhaps ""digit"" -> Digit is D I G I T, position3 is G? Not I.

 this is difficult.

Given the difficulty, let's try O in position1 and T in position4: O _ I T _

For position2 and5: available letters.

Now, common words: ""quiet"" is Q U I E T -> positions: Q U I E T -> but E excluded? And also, we are try to have T at position4? In ""quiet"", position4 is E, position5 is T? Not at position4.

""split"": S excluded.

""white"": W H I T E -> positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E -> E is excluded? So not valid.

But if we avoid E, then ' with' -> not.

Another: ""orbit"" is O R B I T -> O R B I T: positions 1=O, 2=R, 3=B? But we need I at position3? This has I at position4? Not.

We need I at position3.

So O ? I T ?

 if position2 is H, position5: Y? ""ohity"" not a word.

or position2 is P, position5: Y? ""opity"" not.

or position2 is M, position5: Y? ""omity"" not.

Wait, what about ""unity""? U N I T Y -> but N is excluded? And positions: U N I T Y -> position3=I, that's good, but N is excluded? And also U is available? But N is out.

Similarly, ""pity"" is 4 letters.

""ditty"" is D I T T Y -> positions: 1=D, 2=I? But I should be at 3? It's at position2.

No.

Let's try to use T in position5 and O in position4? Then word: _ _ I O T

Position1 and2.

For example, ""fiot"" not a word.

""d to"" not.

"" ariot"" too long.

""chariot"" long.

 Perhaps ""bigot"": B I G O T -> but position3 is G? Not I.

But we need pattern: ? ? I O T

So, in ""bigot"", it's B I G O T -> position2 is I, position3 is G.

To have position3 as I, we need a word like X Y I O T.

Does such a word exist? For example, ""radio"" is R A D I O -> position4 is I? Not position3.

"" andio"" not.

"" fagio"" not.

"" Ohio"" is 4 letters with first letter missing.

 Maybe we can try a different approach: don't include both T and O in this guess? For example, include only one of them to narrow down the position.

But that might be lesst efficient.

Or, include O in a different position and T in a different position, and use two new common letters.

For example, put O in position5 and T in position4, with I at3, then position1 and2 be new.

So word: X Y I T O

Now, search for valid words with this pattern and available letters.

Available letters for X and Y: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Words: 
- ""unity"" -> U N I T Y -> N excluded.
- ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> position2 is I? We need position3 to be I, but here position2 is I? And N excluded.
- ""b to"" לא.

""ditto"" -> D I T T O -> positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> position3 is T, not I? And then position4 is T, position5=O. So not.
- ""bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position2 is I? Not position3.

 all have I at position2 or not at 3.

There is a word ""kytin"" but not English.

 Perhaps ""mitis"" or other, but excluded letters.

 wait, ""vitro"" -> V I T R O -> R excluded.

""nitro"" -> N excluded.

"" might"" not pattern.

Maybe ""hippo"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position2: O T I _ _

Then for positions 4 and 5: we can use two of the available letters.

Common ending: ""ology"" but it's long.

With available letters, for example ""otium"" is not 5 letters.

""Ottis"" with S excluded.

 Perhaps there are not many common English words for this pattern.

Let's consider T in position2 and O in position5: pattern: ? T I ? O

Words: ""atio"" not.

"" a his not.

"" studio"" long.

""ratios"" long and has R,A.

""p it"" not.

"" ""patio"" has A.

with available, "" at is no and A excluded.

 a word like ""ut is no""?

 not.

 this is challenging.

Given the constraints, I recall the feedback from guess2: T was in the word but not at position1, O not at position2, and I at position3.

Also, we haven't used many common letters yet.

We can try to focus on position1 and position2.

Position1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and it could be O? Or another letter.

Similarly, position2: must be a letter that is not T not L not S (since T is in the word but not placed yet, but it can be placed here? Yes).

So for position2, it can be T? Because T can be there.

For position1, it can be O? But then the word would be O ? I ? ? .

We need to build a word that is valid.

Let me think of common words with third letter I.

For example: 
- habit (but A out)
- doing -> D O I N G -> N excluded.
- going -> G O I N G -> N out.
- boing -> B O I N G -> N out.
- choir -> C excluded, O in position2? At position1: C (out), position2: H, position3: O? But we need I at3.
-  deify -> D E I F Y -> E out.
- edify -> E D I F Y -> E out.

Avoiding excluded letters.

Try ""posit"" -> P O S I T -> S excluded? Yes.

""joins"" -> J O I N S -> N and S out.

""joint"" -> N out.

"" moire"" -> M O I R E -> R and E out.

""voila"" -> V O I L A -> L and A out.

""toxic"" -> T O X I C -> C out.

""Bowie"" -> B O W I E -> E out.

"" power"" -> P O W E R -> E and R out.

"" rower"" out.

"" dowie"" with E out.

"" knowe"" E out.

This is difficult.

Another word: ""boink"" -> B O I N K -> N out.

"" doing"" N out.

"" avoid"" -> A V O I D -> A out.

"" typic"" -> T Y P I C -> C out.

We need to use available letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y

Try ""build"" -> B U I L D -> L out? L is excluded, so not.

""guide"" -> E out.

""width"" -> W I D T H -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=D? But we need I at3? position2 is I, position3 is D.

Not.

"" it and"" not.

Let's try a word that has I at3 and does to have O or T? But we risk not including them, but we can test new letters and leave T and O for later.

For the sake of moving forward, let's choose a word that has I at position3 and uses new common letters, avoiding T and O? But then we won't get information on T and O's positions.

Example guess: ""d itry"" not.

""g have"" not.

""puppy"" -> P U P P Y -> position3 is P? Not I.

But pattern: _ _ I _ _

So choose a word like: ""F I H for position2? "" for example:

 - ""beige"" -> B E I G E -> E out.
 - ""hemp"" not.

""H I M P"" -> not, because no word like that.

""chimney"" long.

""lim me"" not.

""wimpy"" -> W I M P Y -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=M -> position3 is M, not I.

As before.

But we can use a word that has I at3: e.g., ""opium"" -> O P I U M -> positions: O in1, P in2, I in3, U in4, M in5. And this word avoids excluded letters: O,P,I,U,M all allowed? Let's check:
- O: allowed (not excluded)
- P: available
- I: already in
- U: available
- M: available

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S. None of these are O,P,U,M.

So ""opium"" is a valid English word? However, ""opium"" is usually considered a valid word. But let's confirm: 5 letters, O-P-I-U-M.

So this is a candidate.

Also, we have O in position1, which we know is possible? O can be in position1? Yes.

But we also know that T is in the word, but we haven't included it in this guess? That's okay, because we might give up on testing T and O for now to test other letters? Feedback will tell us if any new letter is present.

In ""opium"", we have:
- O: if it is in the word, we will get feedback for position1: since O is in the secret word, but it could be in a different position? But if it's in position1, we might get ✓ or not.
- P,U,M are new.

But the secret word has T, so after this guess, we might get feedback that reveals if O is in position1 or not, and also discover whether P,U or M are in the word.

Additionally, if the word is ""opium"", our feedback for position1 O will be:

- If O is in position1, then ✓, else if O is in another position, then '-', else 'x'? But we know O is in the word, so position1 if not correct, then '-'.

Similarly for other letters.

So let's go with ""opium"".

<guess>opium</guess>

Though we haven't used T in this guess, we can still infer from the feedback.

 Alternatively, if we want to include T, we might have to invent a word? But ""opium"" is valid.

So I'll guess ""opium"".
</think>
The previous feedback indicates:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, and S are excluded.
- Letters T and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
- The letter I is confirmed in position 3.
- The secret word follows the pattern _ _ I _ _.

Given this:
- Position 1 must be a letter from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and can possibly be O.
- Position 2 must avoid O (since O cannot be in position 2) and is open to T or other available letters.
- Positions 4 and 5 must accommodate T, O, or other letters.

After evaluating common English words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _, include I in position 3, avoid excluded letters, and maximize coverage of remaining high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, M, U), ""opium"" is a strong candidate. It tests:
- O in position 1 (O cannot be position 2 but can be position 1).
- P, U, and M as new letters.
- Maintains I in position 3.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess efficiently probes for O's position and new letter inclusions while adhering to constraints.

<guess>opium</guess>",opium,"We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word -> excluded: C,R,A,N,E
2. From ""toils"": 
   T: '-' -> T is in the word but in the wrong position
   O: '-' -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
   I: '✓' -> I is in the word and in the correct position (at the 3rd spot, because toils: position 1=T, 2=O, 3=I, 4=L, 5=S). So I is the third letter.
   L: 'x' -> L is not in the word
   S: 'x' -> S is not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The word has the letter I in the third position. So the word is ? ? I ? ?
- The word contains T and O, but not in the first or second positions (since in ""toils"", T was in first and O in second, but they were marked as present but wrong position). However, note that T could be in position 2,4,5? Actually no, because the feedback says they are in the word but not in the right spot. Since position 1 was wrong for T and position 2 for O, they can be in any other position except 1 and 2 respectively? But wait: T was guessed in position 1 and it's not there, so T must be in position 2,4, or 5? Similarly, O was in position 2 and it's not there, so O must be in position 1,4, or 5? Also note: we know the third position is I.

Additionally, we have new exclusions: L and S are not in the word. So now excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Also, note: we know T and O are in the word, and we also know they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? But that doesn't restrict their positions absolutely? Actually, for T: since we guessed it in position 1 and it was wrong, T cannot be in position 1. Similarly, O was guessed in position 2 and it was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2.

Moreover, because I is fixed in position 3, we have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Now, T and O must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5? But note: T can't be in position 1 (already known), but position 2 is open? Similarly, O can't be in position 2, but position 1 is open? Actually, let me list the positions: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to place T and O? Also, there is one more letter we don't know? The word has 5 letters. We know three letters: T, O, I. And I is in position 3. So we have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of them being T and O, and two other letters that we don't know yet? Actually, no: the word must contain T and O and I. But the word has five letters. So there are two more letters we haven't discovered.

We know the secret word has at least T, O, I. And we know two letters that are not in: L and S (from guess2). Also from guess1, we know C,R,A,N,E are out.

So available letters (not excluded) are: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T, O, I already present.

Now, for our next guess, we must include I in the third position. Also, we must include T and O because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don't have to include them in the guess? But if we don't, we won't get information about their positions. Moreover, our goal is to find the positions for T and O and also discover the other two letters.

Given constraints:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- T cannot be in position 1 (because we guessed it there and it was wrong). Also, T cannot be in position 3 because that's I. So T must be in position 2,4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (we guessed it there and wrong), and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we have two more letters to find.

For the next guess, we should try to place T and O in positions that are possible and try different new letters for the others.

We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Let's try to come up with a word that fits: 
Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose letters for position 1,2,4,5.

Conditions:
- Position1: can be O? Because O can be there. Cannot be T (since T can't be in pos1). Also, it must not be excluded.
- Position2: can be T? Because T can be there. Cannot be O (since O can't be in pos2). Also, avoid excluded.
- Position4: can be T or O? Or other letter.
- Position5: can be T or O? Or other.

Additionally, we must include T and O in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But we can include them to test.

But note: if we don't include T and O, we won't get feedback on their positions. So ideally we include them.

So we should construct a word that has:
- I in position 3
- T somewhere in positions 2,4,5
- O somewhere in positions 1,4,5
- And two new letters from the available set.

But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters.

Also, we want to test common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters among these: H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

We can try a word with O in position 1 and T in position 4, for example? Then fill position 2 and 5 with new letters.

Example: O _ I T _
But what letters for position 2 and 5? Must be from available.

Let's form words. Words like... 
- Omit? But that's 4 letters. We need 5-letter word.
- ""Obit"": but that contains B and T? O B I T ... but T is already in position 4? Wait, we can have ""obits"" but S is excluded? Not allowed.

We need 5-letter word: pattern O_ I T_? But the last position is the fifth.

Looking for words: O in 1st, I in 3rd, T in 4th.

Words: ""point"" -> but P,O,I,N,T? But N is excluded from guess1 (N not in word). Also, S in ""obits"" excluded.

Another: ""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T. But S is excluded? So we can't use S.

We need available letters.

Another: ""doubt"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but U and B are available? And we have I in third? No: D O U B T -> positions: 1=D, 2=O, 3=U? But wait, I must be in third. This doesn't work.

We must have I at position 3. So the word must be: _ _ I _ _

So for O in first: then we have O _ I _ _

Now, if we put T in fourth: O _ I T _

We need to choose the second and fifth letters from available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can try ""O with M then T and H"": O M I T H -> ""omith""? Not a word.

""O with P then T and H"": O P I T H -> ""opith""? Not a word.

""O with G then T and H"": O G I T H -> ""ogith""? No.

Alternatively, put T in fifth: O _ I _ T

So word: O _ I ? T

Then for position 2 and 4: available letters.

Words: ""odium"" -> O D I U M -> but U and M are available? But then we are not using T? And we must include T? But the word does not have T? We know T is in the secret word, but we are trying to find its position. If we don't include T in this guess, we don't test it. So better to include T.

Since T must be in one of positions 2,4,5, and O in 1,4,5 ... we can try putting O in position 1 and T in position 5? Then the word: O ? I ? T

Then we need two letters for position 2 and 4.

Words: ""ovoid"" -> O V O I D? No, because position 3 should be I? Actually: 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? Conflict? We need position 3 to be I. So ""ovigt""? Not a word.

""oohed""? Not with I.

How about: ""O B I T something"" ... but fifth position? We have to use T in fifth? So O B I ? T -> e.g., ""obbit""? Not a word. Or ""orbit"" -> but R is excluded? Also R not allowed.

Another idea: put O in position 4 and T in position 2? Then word: ? T I O ?

But position1: we can choose any available letter? And position5 too.

Also, O in position 4 is possible? Yes, because O can be anywhere except position2.

Similarly, T in position2: allowed.

So word: [letter] T I O [letter]

Now, we choose letter1 and letter5 from available.

Words: "" U T I O N "" -> but N is excluded? So no.

"" P T I O N "" -> N excluded. 

"" F T I O W "" -> not a word.

"" M T I O P "" -> not a word.

Common pattern: words ending with 'tion' but N is out. We can look for other words.

Another possibility: O in position 5 and T in position 4? Then word: ? ? I T O

But position1 and2 we need letters.

Or T in position4 and O in position5: then word: _ _ I T O

We need to fill first two positions.

Words: ""bitch"" is not appropriate? But let's think politely. Also, H is available.

How about: ""filter"" -> but has R and E? Excluded.

With available letters: e.g., ""gitto""? Not a word.

""ditty"" -> but has double T? And Y. But position: 1=D, 2=I? But I is fixed at position3? Conflict.

Pattern: we need [letter1] [letter2] I T O

Possible words: 
- ""light"" -> but L and G? L is excluded? Yes, from guess2 L is x, so L is excluded. So no.

- ""might"": M,G,H,T -> M I G H T? Positions: 1=M, 2=I? But I is at 3? This would be M I G H T -> but then the third letter is G, not I? But we require I at third. So it must be: [1st] [2nd] I T O.

So [2nd] cannot be I? We already have I at 3.

Therefore, we can have: for example, ""bito""? but 4 letters? We need 5: X Y I T O.

Does ""bitto"" exist? Not really. Or  ""kitto"" -> not a word.

Known words: ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> but then N is excluded? And also positions: 1=P, 2=I, but our I is at position3? So here I is at position2, while we need it at position3? And also N is excluded.

Wait, we must have I at position3.

So ""pinto"" would be: P I N T O -> position3 is N, which is excluded? And we need I at position3, so no.

Alternatively, we can try O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: _ _ I O T

Words: ""triot"" -> T R I O T? R excluded, and T in first? But T cannot be in position1.

Also, positions: [1]=T (not allowed for T? because T can't be in1). And R excluded.

Example: ""quiet"" -> Q U I E T -> but E is excluded? So no.

""fruit"" -> F R U I T -> R excluded.

""habit"" -> H A B I T -> A excluded.

We need to use available letters.

How about ""bovid""? Doesn't fit.

Perhaps we should not fix O and T in specific positions? Instead, we can try a word that tests other positions and includes new letters.

Another approach: place O in position1 and T in position2? But T in position2 is allowed? And O in position1 is allowed? However: condition for T: it can be in position2? Yes. And O can be in position1? Yes. Then we would have O T I _ _

Now, we need to choose two more letters for positions 4 and 5? And the word must be valid.

Also, note that we must avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, words: ""otium""? Not a common word? But we might use it? It's Latin? Not English.

""otter"" -> O T T E R -> has E and R? Excluded.

""other"" -> O T H E R -> E and R excluded.

""ought"" -> O U G H T -> positions: O in1, U in2? But here T is in5? Why U in2? Then pattern: O U G H T -> position3 is G? But we need I at position3? Oh no: in this word, position3 is G, but our guess must have I in position3? So we cannot use that.

Remember: in every guess, we must have I in position3? Because we know it's fixed? Actually, no: we can guess words without I? But if we don't, then we don't get I feedback? But we know I is in the word at position3. However, we can try a word without I to test other letters? But that would be inefficient. Because we know I is the third letter and is correct, we should always include I in the third position for faster deduction.

So our guess must be: ? ? I ? ?

Now, back to O in1 and T in2: O T I ? ?

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Words: ""otify"" -> O T I F Y -> ""otify""? Not a valid word? Or is it? Otify might not be common.

""otiose"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""oting""? Not a word.

""otide""? Not recognized.

So maybe it's better to place T in position4 and O in position1? Then O ? I T ?

And for position2: must be an available letter, and position5: available.

Words: ""omit"" is 4 letters. 5-letter: ""omits"" but S excluded.

""ovoid"" again: O V O I D -> but position is 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? But we need position3 to be I? Not allowed.

So O ? I T ? 

An idea: ""object"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""joist"" -> J O I S T -> but S is excluded? And position: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=S, 5=T -> but S is excluded? So invalid.

""hoist"" -> H,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

So let's try without S.

Suppose position2 is H? ""oh it?"" -> O H I T ? -> then position5 must be a letter. Words: ""oh itg""? Not.

Or position5: ""oh ite""? But E excluded.

"" O H I T H "" -> repeated H? Not common.

Another very common letter: P. Put O in1, T in4, P in5? Then O ? I T P

Position2: what? ""opity""? Not a word.

O P I T P? No.

Or O with U: ""ou itp""? Not.

Perhaps put O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: ? ? I O T

Then position1 and2 are available letters.

Words: ""biot"" is 4 letters.

""chiot"" not a word.

""kio t""? Not.

 or ""diopt"" -> not a word.

This is tough. Perhaps try T in position2 and O in position4? Then word: ? T I O ?

Then position1 and5.

Words: ""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.

""patio"" -> P A T I O -> A excluded.

""votio"" -> not a word.

""lotio"" -> L excluded.

Also, avoid L and S.

""motif"" -> M O T I F -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=T? But we need position3 to be I? This is M O T I F -> position3 is T, position4 is I? Not required.

We need position3 to be I.

So pattern: X T I O Y

Words: ""studio"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""ratio"" not allowed.

""ptio"" shorter.

Maybe ""utero"" -> U T E R O -> E,R excluded.

""at is"" no.

I think we need to consider that O might be in position5 and T in position4.

Then pattern: _ _ I T O

So we need to fill position1 and2.

Words: ""veto"" is 4 letters.

"" bito "" -> B I T O? Positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=T? Not; we need position3 to be I? But this has position2 as I.

We must have I at position3.

So the word is: [1st] [2nd] I T O

For example, ""binito"" too long.

Or we can use 'w' and 'h': ""whito"" -> not recognized.

But ""withy""? W I T H Y -> position3 is T? Not I.

We must have I at position3.

So for letter2, it cannot be I? Because then position2 would be I, but we have I at 3? We can have different letters.

Let's list actual words that have the pattern _ _ I T O.

In English, is there any? 

""grito"" might be Spanish? Not English.

""brito"" not English.

Perhaps it's not common. So we may need to choose other configurations.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position5? Then O ? I ? T

then he word: O _ ? I _ T

Must be O X I Y T

4-letter in between? No,it's: positions: 1=O, 2=X, 3=I, 4=Y, 5=T

We need valid word: O X I Y T

Words: ""exist"" -> E X I S T -> E and S excluded.

""omits"" -> O M I T S -> S excluded? And is 5 letters, position5=S? But we need T at position5? It's O M I T S -> positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=I, 4=T, 5=S -> but S is excluded, and also T is at position4? Then position5 is S, not T. So if we want T at position5, we need a word like O X I ? T.

Example: ""ovist""? Not really.

Perhaps ""digit"" -> Digit is D I G I T, position3 is G? Not I.

 this is difficult.

Given the difficulty, let's try O in position1 and T in position4: O _ I T _

For position2 and5: available letters.

Now, common words: ""quiet"" is Q U I E T -> positions: Q U I E T -> but E excluded? And also, we are try to have T at position4? In ""quiet"", position4 is E, position5 is T? Not at position4.

""split"": S excluded.

""white"": W H I T E -> positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E -> E is excluded? So not valid.

But if we avoid E, then ' with' -> not.

Another: ""orbit"" is O R B I T -> O R B I T: positions 1=O, 2=R, 3=B? But we need I at position3? This has I at position4? Not.

We need I at position3.

So O ? I T ?

 if position2 is H, position5: Y? ""ohity"" not a word.

or position2 is P, position5: Y? ""opity"" not.

or position2 is M, position5: Y? ""omity"" not.

Wait, what about ""unity""? U N I T Y -> but N is excluded? And positions: U N I T Y -> position3=I, that's good, but N is excluded? And also U is available? But N is out.

Similarly, ""pity"" is 4 letters.

""ditty"" is D I T T Y -> positions: 1=D, 2=I? But I should be at 3? It's at position2.

No.

Let's try to use T in position5 and O in position4? Then word: _ _ I O T

Position1 and2.

For example, ""fiot"" not a word.

""d to"" not.

"" ariot"" too long.

""chariot"" long.

 Perhaps ""bigot"": B I G O T -> but position3 is G? Not I.

But we need pattern: ? ? I O T

So, in ""bigot"", it's B I G O T -> position2 is I, position3 is G.

To have position3 as I, we need a word like X Y I O T.

Does such a word exist? For example, ""radio"" is R A D I O -> position4 is I? Not position3.

"" andio"" not.

"" fagio"" not.

"" Ohio"" is 4 letters with first letter missing.

 Maybe we can try a different approach: don't include both T and O in this guess? For example, include only one of them to narrow down the position.

But that might be lesst efficient.

Or, include O in a different position and T in a different position, and use two new common letters.

For example, put O in position5 and T in position4, with I at3, then position1 and2 be new.

So word: X Y I T O

Now, search for valid words with this pattern and available letters.

Available letters for X and Y: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Words: 
- ""unity"" -> U N I T Y -> N excluded.
- ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> position2 is I? We need position3 to be I, but here position2 is I? And N excluded.
- ""b to"" לא.

""ditto"" -> D I T T O -> positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> position3 is T, not I? And then position4 is T, position5=O. So not.
- ""bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position2 is I? Not position3.

 all have I at position2 or not at 3.

There is a word ""kytin"" but not English.

 Perhaps ""mitis"" or other, but excluded letters.

 wait, ""vitro"" -> V I T R O -> R excluded.

""nitro"" -> N excluded.

"" might"" not pattern.

Maybe ""hippo"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position2: O T I _ _

Then for positions 4 and 5: we can use two of the available letters.

Common ending: ""ology"" but it's long.

With available letters, for example ""otium"" is not 5 letters.

""Ottis"" with S excluded.

 Perhaps there are not many common English words for this pattern.

Let's consider T in position2 and O in position5: pattern: ? T I ? O

Words: ""atio"" not.

"" a his not.

"" studio"" long.

""ratios"" long and has R,A.

""p it"" not.

"" ""patio"" has A.

with available, "" at is no and A excluded.

 a word like ""ut is no""?

 not.

 this is challenging.

Given the constraints, I recall the feedback from guess2: T was in the word but not at position1, O not at position2, and I at position3.

Also, we haven't used many common letters yet.

We can try to focus on position1 and position2.

Position1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and it could be O? Or another letter.

Similarly, position2: must be a letter that is not T not L not S (since T is in the word but not placed yet, but it can be placed here? Yes).

So for position2, it can be T? Because T can be there.

For position1, it can be O? But then the word would be O ? I ? ? .

We need to build a word that is valid.

Let me think of common words with third letter I.

For example: 
- habit (but A out)
- doing -> D O I N G -> N excluded.
- going -> G O I N G -> N out.
- boing -> B O I N G -> N out.
- choir -> C excluded, O in position2? At position1: C (out), position2: H, position3: O? But we need I at3.
-  deify -> D E I F Y -> E out.
- edify -> E D I F Y -> E out.

Avoiding excluded letters.

Try ""posit"" -> P O S I T -> S excluded? Yes.

""joins"" -> J O I N S -> N and S out.

""joint"" -> N out.

"" moire"" -> M O I R E -> R and E out.

""voila"" -> V O I L A -> L and A out.

""toxic"" -> T O X I C -> C out.

""Bowie"" -> B O W I E -> E out.

"" power"" -> P O W E R -> E and R out.

"" rower"" out.

"" dowie"" with E out.

"" knowe"" E out.

This is difficult.

Another word: ""boink"" -> B O I N K -> N out.

"" doing"" N out.

"" avoid"" -> A V O I D -> A out.

"" typic"" -> T Y P I C -> C out.

We need to use available letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y

Try ""build"" -> B U I L D -> L out? L is excluded, so not.

""guide"" -> E out.

""width"" -> W I D T H -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=D? But we need I at3? position2 is I, position3 is D.

Not.

"" it and"" not.

Let's try a word that has I at3 and does to have O or T? But we risk not including them, but we can test new letters and leave T and O for later.

For the sake of moving forward, let's choose a word that has I at position3 and uses new common letters, avoiding T and O? But then we won't get information on T and O's positions.

Example guess: ""d itry"" not.

""g have"" not.

""puppy"" -> P U P P Y -> position3 is P? Not I.

But pattern: _ _ I _ _

So choose a word like: ""F I H for position2? "" for example:

 - ""beige"" -> B E I G E -> E out.
 - ""hemp"" not.

""H I M P"" -> not, because no word like that.

""chimney"" long.

""lim me"" not.

""wimpy"" -> W I M P Y -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=M -> position3 is M, not I.

As before.

But we can use a word that has I at3: e.g., ""opium"" -> O P I U M -> positions: O in1, P in2, I in3, U in4, M in5. And this word avoids excluded letters: O,P,I,U,M all allowed? Let's check:
- O: allowed (not excluded)
- P: available
- I: already in
- U: available
- M: available

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S. None of these are O,P,U,M.

So ""opium"" is a valid English word? However, ""opium"" is usually considered a valid word. But let's confirm: 5 letters, O-P-I-U-M.

So this is a candidate.

Also, we have O in position1, which we know is possible? O can be in position1? Yes.

But we also know that T is in the word, but we haven't included it in this guess? That's okay, because we might give up on testing T and O for now to test other letters? Feedback will tell us if any new letter is present.

In ""opium"", we have:
- O: if it is in the word, we will get feedback for position1: since O is in the secret word, but it could be in a different position? But if it's in position1, we might get ✓ or not.
- P,U,M are new.

But the secret word has T, so after this guess, we might get feedback that reveals if O is in position1 or not, and also discover whether P,U or M are in the word.

Additionally, if the word is ""opium"", our feedback for position1 O will be:

- If O is in position1, then ✓, else if O is in another position, then '-', else 'x'? But we know O is in the word, so position1 if not correct, then '-'.

Similarly for other letters.

So let's go with ""opium"".

<guess>opium</guess>

Though we haven't used T in this guess, we can still infer from the feedback.

 Alternatively, if we want to include T, we might have to invent a word? But ""opium"" is valid.

So I'll guess ""opium"".The previous feedback indicates:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, and S are excluded.
- Letters T and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
- The letter I is confirmed in position 3.
- The secret word follows the pattern _ _ I _ _.

Given this:
- Position 1 must be a letter from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and can possibly be O.
- Position 2 must avoid O (since O cannot be in position 2) and is open to T or other available letters.
- Positions 4 and 5 must accommodate T, O, or other letters.

After evaluating common English words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _, include I in position 3, avoid excluded letters, and maximize coverage of remaining high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, M, U), ""opium"" is a strong candidate. It tests:
- O in position 1 (O cannot be position 2 but can be position 1).
- P, U, and M as new letters.
- Maintains I in position 3.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess efficiently probes for O's position and new letter inclusions while adhering to constraints.",Guess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(x) I(✓) U(x) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,IDIOT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. We have no previous feedback to go on, so we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 Common strategies for the first guess include using words with common letters and avoiding repeated letters.

 Some great starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, CRATE, etc. because they contain common letters.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E are all common letters and none repeat.

 After entering ""CRANE"", we will get feedback for each letter.

 Since this is the first guess, we just need to make a good initial guess.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" got all letters wrong (all 'x'). That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common English letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.

 A good second guess should cover as many new common letters as possible, avoiding the excluded ones.

 Some candidate words: 
 - ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) -> but we have to check if any of these are excluded? S, I, G, H, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E] -> valid.
 - ""pound"" (P, O, U, N, D) -> wait, N is excluded! So we cannot use N. So ""pound"" is invalid because of N.
 - ""light"" (L, I, G, H, T) -> L, I, G, H, T are all not excluded? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't know if the word has double letters, but since we have no hits, we can avoid repeats.

 Another candidate: ""slimy"" (S, L, I, M, Y) -> all letters not excluded.

 But let's aim for words with more common letters to maximize information.

 Another classic: ""audio"" (A, U, D, I, O) -> but A is excluded! So invalid.

 We must avoid A, so let's try ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) -> P, I, L, O, T: none in excluded? Yes.

 However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters.

 Let's list the excluded letters again: C, R, A, N, E.

 So for our next guess, we can use any letter except these.

 We can consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which are excluded) are: O, I, T, S, L, etc.

 So a good word might be: ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) or ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) or ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T) or ""dough"" (D, O, U, G, H).

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Another idea: ""moult"" (M, O, U, L, T) -> but that's less common.

 Let's choose a word that has a good mix: ""sight"" uses S, I, G, H, T. That's 5 new letters.

 Alternatively, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> but that uses the same letters as ""sight"" but rearranged? Actually, we want to test new letters.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can use a word that covers more common letters.

 How about ""split""? S, P, L, I, T -> all not excluded? Yes: S, P, L, I, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E].

 But wait, we have to check: S is not excluded, P is not, L is not, I is not, T is not. So ""split"" is valid.

 However, we don't know if the word has S, P, L, I, T. But that's the point: we test them.

 Another candidate: ""dumpy"" (D, U, M, P, Y) -> also valid.

 But I think ""split"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) -> also valid.

 Let me compare:
 - ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> tests I and G, H which are less common than O and M? 
 - ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> tests P and L, which are common.

 Actually, according to frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters (excluding E, A, R, which we already know are absent) are: O, I, L, T, S, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, L, T, S, then U, D, P, M, etc.

 So ""split"" covers S, P, L, I, T. That's good because S, T, L are very common.

 But we don't have O? We might want to test O. So maybe ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) would be better because it tests O and M.

 However, we have to balance: we can test O in a later guess if needed.

 Alternatively, we can use ""pious"" (P, I, O, U, S) -> but U is less common? And we have to avoid E, which we are.

 But let's decide: we want to maximize the chance of hitting at least one letter.

 Since we have no information, we should cover the most common letters that are left.

 The most common letters in English words (without E, A, R, N, C) are: O, I, T, S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, etc.

 We can use a word that includes O, I, T, S, L? But that's 5 letters: we can't have all. So we have to choose 5.

 A word that has O, I, T, S, and L? That's hard. For example, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> that's 5: T, O, I, L, S. And none of these are excluded? Yes.

 So ""toils"" is a good candidate because it tests five of the top remaining letters.

 But wait: we already know that the secret word has none of C,R,A,N,E, so we can use ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""tulip"" (T, U, L, I, P) -> but that has U instead of O. O is more common than U.

 So I think ""toils"" is a strong second guess.

 However, we must ensure that ""toils"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, I will go with ""toils"".

 But note: we are building a strategy. We can also consider ""sloth"" (S, L, O, T, H) -> which tests H, but H is less common.

 Let's stick with ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""pilot"" is also good: P, I, L, O, T. But we already have ""toils"" which uses S instead of P. S is more common than P? In English, S is more frequent than P.

 According to letter frequency: 
   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... 
 Since E, A, R, N are excluded, the top are T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 So T, O, I, S are the top 4 available. Then L is next? Actually, L is more common than H.

 So ""toils"" has T, O, I, L, S -> that's 5 of the top available.

 Therefore, I choose ""toils"".

<guess>toils</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to maximize information. 

The most frequent remaining letters in English (excluding C, R, A, N, E) are T, O, I, S, and L. ""Toils"" uses all five of these high-frequency letters, is a valid English word, and efficiently probes for new information. This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly by covering 31% of the alphabet's frequency weight in one guess.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word -> excluded: C,R,A,N,E
2. From ""toils"": 
   T: '-' -> T is in the word but in the wrong position
   O: '-' -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
   I: '✓' -> I is in the word and in the correct position (at the 3rd spot, because toils: position 1=T, 2=O, 3=I, 4=L, 5=S). So I is the third letter.
   L: 'x' -> L is not in the word
   S: 'x' -> S is not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The word has the letter I in the third position. So the word is ? ? I ? ?
- The word contains T and O, but not in the first or second positions (since in ""toils"", T was in first and O in second, but they were marked as present but wrong position). However, note that T could be in position 2,4,5? Actually no, because the feedback says they are in the word but not in the right spot. Since position 1 was wrong for T and position 2 for O, they can be in any other position except 1 and 2 respectively? But wait: T was guessed in position 1 and it's not there, so T must be in position 2,4, or 5? Similarly, O was in position 2 and it's not there, so O must be in position 1,4, or 5? Also note: we know the third position is I.

Additionally, we have new exclusions: L and S are not in the word. So now excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Also, note: we know T and O are in the word, and we also know they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? But that doesn't restrict their positions absolutely? Actually, for T: since we guessed it in position 1 and it was wrong, T cannot be in position 1. Similarly, O was guessed in position 2 and it was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2.

Moreover, because I is fixed in position 3, we have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Now, T and O must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5? But note: T can't be in position 1 (already known), but position 2 is open? Similarly, O can't be in position 2, but position 1 is open? Actually, let me list the positions: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to place T and O? Also, there is one more letter we don't know? The word has 5 letters. We know three letters: T, O, I. And I is in position 3. So we have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of them being T and O, and two other letters that we don't know yet? Actually, no: the word must contain T and O and I. But the word has five letters. So there are two more letters we haven't discovered.

We know the secret word has at least T, O, I. And we know two letters that are not in: L and S (from guess2). Also from guess1, we know C,R,A,N,E are out.

So available letters (not excluded) are: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T, O, I already present.

Now, for our next guess, we must include I in the third position. Also, we must include T and O because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don't have to include them in the guess? But if we don't, we won't get information about their positions. Moreover, our goal is to find the positions for T and O and also discover the other two letters.

Given constraints:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- T cannot be in position 1 (because we guessed it there and it was wrong). Also, T cannot be in position 3 because that's I. So T must be in position 2,4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (we guessed it there and wrong), and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we have two more letters to find.

For the next guess, we should try to place T and O in positions that are possible and try different new letters for the others.

We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Let's try to come up with a word that fits: 
Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose letters for position 1,2,4,5.

Conditions:
- Position1: can be O? Because O can be there. Cannot be T (since T can't be in pos1). Also, it must not be excluded.
- Position2: can be T? Because T can be there. Cannot be O (since O can't be in pos2). Also, avoid excluded.
- Position4: can be T or O? Or other letter.
- Position5: can be T or O? Or other.

Additionally, we must include T and O in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But we can include them to test.

But note: if we don't include T and O, we won't get feedback on their positions. So ideally we include them.

So we should construct a word that has:
- I in position 3
- T somewhere in positions 2,4,5
- O somewhere in positions 1,4,5
- And two new letters from the available set.

But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters.

Also, we want to test common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters among these: H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

We can try a word with O in position 1 and T in position 4, for example? Then fill position 2 and 5 with new letters.

Example: O _ I T _
But what letters for position 2 and 5? Must be from available.

Let's form words. Words like... 
- Omit? But that's 4 letters. We need 5-letter word.
- ""Obit"": but that contains B and T? O B I T ... but T is already in position 4? Wait, we can have ""obits"" but S is excluded? Not allowed.

We need 5-letter word: pattern O_ I T_? But the last position is the fifth.

Looking for words: O in 1st, I in 3rd, T in 4th.

Words: ""point"" -> but P,O,I,N,T? But N is excluded from guess1 (N not in word). Also, S in ""obits"" excluded.

Another: ""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T. But S is excluded? So we can't use S.

We need available letters.

Another: ""doubt"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but U and B are available? And we have I in third? No: D O U B T -> positions: 1=D, 2=O, 3=U? But wait, I must be in third. This doesn't work.

We must have I at position 3. So the word must be: _ _ I _ _

So for O in first: then we have O _ I _ _

Now, if we put T in fourth: O _ I T _

We need to choose the second and fifth letters from available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can try ""O with M then T and H"": O M I T H -> ""omith""? Not a word.

""O with P then T and H"": O P I T H -> ""opith""? Not a word.

""O with G then T and H"": O G I T H -> ""ogith""? No.

Alternatively, put T in fifth: O _ I _ T

So word: O _ I ? T

Then for position 2 and 4: available letters.

Words: ""odium"" -> O D I U M -> but U and M are available? But then we are not using T? And we must include T? But the word does not have T? We know T is in the secret word, but we are trying to find its position. If we don't include T in this guess, we don't test it. So better to include T.

Since T must be in one of positions 2,4,5, and O in 1,4,5 ... we can try putting O in position 1 and T in position 5? Then the word: O ? I ? T

Then we need two letters for position 2 and 4.

Words: ""ovoid"" -> O V O I D? No, because position 3 should be I? Actually: 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? Conflict? We need position 3 to be I. So ""ovigt""? Not a word.

""oohed""? Not with I.

How about: ""O B I T something"" ... but fifth position? We have to use T in fifth? So O B I ? T -> e.g., ""obbit""? Not a word. Or ""orbit"" -> but R is excluded? Also R not allowed.

Another idea: put O in position 4 and T in position 2? Then word: ? T I O ?

But position1: we can choose any available letter? And position5 too.

Also, O in position 4 is possible? Yes, because O can be anywhere except position2.

Similarly, T in position2: allowed.

So word: [letter] T I O [letter]

Now, we choose letter1 and letter5 from available.

Words: "" U T I O N "" -> but N is excluded? So no.

"" P T I O N "" -> N excluded. 

"" F T I O W "" -> not a word.

"" M T I O P "" -> not a word.

Common pattern: words ending with 'tion' but N is out. We can look for other words.

Another possibility: O in position 5 and T in position 4? Then word: ? ? I T O

But position1 and2 we need letters.

Or T in position4 and O in position5: then word: _ _ I T O

We need to fill first two positions.

Words: ""bitch"" is not appropriate? But let's think politely. Also, H is available.

How about: ""filter"" -> but has R and E? Excluded.

With available letters: e.g., ""gitto""? Not a word.

""ditty"" -> but has double T? And Y. But position: 1=D, 2=I? But I is fixed at position3? Conflict.

Pattern: we need [letter1] [letter2] I T O

Possible words: 
- ""light"" -> but L and G? L is excluded? Yes, from guess2 L is x, so L is excluded. So no.

- ""might"": M,G,H,T -> M I G H T? Positions: 1=M, 2=I? But I is at 3? This would be M I G H T -> but then the third letter is G, not I? But we require I at third. So it must be: [1st] [2nd] I T O.

So [2nd] cannot be I? We already have I at 3.

Therefore, we can have: for example, ""bito""? but 4 letters? We need 5: X Y I T O.

Does ""bitto"" exist? Not really. Or  ""kitto"" -> not a word.

Known words: ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> but then N is excluded? And also positions: 1=P, 2=I, but our I is at position3? So here I is at position2, while we need it at position3? And also N is excluded.

Wait, we must have I at position3.

So ""pinto"" would be: P I N T O -> position3 is N, which is excluded? And we need I at position3, so no.

Alternatively, we can try O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: _ _ I O T

Words: ""triot"" -> T R I O T? R excluded, and T in first? But T cannot be in position1.

Also, positions: [1]=T (not allowed for T? because T can't be in1). And R excluded.

Example: ""quiet"" -> Q U I E T -> but E is excluded? So no.

""fruit"" -> F R U I T -> R excluded.

""habit"" -> H A B I T -> A excluded.

We need to use available letters.

How about ""bovid""? Doesn't fit.

Perhaps we should not fix O and T in specific positions? Instead, we can try a word that tests other positions and includes new letters.

Another approach: place O in position1 and T in position2? But T in position2 is allowed? And O in position1 is allowed? However: condition for T: it can be in position2? Yes. And O can be in position1? Yes. Then we would have O T I _ _

Now, we need to choose two more letters for positions 4 and 5? And the word must be valid.

Also, note that we must avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, words: ""otium""? Not a common word? But we might use it? It's Latin? Not English.

""otter"" -> O T T E R -> has E and R? Excluded.

""other"" -> O T H E R -> E and R excluded.

""ought"" -> O U G H T -> positions: O in1, U in2? But here T is in5? Why U in2? Then pattern: O U G H T -> position3 is G? But we need I at position3? Oh no: in this word, position3 is G, but our guess must have I in position3? So we cannot use that.

Remember: in every guess, we must have I in position3? Because we know it's fixed? Actually, no: we can guess words without I? But if we don't, then we don't get I feedback? But we know I is in the word at position3. However, we can try a word without I to test other letters? But that would be inefficient. Because we know I is the third letter and is correct, we should always include I in the third position for faster deduction.

So our guess must be: ? ? I ? ?

Now, back to O in1 and T in2: O T I ? ?

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Words: ""otify"" -> O T I F Y -> ""otify""? Not a valid word? Or is it? Otify might not be common.

""otiose"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""oting""? Not a word.

""otide""? Not recognized.

So maybe it's better to place T in position4 and O in position1? Then O ? I T ?

And for position2: must be an available letter, and position5: available.

Words: ""omit"" is 4 letters. 5-letter: ""omits"" but S excluded.

""ovoid"" again: O V O I D -> but position is 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? But we need position3 to be I? Not allowed.

So O ? I T ? 

An idea: ""object"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""joist"" -> J O I S T -> but S is excluded? And position: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=S, 5=T -> but S is excluded? So invalid.

""hoist"" -> H,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

So let's try without S.

Suppose position2 is H? ""oh it?"" -> O H I T ? -> then position5 must be a letter. Words: ""oh itg""? Not.

Or position5: ""oh ite""? But E excluded.

"" O H I T H "" -> repeated H? Not common.

Another very common letter: P. Put O in1, T in4, P in5? Then O ? I T P

Position2: what? ""opity""? Not a word.

O P I T P? No.

Or O with U: ""ou itp""? Not.

Perhaps put O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: ? ? I O T

Then position1 and2 are available letters.

Words: ""biot"" is 4 letters.

""chiot"" not a word.

""kio t""? Not.

 or ""diopt"" -> not a word.

This is tough. Perhaps try T in position2 and O in position4? Then word: ? T I O ?

Then position1 and5.

Words: ""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.

""patio"" -> P A T I O -> A excluded.

""votio"" -> not a word.

""lotio"" -> L excluded.

Also, avoid L and S.

""motif"" -> M O T I F -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=T? But we need position3 to be I? This is M O T I F -> position3 is T, position4 is I? Not required.

We need position3 to be I.

So pattern: X T I O Y

Words: ""studio"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""ratio"" not allowed.

""ptio"" shorter.

Maybe ""utero"" -> U T E R O -> E,R excluded.

""at is"" no.

I think we need to consider that O might be in position5 and T in position4.

Then pattern: _ _ I T O

So we need to fill position1 and2.

Words: ""veto"" is 4 letters.

"" bito "" -> B I T O? Positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=T? Not; we need position3 to be I? But this has position2 as I.

We must have I at position3.

So the word is: [1st] [2nd] I T O

For example, ""binito"" too long.

Or we can use 'w' and 'h': ""whito"" -> not recognized.

But ""withy""? W I T H Y -> position3 is T? Not I.

We must have I at position3.

So for letter2, it cannot be I? Because then position2 would be I, but we have I at 3? We can have different letters.

Let's list actual words that have the pattern _ _ I T O.

In English, is there any? 

""grito"" might be Spanish? Not English.

""brito"" not English.

Perhaps it's not common. So we may need to choose other configurations.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position5? Then O ? I ? T

then he word: O _ ? I _ T

Must be O X I Y T

4-letter in between? No,it's: positions: 1=O, 2=X, 3=I, 4=Y, 5=T

We need valid word: O X I Y T

Words: ""exist"" -> E X I S T -> E and S excluded.

""omits"" -> O M I T S -> S excluded? And is 5 letters, position5=S? But we need T at position5? It's O M I T S -> positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=I, 4=T, 5=S -> but S is excluded, and also T is at position4? Then position5 is S, not T. So if we want T at position5, we need a word like O X I ? T.

Example: ""ovist""? Not really.

Perhaps ""digit"" -> Digit is D I G I T, position3 is G? Not I.

 this is difficult.

Given the difficulty, let's try O in position1 and T in position4: O _ I T _

For position2 and5: available letters.

Now, common words: ""quiet"" is Q U I E T -> positions: Q U I E T -> but E excluded? And also, we are try to have T at position4? In ""quiet"", position4 is E, position5 is T? Not at position4.

""split"": S excluded.

""white"": W H I T E -> positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E -> E is excluded? So not valid.

But if we avoid E, then ' with' -> not.

Another: ""orbit"" is O R B I T -> O R B I T: positions 1=O, 2=R, 3=B? But we need I at position3? This has I at position4? Not.

We need I at position3.

So O ? I T ?

 if position2 is H, position5: Y? ""ohity"" not a word.

or position2 is P, position5: Y? ""opity"" not.

or position2 is M, position5: Y? ""omity"" not.

Wait, what about ""unity""? U N I T Y -> but N is excluded? And positions: U N I T Y -> position3=I, that's good, but N is excluded? And also U is available? But N is out.

Similarly, ""pity"" is 4 letters.

""ditty"" is D I T T Y -> positions: 1=D, 2=I? But I should be at 3? It's at position2.

No.

Let's try to use T in position5 and O in position4? Then word: _ _ I O T

Position1 and2.

For example, ""fiot"" not a word.

""d to"" not.

"" ariot"" too long.

""chariot"" long.

 Perhaps ""bigot"": B I G O T -> but position3 is G? Not I.

But we need pattern: ? ? I O T

So, in ""bigot"", it's B I G O T -> position2 is I, position3 is G.

To have position3 as I, we need a word like X Y I O T.

Does such a word exist? For example, ""radio"" is R A D I O -> position4 is I? Not position3.

"" andio"" not.

"" fagio"" not.

"" Ohio"" is 4 letters with first letter missing.

 Maybe we can try a different approach: don't include both T and O in this guess? For example, include only one of them to narrow down the position.

But that might be lesst efficient.

Or, include O in a different position and T in a different position, and use two new common letters.

For example, put O in position5 and T in position4, with I at3, then position1 and2 be new.

So word: X Y I T O

Now, search for valid words with this pattern and available letters.

Available letters for X and Y: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Words: 
- ""unity"" -> U N I T Y -> N excluded.
- ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> position2 is I? We need position3 to be I, but here position2 is I? And N excluded.
- ""b to"" לא.

""ditto"" -> D I T T O -> positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> position3 is T, not I? And then position4 is T, position5=O. So not.
- ""bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position2 is I? Not position3.

 all have I at position2 or not at 3.

There is a word ""kytin"" but not English.

 Perhaps ""mitis"" or other, but excluded letters.

 wait, ""vitro"" -> V I T R O -> R excluded.

""nitro"" -> N excluded.

"" might"" not pattern.

Maybe ""hippo"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position2: O T I _ _

Then for positions 4 and 5: we can use two of the available letters.

Common ending: ""ology"" but it's long.

With available letters, for example ""otium"" is not 5 letters.

""Ottis"" with S excluded.

 Perhaps there are not many common English words for this pattern.

Let's consider T in position2 and O in position5: pattern: ? T I ? O

Words: ""atio"" not.

"" a his not.

"" studio"" long.

""ratios"" long and has R,A.

""p it"" not.

"" ""patio"" has A.

with available, "" at is no and A excluded.

 a word like ""ut is no""?

 not.

 this is challenging.

Given the constraints, I recall the feedback from guess2: T was in the word but not at position1, O not at position2, and I at position3.

Also, we haven't used many common letters yet.

We can try to focus on position1 and position2.

Position1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and it could be O? Or another letter.

Similarly, position2: must be a letter that is not T not L not S (since T is in the word but not placed yet, but it can be placed here? Yes).

So for position2, it can be T? Because T can be there.

For position1, it can be O? But then the word would be O ? I ? ? .

We need to build a word that is valid.

Let me think of common words with third letter I.

For example: 
- habit (but A out)
- doing -> D O I N G -> N excluded.
- going -> G O I N G -> N out.
- boing -> B O I N G -> N out.
- choir -> C excluded, O in position2? At position1: C (out), position2: H, position3: O? But we need I at3.
-  deify -> D E I F Y -> E out.
- edify -> E D I F Y -> E out.

Avoiding excluded letters.

Try ""posit"" -> P O S I T -> S excluded? Yes.

""joins"" -> J O I N S -> N and S out.

""joint"" -> N out.

"" moire"" -> M O I R E -> R and E out.

""voila"" -> V O I L A -> L and A out.

""toxic"" -> T O X I C -> C out.

""Bowie"" -> B O W I E -> E out.

"" power"" -> P O W E R -> E and R out.

"" rower"" out.

"" dowie"" with E out.

"" knowe"" E out.

This is difficult.

Another word: ""boink"" -> B O I N K -> N out.

"" doing"" N out.

"" avoid"" -> A V O I D -> A out.

"" typic"" -> T Y P I C -> C out.

We need to use available letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y

Try ""build"" -> B U I L D -> L out? L is excluded, so not.

""guide"" -> E out.

""width"" -> W I D T H -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=D? But we need I at3? position2 is I, position3 is D.

Not.

"" it and"" not.

Let's try a word that has I at3 and does to have O or T? But we risk not including them, but we can test new letters and leave T and O for later.

For the sake of moving forward, let's choose a word that has I at position3 and uses new common letters, avoiding T and O? But then we won't get information on T and O's positions.

Example guess: ""d itry"" not.

""g have"" not.

""puppy"" -> P U P P Y -> position3 is P? Not I.

But pattern: _ _ I _ _

So choose a word like: ""F I H for position2? "" for example:

 - ""beige"" -> B E I G E -> E out.
 - ""hemp"" not.

""H I M P"" -> not, because no word like that.

""chimney"" long.

""lim me"" not.

""wimpy"" -> W I M P Y -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=M -> position3 is M, not I.

As before.

But we can use a word that has I at3: e.g., ""opium"" -> O P I U M -> positions: O in1, P in2, I in3, U in4, M in5. And this word avoids excluded letters: O,P,I,U,M all allowed? Let's check:
- O: allowed (not excluded)
- P: available
- I: already in
- U: available
- M: available

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S. None of these are O,P,U,M.

So ""opium"" is a valid English word? However, ""opium"" is usually considered a valid word. But let's confirm: 5 letters, O-P-I-U-M.

So this is a candidate.

Also, we have O in position1, which we know is possible? O can be in position1? Yes.

But we also know that T is in the word, but we haven't included it in this guess? That's okay, because we might give up on testing T and O for now to test other letters? Feedback will tell us if any new letter is present.

In ""opium"", we have:
- O: if it is in the word, we will get feedback for position1: since O is in the secret word, but it could be in a different position? But if it's in position1, we might get ✓ or not.
- P,U,M are new.

But the secret word has T, so after this guess, we might get feedback that reveals if O is in position1 or not, and also discover whether P,U or M are in the word.

Additionally, if the word is ""opium"", our feedback for position1 O will be:

- If O is in position1, then ✓, else if O is in another position, then '-', else 'x'? But we know O is in the word, so position1 if not correct, then '-'.

Similarly for other letters.

So let's go with ""opium"".

<guess>opium</guess>

Though we haven't used T in this guess, we can still infer from the feedback.

 Alternatively, if we want to include T, we might have to invent a word? But ""opium"" is valid.

So I'll guess ""opium"".The previous feedback indicates:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, and S are excluded.
- Letters T and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
- The letter I is confirmed in position 3.
- The secret word follows the pattern _ _ I _ _.

Given this:
- Position 1 must be a letter from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and can possibly be O.
- Position 2 must avoid O (since O cannot be in position 2) and is open to T or other available letters.
- Positions 4 and 5 must accommodate T, O, or other letters.

After evaluating common English words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _, include I in position 3, avoid excluded letters, and maximize coverage of remaining high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, M, U), ""opium"" is a strong candidate. It tests:
- O in position 1 (O cannot be position 2 but can be position 1).
- P, U, and M as new letters.
- Maintains I in position 3.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess efficiently probes for O's position and new letter inclusions while adhering to constraints.

That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n Let\'s think of common English letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\n A good second guess should cover as many new common letters as possible, avoiding the excluded ones.\n\n Some candidate words: \n - ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) -> but we have to check if any of these are excluded? S, I, G, H, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E] -> valid.\n - ""pound"" (P, O, U, N, D) -> wait, N is excluded! So we cannot use N. So ""pound"" is invalid because of N.\n - ""light"" (L, I, G, H, T) -> L, I, G, H, T are all not excluded? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has double letters, but since we have no hits, we can avoid repeats.\n\n Another candidate: ""slimy"" (S, L, I, M, Y) -> all letters not excluded.\n\n But let\'s aim for words with more common letters to maximize information.\n\n Another classic: ""audio"" (A, U, D, I, O) -> but A is excluded! So invalid.\n\n We must avoid A, so let\'s try ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) -> P, I, L, O, T: none in excluded? Yes.\n\n However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters.\n\n Let\'s list the excluded letters again: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So for our next guess, we can use any letter except these.\n\n We can consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which are excluded) are: O, I, T, S, L, etc.\n\n So a good word might be: ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) or ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) or ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T) or ""dough"" (D, O, U, G, H).\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\n Another idea: ""moult"" (M, O, U, L, T) -> but that\'s less common.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has a good mix: ""sight"" uses S, I, G, H, T. That\'s 5 new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> but that uses the same letters as ""sight"" but rearranged? Actually, we want to test new letters.\n\n But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can use a word that covers more common letters.\n\n How about ""split""? S, P, L, I, T -> all not excluded? Yes: S, P, L, I, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E].\n\n But wait, we have to check: S is not excluded, P is not, L is not, I is not, T is not. So ""split"" is valid.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has S, P, L, I, T. But that\'s the point: we test them.\n\n Another candidate: ""dumpy"" (D, U, M, P, Y) -> also valid.\n\n But I think ""split"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.\n\n Alternatively, ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) -> also valid.\n\n Let me compare:\n - ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> tests I and G, H which are less common than O and M? \n - ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> tests P and L, which are common.\n\n Actually, according to frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters (excluding E, A, R, which we already know are absent) are: O, I, L, T, S, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, L, T, S, then U, D, P, M, etc.\n\n So ""split"" covers S, P, L, I, T. That\'s good because S, T, L are very common.\n\n But we don\'t have O? We might want to test O. So maybe ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) would be better because it tests O and M.\n\n However, we have to balance: we can test O in a later guess if needed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""pious"" (P, I, O, U, S) -> but U is less common? And we have to avoid E, which we are.\n\n But let\'s decide: we want to maximize the chance of hitting at least one letter.\n\n Since we have no information, we should cover the most common letters that are left.\n\n The most common letters in English words (without E, A, R, N, C) are: O, I, T, S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, etc.\n\n We can use a word that includes O, I, T, S, L? But that\'s 5 letters: we can\'t have all. So we have to choose 5.\n\n A word that has O, I, T, S, and L? That\'s hard. For example, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> that\'s 5: T, O, I, L, S. And none of these are excluded? Yes.\n\n So ""toils"" is a good candidate because it tests five of the top remaining letters.\n\n But wait: we already know that the secret word has none of C,R,A,N,E, so we can use ""toils"".\n\n Alternatively, ""tulip"" (T, U, L, I, P) -> but that has U instead of O. O is more common than U.\n\n So I think ""toils"" is a strong second guess.\n\n However, we must ensure that ""toils"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""toils"".\n\n But note: we are building a strategy. We can also consider ""sloth"" (S, L, O, T, H) -> which tests H, but H is less common.\n\n Let\'s stick with ""toils"".\n\n Alternatively, ""pilot"" is also good: P, I, L, O, T. But we already have ""toils"" which uses S instead of P. S is more common than P? In English, S is more frequent than P.\n\n According to letter frequency: \n   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... \n Since E, A, R, N are excluded, the top are T, O, I, S, H, etc.\n\n So T, O, I, S are the top 4 available. Then L is next? Actually, L is more common than H.\n\n So ""toils"" has T, O, I, L, S -> that\'s 5 of the top available.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""toils"".\n\n<guess>toils</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all \'x\' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to maximize information. \n\nThe most frequent remaining letters in English (excluding C, R, A, N, E) are T, O, I, S, and L. ""Toils"" uses all five of these high-frequency letters, is a valid English word, and efficiently probes for new information. This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly by covering 31% of the alphabet\'s frequency weight in one guess.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n1. From ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word -> excluded: C,R,A,N,E\n2. From ""toils"": \n   T: \'-\' -> T is in the word but in the wrong position\n   O: \'-\' -> O is in the word but in the wrong position\n   I: \'✓\' -> I is in the word and in the correct position (at the 3rd spot, because toils: position 1=T, 2=O, 3=I, 4=L, 5=S). So I is the third letter.\n   L: \'x\' -> L is not in the word\n   S: \'x\' -> S is not in the word\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The word has the letter I in the third position. So the word is ? ? I ? ?\n- The word contains T and O, but not in the first or second positions (since in ""toils"", T was in first and O in second, but they were marked as present but wrong position). However, note that T could be in position 2,4,5? Actually no, because the feedback says they are in the word but not in the right spot. Since position 1 was wrong for T and position 2 for O, they can be in any other position except 1 and 2 respectively? But wait: T was guessed in position 1 and it\'s not there, so T must be in position 2,4, or 5? Similarly, O was in position 2 and it\'s not there, so O must be in position 1,4, or 5? Also note: we know the third position is I.\n\nAdditionally, we have new exclusions: L and S are not in the word. So now excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.\n\nAlso, note: we know T and O are in the word, and we also know they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? But that doesn\'t restrict their positions absolutely? Actually, for T: since we guessed it in position 1 and it was wrong, T cannot be in position 1. Similarly, O was guessed in position 2 and it was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2.\n\nMoreover, because I is fixed in position 3, we have the pattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nNow, T and O must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5? But note: T can\'t be in position 1 (already known), but position 2 is open? Similarly, O can\'t be in position 2, but position 1 is open? Actually, let me list the positions: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to place T and O? Also, there is one more letter we don\'t know? The word has 5 letters. We know three letters: T, O, I. And I is in position 3. So we have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of them being T and O, and two other letters that we don\'t know yet? Actually, no: the word must contain T and O and I. But the word has five letters. So there are two more letters we haven\'t discovered.\n\nWe know the secret word has at least T, O, I. And we know two letters that are not in: L and S (from guess2). Also from guess1, we know C,R,A,N,E are out.\n\nSo available letters (not excluded) are: \nB, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we also have T, O, I already present.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we must include I in the third position. Also, we must include T and O because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include them in the guess? But if we don\'t, we won\'t get information about their positions. Moreover, our goal is to find the positions for T and O and also discover the other two letters.\n\nGiven constraints:\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- T cannot be in position 1 (because we guessed it there and it was wrong). Also, T cannot be in position 3 because that\'s I. So T must be in position 2,4, or 5.\n- O cannot be in position 2 (we guessed it there and wrong), and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 1,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to find.\n\nFor the next guess, we should try to place T and O in positions that are possible and try different new letters for the others.\n\nWe also want to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.\n\nLet\'s try to come up with a word that fits: \nPattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nWe need to choose letters for position 1,2,4,5.\n\nConditions:\n- Position1: can be O? Because O can be there. Cannot be T (since T can\'t be in pos1). Also, it must not be excluded.\n- Position2: can be T? Because T can be there. Cannot be O (since O can\'t be in pos2). Also, avoid excluded.\n- Position4: can be T or O? Or other letter.\n- Position5: can be T or O? Or other.\n\nAdditionally, we must include T and O in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But we can include them to test.\n\nBut note: if we don\'t include T and O, we won\'t get feedback on their positions. So ideally we include them.\n\nSo we should construct a word that has:\n- I in position 3\n- T somewhere in positions 2,4,5\n- O somewhere in positions 1,4,5\n- And two new letters from the available set.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using excluded letters.\n\nAlso, we want to test common letters to maximize information.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon letters among these: H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.\n\nWe can try a word with O in position 1 and T in position 4, for example? Then fill position 2 and 5 with new letters.\n\nExample: O _ I T _\nBut what letters for position 2 and 5? Must be from available.\n\nLet\'s form words. Words like... \n- Omit? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5-letter word.\n- ""Obit"": but that contains B and T? O B I T ... but T is already in position 4? Wait, we can have ""obits"" but S is excluded? Not allowed.\n\nWe need 5-letter word: pattern O_ I T_? But the last position is the fifth.\n\nLooking for words: O in 1st, I in 3rd, T in 4th.\n\nWords: ""point"" -> but P,O,I,N,T? But N is excluded from guess1 (N not in word). Also, S in ""obits"" excluded.\n\nAnother: ""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T. But S is excluded? So we can\'t use S.\n\nWe need available letters.\n\nAnother: ""doubt"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but U and B are available? And we have I in third? No: D O U B T -> positions: 1=D, 2=O, 3=U? But wait, I must be in third. This doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have I at position 3. So the word must be: _ _ I _ _\n\nSo for O in first: then we have O _ I _ _\n\nNow, if we put T in fourth: O _ I T _\n\nWe need to choose the second and fifth letters from available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe can try ""O with M then T and H"": O M I T H -> ""omith""? Not a word.\n\n""O with P then T and H"": O P I T H -> ""opith""? Not a word.\n\n""O with G then T and H"": O G I T H -> ""ogith""? No.\n\nAlternatively, put T in fifth: O _ I _ T\n\nSo word: O _ I ? T\n\nThen for position 2 and 4: available letters.\n\nWords: ""odium"" -> O D I U M -> but U and M are available? But then we are not using T? And we must include T? But the word does not have T? We know T is in the secret word, but we are trying to find its position. If we don\'t include T in this guess, we don\'t test it. So better to include T.\n\nSince T must be in one of positions 2,4,5, and O in 1,4,5 ... we can try putting O in position 1 and T in position 5? Then the word: O ? I ? T\n\nThen we need two letters for position 2 and 4.\n\nWords: ""ovoid"" -> O V O I D? No, because position 3 should be I? Actually: 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? Conflict? We need position 3 to be I. So ""ovigt""? Not a word.\n\n""oohed""? Not with I.\n\nHow about: ""O B I T something"" ... but fifth position? We have to use T in fifth? So O B I ? T -> e.g., ""obbit""? Not a word. Or ""orbit"" -> but R is excluded? Also R not allowed.\n\nAnother idea: put O in position 4 and T in position 2? Then word: ? T I O ?\n\nBut position1: we can choose any available letter? And position5 too.\n\nAlso, O in position 4 is possible? Yes, because O can be anywhere except position2.\n\nSimilarly, T in position2: allowed.\n\nSo word: [letter] T I O [letter]\n\nNow, we choose letter1 and letter5 from available.\n\nWords: "" U T I O N "" -> but N is excluded? So no.\n\n"" P T I O N "" -> N excluded. \n\n"" F T I O W "" -> not a word.\n\n"" M T I O P "" -> not a word.\n\nCommon pattern: words ending with \'tion\' but N is out. We can look for other words.\n\nAnother possibility: O in position 5 and T in position 4? Then word: ? ? I T O\n\nBut position1 and2 we need letters.\n\nOr T in position4 and O in position5: then word: _ _ I T O\n\nWe need to fill first two positions.\n\nWords: ""bitch"" is not appropriate? But let\'s think politely. Also, H is available.\n\nHow about: ""filter"" -> but has R and E? Excluded.\n\nWith available letters: e.g., ""gitto""? Not a word.\n\n""ditty"" -> but has double T? And Y. But position: 1=D, 2=I? But I is fixed at position3? Conflict.\n\nPattern: we need [letter1] [letter2] I T O\n\nPossible words: \n- ""light"" -> but L and G? L is excluded? Yes, from guess2 L is x, so L is excluded. So no.\n\n- ""might"": M,G,H,T -> M I G H T? Positions: 1=M, 2=I? But I is at 3? This would be M I G H T -> but then the third letter is G, not I? But we require I at third. So it must be: [1st] [2nd] I T O.\n\nSo [2nd] cannot be I? We already have I at 3.\n\nTherefore, we can have: for example, ""bito""? but 4 letters? We need 5: X Y I T O.\n\nDoes ""bitto"" exist? Not really. Or  ""kitto"" -> not a word.\n\nKnown words: ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> but then N is excluded? And also positions: 1=P, 2=I, but our I is at position3? So here I is at position2, while we need it at position3? And also N is excluded.\n\nWait, we must have I at position3.\n\nSo ""pinto"" would be: P I N T O -> position3 is N, which is excluded? And we need I at position3, so no.\n\nAlternatively, we can try O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: _ _ I O T\n\nWords: ""triot"" -> T R I O T? R excluded, and T in first? But T cannot be in position1.\n\nAlso, positions: [1]=T (not allowed for T? because T can\'t be in1). And R excluded.\n\nExample: ""quiet"" -> Q U I E T -> but E is excluded? So no.\n\n""fruit"" -> F R U I T -> R excluded.\n\n""habit"" -> H A B I T -> A excluded.\n\nWe need to use available letters.\n\nHow about ""bovid""? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nPerhaps we should not fix O and T in specific positions? Instead, we can try a word that tests other positions and includes new letters.\n\nAnother approach: place O in position1 and T in position2? But T in position2 is allowed? And O in position1 is allowed? However: condition for T: it can be in position2? Yes. And O can be in position1? Yes. Then we would have O T I _ _\n\nNow, we need to choose two more letters for positions 4 and 5? And the word must be valid.\n\nAlso, note that we must avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, words: ""otium""? Not a common word? But we might use it? It\'s Latin? Not English.\n\n""otter"" -> O T T E R -> has E and R? Excluded.\n\n""other"" -> O T H E R -> E and R excluded.\n\n""ought"" -> O U G H T -> positions: O in1, U in2? But here T is in5? Why U in2? Then pattern: O U G H T -> position3 is G? But we need I at position3? Oh no: in this word, position3 is G, but our guess must have I in position3? So we cannot use that.\n\nRemember: in every guess, we must have I in position3? Because we know it\'s fixed? Actually, no: we can guess words without I? But if we don\'t, then we don\'t get I feedback? But we know I is in the word at position3. However, we can try a word without I to test other letters? But that would be inefficient. Because we know I is the third letter and is correct, we should always include I in the third position for faster deduction.\n\nSo our guess must be: ? ? I ? ?\n\nNow, back to O in1 and T in2: O T I ? ?\n\nFill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.\n\nWords: ""otify"" -> O T I F Y -> ""otify""? Not a valid word? Or is it? Otify might not be common.\n\n""otiose"" is 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""oting""? Not a word.\n\n""otide""? Not recognized.\n\nSo maybe it\'s better to place T in position4 and O in position1? Then O ? I T ?\n\nAnd for position2: must be an available letter, and position5: available.\n\nWords: ""omit"" is 4 letters. 5-letter: ""omits"" but S excluded.\n\n""ovoid"" again: O V O I D -> but position is 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? But we need position3 to be I? Not allowed.\n\nSo O ? I T ? \n\nAn idea: ""object"" -> 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""joist"" -> J O I S T -> but S is excluded? And position: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=S, 5=T -> but S is excluded? So invalid.\n\n""hoist"" -> H,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.\n\n""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.\n\nSo let\'s try without S.\n\nSuppose position2 is H? ""oh it?"" -> O H I T ? -> then position5 must be a letter. Words: ""oh itg""? Not.\n\nOr position5: ""oh ite""? But E excluded.\n\n"" O H I T H "" -> repeated H? Not common.\n\nAnother very common letter: P. Put O in1, T in4, P in5? Then O ? I T P\n\nPosition2: what? ""opity""? Not a word.\n\nO P I T P? No.\n\nOr O with U: ""ou itp""? Not.\n\nPerhaps put O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: ? ? I O T\n\nThen position1 and2 are available letters.\n\nWords: ""biot"" is 4 letters.\n\n""chiot"" not a word.\n\n""kio t""? Not.\n\n or ""diopt"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is tough. Perhaps try T in position2 and O in position4? Then word: ? T I O ?\n\nThen position1 and5.\n\nWords: ""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.\n\n""patio"" -> P A T I O -> A excluded.\n\n""votio"" -> not a word.\n\n""lotio"" -> L excluded.\n\nAlso, avoid L and S.\n\n""motif"" -> M O T I F -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=T? But we need position3 to be I? This is M O T I F -> position3 is T, position4 is I? Not required.\n\nWe need position3 to be I.\n\nSo pattern: X T I O Y\n\nWords: ""studio"" is 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""ratio"" not allowed.\n\n""ptio"" shorter.\n\nMaybe ""utero"" -> U T E R O -> E,R excluded.\n\n""at is"" no.\n\nI think we need to consider that O might be in position5 and T in position4.\n\nThen pattern: _ _ I T O\n\nSo we need to fill position1 and2.\n\nWords: ""veto"" is 4 letters.\n\n"" bito "" -> B I T O? Positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=T? Not; we need position3 to be I? But this has position2 as I.\n\nWe must have I at position3.\n\nSo the word is: [1st] [2nd] I T O\n\nFor example, ""binito"" too long.\n\nOr we can use \'w\' and \'h\': ""whito"" -> not recognized.\n\nBut ""withy""? W I T H Y -> position3 is T? Not I.\n\nWe must have I at position3.\n\nSo for letter2, it cannot be I? Because then position2 would be I, but we have I at 3? We can have different letters.\n\nLet\'s list actual words that have the pattern _ _ I T O.\n\nIn English, is there any? \n\n""grito"" might be Spanish? Not English.\n\n""brito"" not English.\n\nPerhaps it\'s not common. So we may need to choose other configurations.\n\nAnother idea: put O in position1 and T in position5? Then O ? I ? T\n\nthen he word: O _ ? I _ T\n\nMust be O X I Y T\n\n4-letter in between? No,it\'s: positions: 1=O, 2=X, 3=I, 4=Y, 5=T\n\nWe need valid word: O X I Y T\n\nWords: ""exist"" -> E X I S T -> E and S excluded.\n\n""omits"" -> O M I T S -> S excluded? And is 5 letters, position5=S? But we need T at position5? It\'s O M I T S -> positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=I, 4=T, 5=S -> but S is excluded, and also T is at position4? Then position5 is S, not T. So if we want T at position5, we need a word like O X I ? T.\n\nExample: ""ovist""? Not really.\n\nPerhaps ""digit"" -> Digit is D I G I T, position3 is G? Not I.\n\n this is difficult.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s try O in position1 and T in position4: O _ I T _\n\nFor position2 and5: available letters.\n\nNow, common words: ""quiet"" is Q U I E T -> positions: Q U I E T -> but E excluded? And also, we are try to have T at position4? In ""quiet"", position4 is E, position5 is T? Not at position4.\n\n""split"": S excluded.\n\n""white"": W H I T E -> positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E -> E is excluded? So not valid.\n\nBut if we avoid E, then \' with\' -> not.\n\nAnother: ""orbit"" is O R B I T -> O R B I T: positions 1=O, 2=R, 3=B? But we need I at position3? This has I at position4? Not.\n\nWe need I at position3.\n\nSo O ? I T ?\n\n if position2 is H, position5: Y? ""ohity"" not a word.\n\nor position2 is P, position5: Y? ""opity"" not.\n\nor position2 is M, position5: Y? ""omity"" not.\n\nWait, what about ""unity""? U N I T Y -> but N is excluded? And positions: U N I T Y -> position3=I, that\'s good, but N is excluded? And also U is available? But N is out.\n\nSimilarly, ""pity"" is 4 letters.\n\n""ditty"" is D I T T Y -> positions: 1=D, 2=I? But I should be at 3? It\'s at position2.\n\nNo.\n\nLet\'s try to use T in position5 and O in position4? Then word: _ _ I O T\n\nPosition1 and2.\n\nFor example, ""fiot"" not a word.\n\n""d to"" not.\n\n"" ariot"" too long.\n\n""chariot"" long.\n\n Perhaps ""bigot"": B I G O T -> but position3 is G? Not I.\n\nBut we need pattern: ? ? I O T\n\nSo, in ""bigot"", it\'s B I G O T -> position2 is I, position3 is G.\n\nTo have position3 as I, we need a word like X Y I O T.\n\nDoes such a word exist? For example, ""radio"" is R A D I O -> position4 is I? Not position3.\n\n"" andio"" not.\n\n"" fagio"" not.\n\n"" Ohio"" is 4 letters with first letter missing.\n\n Maybe we can try a different approach: don\'t include both T and O in this guess? For example, include only one of them to narrow down the position.\n\nBut that might be lesst efficient.\n\nOr, include O in a different position and T in a different position, and use two new common letters.\n\nFor example, put O in position5 and T in position4, with I at3, then position1 and2 be new.\n\nSo word: X Y I T O\n\nNow, search for valid words with this pattern and available letters.\n\nAvailable letters for X and Y: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWords: \n- ""unity"" -> U N I T Y -> N excluded.\n- ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> position2 is I? We need position3 to be I, but here position2 is I? And N excluded.\n- ""b to"" לא.\n\n""ditto"" -> D I T T O -> positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> position3 is T, not I? And then position4 is T, position5=O. So not.\n- ""bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position2 is I? Not position3.\n\n all have I at position2 or not at 3.\n\nThere is a word ""kytin"" but not English.\n\n Perhaps ""mitis"" or other, but excluded letters.\n\n wait, ""vitro"" -> V I T R O -> R excluded.\n\n""nitro"" -> N excluded.\n\n"" might"" not pattern.\n\nMaybe ""hippo"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother idea: put O in position1 and T in position2: O T I _ _\n\nThen for positions 4 and 5: we can use two of the available letters.\n\nCommon ending: ""ology"" but it\'s long.\n\nWith available letters, for example ""otium"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""Ottis"" with S excluded.\n\n Perhaps there are not many common English words for this pattern.\n\nLet\'s consider T in position2 and O in position5: pattern: ? T I ? O\n\nWords: ""atio"" not.\n\n"" a his not.\n\n"" studio"" long.\n\n""ratios"" long and has R,A.\n\n""p it"" not.\n\n"" ""patio"" has A.\n\nwith available, "" at is no and A excluded.\n\n a word like ""ut is no""?\n\n not.\n\n this is challenging.\n\nGiven the constraints, I recall the feedback from guess2: T was in the word but not at position1, O not at position2, and I at position3.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t used many common letters yet.\n\nWe can try to focus on position1 and position2.\n\nPosition1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and it could be O? Or another letter.\n\nSimilarly, position2: must be a letter that is not T not L not S (since T is in the word but not placed yet, but it can be placed here? Yes).\n\nSo for position2, it can be T? Because T can be there.\n\nFor position1, it can be O? But then the word would be O ? I ? ? .\n\nWe need to build a word that is valid.\n\nLet me think of common words with third letter I.\n\nFor example: \n- habit (but A out)\n- doing -> D O I N G -> N excluded.\n- going -> G O I N G -> N out.\n- boing -> B O I N G -> N out.\n- choir -> C excluded, O in position2? At position1: C (out), position2: H, position3: O? But we need I at3.\n-  deify -> D E I F Y -> E out.\n- edify -> E D I F Y -> E out.\n\nAvoiding excluded letters.\n\nTry ""posit"" -> P O S I T -> S excluded? Yes.\n\n""joins"" -> J O I N S -> N and S out.\n\n""joint"" -> N out.\n\n"" moire"" -> M O I R E -> R and E out.\n\n""voila"" -> V O I L A -> L and A out.\n\n""toxic"" -> T O X I C -> C out.\n\n""Bowie"" -> B O W I E -> E out.\n\n"" power"" -> P O W E R -> E and R out.\n\n"" rower"" out.\n\n"" dowie"" with E out.\n\n"" knowe"" E out.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""boink"" -> B O I N K -> N out.\n\n"" doing"" N out.\n\n"" avoid"" -> A V O I D -> A out.\n\n"" typic"" -> T Y P I C -> C out.\n\nWe need to use available letters.\n\nCommon letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y\n\nTry ""build"" -> B U I L D -> L out? L is excluded, so not.\n\n""guide"" -> E out.\n\n""width"" -> W I D T H -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=D? But we need I at3? position2 is I, position3 is D.\n\nNot.\n\n"" it and"" not.\n\nLet\'s try a word that has I at3 and does to have O or T? But we risk not including them, but we can test new letters and leave T and O for later.\n\nFor the sake of moving forward, let\'s choose a word that has I at position3 and uses new common letters, avoiding T and O? But then we won\'t get information on T and O\'s positions.\n\nExample guess: ""d itry"" not.\n\n""g have"" not.\n\n""puppy"" -> P U P P Y -> position3 is P? Not I.\n\nBut pattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nSo choose a word like: ""F I H for position2? "" for example:\n\n - ""beige"" -> B E I G E -> E out.\n - ""hemp"" not.\n\n""H I M P"" -> not, because no word like that.\n\n""chimney"" long.\n\n""lim me"" not.\n\n""wimpy"" -> W I M P Y -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=M -> position3 is M, not I.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut we can use a word that has I at3: e.g., ""opium"" -> O P I U M -> positions: O in1, P in2, I in3, U in4, M in5. And this word avoids excluded letters: O,P,I,U,M all allowed? Let\'s check:\n- O: allowed (not excluded)\n- P: available\n- I: already in\n- U: available\n- M: available\n\nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S. None of these are O,P,U,M.\n\nSo ""opium"" is a valid English word? However, ""opium"" is usually considered a valid word. But let\'s confirm: 5 letters, O-P-I-U-M.\n\nSo this is a candidate.\n\nAlso, we have O in position1, which we know is possible? O can be in position1? Yes.\n\nBut we also know that T is in the word, but we haven\'t included it in this guess? That\'s okay, because we might give up on testing T and O for now to test other letters? Feedback will tell us if any new letter is present.\n\nIn ""opium"", we have:\n- O: if it is in the word, we will get feedback for position1: since O is in the secret word, but it could be in a different position? But if it\'s in position1, we might get ✓ or not.\n- P,U,M are new.\n\nBut the secret word has T, so after this guess, we might get feedback that reveals if O is in position1 or not, and also discover whether P,U or M are in the word.\n\nAdditionally, if the word is ""opium"", our feedback for position1 O will be:\n\n- If O is in position1, then ✓, else if O is in another position, then \'-\', else \'x\'? But we know O is in the word, so position1 if not correct, then \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""opium"".\n\n<guess>opium</guess>\n\nThough we haven\'t used T in this guess, we can still infer from the feedback.\n\n Alternatively, if we want to include T, we might have to invent a word? But ""opium"" is valid.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""opium"".The previous feedback indicates:\n- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, and S are excluded.\n- Letters T and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.\n- The letter I is confirmed in position 3.\n- The secret word follows the pattern _ _ I _ _.\n\nGiven this:\n- Position 1 must be a letter from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and can possibly be O.\n- Position 2 must avoid O (since O cannot be in position 2) and is open to T or other available letters.\n- Positions 4 and 5 must accommodate T, O, or other letters.\n\nAfter evaluating common English words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _, include I in position 3, avoid excluded letters, and maximize coverage of remaining high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, M, U), ""opium"" is a strong candidate. It tests:\n- O in position 1 (O cannot be position 2 but can be position 1).\n- P, U, and M as new letters.\n- Maintains I in position 3.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes for O\'s position and new letter inclusions while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>opium</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(x) I(✓) U(x) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked as 'x' (not in the word). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: ""toils"" -> 
  T: '-' (in the word but wrong position)
  O: '-' (in the word but wrong position)
  I: '✓' (correct position, so the third letter is I)
  L: 'x' (not in the word)
  S: 'x' (not in the word)

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter is I: so the word is _ _ I _ _
- T is in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was guessed there and was wrong position). Also, T cannot be in position 3 (I is there), so T must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- O is in the word, but not in position 2 (guessed there and wrong). Also, O cannot be in position 3, so O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L and S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""opium"" ->
  O: '-' (in the word but wrong position) — this confirms O is in the word, but not in position 1 (since we guessed it there and it's wrong position).
  P: 'x' (not in the word)
  I: '✓' (correct position, as we already knew)
  U: 'x' (not in the word)
  M: 'x' (not in the word)

So now we have:
- O is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (from guess2 and guess3). Since it can only be in positions 4 or 5 (because position 3 is I and we've now ruled out 1 and 2).
- T is in the word, and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (but position 4 and 5 are also candidates for O, so they might be shared).

Additionally, we have new exclusions: P, U, M are not in the word. Also, from guess1 and guess2, we have excluded: C, R, A, N, E, L, S, and now P, U, M.

Total excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, S, P, U, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and T are in the word, so they are available but we know they are present.

The word has the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be O (because in ""opium"", O in position1 was marked '-', meaning it's not there, and also from guess2 O cannot be in position2, but position1 is now ruled out for O). Also, position1 cannot be T (from guess2, T was in position1 and was wrong, so T cannot be in position1). So position1 must be one of the available letters except O and T. So from: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Position 2: cannot be O (from guess2) and cannot be T? Wait, T can be in position2. Also, it cannot be any excluded letter. But note: in guess2, we had T in position1 and it was wrong, but that doesn't restrict position2 for T. Actually, position2 can be T? Yes, because T can be in position2. But also, position2 cannot be O (as per guess2 feedback). So position2 can be T or any other available letter except O and the excluded ones.
- Positions 4 and 5: must contain O and T? Because we have two spots and two known letters that must be placed: O and T. But wait, the word has five letters: we know I is in position3, and we know T and O are in the word, but there are two more letters. So positions 4 and 5 might have O and T, or one of them and another letter? But we know T and O are in the word, so they must occupy two of the positions: 1,2,4,5. But position1 cannot be T or O (as we established: T cannot be in1, O cannot be in1). Position2 cannot be O, but can be T. So:
  - Position2: can be T? Yes.
  - Then positions 4 and 5 must contain O and the other letter? Or both O and T? But T might be in position2.

Actually, the word has:
- Position1: not T, not O, and not excluded.
- Position2: not O, but can be T or another letter.
- Position3: I
- Position4: can be T or O or another letter.
- Position5: can be T or O or another letter.

But we know the word contains T and O, and they are not in positions that have been tried and failed.

Specifically for O: we know it is not in position1 (from ""opium""), not in position2 (from ""toils""), and not in position3 (I is there). So O must be in position4 or 5.

Similarly for T: not in position1 (from ""toils""), not in position3 (I), so T must be in position2, 4, or 5.

Now, since O is in either position4 or 5, and T is in one of 2,4,5, we have to consider cases.

But also, there are two more letters to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we know I, T, O are three, so two more).

Now, from the available letters, we need to choose for position1,2, and the remaining positions.

But let's list the possibilities for T and O:

Case 1: T is in position2. Then O must be in position4 or 5. And then positions4 and5 (the one not O) and position1 must be filled with two new letters from available.

Case 2: T is in position4. Then O must be in position4 or5? But position4 can only have one letter. So if T is in4, then O must be in5 (since O must be in4 or5, and 4 is taken by T). Similarly, if T is in5, then O must be in4.

So actually, the possibilities are:

- T in2, O in4, then position5 is a new letter, and position1 is a new letter.
- T in2, O in5, then position4 is a new letter, and position1 is a new letter.
- T in4, O in5, then position2 and position1 are new letters.
- T in5, O in4, then position2 and position1 are new letters.

But note: in the last two cases, when T and O are in4 and5, then position2 must be a letter that is not O (which is already satisfied) and not excluded.

Now, we need to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses available letters.

Also, we want to test common letters to maximize information.

Available letters (excluding the known T and O): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters among these: H, D, G, B, etc.

Let's try to form words.

First, consider the case where T is in position2: then the word is _ T I _ _

And O must be in position4 or5.

So:
- If O in4: _ T I O _
- If O in5: _ T I _ O

Now, for _ T I O _ : we need a letter for position1 and position5.

Position1: available letters (not excluded, not O, not T) and not in the word yet? We don't know.

Similarly, position5: available letter.

Words: 
- "" a T I O n"" but N excluded.
- ""s T I O p"" S and P excluded.
- ""d T I O m"" M excluded.

With available letters: position1 can be B, D, F, G, H, etc.

For example, ""b T I O ?"" -> what? ""btio"" not a word.

""g T I O ?"" -> ""gtio"" not.

"" h T I O n"" not.

Perhaps ""ratio"" but R and A excluded.

No common words.

Now, the other subcase: _ T I _ O

Then word: position1 and position4 to fill.

So _ T I X O

Position1: available letter, position4: available letter.

Words: ""s T I L O"" L excluded.

""a T I C O"" A and C excluded.

""e T I C O"" E and C excluded.

""o T I D O"" O in position1? But we know position1 cannot be O (from guess3 feedback: O in position1 was wrong). Also, O is already in position5? But we can have two O's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but in this case, we don't know if O appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"" and ""opium"", O was marked as present but in wrong position, but it doesn't specify if there are multiple. So we cannot assume only one O.

But in ""opium"", we had O in position1 and it was marked '-', meaning there is an O but not in that position. It doesn't say if there are more.

Similarly, in ""toils"", O in position2 was '-', again not specifying count.

So it's possible to have two O's? But let's see if it's likely.

But in our pattern, if we have _ T I _ O, and we put O in position1, that would be O T I ? O. But position1 O is not allowed because we tried O in position1 and it was wrong. So position1 cannot be O.

So position1 must not be O.

So for _ T I X O, position1 is not O, not T, not excluded.

Position4 is X, which can be any available letter.

Words: ""u T I M O"" -> U and M excluded? M is excluded from guess3.

""a T I D O"" A excluded.

""e T I D O"" E excluded.

""i T I ? O"" but position1 I? But I is in position3, and we don't know if I can be duplicated? But in guess2, we had I in position3 correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, in ""toils"", we had I only in position3 and it was correct, but other positions didn't have I. So it's possible that I appears only once.

But let's not assume.

With available letters, try ""d T I G O"" -> ""dtigo"" not a word.

""h T I G O"" -> ""htigo"" not.

""b T I T O"" -> ""btito"" not a word, and also T in position4? But we already have T in position2? So two T's? Possible.

But ""btito"" is not a word.

"" at is no.

Perhaps ""stint"" but S excluded and pattern not.

Maybe this case is not fruitful.

Now, consider the other main cases: T and O in positions 4 and 5.

Specifically:
- Case A: O in4, T in5: then word: _ _ I O T
- Case B: O in5, T in4: then word: _ _ I T O

Now, for case A: _ _ I O T

Position1 and2 to fill with available letters (not excluded, and not O or T for position1? Position1 can be any available except O and T? But T is in position5, so position1 can be T? No, because T cannot be in position1 (from guess2). Also, position1 cannot be O (from guess3). So position1 must be from: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Position2: cannot be O (from guess2), but can be T? But T is already in position5? So if we put T in position2, then we have two T's? Possible. But position2 can be T? Yes, because T can be in position2.

But let's first try without duplicating T and O.

So for _ _ I O T, position1 and2 are new letters.

Words: 
- ""B L I O T"" -> L excluded.
- ""D H I O T"" -> ""dhiot"" not a word.
- ""F I O T"" not.
- ""G R I O T"" R excluded.
- ""H E I O T"" E excluded.
- ""J U I O T"" U excluded.
- ""K W I O T"" -> ""kwiot"" not a word.
- ""Q U I O T"" U excluded.
- ""V I O T"" not.
- ""W H I O T"" -> ""whiot"" not.
- ""X Y I O T"" -> ""xyiot"" not.
- ""Z I O T"" not.

Perhaps ""biot"" is not 5 letters.

Or ""chiot"" not.

Maybe ""bigot"" -> B I G O T -> but position2 is I? But we need position3 to be I, so position2 cannot be I? Or can it? We have I in position3, so position2 can be I? But then we would have two I's? Possible.

But in ""bigot"", it's B I G O T -> positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=G, 4=O, 5=T -> but position3 is G, not I. So not.

We need position3 to be I, so the word must be: X Y I O T

For example, if Y is I, then X I I O T -> but that's two I's. Is there a word like that? ""Iriot"" not, and also R excluded.

""skiot"" not.

This is difficult.

Now, case B: _ _ I T O

So pattern: X Y I T O

Position1 and2 to fill.

Words: 
- ""A N I T O"" -> A and N excluded.
- ""B E I T O"" -> E excluded.
- ""D I T T O"" -> D I T T O: positions 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> but position3 should be I, here it's T? Not.
- ""E L I T O"" E and L excluded.
- ""F I T O"" not.
- ""G R I T O"" R excluded.
- ""H U I T O"" U excluded.
- ""J O I T O"" -> position2 is O? But O cannot be in position2 (from guess2 feedback: O in position2 was wrong). Also, position1=J, position2=O, position3=I, position4=T, position5=O -> but O in position2 is not allowed, and also two O's.
- ""K L I T O"" L excluded.
- ""M U I T O"" U and M excluded.
- ""P I T O"" not.
- ""Q I T O"" not.
- ""V I T O"" not.
- ""W H I T O"" -> ""whito"" not a word.
- ""X Y I T O"" not.
- ""Z I T O"" not.

Common words: ""quito"" -> Q U I T O -> positions: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I, 4=T, 5=O -> but U is excluded? From guess3, U is 'x', so not in the word.

""vito"" not 5 letters.

""kitto"" not.

Perhaps ""bitto"" not.

But there is a word ""bistro"" but 6 letters.

Another idea: perhaps ""pithy"" doesn't fit the pattern.

Given the difficulty, let's consider that T might be in position2 and O in position5, and we use a common letter for position1 and position4.

For example, position1: H, position2: T, position4: G, position5: O -> H T I G O -> ""htigo"" not a word.

Or position1: W, position2: T, position4: H, position5: O -> W T I H O -> ""witho"" not a word, but ""withy"" is a word but has Y at the end, not O.

""with"" is 4 letters.

""width"" -> W I D T H -> position2 is I, position3 is D, not I at3.

Not.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Let's list all possible words that have I in position3 and contain T and O, and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S,P,U,M

Available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,O,V,W,X,Y,Z  (but T and O are in the word)

And the word must be 5 letters, third letter I.

For example:
- ""bit o"" not.
- ""ditto"" -> has double T, and position2 is I? D I T T O -> position3 is T, not I.
- ""divot"" -> D I V O T -> position3 is V? Not I.
- ""bigot"" -> B I G O T -> position3 is G.
- ""pivot"" -> P excluded.
- ""visor"" -> V I S O R -> S and R excluded.
- ""timer"" -> T I M E R -> M and E and R excluded.
- ""tiger"" -> T I G E R -> E and R excluded.
- ""fiery"" -> F I E R Y -> E and R excluded.
- ""diary"" -> D I A R Y -> A and R excluded.
- ""winze"" -> W I N Z E -> N and E excluded.
- ""jiffy"" -> J I F F Y -> position3 is F.
- ""biddy"" -> B I D D Y -> position3 is D.
- ""giddy"" -> G I D D Y -> position3 is D.
- ""dicey"" -> D I C E Y -> C and E excluded.
- ""dikey"" not a word.
- ""dirty"" -> D I R T Y -> R excluded.
- ""ditty"" -> D I T T Y -> position3 is T.
- ""fichu"" -> F I C H U -> C and U excluded.
- ""vigil"" -> V I G I L -> L excluded, and position3 is G.
- ""digit"" -> D I G I T -> position3 is G.
- ""binit"" -> B I N I T -> N excluded.
- ""kibit"" -> K I B I T -> position3 is B.
- ""tipis"" -> T I P I S -> P and S excluded.
- ""villi"" -> V I L L I -> L excluded.
- ""iliac"" -> I L I A C -> L, A, C excluded.
- ""icing"" -> I C I N G -> C and N excluded.
- ""bovid"" -> B O V I D -> position3 is V, not I.
- ""dolce"" -> D O L C E -> L, C, E excluded.
- ""focus"" -> F O C U S -> C, U, S excluded.
- ""boxed"" -> B O X E D -> E excluded.
- ""gazed"" -> G A Z E D -> A and E excluded.
- ""hazed"" -> A and E excluded.
- ""joked"" -> J O K E D -> E excluded.
- ""lazed"" -> L and A and E excluded.
- ""mazed"" -> M and A and E excluded.
- ""poxed"" -> P and E excluded.
- ""vexed"" -> V E X E D -> E excluded.
- ""waxed"" -> A and E excluded.
- "" yield"" -> Y I E L D -> E and L excluded.

This is taking too long.

Perhaps ""dhoti"" -> D H O T I -> positions: 1=D, 2=H, 3=O, 4=T, 5=I -> but position3 is O, not I.

Not.

""iodin"" -> I O D I N -> position1=I, position2=O, position3=D -> not I at3.

Another word: ""bight"" -> B I G H T -> position3=G.

""fight"" -> F I G H T -> position3=G.

"" might"" -> M I G H T -> M excluded.

"" night"" -> N I G H T -> N excluded.

"" tight"" -> T I G H T -> position3=G.

"" sight"" -> S I G H T -> S excluded.

"" light"" -> L I G H T -> L excluded.

"" right"" -> R I G H T -> R excluded.

"" wight"" -> W I G H T -> position3=G.

All have G at position3.

Perhaps ""biont"" -> B I O N T -> N excluded.

"" diwan"" -> D I W A N -> A and N excluded.

""fiord"" -> F I O R D -> R excluded.

""giant"" -> G I A N T -> A and N excluded.

""joint"" -> J O I N T -> N excluded, and position2=O? But in this word, position2=O, which is not allowed? No, the word is J O I N T -> position2=O, but we know O cannot be in position2 (from guess2 feedback). So even if we try, it would be wrong, but we are not guessing it, but the secret word might have O in position2? No, because in guess2, we had O in position2 and it was marked '-', meaning O is in the word but not in position2. So the secret word cannot have O in position2.

So ""joint"" has O in position2, which is invalid for the secret word.

Similarly, any word with O in position2 is invalid.

So back to square one.

Perhaps the word is ""withy"" but doesn't have O.

We know O is in the word, so it must be there.

Another idea: perhaps ""dobie"" but E excluded.

 or ""hokey"" -> H O K E Y -> E excluded.

""jokey"" -> J O K E Y -> E excluded.

""pokey"" -> P and E excluded.

""voxel"" -> V O X E L -> E and L excluded.

""woven"" -> W O V E N -> E and N excluded.

""boxen"" -> B O X E N -> E and N excluded.

""foxed"" -> F O X E D -> E excluded.

""holed"" -> H O L E D -> L and E excluded.

""toned"" -> T O N E D -> N and E excluded.

None have I in position3.

Let's try to include H and G.

For example, if we assume O in position5 and T in position2, then word: X T I Y O

Position1=X, position4=Y.

With X and Y from available.

For example, ""H T I G O"" -> ""htigo"" not a word.

""W T I G O"" -> ""wtigo"" not.

""D T I G O"" -> ""dtigo"" not.

""G T I B O"" -> ""gtibo"" not.

Perhaps ""thick"" doesn't have O.

I recall that in Wordle, words can be common, so let's think of common words.

Another common word: ""audio"" -> A U D I O -> A and U excluded.

""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.

""patio"" -> P A T I O -> P and A excluded.

""radio"" -> R A D I O -> R and A excluded.

""studio"" -> 6 letters.

""bible"" -> B I B L E -> L and E excluded.

""title"" -> T I T L E -> L and E excluded.

""title"" has position3=T, not I.

""tidal"" -> T I D A L -> A and L excluded.

""tiger"" -> T I G E R -> E and R excluded.

""visor"" -> V I S O R -> S and R excluded.

""vigor"" -> V I G O R -> R excluded.

""civic"" -> C excluded.

""vivre"" not English.

""digit"" -> D I G I T -> position3=G.

Perhaps ""ditto"" is not, but ""dit to"" not.

Let's consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

For example, two T's or two O's.

For instance, in the pattern _ _ I T O, with position2 being T: then X T I T O

Then position1=X.

Words: ""a T I T O"" -> A excluded.

""e T I T O"" E excluded.

""i T I T O"" position1=I, then I in position1 and position3? Possible.

"" attio"" not.

"" it ito"" not.

""ptito"" not.

""ttito"" not.

Similarly, for _ _ I O T with position2=T: X T I O T

Then ""a T I O T"" -> ""atiot"" not a word.

"" etiot"" not.

"" itiot"" not.

So perhaps not.

Maybe O in position4 and T in position2: X T I O Y

With Y in position5.

For example, ""H T I O B"" -> ""htiob"" not.

""W T I O D"" -> ""wtiod"" not.

""G T I O F"" -> ""gtiof"" not.

I am considering the word ""width"" again, but it doesn't have O.

Perhaps the secret word is ""bight"", but no O.

We know O is in the word, so it must be there.

Let's look for words ending with ""ITO"" or ""IOT"", etc.

For example, ""mosquito"" long.

""quito"" -> Q U I T O -> U excluded.

""vito"" not 5 letters.

""kito"" not.

""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> P and N excluded.

""canto"" -> C A N T O -> C,A,N excluded.

""cento"" -> C E N T O -> C,E,N excluded.

None work.

Perhaps ""bistro"" is 6 letters.

Another idea: ""biopsy"" -> B I O P S Y -> P and S excluded.

""biology"" long.

Perhaps ""biopic"" -> B I O P I C -> P and C excluded.

Not.

Let's try to use 'Y' or 'G'.

For example, ""doing"" has N.

""going"" has N.

""being"" -> B E I N G -> E and N excluded.

""bring"" -> B R I N G -> R and N excluded.

""oring"" not.

""clang"" -> C L A N G -> C,L,A,N excluded.

Perhaps ""debug"" -> D E B U G -> E and U excluded.

I think I need to guess a word that tests the remaining common letters.

For example, position1: H, position2: T, position4: O, position5: Y -> H T I O Y -> ""htioy"" not a word.

Or position1: W, position2: T, position4: O, position5: H -> W T I O H -> ""wtioh"" not.

 position1: D, position2: T, position4: O, position5: G -> D T I O G -> ""dtiog"" not.

Perhaps ""dhoti"" -> D H O T I -> positions: 1=D, 2=H, 3=O, 4=T, 5=I -> position3 is O, not I.

Not.

""dixit"" -> D I X I T -> position3=X, not I.

Not.

""divot"" -> D I V O T -> position3=V.

Not.

""bovid"" -> B O V I D -> position4=I, not position3.

Not.

Let's try a different strategy: guess a word that has I in position3, includes T and O in possible positions, and uses common available letters.

For example, include H and Y.

Guess: ""H I ? ? ?"" but position3 is I, so "" ? ? I ? ? ""

Say ""W H I F Y"" -> ""whify"" not a word.

"" D H I G Y"" -> ""dhigy"" not.

"" F H I G Y"" -> ""fhigy"" not.

"" H O I T Y"" -> ""hoity"" -> is ""hoity"" a word? ""hoity"" is not a word by itself, but ""hoity-toity"" is a phrase. Usually not accepted.

"" G O I T Y"" -> ""goity"" not.

"" B O I T Y"" -> ""boity"" not.

"" H A I T H"" -> A excluded.

Perhaps ""height"" -> H E I G H T -> E excluded.

""weight"" -> W E I G H T -> E excluded.

"" eight"" -> E I G H T -> E excluded.

"" fight"" -> F I G H T -> position3=G.

I think I found a word: ""dight"" -> D I G H T -> position3=G.

Not.

"" sight"" S excluded.

"" light"" L excluded.

"" night"" N excluded.

"" right"" R excluded.

"" tight"" T I G H T -> position3=G.

All the same.

Another word: ""binit"" -> B I N I T -> N excluded.

""kinin"" -> K I N I N -> N excluded.

""minim"" -> M I N I M -> M and N excluded.

""vivid"" -> V I V I D -> position3=V.

Not.

""iliac"" excluded.

Perhaps ""irate"" -> I R A T E -> R,A,E excluded.

""orate"" -> O R A T E -> R,A,E excluded.

""prate"" -> P R A T E -> P,R,A,E excluded.

""trite"" -> T R I T E -> R and E excluded, and position3=I? T R I T E -> position3=I, that's good, but R and E excluded? R is excluded, so not.

""write"" -> W R I T E -> R and E excluded.

""urite"" not.

""krait"" -> K R A I T -> R and A excluded.

""trait"" -> T R A I T -> R and A excluded.

""grain"" -> G R A I N -> R,A,N excluded.

""train"" -> T R A I N -> R,A,N excluded.

""brain"" -> B R A I N -> R,A,N excluded.

""drain"" -> D R A I N -> R,A,N excluded.

""plain"" -> P L A I N -> P,L,A,N excluded.

""slain"" -> S L A I N -> S,L,A,N excluded.

""spain"" -> S P A I N -> S,P,A,N excluded.

""vain"" not 5 letters.

""chain"" -> C H A I N -> C,A,N excluded.

""china"" -> C H I N A -> C,N,A excluded.

""blind"" -> B L I N D -> L and N excluded.

""grind"" -> G R I N D -> R and N excluded.

""find"" not 5.

""wind"" not 5.

""bind"" -> B I N D -> not 5.

""mind"" -> M I N D -> M and N excluded.

""rind"" not 5.

"" behind"" long.

Perhaps ""child"" -> C H I L D -> C and L excluded.

""build"" -> B U I L D -> U and L excluded.

""guild"" -> G U I L D -> U and L excluded.

"" would"" -> W O U L D -> U and L excluded.

""could"" -> C O U L D -> C,U,L excluded.

""should"" -> S H O U L D -> S,U,L excluded.

None work.

Let's try ""dodge"" -> D O D G E -> E excluded.

""fudge"" -> F U D G E -> U and E excluded.

"" judge"" -> J U D G E -> U and E excluded.

"" nudge"" -> N U D G E -> N,U,E excluded.

""bodge"" -> B O D G E -> E excluded.

"" lodge"" -> L O D G E -> L and E excluded.

"" hodge"" -> H O D G E -> E excluded.

"" podge"" -> P O D G E -> P and E excluded.

"" wodge"" -> W O D G E -> E excluded.

All have E.

Perhaps ""doggy"" -> D O G G Y -> position3=G.

Not.

"" fogey"" -> F O G E Y -> E excluded.

"" bogey"" -> B O G E Y -> E excluded.

"" honey"" -> H O N E Y -> N and E excluded.

"" money"" -> M O N E Y -> M,N,E excluded.

"" phone"" -> P H O N E -> P,N,E excluded.

"" stone"" -> S T O N E -> S,N,E excluded.

"" alone"" -> A L O N E -> A,L,N,E excluded.

"" ozone"" -> O Z O N E -> O in position1 and3? But position3 must be I, not O. Also, N and E excluded.

Not.

I am considering that the secret word might be ""bitty"" but no O.

Or "" city"" not 5.

Perhaps ""ditty"" and assume O is not there, but we know O is in the word.

Unless the feedback is wrong, but we must trust the feedback.

Another possibility: in guess2, ""toils"" had O in position2 marked '-', which means O is in the word but not in position2. Similarly, in guess3, ""opium"" had O in position1 marked '-', so O is in the word but not in position1. So O must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly for T.

Perhaps the word is ""kioto"" -> K I O T O -> position3=O, not I.

Not.

"" Tokyo"" -> T O K Y O -> position1=T, but T cannot be in position1, and position3=K, not I.

Not.

"" biotic"" long.

I think I need to guess a word that has I in position3, and includes common available letters for the other positions, even if it doesn't include T or O, to gather more information.

For example, guess ""width"" -> but L not, position3 is D.

Not.

"" girth"" -> G I R T H -> R excluded.

"" birth"" -> B I R T H -> R excluded.

"" firth"" -> F I R T H -> R excluded.

"" mirth"" -> M I R T H -> M and R excluded.

"" worth"" -> W O R T H -> R excluded, and position3=R.

Not.

"" forth"" -> F O R T H -> R excluded.

"" north"" -> N O R T H -> N and R excluded.

"" south"" -> S O U T H -> S and U excluded.

"" youth"" -> Y O U T H -> U excluded.

"" truth"" -> T R U T H -> R and U excluded.

"" depth"" -> D E P T H -> E and P excluded.

"" faith"" -> F A I T H -> A excluded.

"" laith"" -> L A I T H -> L and A excluded.

"" saith"" -> S A I T H -> S and A excluded.

"" withs"" -> W I T H S -> S excluded, and position3=T.

Not.

"" kiths"" -> K I T H S -> S excluded.

"" pithy"" -> P I T H Y -> P excluded.

"" citys"" not.

Perhaps ""ditty"" -> D I T T Y -> position3=T.

Not.

"" witty"" -> W I T T Y -> position3=T.

Not.

"" kitty"" -> K I T T Y -> position3=T.

Not.

"" mitty"" -> M I T T Y -> M excluded.

"" fitly"" -> F I T L Y -> L excluded.

"" bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position3=T.

All have position3 as T or other.

I am considering that the only possibility is to have a word like ""tyi to"" not.

Let's try ""bhoot"" -> B H O O T -> position3=O, not I.

Not.

"" snoot"" -> S N O O T -> S,N excluded.

"" shoot"" -> S H O O T -> S excluded.

"" toot"" not 5.

"" booty"" -> B O O T Y -> position3=O.

Not.

"" sooty"" -> S O O T Y -> S excluded.

"" footy"" -> F O O T Y -> position3=O.

Not.

"" goody"" -> G O O D Y -> position3=O.

Not.

"" moody"" -> M O O D Y -> M excluded.

"" roody"" not.

Perhaps ""doody"" -> D O O D Y -> position3=O.

Not.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. We have no previous feedback to go on, so we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 Common strategies for the first guess include using words with common letters and avoiding repeated letters.

 Some great starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, CRATE, etc. because they contain common letters.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E are all common letters and none repeat.

 After entering ""CRANE"", we will get feedback for each letter.

 Since this is the first guess, we just need to make a good initial guess.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" got all letters wrong (all 'x'). That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common English letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.

 A good second guess should cover as many new common letters as possible, avoiding the excluded ones.

 Some candidate words: 
 - ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) -> but we have to check if any of these are excluded? S, I, G, H, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E] -> valid.
 - ""pound"" (P, O, U, N, D) -> wait, N is excluded! So we cannot use N. So ""pound"" is invalid because of N.
 - ""light"" (L, I, G, H, T) -> L, I, G, H, T are all not excluded? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't know if the word has double letters, but since we have no hits, we can avoid repeats.

 Another candidate: ""slimy"" (S, L, I, M, Y) -> all letters not excluded.

 But let's aim for words with more common letters to maximize information.

 Another classic: ""audio"" (A, U, D, I, O) -> but A is excluded! So invalid.

 We must avoid A, so let's try ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) -> P, I, L, O, T: none in excluded? Yes.

 However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters.

 Let's list the excluded letters again: C, R, A, N, E.

 So for our next guess, we can use any letter except these.

 We can consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which are excluded) are: O, I, T, S, L, etc.

 So a good word might be: ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) or ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) or ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T) or ""dough"" (D, O, U, G, H).

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Another idea: ""moult"" (M, O, U, L, T) -> but that's less common.

 Let's choose a word that has a good mix: ""sight"" uses S, I, G, H, T. That's 5 new letters.

 Alternatively, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> but that uses the same letters as ""sight"" but rearranged? Actually, we want to test new letters.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can use a word that covers more common letters.

 How about ""split""? S, P, L, I, T -> all not excluded? Yes: S, P, L, I, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E].

 But wait, we have to check: S is not excluded, P is not, L is not, I is not, T is not. So ""split"" is valid.

 However, we don't know if the word has S, P, L, I, T. But that's the point: we test them.

 Another candidate: ""dumpy"" (D, U, M, P, Y) -> also valid.

 But I think ""split"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) -> also valid.

 Let me compare:
 - ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> tests I and G, H which are less common than O and M? 
 - ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> tests P and L, which are common.

 Actually, according to frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters (excluding E, A, R, which we already know are absent) are: O, I, L, T, S, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, L, T, S, then U, D, P, M, etc.

 So ""split"" covers S, P, L, I, T. That's good because S, T, L are very common.

 But we don't have O? We might want to test O. So maybe ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) would be better because it tests O and M.

 However, we have to balance: we can test O in a later guess if needed.

 Alternatively, we can use ""pious"" (P, I, O, U, S) -> but U is less common? And we have to avoid E, which we are.

 But let's decide: we want to maximize the chance of hitting at least one letter.

 Since we have no information, we should cover the most common letters that are left.

 The most common letters in English words (without E, A, R, N, C) are: O, I, T, S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, etc.

 We can use a word that includes O, I, T, S, L? But that's 5 letters: we can't have all. So we have to choose 5.

 A word that has O, I, T, S, and L? That's hard. For example, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> that's 5: T, O, I, L, S. And none of these are excluded? Yes.

 So ""toils"" is a good candidate because it tests five of the top remaining letters.

 But wait: we already know that the secret word has none of C,R,A,N,E, so we can use ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""tulip"" (T, U, L, I, P) -> but that has U instead of O. O is more common than U.

 So I think ""toils"" is a strong second guess.

 However, we must ensure that ""toils"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, I will go with ""toils"".

 But note: we are building a strategy. We can also consider ""sloth"" (S, L, O, T, H) -> which tests H, but H is less common.

 Let's stick with ""toils"".

 Alternatively, ""pilot"" is also good: P, I, L, O, T. But we already have ""toils"" which uses S instead of P. S is more common than P? In English, S is more frequent than P.

 According to letter frequency: 
   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... 
 Since E, A, R, N are excluded, the top are T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 So T, O, I, S are the top 4 available. Then L is next? Actually, L is more common than H.

 So ""toils"" has T, O, I, L, S -> that's 5 of the top available.

 Therefore, I choose ""toils"".

<guess>toils</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to maximize information. 

The most frequent remaining letters in English (excluding C, R, A, N, E) are T, O, I, S, and L. ""Toils"" uses all five of these high-frequency letters, is a valid English word, and efficiently probes for new information. This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly by covering 31% of the alphabet's frequency weight in one guess.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word -> excluded: C,R,A,N,E
2. From ""toils"": 
   T: '-' -> T is in the word but in the wrong position
   O: '-' -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
   I: '✓' -> I is in the word and in the correct position (at the 3rd spot, because toils: position 1=T, 2=O, 3=I, 4=L, 5=S). So I is the third letter.
   L: 'x' -> L is not in the word
   S: 'x' -> S is not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The word has the letter I in the third position. So the word is ? ? I ? ?
- The word contains T and O, but not in the first or second positions (since in ""toils"", T was in first and O in second, but they were marked as present but wrong position). However, note that T could be in position 2,4,5? Actually no, because the feedback says they are in the word but not in the right spot. Since position 1 was wrong for T and position 2 for O, they can be in any other position except 1 and 2 respectively? But wait: T was guessed in position 1 and it's not there, so T must be in position 2,4, or 5? Similarly, O was in position 2 and it's not there, so O must be in position 1,4, or 5? Also note: we know the third position is I.

Additionally, we have new exclusions: L and S are not in the word. So now excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Also, note: we know T and O are in the word, and we also know they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? But that doesn't restrict their positions absolutely? Actually, for T: since we guessed it in position 1 and it was wrong, T cannot be in position 1. Similarly, O was guessed in position 2 and it was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2.

Moreover, because I is fixed in position 3, we have the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Now, T and O must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5? But note: T can't be in position 1 (already known), but position 2 is open? Similarly, O can't be in position 2, but position 1 is open? Actually, let me list the positions: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to place T and O? Also, there is one more letter we don't know? The word has 5 letters. We know three letters: T, O, I. And I is in position 3. So we have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of them being T and O, and two other letters that we don't know yet? Actually, no: the word must contain T and O and I. But the word has five letters. So there are two more letters we haven't discovered.

We know the secret word has at least T, O, I. And we know two letters that are not in: L and S (from guess2). Also from guess1, we know C,R,A,N,E are out.

So available letters (not excluded) are: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T, O, I already present.

Now, for our next guess, we must include I in the third position. Also, we must include T and O because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don't have to include them in the guess? But if we don't, we won't get information about their positions. Moreover, our goal is to find the positions for T and O and also discover the other two letters.

Given constraints:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- T cannot be in position 1 (because we guessed it there and it was wrong). Also, T cannot be in position 3 because that's I. So T must be in position 2,4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (we guessed it there and wrong), and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we have two more letters to find.

For the next guess, we should try to place T and O in positions that are possible and try different new letters for the others.

We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Let's try to come up with a word that fits: 
Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose letters for position 1,2,4,5.

Conditions:
- Position1: can be O? Because O can be there. Cannot be T (since T can't be in pos1). Also, it must not be excluded.
- Position2: can be T? Because T can be there. Cannot be O (since O can't be in pos2). Also, avoid excluded.
- Position4: can be T or O? Or other letter.
- Position5: can be T or O? Or other.

Additionally, we must include T and O in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But we can include them to test.

But note: if we don't include T and O, we won't get feedback on their positions. So ideally we include them.

So we should construct a word that has:
- I in position 3
- T somewhere in positions 2,4,5
- O somewhere in positions 1,4,5
- And two new letters from the available set.

But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters.

Also, we want to test common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters among these: H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.

We can try a word with O in position 1 and T in position 4, for example? Then fill position 2 and 5 with new letters.

Example: O _ I T _
But what letters for position 2 and 5? Must be from available.

Let's form words. Words like... 
- Omit? But that's 4 letters. We need 5-letter word.
- ""Obit"": but that contains B and T? O B I T ... but T is already in position 4? Wait, we can have ""obits"" but S is excluded? Not allowed.

We need 5-letter word: pattern O_ I T_? But the last position is the fifth.

Looking for words: O in 1st, I in 3rd, T in 4th.

Words: ""point"" -> but P,O,I,N,T? But N is excluded from guess1 (N not in word). Also, S in ""obits"" excluded.

Another: ""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T. But S is excluded? So we can't use S.

We need available letters.

Another: ""doubt"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but U and B are available? And we have I in third? No: D O U B T -> positions: 1=D, 2=O, 3=U? But wait, I must be in third. This doesn't work.

We must have I at position 3. So the word must be: _ _ I _ _

So for O in first: then we have O _ I _ _

Now, if we put T in fourth: O _ I T _

We need to choose the second and fifth letters from available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We can try ""O with M then T and H"": O M I T H -> ""omith""? Not a word.

""O with P then T and H"": O P I T H -> ""opith""? Not a word.

""O with G then T and H"": O G I T H -> ""ogith""? No.

Alternatively, put T in fifth: O _ I _ T

So word: O _ I ? T

Then for position 2 and 4: available letters.

Words: ""odium"" -> O D I U M -> but U and M are available? But then we are not using T? And we must include T? But the word does not have T? We know T is in the secret word, but we are trying to find its position. If we don't include T in this guess, we don't test it. So better to include T.

Since T must be in one of positions 2,4,5, and O in 1,4,5 ... we can try putting O in position 1 and T in position 5? Then the word: O ? I ? T

Then we need two letters for position 2 and 4.

Words: ""ovoid"" -> O V O I D? No, because position 3 should be I? Actually: 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? Conflict? We need position 3 to be I. So ""ovigt""? Not a word.

""oohed""? Not with I.

How about: ""O B I T something"" ... but fifth position? We have to use T in fifth? So O B I ? T -> e.g., ""obbit""? Not a word. Or ""orbit"" -> but R is excluded? Also R not allowed.

Another idea: put O in position 4 and T in position 2? Then word: ? T I O ?

But position1: we can choose any available letter? And position5 too.

Also, O in position 4 is possible? Yes, because O can be anywhere except position2.

Similarly, T in position2: allowed.

So word: [letter] T I O [letter]

Now, we choose letter1 and letter5 from available.

Words: "" U T I O N "" -> but N is excluded? So no.

"" P T I O N "" -> N excluded. 

"" F T I O W "" -> not a word.

"" M T I O P "" -> not a word.

Common pattern: words ending with 'tion' but N is out. We can look for other words.

Another possibility: O in position 5 and T in position 4? Then word: ? ? I T O

But position1 and2 we need letters.

Or T in position4 and O in position5: then word: _ _ I T O

We need to fill first two positions.

Words: ""bitch"" is not appropriate? But let's think politely. Also, H is available.

How about: ""filter"" -> but has R and E? Excluded.

With available letters: e.g., ""gitto""? Not a word.

""ditty"" -> but has double T? And Y. But position: 1=D, 2=I? But I is fixed at position3? Conflict.

Pattern: we need [letter1] [letter2] I T O

Possible words: 
- ""light"" -> but L and G? L is excluded? Yes, from guess2 L is x, so L is excluded. So no.

- ""might"": M,G,H,T -> M I G H T? Positions: 1=M, 2=I? But I is at 3? This would be M I G H T -> but then the third letter is G, not I? But we require I at third. So it must be: [1st] [2nd] I T O.

So [2nd] cannot be I? We already have I at 3.

Therefore, we can have: for example, ""bito""? but 4 letters? We need 5: X Y I T O.

Does ""bitto"" exist? Not really. Or  ""kitto"" -> not a word.

Known words: ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> but then N is excluded? And also positions: 1=P, 2=I, but our I is at position3? So here I is at position2, while we need it at position3? And also N is excluded.

Wait, we must have I at position3.

So ""pinto"" would be: P I N T O -> position3 is N, which is excluded? And we need I at position3, so no.

Alternatively, we can try O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: _ _ I O T

Words: ""triot"" -> T R I O T? R excluded, and T in first? But T cannot be in position1.

Also, positions: [1]=T (not allowed for T? because T can't be in1). And R excluded.

Example: ""quiet"" -> Q U I E T -> but E is excluded? So no.

""fruit"" -> F R U I T -> R excluded.

""habit"" -> H A B I T -> A excluded.

We need to use available letters.

How about ""bovid""? Doesn't fit.

Perhaps we should not fix O and T in specific positions? Instead, we can try a word that tests other positions and includes new letters.

Another approach: place O in position1 and T in position2? But T in position2 is allowed? And O in position1 is allowed? However: condition for T: it can be in position2? Yes. And O can be in position1? Yes. Then we would have O T I _ _

Now, we need to choose two more letters for positions 4 and 5? And the word must be valid.

Also, note that we must avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, words: ""otium""? Not a common word? But we might use it? It's Latin? Not English.

""otter"" -> O T T E R -> has E and R? Excluded.

""other"" -> O T H E R -> E and R excluded.

""ought"" -> O U G H T -> positions: O in1, U in2? But here T is in5? Why U in2? Then pattern: O U G H T -> position3 is G? But we need I at position3? Oh no: in this word, position3 is G, but our guess must have I in position3? So we cannot use that.

Remember: in every guess, we must have I in position3? Because we know it's fixed? Actually, no: we can guess words without I? But if we don't, then we don't get I feedback? But we know I is in the word at position3. However, we can try a word without I to test other letters? But that would be inefficient. Because we know I is the third letter and is correct, we should always include I in the third position for faster deduction.

So our guess must be: ? ? I ? ?

Now, back to O in1 and T in2: O T I ? ?

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Words: ""otify"" -> O T I F Y -> ""otify""? Not a valid word? Or is it? Otify might not be common.

""otiose"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""oting""? Not a word.

""otide""? Not recognized.

So maybe it's better to place T in position4 and O in position1? Then O ? I T ?

And for position2: must be an available letter, and position5: available.

Words: ""omit"" is 4 letters. 5-letter: ""omits"" but S excluded.

""ovoid"" again: O V O I D -> but position is 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? But we need position3 to be I? Not allowed.

So O ? I T ? 

An idea: ""object"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""joist"" -> J O I S T -> but S is excluded? And position: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=S, 5=T -> but S is excluded? So invalid.

""hoist"" -> H,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.

So let's try without S.

Suppose position2 is H? ""oh it?"" -> O H I T ? -> then position5 must be a letter. Words: ""oh itg""? Not.

Or position5: ""oh ite""? But E excluded.

"" O H I T H "" -> repeated H? Not common.

Another very common letter: P. Put O in1, T in4, P in5? Then O ? I T P

Position2: what? ""opity""? Not a word.

O P I T P? No.

Or O with U: ""ou itp""? Not.

Perhaps put O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: ? ? I O T

Then position1 and2 are available letters.

Words: ""biot"" is 4 letters.

""chiot"" not a word.

""kio t""? Not.

 or ""diopt"" -> not a word.

This is tough. Perhaps try T in position2 and O in position4? Then word: ? T I O ?

Then position1 and5.

Words: ""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.

""patio"" -> P A T I O -> A excluded.

""votio"" -> not a word.

""lotio"" -> L excluded.

Also, avoid L and S.

""motif"" -> M O T I F -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=T? But we need position3 to be I? This is M O T I F -> position3 is T, position4 is I? Not required.

We need position3 to be I.

So pattern: X T I O Y

Words: ""studio"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""ratio"" not allowed.

""ptio"" shorter.

Maybe ""utero"" -> U T E R O -> E,R excluded.

""at is"" no.

I think we need to consider that O might be in position5 and T in position4.

Then pattern: _ _ I T O

So we need to fill position1 and2.

Words: ""veto"" is 4 letters.

"" bito "" -> B I T O? Positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=T? Not; we need position3 to be I? But this has position2 as I.

We must have I at position3.

So the word is: [1st] [2nd] I T O

For example, ""binito"" too long.

Or we can use 'w' and 'h': ""whito"" -> not recognized.

But ""withy""? W I T H Y -> position3 is T? Not I.

We must have I at position3.

So for letter2, it cannot be I? Because then position2 would be I, but we have I at 3? We can have different letters.

Let's list actual words that have the pattern _ _ I T O.

In English, is there any? 

""grito"" might be Spanish? Not English.

""brito"" not English.

Perhaps it's not common. So we may need to choose other configurations.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position5? Then O ? I ? T

then he word: O _ ? I _ T

Must be O X I Y T

4-letter in between? No,it's: positions: 1=O, 2=X, 3=I, 4=Y, 5=T

We need valid word: O X I Y T

Words: ""exist"" -> E X I S T -> E and S excluded.

""omits"" -> O M I T S -> S excluded? And is 5 letters, position5=S? But we need T at position5? It's O M I T S -> positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=I, 4=T, 5=S -> but S is excluded, and also T is at position4? Then position5 is S, not T. So if we want T at position5, we need a word like O X I ? T.

Example: ""ovist""? Not really.

Perhaps ""digit"" -> Digit is D I G I T, position3 is G? Not I.

 this is difficult.

Given the difficulty, let's try O in position1 and T in position4: O _ I T _

For position2 and5: available letters.

Now, common words: ""quiet"" is Q U I E T -> positions: Q U I E T -> but E excluded? And also, we are try to have T at position4? In ""quiet"", position4 is E, position5 is T? Not at position4.

""split"": S excluded.

""white"": W H I T E -> positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E -> E is excluded? So not valid.

But if we avoid E, then ' with' -> not.

Another: ""orbit"" is O R B I T -> O R B I T: positions 1=O, 2=R, 3=B? But we need I at position3? This has I at position4? Not.

We need I at position3.

So O ? I T ?

 if position2 is H, position5: Y? ""ohity"" not a word.

or position2 is P, position5: Y? ""opity"" not.

or position2 is M, position5: Y? ""omity"" not.

Wait, what about ""unity""? U N I T Y -> but N is excluded? And positions: U N I T Y -> position3=I, that's good, but N is excluded? And also U is available? But N is out.

Similarly, ""pity"" is 4 letters.

""ditty"" is D I T T Y -> positions: 1=D, 2=I? But I should be at 3? It's at position2.

No.

Let's try to use T in position5 and O in position4? Then word: _ _ I O T

Position1 and2.

For example, ""fiot"" not a word.

""d to"" not.

"" ariot"" too long.

""chariot"" long.

 Perhaps ""bigot"": B I G O T -> but position3 is G? Not I.

But we need pattern: ? ? I O T

So, in ""bigot"", it's B I G O T -> position2 is I, position3 is G.

To have position3 as I, we need a word like X Y I O T.

Does such a word exist? For example, ""radio"" is R A D I O -> position4 is I? Not position3.

"" andio"" not.

"" fagio"" not.

"" Ohio"" is 4 letters with first letter missing.

 Maybe we can try a different approach: don't include both T and O in this guess? For example, include only one of them to narrow down the position.

But that might be lesst efficient.

Or, include O in a different position and T in a different position, and use two new common letters.

For example, put O in position5 and T in position4, with I at3, then position1 and2 be new.

So word: X Y I T O

Now, search for valid words with this pattern and available letters.

Available letters for X and Y: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Words: 
- ""unity"" -> U N I T Y -> N excluded.
- ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> position2 is I? We need position3 to be I, but here position2 is I? And N excluded.
- ""b to"" לא.

""ditto"" -> D I T T O -> positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> position3 is T, not I? And then position4 is T, position5=O. So not.
- ""bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position2 is I? Not position3.

 all have I at position2 or not at 3.

There is a word ""kytin"" but not English.

 Perhaps ""mitis"" or other, but excluded letters.

 wait, ""vitro"" -> V I T R O -> R excluded.

""nitro"" -> N excluded.

"" might"" not pattern.

Maybe ""hippo"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: put O in position1 and T in position2: O T I _ _

Then for positions 4 and 5: we can use two of the available letters.

Common ending: ""ology"" but it's long.

With available letters, for example ""otium"" is not 5 letters.

""Ottis"" with S excluded.

 Perhaps there are not many common English words for this pattern.

Let's consider T in position2 and O in position5: pattern: ? T I ? O

Words: ""atio"" not.

"" a his not.

"" studio"" long.

""ratios"" long and has R,A.

""p it"" not.

"" ""patio"" has A.

with available, "" at is no and A excluded.

 a word like ""ut is no""?

 not.

 this is challenging.

Given the constraints, I recall the feedback from guess2: T was in the word but not at position1, O not at position2, and I at position3.

Also, we haven't used many common letters yet.

We can try to focus on position1 and position2.

Position1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and it could be O? Or another letter.

Similarly, position2: must be a letter that is not T not L not S (since T is in the word but not placed yet, but it can be placed here? Yes).

So for position2, it can be T? Because T can be there.

For position1, it can be O? But then the word would be O ? I ? ? .

We need to build a word that is valid.

Let me think of common words with third letter I.

For example: 
- habit (but A out)
- doing -> D O I N G -> N excluded.
- going -> G O I N G -> N out.
- boing -> B O I N G -> N out.
- choir -> C excluded, O in position2? At position1: C (out), position2: H, position3: O? But we need I at3.
-  deify -> D E I F Y -> E out.
- edify -> E D I F Y -> E out.

Avoiding excluded letters.

Try ""posit"" -> P O S I T -> S excluded? Yes.

""joins"" -> J O I N S -> N and S out.

""joint"" -> N out.

"" moire"" -> M O I R E -> R and E out.

""voila"" -> V O I L A -> L and A out.

""toxic"" -> T O X I C -> C out.

""Bowie"" -> B O W I E -> E out.

"" power"" -> P O W E R -> E and R out.

"" rower"" out.

"" dowie"" with E out.

"" knowe"" E out.

This is difficult.

Another word: ""boink"" -> B O I N K -> N out.

"" doing"" N out.

"" avoid"" -> A V O I D -> A out.

"" typic"" -> T Y P I C -> C out.

We need to use available letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y

Try ""build"" -> B U I L D -> L out? L is excluded, so not.

""guide"" -> E out.

""width"" -> W I D T H -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=D? But we need I at3? position2 is I, position3 is D.

Not.

"" it and"" not.

Let's try a word that has I at3 and does to have O or T? But we risk not including them, but we can test new letters and leave T and O for later.

For the sake of moving forward, let's choose a word that has I at position3 and uses new common letters, avoiding T and O? But then we won't get information on T and O's positions.

Example guess: ""d itry"" not.

""g have"" not.

""puppy"" -> P U P P Y -> position3 is P? Not I.

But pattern: _ _ I _ _

So choose a word like: ""F I H for position2? "" for example:

 - ""beige"" -> B E I G E -> E out.
 - ""hemp"" not.

""H I M P"" -> not, because no word like that.

""chimney"" long.

""lim me"" not.

""wimpy"" -> W I M P Y -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=M -> position3 is M, not I.

As before.

But we can use a word that has I at3: e.g., ""opium"" -> O P I U M -> positions: O in1, P in2, I in3, U in4, M in5. And this word avoids excluded letters: O,P,I,U,M all allowed? Let's check:
- O: allowed (not excluded)
- P: available
- I: already in
- U: available
- M: available

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S. None of these are O,P,U,M.

So ""opium"" is a valid English word? However, ""opium"" is usually considered a valid word. But let's confirm: 5 letters, O-P-I-U-M.

So this is a candidate.

Also, we have O in position1, which we know is possible? O can be in position1? Yes.

But we also know that T is in the word, but we haven't included it in this guess? That's okay, because we might give up on testing T and O for now to test other letters? Feedback will tell us if any new letter is present.

In ""opium"", we have:
- O: if it is in the word, we will get feedback for position1: since O is in the secret word, but it could be in a different position? But if it's in position1, we might get ✓ or not.
- P,U,M are new.

But the secret word has T, so after this guess, we might get feedback that reveals if O is in position1 or not, and also discover whether P,U or M are in the word.

Additionally, if the word is ""opium"", our feedback for position1 O will be:

- If O is in position1, then ✓, else if O is in another position, then '-', else 'x'? But we know O is in the word, so position1 if not correct, then '-'.

Similarly for other letters.

So let's go with ""opium"".

<guess>opium</guess>

Though we haven't used T in this guess, we can still infer from the feedback.

 Alternatively, if we want to include T, we might have to invent a word? But ""opium"" is valid.

So I'll guess ""opium"".The previous feedback indicates:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, and S are excluded.
- Letters T and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
- The letter I is confirmed in position 3.
- The secret word follows the pattern _ _ I _ _.

Given this:
- Position 1 must be a letter from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and can possibly be O.
- Position 2 must avoid O (since O cannot be in position 2) and is open to T or other available letters.
- Positions 4 and 5 must accommodate T, O, or other letters.

After evaluating common English words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _, include I in position 3, avoid excluded letters, and maximize coverage of remaining high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, M, U), ""opium"" is a strong candidate. It tests:
- O in position 1 (O cannot be position 2 but can be position 1).
- P, U, and M as new letters.
- Maintains I in position 3.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess efficiently probes for O's position and new letter inclusions while adhering to constraints.

That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n Let\'s think of common English letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\n A good second guess should cover as many new common letters as possible, avoiding the excluded ones.\n\n Some candidate words: \n - ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) -> but we have to check if any of these are excluded? S, I, G, H, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E] -> valid.\n - ""pound"" (P, O, U, N, D) -> wait, N is excluded! So we cannot use N. So ""pound"" is invalid because of N.\n - ""light"" (L, I, G, H, T) -> L, I, G, H, T are all not excluded? Yes, because excluded are C,R,A,N,E.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has double letters, but since we have no hits, we can avoid repeats.\n\n Another candidate: ""slimy"" (S, L, I, M, Y) -> all letters not excluded.\n\n But let\'s aim for words with more common letters to maximize information.\n\n Another classic: ""audio"" (A, U, D, I, O) -> but A is excluded! So invalid.\n\n We must avoid A, so let\'s try ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) -> P, I, L, O, T: none in excluded? Yes.\n\n However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters.\n\n Let\'s list the excluded letters again: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So for our next guess, we can use any letter except these.\n\n We can consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which are excluded) are: O, I, T, S, L, etc.\n\n So a good word might be: ""sight"" (S, I, G, H, T) or ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T) or ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T) or ""dough"" (D, O, U, G, H).\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\n Another idea: ""moult"" (M, O, U, L, T) -> but that\'s less common.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has a good mix: ""sight"" uses S, I, G, H, T. That\'s 5 new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> but that uses the same letters as ""sight"" but rearranged? Actually, we want to test new letters.\n\n But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can use a word that covers more common letters.\n\n How about ""split""? S, P, L, I, T -> all not excluded? Yes: S, P, L, I, T are not in [C,R,A,N,E].\n\n But wait, we have to check: S is not excluded, P is not, L is not, I is not, T is not. So ""split"" is valid.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has S, P, L, I, T. But that\'s the point: we test them.\n\n Another candidate: ""dumpy"" (D, U, M, P, Y) -> also valid.\n\n But I think ""split"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.\n\n Alternatively, ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) -> also valid.\n\n Let me compare:\n - ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> tests I and G, H which are less common than O and M? \n - ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> tests P and L, which are common.\n\n Actually, according to frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters (excluding E, A, R, which we already know are absent) are: O, I, L, T, S, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, L, T, S, then U, D, P, M, etc.\n\n So ""split"" covers S, P, L, I, T. That\'s good because S, T, L are very common.\n\n But we don\'t have O? We might want to test O. So maybe ""stomp"" (S, T, O, M, P) would be better because it tests O and M.\n\n However, we have to balance: we can test O in a later guess if needed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""pious"" (P, I, O, U, S) -> but U is less common? And we have to avoid E, which we are.\n\n But let\'s decide: we want to maximize the chance of hitting at least one letter.\n\n Since we have no information, we should cover the most common letters that are left.\n\n The most common letters in English words (without E, A, R, N, C) are: O, I, T, S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, etc.\n\n We can use a word that includes O, I, T, S, L? But that\'s 5 letters: we can\'t have all. So we have to choose 5.\n\n A word that has O, I, T, S, and L? That\'s hard. For example, ""toils"" (T, O, I, L, S) -> that\'s 5: T, O, I, L, S. And none of these are excluded? Yes.\n\n So ""toils"" is a good candidate because it tests five of the top remaining letters.\n\n But wait: we already know that the secret word has none of C,R,A,N,E, so we can use ""toils"".\n\n Alternatively, ""tulip"" (T, U, L, I, P) -> but that has U instead of O. O is more common than U.\n\n So I think ""toils"" is a strong second guess.\n\n However, we must ensure that ""toils"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""toils"".\n\n But note: we are building a strategy. We can also consider ""sloth"" (S, L, O, T, H) -> which tests H, but H is less common.\n\n Let\'s stick with ""toils"".\n\n Alternatively, ""pilot"" is also good: P, I, L, O, T. But we already have ""toils"" which uses S instead of P. S is more common than P? In English, S is more frequent than P.\n\n According to letter frequency: \n   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, ... \n Since E, A, R, N are excluded, the top are T, O, I, S, H, etc.\n\n So T, O, I, S are the top 4 available. Then L is next? Actually, L is more common than H.\n\n So ""toils"" has T, O, I, L, S -> that\'s 5 of the top available.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""toils"".\n\n<guess>toils</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all \'x\' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to maximize information. \n\nThe most frequent remaining letters in English (excluding C, R, A, N, E) are T, O, I, S, and L. ""Toils"" uses all five of these high-frequency letters, is a valid English word, and efficiently probes for new information. This choice helps narrow down possibilities quickly by covering 31% of the alphabet\'s frequency weight in one guess.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n1. From ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word -> excluded: C,R,A,N,E\n2. From ""toils"": \n   T: \'-\' -> T is in the word but in the wrong position\n   O: \'-\' -> O is in the word but in the wrong position\n   I: \'✓\' -> I is in the word and in the correct position (at the 3rd spot, because toils: position 1=T, 2=O, 3=I, 4=L, 5=S). So I is the third letter.\n   L: \'x\' -> L is not in the word\n   S: \'x\' -> S is not in the word\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The word has the letter I in the third position. So the word is ? ? I ? ?\n- The word contains T and O, but not in the first or second positions (since in ""toils"", T was in first and O in second, but they were marked as present but wrong position). However, note that T could be in position 2,4,5? Actually no, because the feedback says they are in the word but not in the right spot. Since position 1 was wrong for T and position 2 for O, they can be in any other position except 1 and 2 respectively? But wait: T was guessed in position 1 and it\'s not there, so T must be in position 2,4, or 5? Similarly, O was in position 2 and it\'s not there, so O must be in position 1,4, or 5? Also note: we know the third position is I.\n\nAdditionally, we have new exclusions: L and S are not in the word. So now excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.\n\nAlso, note: we know T and O are in the word, and we also know they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively? But that doesn\'t restrict their positions absolutely? Actually, for T: since we guessed it in position 1 and it was wrong, T cannot be in position 1. Similarly, O was guessed in position 2 and it was wrong, so O cannot be in position 2.\n\nMoreover, because I is fixed in position 3, we have the pattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nNow, T and O must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5? But note: T can\'t be in position 1 (already known), but position 2 is open? Similarly, O can\'t be in position 2, but position 1 is open? Actually, let me list the positions: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to place T and O? Also, there is one more letter we don\'t know? The word has 5 letters. We know three letters: T, O, I. And I is in position 3. So we have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of them being T and O, and two other letters that we don\'t know yet? Actually, no: the word must contain T and O and I. But the word has five letters. So there are two more letters we haven\'t discovered.\n\nWe know the secret word has at least T, O, I. And we know two letters that are not in: L and S (from guess2). Also from guess1, we know C,R,A,N,E are out.\n\nSo available letters (not excluded) are: \nB, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we also have T, O, I already present.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we must include I in the third position. Also, we must include T and O because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include them in the guess? But if we don\'t, we won\'t get information about their positions. Moreover, our goal is to find the positions for T and O and also discover the other two letters.\n\nGiven constraints:\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- T cannot be in position 1 (because we guessed it there and it was wrong). Also, T cannot be in position 3 because that\'s I. So T must be in position 2,4, or 5.\n- O cannot be in position 2 (we guessed it there and wrong), and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 1,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to find.\n\nFor the next guess, we should try to place T and O in positions that are possible and try different new letters for the others.\n\nWe also want to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.\n\nLet\'s try to come up with a word that fits: \nPattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nWe need to choose letters for position 1,2,4,5.\n\nConditions:\n- Position1: can be O? Because O can be there. Cannot be T (since T can\'t be in pos1). Also, it must not be excluded.\n- Position2: can be T? Because T can be there. Cannot be O (since O can\'t be in pos2). Also, avoid excluded.\n- Position4: can be T or O? Or other letter.\n- Position5: can be T or O? Or other.\n\nAdditionally, we must include T and O in the word? Not necessarily in this guess? But we can include them to test.\n\nBut note: if we don\'t include T and O, we won\'t get feedback on their positions. So ideally we include them.\n\nSo we should construct a word that has:\n- I in position 3\n- T somewhere in positions 2,4,5\n- O somewhere in positions 1,4,5\n- And two new letters from the available set.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using excluded letters.\n\nAlso, we want to test common letters to maximize information.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon letters among these: H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.\n\nWe can try a word with O in position 1 and T in position 4, for example? Then fill position 2 and 5 with new letters.\n\nExample: O _ I T _\nBut what letters for position 2 and 5? Must be from available.\n\nLet\'s form words. Words like... \n- Omit? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5-letter word.\n- ""Obit"": but that contains B and T? O B I T ... but T is already in position 4? Wait, we can have ""obits"" but S is excluded? Not allowed.\n\nWe need 5-letter word: pattern O_ I T_? But the last position is the fifth.\n\nLooking for words: O in 1st, I in 3rd, T in 4th.\n\nWords: ""point"" -> but P,O,I,N,T? But N is excluded from guess1 (N not in word). Also, S in ""obits"" excluded.\n\nAnother: ""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T. But S is excluded? So we can\'t use S.\n\nWe need available letters.\n\nAnother: ""doubt"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but U and B are available? And we have I in third? No: D O U B T -> positions: 1=D, 2=O, 3=U? But wait, I must be in third. This doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have I at position 3. So the word must be: _ _ I _ _\n\nSo for O in first: then we have O _ I _ _\n\nNow, if we put T in fourth: O _ I T _\n\nWe need to choose the second and fifth letters from available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe can try ""O with M then T and H"": O M I T H -> ""omith""? Not a word.\n\n""O with P then T and H"": O P I T H -> ""opith""? Not a word.\n\n""O with G then T and H"": O G I T H -> ""ogith""? No.\n\nAlternatively, put T in fifth: O _ I _ T\n\nSo word: O _ I ? T\n\nThen for position 2 and 4: available letters.\n\nWords: ""odium"" -> O D I U M -> but U and M are available? But then we are not using T? And we must include T? But the word does not have T? We know T is in the secret word, but we are trying to find its position. If we don\'t include T in this guess, we don\'t test it. So better to include T.\n\nSince T must be in one of positions 2,4,5, and O in 1,4,5 ... we can try putting O in position 1 and T in position 5? Then the word: O ? I ? T\n\nThen we need two letters for position 2 and 4.\n\nWords: ""ovoid"" -> O V O I D? No, because position 3 should be I? Actually: 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? Conflict? We need position 3 to be I. So ""ovigt""? Not a word.\n\n""oohed""? Not with I.\n\nHow about: ""O B I T something"" ... but fifth position? We have to use T in fifth? So O B I ? T -> e.g., ""obbit""? Not a word. Or ""orbit"" -> but R is excluded? Also R not allowed.\n\nAnother idea: put O in position 4 and T in position 2? Then word: ? T I O ?\n\nBut position1: we can choose any available letter? And position5 too.\n\nAlso, O in position 4 is possible? Yes, because O can be anywhere except position2.\n\nSimilarly, T in position2: allowed.\n\nSo word: [letter] T I O [letter]\n\nNow, we choose letter1 and letter5 from available.\n\nWords: "" U T I O N "" -> but N is excluded? So no.\n\n"" P T I O N "" -> N excluded. \n\n"" F T I O W "" -> not a word.\n\n"" M T I O P "" -> not a word.\n\nCommon pattern: words ending with \'tion\' but N is out. We can look for other words.\n\nAnother possibility: O in position 5 and T in position 4? Then word: ? ? I T O\n\nBut position1 and2 we need letters.\n\nOr T in position4 and O in position5: then word: _ _ I T O\n\nWe need to fill first two positions.\n\nWords: ""bitch"" is not appropriate? But let\'s think politely. Also, H is available.\n\nHow about: ""filter"" -> but has R and E? Excluded.\n\nWith available letters: e.g., ""gitto""? Not a word.\n\n""ditty"" -> but has double T? And Y. But position: 1=D, 2=I? But I is fixed at position3? Conflict.\n\nPattern: we need [letter1] [letter2] I T O\n\nPossible words: \n- ""light"" -> but L and G? L is excluded? Yes, from guess2 L is x, so L is excluded. So no.\n\n- ""might"": M,G,H,T -> M I G H T? Positions: 1=M, 2=I? But I is at 3? This would be M I G H T -> but then the third letter is G, not I? But we require I at third. So it must be: [1st] [2nd] I T O.\n\nSo [2nd] cannot be I? We already have I at 3.\n\nTherefore, we can have: for example, ""bito""? but 4 letters? We need 5: X Y I T O.\n\nDoes ""bitto"" exist? Not really. Or  ""kitto"" -> not a word.\n\nKnown words: ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> but then N is excluded? And also positions: 1=P, 2=I, but our I is at position3? So here I is at position2, while we need it at position3? And also N is excluded.\n\nWait, we must have I at position3.\n\nSo ""pinto"" would be: P I N T O -> position3 is N, which is excluded? And we need I at position3, so no.\n\nAlternatively, we can try O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: _ _ I O T\n\nWords: ""triot"" -> T R I O T? R excluded, and T in first? But T cannot be in position1.\n\nAlso, positions: [1]=T (not allowed for T? because T can\'t be in1). And R excluded.\n\nExample: ""quiet"" -> Q U I E T -> but E is excluded? So no.\n\n""fruit"" -> F R U I T -> R excluded.\n\n""habit"" -> H A B I T -> A excluded.\n\nWe need to use available letters.\n\nHow about ""bovid""? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nPerhaps we should not fix O and T in specific positions? Instead, we can try a word that tests other positions and includes new letters.\n\nAnother approach: place O in position1 and T in position2? But T in position2 is allowed? And O in position1 is allowed? However: condition for T: it can be in position2? Yes. And O can be in position1? Yes. Then we would have O T I _ _\n\nNow, we need to choose two more letters for positions 4 and 5? And the word must be valid.\n\nAlso, note that we must avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,L,S.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, words: ""otium""? Not a common word? But we might use it? It\'s Latin? Not English.\n\n""otter"" -> O T T E R -> has E and R? Excluded.\n\n""other"" -> O T H E R -> E and R excluded.\n\n""ought"" -> O U G H T -> positions: O in1, U in2? But here T is in5? Why U in2? Then pattern: O U G H T -> position3 is G? But we need I at position3? Oh no: in this word, position3 is G, but our guess must have I in position3? So we cannot use that.\n\nRemember: in every guess, we must have I in position3? Because we know it\'s fixed? Actually, no: we can guess words without I? But if we don\'t, then we don\'t get I feedback? But we know I is in the word at position3. However, we can try a word without I to test other letters? But that would be inefficient. Because we know I is the third letter and is correct, we should always include I in the third position for faster deduction.\n\nSo our guess must be: ? ? I ? ?\n\nNow, back to O in1 and T in2: O T I ? ?\n\nFill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.\n\nWords: ""otify"" -> O T I F Y -> ""otify""? Not a valid word? Or is it? Otify might not be common.\n\n""otiose"" is 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""oting""? Not a word.\n\n""otide""? Not recognized.\n\nSo maybe it\'s better to place T in position4 and O in position1? Then O ? I T ?\n\nAnd for position2: must be an available letter, and position5: available.\n\nWords: ""omit"" is 4 letters. 5-letter: ""omits"" but S excluded.\n\n""ovoid"" again: O V O I D -> but position is 1=O, 2=V, 3=O? But we need position3 to be I? Not allowed.\n\nSo O ? I T ? \n\nAn idea: ""object"" -> 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""joist"" -> J O I S T -> but S is excluded? And position: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=S, 5=T -> but S is excluded? So invalid.\n\n""hoist"" -> H,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.\n\n""moist"" -> M,O,I,S,T -> S excluded.\n\nSo let\'s try without S.\n\nSuppose position2 is H? ""oh it?"" -> O H I T ? -> then position5 must be a letter. Words: ""oh itg""? Not.\n\nOr position5: ""oh ite""? But E excluded.\n\n"" O H I T H "" -> repeated H? Not common.\n\nAnother very common letter: P. Put O in1, T in4, P in5? Then O ? I T P\n\nPosition2: what? ""opity""? Not a word.\n\nO P I T P? No.\n\nOr O with U: ""ou itp""? Not.\n\nPerhaps put O in position4 and T in position5? Then word: ? ? I O T\n\nThen position1 and2 are available letters.\n\nWords: ""biot"" is 4 letters.\n\n""chiot"" not a word.\n\n""kio t""? Not.\n\n or ""diopt"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is tough. Perhaps try T in position2 and O in position4? Then word: ? T I O ?\n\nThen position1 and5.\n\nWords: ""ratio"" -> R A T I O -> R and A excluded.\n\n""patio"" -> P A T I O -> A excluded.\n\n""votio"" -> not a word.\n\n""lotio"" -> L excluded.\n\nAlso, avoid L and S.\n\n""motif"" -> M O T I F -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=T? But we need position3 to be I? This is M O T I F -> position3 is T, position4 is I? Not required.\n\nWe need position3 to be I.\n\nSo pattern: X T I O Y\n\nWords: ""studio"" is 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""ratio"" not allowed.\n\n""ptio"" shorter.\n\nMaybe ""utero"" -> U T E R O -> E,R excluded.\n\n""at is"" no.\n\nI think we need to consider that O might be in position5 and T in position4.\n\nThen pattern: _ _ I T O\n\nSo we need to fill position1 and2.\n\nWords: ""veto"" is 4 letters.\n\n"" bito "" -> B I T O? Positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=T? Not; we need position3 to be I? But this has position2 as I.\n\nWe must have I at position3.\n\nSo the word is: [1st] [2nd] I T O\n\nFor example, ""binito"" too long.\n\nOr we can use \'w\' and \'h\': ""whito"" -> not recognized.\n\nBut ""withy""? W I T H Y -> position3 is T? Not I.\n\nWe must have I at position3.\n\nSo for letter2, it cannot be I? Because then position2 would be I, but we have I at 3? We can have different letters.\n\nLet\'s list actual words that have the pattern _ _ I T O.\n\nIn English, is there any? \n\n""grito"" might be Spanish? Not English.\n\n""brito"" not English.\n\nPerhaps it\'s not common. So we may need to choose other configurations.\n\nAnother idea: put O in position1 and T in position5? Then O ? I ? T\n\nthen he word: O _ ? I _ T\n\nMust be O X I Y T\n\n4-letter in between? No,it\'s: positions: 1=O, 2=X, 3=I, 4=Y, 5=T\n\nWe need valid word: O X I Y T\n\nWords: ""exist"" -> E X I S T -> E and S excluded.\n\n""omits"" -> O M I T S -> S excluded? And is 5 letters, position5=S? But we need T at position5? It\'s O M I T S -> positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=I, 4=T, 5=S -> but S is excluded, and also T is at position4? Then position5 is S, not T. So if we want T at position5, we need a word like O X I ? T.\n\nExample: ""ovist""? Not really.\n\nPerhaps ""digit"" -> Digit is D I G I T, position3 is G? Not I.\n\n this is difficult.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s try O in position1 and T in position4: O _ I T _\n\nFor position2 and5: available letters.\n\nNow, common words: ""quiet"" is Q U I E T -> positions: Q U I E T -> but E excluded? And also, we are try to have T at position4? In ""quiet"", position4 is E, position5 is T? Not at position4.\n\n""split"": S excluded.\n\n""white"": W H I T E -> positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E -> E is excluded? So not valid.\n\nBut if we avoid E, then \' with\' -> not.\n\nAnother: ""orbit"" is O R B I T -> O R B I T: positions 1=O, 2=R, 3=B? But we need I at position3? This has I at position4? Not.\n\nWe need I at position3.\n\nSo O ? I T ?\n\n if position2 is H, position5: Y? ""ohity"" not a word.\n\nor position2 is P, position5: Y? ""opity"" not.\n\nor position2 is M, position5: Y? ""omity"" not.\n\nWait, what about ""unity""? U N I T Y -> but N is excluded? And positions: U N I T Y -> position3=I, that\'s good, but N is excluded? And also U is available? But N is out.\n\nSimilarly, ""pity"" is 4 letters.\n\n""ditty"" is D I T T Y -> positions: 1=D, 2=I? But I should be at 3? It\'s at position2.\n\nNo.\n\nLet\'s try to use T in position5 and O in position4? Then word: _ _ I O T\n\nPosition1 and2.\n\nFor example, ""fiot"" not a word.\n\n""d to"" not.\n\n"" ariot"" too long.\n\n""chariot"" long.\n\n Perhaps ""bigot"": B I G O T -> but position3 is G? Not I.\n\nBut we need pattern: ? ? I O T\n\nSo, in ""bigot"", it\'s B I G O T -> position2 is I, position3 is G.\n\nTo have position3 as I, we need a word like X Y I O T.\n\nDoes such a word exist? For example, ""radio"" is R A D I O -> position4 is I? Not position3.\n\n"" andio"" not.\n\n"" fagio"" not.\n\n"" Ohio"" is 4 letters with first letter missing.\n\n Maybe we can try a different approach: don\'t include both T and O in this guess? For example, include only one of them to narrow down the position.\n\nBut that might be lesst efficient.\n\nOr, include O in a different position and T in a different position, and use two new common letters.\n\nFor example, put O in position5 and T in position4, with I at3, then position1 and2 be new.\n\nSo word: X Y I T O\n\nNow, search for valid words with this pattern and available letters.\n\nAvailable letters for X and Y: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWords: \n- ""unity"" -> U N I T Y -> N excluded.\n- ""pinto"" -> P I N T O -> position2 is I? We need position3 to be I, but here position2 is I? And N excluded.\n- ""b to"" לא.\n\n""ditto"" -> D I T T O -> positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=T -> position3 is T, not I? And then position4 is T, position5=O. So not.\n- ""bitty"" -> B I T T Y -> position2 is I? Not position3.\n\n all have I at position2 or not at 3.\n\nThere is a word ""kytin"" but not English.\n\n Perhaps ""mitis"" or other, but excluded letters.\n\n wait, ""vitro"" -> V I T R O -> R excluded.\n\n""nitro"" -> N excluded.\n\n"" might"" not pattern.\n\nMaybe ""hippo"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother idea: put O in position1 and T in position2: O T I _ _\n\nThen for positions 4 and 5: we can use two of the available letters.\n\nCommon ending: ""ology"" but it\'s long.\n\nWith available letters, for example ""otium"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""Ottis"" with S excluded.\n\n Perhaps there are not many common English words for this pattern.\n\nLet\'s consider T in position2 and O in position5: pattern: ? T I ? O\n\nWords: ""atio"" not.\n\n"" a his not.\n\n"" studio"" long.\n\n""ratios"" long and has R,A.\n\n""p it"" not.\n\n"" ""patio"" has A.\n\nwith available, "" at is no and A excluded.\n\n a word like ""ut is no""?\n\n not.\n\n this is challenging.\n\nGiven the constraints, I recall the feedback from guess2: T was in the word but not at position1, O not at position2, and I at position3.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t used many common letters yet.\n\nWe can try to focus on position1 and position2.\n\nPosition1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and it could be O? Or another letter.\n\nSimilarly, position2: must be a letter that is not T not L not S (since T is in the word but not placed yet, but it can be placed here? Yes).\n\nSo for position2, it can be T? Because T can be there.\n\nFor position1, it can be O? But then the word would be O ? I ? ? .\n\nWe need to build a word that is valid.\n\nLet me think of common words with third letter I.\n\nFor example: \n- habit (but A out)\n- doing -> D O I N G -> N excluded.\n- going -> G O I N G -> N out.\n- boing -> B O I N G -> N out.\n- choir -> C excluded, O in position2? At position1: C (out), position2: H, position3: O? But we need I at3.\n-  deify -> D E I F Y -> E out.\n- edify -> E D I F Y -> E out.\n\nAvoiding excluded letters.\n\nTry ""posit"" -> P O S I T -> S excluded? Yes.\n\n""joins"" -> J O I N S -> N and S out.\n\n""joint"" -> N out.\n\n"" moire"" -> M O I R E -> R and E out.\n\n""voila"" -> V O I L A -> L and A out.\n\n""toxic"" -> T O X I C -> C out.\n\n""Bowie"" -> B O W I E -> E out.\n\n"" power"" -> P O W E R -> E and R out.\n\n"" rower"" out.\n\n"" dowie"" with E out.\n\n"" knowe"" E out.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""boink"" -> B O I N K -> N out.\n\n"" doing"" N out.\n\n"" avoid"" -> A V O I D -> A out.\n\n"" typic"" -> T Y P I C -> C out.\n\nWe need to use available letters.\n\nCommon letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y\n\nTry ""build"" -> B U I L D -> L out? L is excluded, so not.\n\n""guide"" -> E out.\n\n""width"" -> W I D T H -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=D? But we need I at3? position2 is I, position3 is D.\n\nNot.\n\n"" it and"" not.\n\nLet\'s try a word that has I at3 and does to have O or T? But we risk not including them, but we can test new letters and leave T and O for later.\n\nFor the sake of moving forward, let\'s choose a word that has I at position3 and uses new common letters, avoiding T and O? But then we won\'t get information on T and O\'s positions.\n\nExample guess: ""d itry"" not.\n\n""g have"" not.\n\n""puppy"" -> P U P P Y -> position3 is P? Not I.\n\nBut pattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nSo choose a word like: ""F I H for position2? "" for example:\n\n - ""beige"" -> B E I G E -> E out.\n - ""hemp"" not.\n\n""H I M P"" -> not, because no word like that.\n\n""chimney"" long.\n\n""lim me"" not.\n\n""wimpy"" -> W I M P Y -> positions: 1=W, 2=I, 3=M -> position3 is M, not I.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut we can use a word that has I at3: e.g., ""opium"" -> O P I U M -> positions: O in1, P in2, I in3, U in4, M in5. And this word avoids excluded letters: O,P,I,U,M all allowed? Let\'s check:\n- O: allowed (not excluded)\n- P: available\n- I: already in\n- U: available\n- M: available\n\nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,L,S. None of these are O,P,U,M.\n\nSo ""opium"" is a valid English word? However, ""opium"" is usually considered a valid word. But let\'s confirm: 5 letters, O-P-I-U-M.\n\nSo this is a candidate.\n\nAlso, we have O in position1, which we know is possible? O can be in position1? Yes.\n\nBut we also know that T is in the word, but we haven\'t included it in this guess? That\'s okay, because we might give up on testing T and O for now to test other letters? Feedback will tell us if any new letter is present.\n\nIn ""opium"", we have:\n- O: if it is in the word, we will get feedback for position1: since O is in the secret word, but it could be in a different position? But if it\'s in position1, we might get ✓ or not.\n- P,U,M are new.\n\nBut the secret word has T, so after this guess, we might get feedback that reveals if O is in position1 or not, and also discover whether P,U or M are in the word.\n\nAdditionally, if the word is ""opium"", our feedback for position1 O will be:\n\n- If O is in position1, then ✓, else if O is in another position, then \'-\', else \'x\'? But we know O is in the word, so position1 if not correct, then \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""opium"".\n\n<guess>opium</guess>\n\nThough we haven\'t used T in this guess, we can still infer from the feedback.\n\n Alternatively, if we want to include T, we might have to invent a word? But ""opium"" is valid.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""opium"".The previous feedback indicates:\n- Letters C, R, A, N, E, L, and S are excluded.\n- Letters T and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, respectively.\n- The letter I is confirmed in position 3.\n- The secret word follows the pattern _ _ I _ _.\n\nGiven this:\n- Position 1 must be a letter from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and can possibly be O.\n- Position 2 must avoid O (since O cannot be in position 2) and is open to T or other available letters.\n- Positions 4 and 5 must accommodate T, O, or other letters.\n\nAfter evaluating common English words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _, include I in position 3, avoid excluded letters, and maximize coverage of remaining high-frequency letters (e.g., O, P, M, U), ""opium"" is a strong candidate. It tests:\n- O in position 1 (O cannot be position 2 but can be position 1).\n- P, U, and M as new letters.\n- Maintains I in position 3.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes for O\'s position and new letter inclusions while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>opium</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(x) I(✓) U(x) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(x) I(✓) U(x) M(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   This means that the letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all. So we can exclude these letters.

2. **Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)**  
   - T is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked as '-', meaning wrong position).
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed in position 2, marked as '-').
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since it was guessed in position 3 and marked as '✓').
   - L and S are not in the word (marked as 'x'), so we can exclude L and S.

   Therefore, the secret word has I in the third position: _ _ I _ _

   Also, T and O are in the word, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

3. **Guess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(x) I(✓) U(x) M(x)**  
   - O is in the word but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1, marked as '-').
   - P is not in the word (x), so exclude P.
   - I is in the correct position (position 3, ✓) — this we already know.
   - U and M are not in the word (x), so exclude U and M.

Now, combining all exclusions:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, S, P, U, M

The only letters we know are in the word are T, O, and I (with I fixed at position 3). The secret word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we haven't discovered yet.

Available letters (not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T and O which are in the word.

Constraints on positions:

- Position 3 is fixed as I.
- T cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2) and cannot be in position 3 (since that's I). So T must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3) and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 4 or 5.

Since O must be in position 4 or 5, and T must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but note that positions 4 and 5 can only hold one letter each. So we have to consider the possibilities:

- If O is in position 4, then T can be in position 2 or 5 (but not 4 because O is there).
- If O is in position 5, then T can be in position 2 or 4.

Also, we have two more letters to fill the remaining positions. These must be from the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to make a new guess that fits the pattern _ _ I _ _ and includes T and O (since they are in the word) and two new letters from the available set.

We should also avoid using any excluded letters.

Let's consider the possibilities for O: it must be in position 4 or 5.

Case 1: O in position 4.
Then the word is: _ _ I O _
Now, T must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is not allowed for T, and position 3 is I, position 4 is O).

Subcase 1.1: T in position 2.
Then the word is: _ T I O _
We need a letter for position 1 and position 5. Both must be from available letters (and not T or O, which are already used).

Subcase 1.2: T in position 5.
Then the word is: _ _ I O T
We need letters for position 1 and 2.

Case 2: O in position 5.
Then the word is: _ _ I _ O
T must be in position 2 or 4.

Subcase 2.1: T in position 2.
Then the word is: _ T I _ O
Need letters for position 1 and 4.

Subcase 2.2: T in position 4.
Then the word is: _ _ I T O
Need letters for position 1 and 2.

We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

Let's try to find words for each case:

Case 1.1: Pattern _ T I O _
- Position 1: must be a letter from available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 5: similarly.

Possible words:
- ""STIO?"" but S is excluded.
- ""BTIO?"" - not a word.
- ""DTIO?"" - not.
- ""FTIO?"" - not.
- ""GTIO?"" - not.
- ""HTIO?"" - not.
- ""KTIO?"" - not.
- ""QTIO?"" - not.
- ""VTIO?"" - not.
- ""WTIO?"" - not.
- ""XTIO?"" - not.
- ""YTIO?"" - not.
- ""ZTIO?"" - not.

No common words seem to fit.

Case 1.2: Pattern _ _ I O T
- Position 1 and 2: available letters.

Words:
- ""B I O T"" is 4 letters.
- ""DIOT"" is 4 letters? But we need 5: _ _ I O T, so two letters before.
- ""A diot"" not.
- ""EDIOT"" has E excluded.
- ""IDIOT"" -> I D I O T: positions 1=I, 2=D, 3=I, 4=O, 5=T. But we need position 3 to be I, which it is, but position 1 is I? But we have I only at position 3? And also, we have two I's? But the secret word might have two I's? However, in our feedback, we don't have information about duplicate letters. But in guess2, we had only one I and it was correct. But the secret word might have another I? But in this case, ""IDIOT"" has I at position 1 and 3. But we don't know if the secret word has two I's. Also, D is available. But let's check: 
  - Position 1: I? But we don't know if I is in other positions? However, in guess2, we had ""toils"" with I at position 3 correct, but we didn't test I elsewhere. Similarly, in guess3, ""opium"" had I at position 3 correct. So it's possible that the word has another I? But we haven't been told that I is duplicated. So we can try.

But ""idiot"" uses I at position 1 and 3. However, we have excluded letters: let's check if it uses any excluded: I, D, I, O, T. Excluded letters are C,R,A,N,E,L,S,P,U,M. None of these are in ""idiot"". So it is a candidate.

But note: in ""idiot"", position 1 is I. But we don't know if I is allowed at position 1? The feedback only told us that I is at position 3, but it doesn't prevent I from being elsewhere. However, we have no evidence against it.

But we also have T at position 5 and O at position 4.

So ""idiot"" is a possible guess.

Case 2.1: Pattern _ T I _ O
- Position 1 and 4: available letters.

Words:
- "" T I O O"" not.
- ""ATICO"" has A excluded.
- "" T I B O"" -> e.g., ""stibo"" S excluded.
- "" T I D O"" -> ""stido"" S out.
- "" T I G O"" -> ""stigo"" S out.
- Without S: ""btigo"" not a word.
- "" T I K O"" -> ""ptiko"" P excluded? Or ""ktiko"" not.
- "" T I V O"" -> ""ctivo"" C out.
- "" T I Z O"" -> not.

No common words.

Case 2.2: Pattern _ _ I T O
- Position 1 and 2: available letters.

Words:
- "" I T T O"" -> ""mit to"" not.
- ""BITTO"" not a word.
- ""DITTO"" -> D I T T O: positions 1=D, 2=I, 3=T, 4=T, 5=O. But we need position 3 to be I? Here position 3 is T, not I. So not.
- ""FITTO"" not.
- ""GITTO"" -> as in ""giotto""? But it's G I O T T O, 6 letters? Or ""gitto"" not a word.
- ""HITTO"" not.
- ""KITTO"" not.
- ""VITTO"" not.
- ""WITTO"" not.

No common words.

Therefore, the only plausible word we found is ""idiot"" for case 1.2.

In ""idiot"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: D
- Position 3: I (which is fixed and correct)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: T

But note: we have I at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? The feedback has not indicated that I is duplicated, but it's possible.

Also, we know T is in the word, and here it's at position 5. O is at position 4.

Now, let's check against constraints:
- T: in the word, and in position 5. We know T cannot be in position 1, but position 5 is allowed.
- O: in the word, and in position 4. We know O cannot be in position 1 or 2, and position 4 is allowed.

Also, the letters used: I, D, I, O, T. Excluded letters are not used.

So ""idiot"" is a valid guess.

Alternatively, are there other words?

What about ""dhoti""? But ""dhoti"" is D H O T I, which would be positions: 1=D, 2=H, 3=O? But we need position 3 to be I. So not.

Or ""posit"" but S and P excluded.

So ""idiot"" seems to be the best candidate.

We can guess ""idiot"".

But note: in ""idiot"", we are using I at position 1. We don't know if the secret word has two I's. But if it doesn't, then the feedback will show that the first I is not in the word (x) or if it is in the word but wrong position (-). But since we know I is at position 3, if there is only one I, then position 1 I would be marked as 'x' because it's not in the word (if no duplicate). But if it is marked as '-', then it means there is another I.

But we are trying to solve the word, so it's okay.

Given the above, we'll guess ""idiot"".

<guess>idiot</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Excluded Letters**: From previous feedback, the following letters are not in the secret word:
   - Guess 1 (crane): C, R, A, N, E (all marked ""x"").
   - Guess 2 (toils): L, S (marked ""x"").
   - Guess 3 (opium): P, U, M (marked ""x"").
   - **Total excluded**: C, R, A, N, E, L, S, P, U, M.  
   **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - I is in position 3 (✓ from both Guess 2 and Guess 3).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1 (marked ""-"" in Guess 2).
   - O is in the word but not in position 1 (marked ""-"" in Guess 3) or position 2 (marked ""-"" in Guess 2).  
   **Pattern so far**: `_ _ I _ _`.

3. **Constraints for T and O**:
   - T must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).
   - O must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 3).
   - Since O must occupy position 4 or 5, and T must be in 2, 4, or 5, the possible configurations are:
     - O in position 4 → T in position 2 or 5.
     - O in position 5 → T in position 2 or 4.

4. **New Guess Requirements**:
   - Must include I in position 3.
   - Must include T and O (since they are in the word).
   - Use two additional letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - Avoid all excluded letters.

5. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - After testing patterns (e.g., `_ T I O _`, `_ _ I O T`, `_ T I _ O`, `_ _ I T O`), the only valid English word that fits the constraints and available letters is **""idiot""**:
     - Position 1: I (not excluded, and possible if duplicated).
     - Position 2: D (available letter).
     - Position 3: I (✓ confirmed).
     - Position 4: O (fits position constraint).
     - Position 5: T (fits position constraint).
   - This adheres to all feedback:
     - T is in position 5 (allowed, since T cannot be in 1).
     - O is in position 4 (allowed, since O cannot be in 1 or 2).
     - Uses D (available) and tests for I duplication.

6. **Why ""idiot""?**  
   It efficiently tests:
   - If I is duplicated (position 1 feedback will clarify).
   - Positions of T and O.
   - Introduces a new common letter (D).

<guess>idiot</guess>",idiot,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   This means that the letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all. So we can exclude these letters.

2. **Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(x)**  
   - T is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked as '-', meaning wrong position).
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (guessed in position 2, marked as '-').
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since it was guessed in position 3 and marked as '✓').
   - L and S are not in the word (marked as 'x'), so we can exclude L and S.

   Therefore, the secret word has I in the third position: _ _ I _ _

   Also, T and O are in the word, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

3. **Guess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(x) I(✓) U(x) M(x)**  
   - O is in the word but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1, marked as '-').
   - P is not in the word (x), so exclude P.
   - I is in the correct position (position 3, ✓) — this we already know.
   - U and M are not in the word (x), so exclude U and M.

Now, combining all exclusions:

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, S, P, U, M

The only letters we know are in the word are T, O, and I (with I fixed at position 3). The secret word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we haven't discovered yet.

Available letters (not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T and O which are in the word.

Constraints on positions:

- Position 3 is fixed as I.
- T cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2) and cannot be in position 3 (since that's I). So T must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3) and cannot be in position 3 (I). So O must be in position 4 or 5.

Since O must be in position 4 or 5, and T must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but note that positions 4 and 5 can only hold one letter each. So we have to consider the possibilities:

- If O is in position 4, then T can be in position 2 or 5 (but not 4 because O is there).
- If O is in position 5, then T can be in position 2 or 4.

Also, we have two more letters to fill the remaining positions. These must be from the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to make a new guess that fits the pattern _ _ I _ _ and includes T and O (since they are in the word) and two new letters from the available set.

We should also avoid using any excluded letters.

Let's consider the possibilities for O: it must be in position 4 or 5.

Case 1: O in position 4.
Then the word is: _ _ I O _
Now, T must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is not allowed for T, and position 3 is I, position 4 is O).

Subcase 1.1: T in position 2.
Then the word is: _ T I O _
We need a letter for position 1 and position 5. Both must be from available letters (and not T or O, which are already used).

Subcase 1.2: T in position 5.
Then the word is: _ _ I O T
We need letters for position 1 and 2.

Case 2: O in position 5.
Then the word is: _ _ I _ O
T must be in position 2 or 4.

Subcase 2.1: T in position 2.
Then the word is: _ T I _ O
Need letters for position 1 and 4.

Subcase 2.2: T in position 4.
Then the word is: _ _ I T O
Need letters for position 1 and 2.

We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

Let's try to find words for each case:

Case 1.1: Pattern _ T I O _
- Position 1: must be a letter from available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 5: similarly.

Possible words:
- ""STIO?"" but S is excluded.
- ""BTIO?"" - not a word.
- ""DTIO?"" - not.
- ""FTIO?"" - not.
- ""GTIO?"" - not.
- ""HTIO?"" - not.
- ""KTIO?"" - not.
- ""QTIO?"" - not.
- ""VTIO?"" - not.
- ""WTIO?"" - not.
- ""XTIO?"" - not.
- ""YTIO?"" - not.
- ""ZTIO?"" - not.

No common words seem to fit.

Case 1.2: Pattern _ _ I O T
- Position 1 and 2: available letters.

Words:
- ""B I O T"" is 4 letters.
- ""DIOT"" is 4 letters? But we need 5: _ _ I O T, so two letters before.
- ""A diot"" not.
- ""EDIOT"" has E excluded.
- ""IDIOT"" -> I D I O T: positions 1=I, 2=D, 3=I, 4=O, 5=T. But we need position 3 to be I, which it is, but position 1 is I? But we have I only at position 3? And also, we have two I's? But the secret word might have two I's? However, in our feedback, we don't have information about duplicate letters. But in guess2, we had only one I and it was correct. But the secret word might have another I? But in this case, ""IDIOT"" has I at position 1 and 3. But we don't know if the secret word has two I's. Also, D is available. But let's check: 
  - Position 1: I? But we don't know if I is in other positions? However, in guess2, we had ""toils"" with I at position 3 correct, but we didn't test I elsewhere. Similarly, in guess3, ""opium"" had I at position 3 correct. So it's possible that the word has another I? But we haven't been told that I is duplicated. So we can try.

But ""idiot"" uses I at position 1 and 3. However, we have excluded letters: let's check if it uses any excluded: I, D, I, O, T. Excluded letters are C,R,A,N,E,L,S,P,U,M. None of these are in ""idiot"". So it is a candidate.

But note: in ""idiot"", position 1 is I. But we don't know if I is allowed at position 1? The feedback only told us that I is at position 3, but it doesn't prevent I from being elsewhere. However, we have no evidence against it.

But we also have T at position 5 and O at position 4.

So ""idiot"" is a possible guess.

Case 2.1: Pattern _ T I _ O
- Position 1 and 4: available letters.

Words:
- "" T I O O"" not.
- ""ATICO"" has A excluded.
- "" T I B O"" -> e.g., ""stibo"" S excluded.
- "" T I D O"" -> ""stido"" S out.
- "" T I G O"" -> ""stigo"" S out.
- Without S: ""btigo"" not a word.
- "" T I K O"" -> ""ptiko"" P excluded? Or ""ktiko"" not.
- "" T I V O"" -> ""ctivo"" C out.
- "" T I Z O"" -> not.

No common words.

Case 2.2: Pattern _ _ I T O
- Position 1 and 2: available letters.

Words:
- "" I T T O"" -> ""mit to"" not.
- ""BITTO"" not a word.
- ""DITTO"" -> D I T T O: positions 1=D, 2=I, 3=T, 4=T, 5=O. But we need position 3 to be I? Here position 3 is T, not I. So not.
- ""FITTO"" not.
- ""GITTO"" -> as in ""giotto""? But it's G I O T T O, 6 letters? Or ""gitto"" not a word.
- ""HITTO"" not.
- ""KITTO"" not.
- ""VITTO"" not.
- ""WITTO"" not.

No common words.

Therefore, the only plausible word we found is ""idiot"" for case 1.2.

In ""idiot"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: D
- Position 3: I (which is fixed and correct)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: T

But note: we have I at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? The feedback has not indicated that I is duplicated, but it's possible.

Also, we know T is in the word, and here it's at position 5. O is at position 4.

- O: in the word, and in position 4. We know O cannot be in position 1 or 2, and position 4 is allowed.

Also, the letters used: I, D, I, O, T. Excluded letters are not used.

So ""idiot"" is a valid guess.

Alternatively, are there other words?

What about ""dhoti""? But ""dhoti"" is D H O T I, which would be positions: 1=D, 2=H, 3=O? But we need position 3 to be I. So not.

   - I is in position 3 (✓ from both Guess 2 and Guess 3).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1 (marked ""-"" in Guess 2).
   - O is in the word but not in position 1 (marked ""-"" in Guess 3) or position 2 (marked ""-"" in Guess 2).  
   **Pattern so far**: `_ _ I _ _`.

3. **Constraints for T and O**:
   - T must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).
   - O must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 3).
   - Since O must occupy position 4 or 5, and T must be in 2, 4, or 5, the possible configurations are:
     - O in position 4 → T in position 2 or 5.
     - O in position 5 → T in position 2 or 4.

4. **New Guess Requirements**:
   - Must include I in position 3.
   - Must include T and O (since they are in the word).
   - Use two additional letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - Avoid all excluded letters.

5. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - After testing patterns (e.g., `_ T I O _`, `_ _ I O T`, `_ T I _ O`, `_ _ I T O`), the only valid English word that fits the constraints and available letters is **""idiot""**:
     - Position 1: I (not excluded, and possible if duplicated).
     - Position 2: D (available letter).
     - Position 3: I (✓ confirmed).
     - Position 4: O (fits position constraint).
     - Position 5: T (fits position constraint).
   - This adheres to all feedback:
     - T is in position 5 (allowed, since T cannot be in 1).
     - O is in position 4 (allowed, since O cannot be in 1 or 2).
     - Uses D (available) and tests for I duplication.

6. **Why ""idiot""?**  
   It efficiently tests:
   - If I is duplicated (position 1 feedback will clarify).
   - Positions of T and O.
   - Introduces a new common letter (D).",Guess 5: idiot -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) D(✓) I(✓) O(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
