We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A (because A is in the correct position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""crane"" and is marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

Also, the word contains the letter E, but not at the end. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid using the letters C, R, and N in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' as the third letter.
- Includes the letter 'E' (but not in the fifth position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The word must have the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It must contain an 'E' that is not at the end (so positions 1, 2, or 4).

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ A _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E A _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ A E _

We also want to test other common consonants to get more information.

Let's consider some words:

Option 1: Start with E in position 1.
- Example: ""EATER"" -> but we know A is in position 3, so if we put E at position 1, then the word would be E _ A _ _. But ""EATER"" has E at 1, A at 3, T at 2, E at 4, R at 5. But R is excluded (we cannot use R). So not valid.

We must avoid R, so words with R are out.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E A _ _
- Example: ""LEAST"" -> L E A S T. But we have S and T which are new. Also, note that in the feedback, E was marked as present but not in position 5, so it could be in position 2. However, we must avoid using N (which is not in ""least"") and R (also not in ""least""). So this is a candidate.

But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" had E as present, so we must include E in our next guess? Actually, we should because we know E is in the word and we want to find its position.

But note: the feedback does not require us to use E again? Actually, we can choose not to, but it would be inefficient because we know E is in the word and we need to find where. So we should include E and try it in a different position.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So in the next guess, we should try E in a different position (1, 2, or 4).

But we also have the constraint that the third letter is A.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include E and avoid C, R, N.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

With E in position 1: 
- ""EAGLE"" -> E A G L E -> but the third letter is G, not A? Wait, no: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:G -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

So for E in position 1: the word would be E _ A _ _
Examples: 
- ""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but second letter is A? Then third would be T? No: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:T -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Actually, we need the third letter to be A, so the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So if we put E at position 1, then the word is E [2] A [4] [5]. The second letter can be any letter (except C, R, N) and the fourth and fifth as well.

So let's try to find words with pattern E _ A _ _ 
But note: the second letter must not be A? It can be, but we don't know. Actually, we don't have any information about the second letter yet.

Example words: 
- ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E. This avoids C, R, N. And it has E at position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (from the feedback of ""crane"": E was at 5 and marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So if we use ""ELATE"", we are putting E at 5 again, which we know is not correct. But that's okay because we are testing other positions. However, we are also testing E at position 1.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our next guess, we don't have to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

So for pattern E _ A _ _ (E at 1) and then the fifth letter is not E. Example: 
- ""EXAMS"" -> but we have X and M, and S. But ""exams"" is a word? Yes. But let's see: E X A M S. This avoids C, R, N. And E is at 1, and the fifth is S (not E). So that's a candidate.

But is ""exams"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""EBAY"" -> not 5 letters. 

""ELANS"" -> but N is excluded. So no.

""EVADE"": E V A D E -> but then E is at 5 again, which we know is not the position. So avoid.

""EDGES"": E D G E S -> but the third letter is G, not A? No, we need the third letter to be A. So pattern: E _ A _ _ -> so the third letter is A. So ""EDGES"" is E D G E S -> third letter is G, so not matching.

So let me think: we need the word to have the third letter A. So for E at position 1, the word must be: E [letter] A [letter] [letter]. And the last letter should not be E (to avoid the known wrong position). 

Examples:
- ""EXALT"": E X A L T -> avoids C, R, N. And no E at the end. So that's a candidate.

Similarly, with E at position 2: pattern _ E A _ _
Examples: 
- ""STEAL"": S T E A L -> but the third letter is E? Then the pattern would be S T E A L -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. 

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is [1][2]A[4][5]. If we want E at position 2, then the word is [1] E A [4] [5]. 

So examples: 
- ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. Avoids C, R, N. And E is at position 2. This is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TEAMS"": T E A M S -> same pattern.

Or ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> but D and S.

With E at position 4: pattern _ _ A E _
Examples: 
- ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but E is at position 5? Actually, the pattern would be [1][2]A[4][5] and we want E at position 4: so [1][2]A E [5]. 
Example: ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we want the fifth letter not to be E? Actually, we can have E at position 4 and the fifth can be anything. But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, that's fine.

But in ""SHADE"", the E is at position 5? Let me check: 
- S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So E is at 5. We don't want that because we know E is not at 5. So we need a word with pattern [1][2]A E [5] and [5] is not E. 

Example: ""SHAPE"": S H A P E -> again E at 5. 
""GRACE"": but G and R -> R is excluded.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> E at 5 again.

It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 and not at 5? Actually, the fifth letter can be any letter except E? But we don't have to avoid E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 again? But we know it's not there, so it's a wasted opportunity. So better to avoid.

Therefore, let's focus on E at position 1 or 2.

Candidates:
1. E _ A _ _ with no E at 5: e.g., ""EXALT"" (E X A L T)
2. _ E A _ _ : e.g., ""SEAMS"" (S E A M S), ""TEAMS"" (T E A M S), ""BEADS"" (B E A D S), ""HEADS"" (H E A D S), etc.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We should avoid C, R, N. So available letters: we can use common letters like S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.

In ""EXALT"": letters E, X, A, L, T. We already know A and E are in the word. So we are testing X, L, T. X is not very common.

In ""SEAMS"": S, E, A, M, S. We are testing S and M. But S appears twice? Actually, it's two S's? The word ""seams"" has two S's? S-E-A-M-S: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. So two S's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one S, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TEAMS"": T, E, A, M, S. All distinct letters. This tests T, E, A, M, S. We know E and A are in the word, so we are testing T, M, S.

Similarly, ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S. Distinct letters, tests B, D, S.

Another candidate: ""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S.

We can also consider ""LEADS"": but L, E, A, D, S. But we haven't used L.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So it's okay to have duplicates? But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.

So let's choose a word with distinct new letters and that includes E in a new position (either 1 or 2) and avoids C, R, N.

I think ""TEAMS"" is a good candidate: 
- T is a common letter, E at position 2 (which we haven't tried), A at 3 (known), M and S are common.

Another option: ""BEADS"" (B, E, A, D, S) or ""HEADS"" (H, E, A, D, S). But H is less common than T.

We could also consider ""STEAM"": but pattern? S T E A M -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:M -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't fit. We must have A at position 3.

So ""STEAM"" is not valid because the third letter is E, not A.

Therefore, I think ""TEAMS"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""TEAMS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So I'll go with ""TEAMS"".

Alternatively, ""SEAMS"" is also valid, but it has two S's. So ""TEAMS"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEAMS""

But note: we are also testing the position of E. In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x.

We are also testing T at position 1, M at position 4, and S at position 5.

So let's proceed with ""TEAMS"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).
- A is in the correct position (third letter, marked as ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked as -).

The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _, and it contains the letter E (which must be in position 1, 2, or 4). For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include E in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""teams"" fits well:
- It has A as the third letter (matching the known position).
- It places E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It uses new letters (T, M, S) that haven't been tried yet, maximizing information gain.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

<guess>teams</guess>",teams,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A (because A is in the correct position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""crane"" and is marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

Also, the word contains the letter E, but not at the end. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid using the letters C, R, and N in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' as the third letter.
- Includes the letter 'E' (but not in the fifth position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The word must have the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It must contain an 'E' that is not at the end (so positions 1, 2, or 4).

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ A _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E A _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ A E _

We also want to test other common consonants to get more information.

Let's consider some words:

Option 1: Start with E in position 1.
- Example: ""EATER"" -> but we know A is in position 3, so if we put E at position 1, then the word would be E _ A _ _. But ""EATER"" has E at 1, A at 3, T at 2, E at 4, R at 5. But R is excluded (we cannot use R). So not valid.

We must avoid R, so words with R are out.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E A _ _
- Example: ""LEAST"" -> L E A S T. But we have S and T which are new. Also, note that in the feedback, E was marked as present but not in position 5, so it could be in position 2. However, we must avoid using N (which is not in ""least"") and R (also not in ""least""). So this is a candidate.

But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" had E as present, so we must include E in our next guess? Actually, we should because we know E is in the word and we want to find its position.

But note: the feedback does not require us to use E again? Actually, we can choose not to, but it would be inefficient because we know E is in the word and we need to find where. So we should include E and try it in a different position.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So in the next guess, we should try E in a different position (1, 2, or 4).

But we also have the constraint that the third letter is A.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include E and avoid C, R, N.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

With E in position 1: 
- ""EAGLE"" -> E A G L E -> but the third letter is G, not A? Wait, no: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:G -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

So for E in position 1: the word would be E _ A _ _
Examples: 
- ""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but second letter is A? Then third would be T? No: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:T -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Actually, we need the third letter to be A, so the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So if we put E at position 1, then the word is E [2] A [4] [5]. The second letter can be any letter (except C, R, N) and the fourth and fifth as well.

So let's try to find words with pattern E _ A _ _ 
But note: the second letter must not be A? It can be, but we don't know. Actually, we don't have any information about the second letter yet.

Example words: 
- ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E. This avoids C, R, N. And it has E at position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (from the feedback of ""crane"": E was at 5 and marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So if we use ""ELATE"", we are putting E at 5 again, which we know is not correct. But that's okay because we are testing other positions. However, we are also testing E at position 1.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our next guess, we don't have to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

So for pattern E _ A _ _ (E at 1) and then the fifth letter is not E. Example: 
- ""EXAMS"" -> but we have X and M, and S. But ""exams"" is a word? Yes. But let's see: E X A M S. This avoids C, R, N. And E is at 1, and the fifth is S (not E). So that's a candidate.

But is ""exams"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""EBAY"" -> not 5 letters. 

""ELANS"" -> but N is excluded. So no.

""EVADE"": E V A D E -> but then E is at 5 again, which we know is not the position. So avoid.

""EDGES"": E D G E S -> but the third letter is G, not A? No, we need the third letter to be A. So pattern: E _ A _ _ -> so the third letter is A. So ""EDGES"" is E D G E S -> third letter is G, so not matching.

So let me think: we need the word to have the third letter A. So for E at position 1, the word must be: E [letter] A [letter] [letter]. And the last letter should not be E (to avoid the known wrong position). 

Examples:
- ""EXALT"": E X A L T -> avoids C, R, N. And no E at the end. So that's a candidate.

Similarly, with E at position 2: pattern _ E A _ _
Examples: 
- ""STEAL"": S T E A L -> but the third letter is E? Then the pattern would be S T E A L -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. 

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is [1][2]A[4][5]. If we want E at position 2, then the word is [1] E A [4] [5]. 

So examples: 
- ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. Avoids C, R, N. And E is at position 2. This is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TEAMS"": T E A M S -> same pattern.

Or ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> but D and S.

With E at position 4: pattern _ _ A E _
Examples: 
- ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but E is at position 5? Actually, the pattern would be [1][2]A[4][5] and we want E at position 4: so [1][2]A E [5]. 
Example: ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we want the fifth letter not to be E? Actually, we can have E at position 4 and the fifth can be anything. But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, that's fine.

But in ""SHADE"", the E is at position 5? Let me check: 
- S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So E is at 5. We don't want that because we know E is not at 5. So we need a word with pattern [1][2]A E [5] and [5] is not E. 

Example: ""SHAPE"": S H A P E -> again E at 5. 
""GRACE"": but G and R -> R is excluded.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> E at 5 again.

It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 and not at 5? Actually, the fifth letter can be any letter except E? But we don't have to avoid E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 again? But we know it's not there, so it's a wasted opportunity. So better to avoid.

Therefore, let's focus on E at position 1 or 2.

Candidates:
1. E _ A _ _ with no E at 5: e.g., ""EXALT"" (E X A L T)
2. _ E A _ _ : e.g., ""SEAMS"" (S E A M S), ""TEAMS"" (T E A M S), ""BEADS"" (B E A D S), ""HEADS"" (H E A D S), etc.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We should avoid C, R, N. So available letters: we can use common letters like S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.

In ""EXALT"": letters E, X, A, L, T. We already know A and E are in the word. So we are testing X, L, T. X is not very common.

In ""SEAMS"": S, E, A, M, S. We are testing S and M. But S appears twice? Actually, it's two S's? The word ""seams"" has two S's? S-E-A-M-S: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. So two S's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one S, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TEAMS"": T, E, A, M, S. All distinct letters. This tests T, E, A, M, S. We know E and A are in the word, so we are testing T, M, S.

Similarly, ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S. Distinct letters, tests B, D, S.

Another candidate: ""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S.

We can also consider ""LEADS"": but L, E, A, D, S. But we haven't used L.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So it's okay to have duplicates? But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.

So let's choose a word with distinct new letters and that includes E in a new position (either 1 or 2) and avoids C, R, N.

I think ""TEAMS"" is a good candidate: 
- T is a common letter, E at position 2 (which we haven't tried), A at 3 (known), M and S are common.

Another option: ""BEADS"" (B, E, A, D, S) or ""HEADS"" (H, E, A, D, S). But H is less common than T.

We could also consider ""STEAM"": but pattern? S T E A M -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:M -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't fit. We must have A at position 3.

So ""STEAM"" is not valid because the third letter is E, not A.

Therefore, I think ""TEAMS"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""TEAMS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So I'll go with ""TEAMS"".

Alternatively, ""SEAMS"" is also valid, but it has two S's. So ""TEAMS"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEAMS""

But note: we are also testing the position of E. In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x.

We are also testing T at position 1, M at position 4, and S at position 5.

So let's proceed with ""TEAMS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).
- A is in the correct position (third letter, marked as ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked as -).

The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _, and it contains the letter E (which must be in position 1, 2, or 4). For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include E in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""teams"" fits well:
- It has A as the third letter (matching the known position).
- It places E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It uses new letters (T, M, S) that haven't been tried yet, maximizing information gain.
- It avoids C, R, and N.",Guess 2: teams -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BEAST,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A (because A is in the correct position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""crane"" and is marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

Also, the word contains the letter E, but not at the end. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid using the letters C, R, and N in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' as the third letter.
- Includes the letter 'E' (but not in the fifth position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The word must have the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It must contain an 'E' that is not at the end (so positions 1, 2, or 4).

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ A _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E A _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ A E _

We also want to test other common consonants to get more information.

Let's consider some words:

Option 1: Start with E in position 1.
- Example: ""EATER"" -> but we know A is in position 3, so if we put E at position 1, then the word would be E _ A _ _. But ""EATER"" has E at 1, A at 3, T at 2, E at 4, R at 5. But R is excluded (we cannot use R). So not valid.

We must avoid R, so words with R are out.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E A _ _
- Example: ""LEAST"" -> L E A S T. But we have S and T which are new. Also, note that in the feedback, E was marked as present but not in position 5, so it could be in position 2. However, we must avoid using N (which is not in ""least"") and R (also not in ""least""). So this is a candidate.

But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" had E as present, so we must include E in our next guess? Actually, we should because we know E is in the word and we want to find its position.

But note: the feedback does not require us to use E again? Actually, we can choose not to, but it would be inefficient because we know E is in the word and we need to find where. So we should include E and try it in a different position.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So in the next guess, we should try E in a different position (1, 2, or 4).

But we also have the constraint that the third letter is A.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include E and avoid C, R, N.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

With E in position 1: 
- ""EAGLE"" -> E A G L E -> but the third letter is G, not A? Wait, no: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:G -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

So for E in position 1: the word would be E _ A _ _
Examples: 
- ""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but second letter is A? Then third would be T? No: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:T -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Actually, we need the third letter to be A, so the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So if we put E at position 1, then the word is E [2] A [4] [5]. The second letter can be any letter (except C, R, N) and the fourth and fifth as well.

So let's try to find words with pattern E _ A _ _ 
But note: the second letter must not be A? It can be, but we don't know. Actually, we don't have any information about the second letter yet.

Example words: 
- ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E. This avoids C, R, N. And it has E at position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (from the feedback of ""crane"": E was at 5 and marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So if we use ""ELATE"", we are putting E at 5 again, which we know is not correct. But that's okay because we are testing other positions. However, we are also testing E at position 1.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our next guess, we don't have to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

So for pattern E _ A _ _ (E at 1) and then the fifth letter is not E. Example: 
- ""EXAMS"" -> but we have X and M, and S. But ""exams"" is a word? Yes. But let's see: E X A M S. This avoids C, R, N. And E is at 1, and the fifth is S (not E). So that's a candidate.

But is ""exams"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""EBAY"" -> not 5 letters. 

""ELANS"" -> but N is excluded. So no.

""EVADE"": E V A D E -> but then E is at 5 again, which we know is not the position. So avoid.

""EDGES"": E D G E S -> but the third letter is G, not A? No, we need the third letter to be A. So pattern: E _ A _ _ -> so the third letter is A. So ""EDGES"" is E D G E S -> third letter is G, so not matching.

So let me think: we need the word to have the third letter A. So for E at position 1, the word must be: E [letter] A [letter] [letter]. And the last letter should not be E (to avoid the known wrong position). 

Examples:
- ""EXALT"": E X A L T -> avoids C, R, N. And no E at the end. So that's a candidate.

Similarly, with E at position 2: pattern _ E A _ _
Examples: 
- ""STEAL"": S T E A L -> but the third letter is E? Then the pattern would be S T E A L -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. 

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is [1][2]A[4][5]. If we want E at position 2, then the word is [1] E A [4] [5]. 

So examples: 
- ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. Avoids C, R, N. And E is at position 2. This is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TEAMS"": T E A M S -> same pattern.

Or ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> but D and S.

With E at position 4: pattern _ _ A E _
Examples: 
- ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but E is at position 5? Actually, the pattern would be [1][2]A[4][5] and we want E at position 4: so [1][2]A E [5]. 
Example: ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we want the fifth letter not to be E? Actually, we can have E at position 4 and the fifth can be anything. But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, that's fine.

But in ""SHADE"", the E is at position 5? Let me check: 
- S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So E is at 5. We don't want that because we know E is not at 5. So we need a word with pattern [1][2]A E [5] and [5] is not E. 

Example: ""SHAPE"": S H A P E -> again E at 5. 
""GRACE"": but G and R -> R is excluded.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> E at 5 again.

It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 and not at 5? Actually, the fifth letter can be any letter except E? But we don't have to avoid E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 again? But we know it's not there, so it's a wasted opportunity. So better to avoid.

Therefore, let's focus on E at position 1 or 2.

Candidates:
1. E _ A _ _ with no E at 5: e.g., ""EXALT"" (E X A L T)
2. _ E A _ _ : e.g., ""SEAMS"" (S E A M S), ""TEAMS"" (T E A M S), ""BEADS"" (B E A D S), ""HEADS"" (H E A D S), etc.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We should avoid C, R, N. So available letters: we can use common letters like S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.

In ""EXALT"": letters E, X, A, L, T. We already know A and E are in the word. So we are testing X, L, T. X is not very common.

In ""SEAMS"": S, E, A, M, S. We are testing S and M. But S appears twice? Actually, it's two S's? The word ""seams"" has two S's? S-E-A-M-S: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. So two S's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one S, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TEAMS"": T, E, A, M, S. All distinct letters. This tests T, E, A, M, S. We know E and A are in the word, so we are testing T, M, S.

Similarly, ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S. Distinct letters, tests B, D, S.

Another candidate: ""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S.

We can also consider ""LEADS"": but L, E, A, D, S. But we haven't used L.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So it's okay to have duplicates? But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.

So let's choose a word with distinct new letters and that includes E in a new position (either 1 or 2) and avoids C, R, N.

I think ""TEAMS"" is a good candidate: 
- T is a common letter, E at position 2 (which we haven't tried), A at 3 (known), M and S are common.

Another option: ""BEADS"" (B, E, A, D, S) or ""HEADS"" (H, E, A, D, S). But H is less common than T.

So ""STEAM"" is not valid because the third letter is E, not A.

Therefore, I think ""TEAMS"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""TEAMS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So I'll go with ""TEAMS"".

Alternatively, ""SEAMS"" is also valid, but it has two S's. So ""TEAMS"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEAMS""

But note: we are also testing the position of E. In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x.

We are also testing T at position 1, M at position 4, and S at position 5.

So let's proceed with ""TEAMS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).
- A is in the correct position (third letter, marked as ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked as -).

But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, that\'s fine.\n\nBut in ""SHADE"", the E is at position 5? Let me check: \n- S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So E is at 5. We don\'t want that because we know E is not at 5. So we need a word with pattern [1][2]A E [5] and [5] is not E. \n\nExample: ""SHAPE"": S H A P E -> again E at 5. \n""GRACE"": but G and R -> R is excluded.\n\n""BLAME"": B L A M E -> E at 5 again.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with E at position 4 and not at 5? Actually, the fifth letter can be any letter except E? But we don\'t have to avoid E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 again? But we know it\'s not there, so it\'s a wasted opportunity. So better to avoid.\n\nTherefore, let\'s focus on E at position 1 or 2.\n\nCandidates:\n1. E _ A _ _ with no E at 5: e.g., ""EXALT"" (E X A L T)\n2. _ E A _ _ : e.g., ""SEAMS"" (S E A M S), ""TEAMS"" (T E A M S), ""BEADS"" (B E A D S), ""HEADS"" (H E A D S), etc.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We should avoid C, R, N. So available letters: we can use common letters like S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.\n\nIn ""EXALT"": letters E, X, A, L, T. We already know A and E are in the word. So we are testing X, L, T. X is not very common.\n\nIn ""SEAMS"": S, E, A, M, S. We are testing S and M. But S appears twice? Actually, it\'s two S\'s? The word ""seams"" has two S\'s? S-E-A-M-S: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. So two S\'s. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one S, we might get confusing feedback. But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""TEAMS"": T, E, A, M, S. All distinct letters. This tests T, E, A, M, S. We know E and A are in the word, so we are testing T, M, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S. Distinct letters, tests B, D, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S.\n\nWe can also consider ""LEADS"": but L, E, A, D, S. But we haven\'t used L.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. So it\'s okay to have duplicates? But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with distinct new letters and that includes E in a new position (either 1 or 2) and avoids C, R, N.\n\nI think ""TEAMS"" is a good candidate: \n- T is a common letter, E at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried), A at 3 (known), M and S are common.\n\nAnother option: ""BEADS"" (B, E, A, D, S) or ""HEADS"" (H, E, A, D, S). But H is less common than T.\n\nWe could also consider ""STEAM"": but pattern? S T E A M -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:M -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn\'t fit. We must have A at position 3.\n\nSo ""STEAM"" is not valid because the third letter is E, not A.\n\nTherefore, I think ""TEAMS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""TEAMS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TEAMS"".\n\nAlternatively, ""SEAMS"" is also valid, but it has two S\'s. So ""TEAMS"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""TEAMS""\n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of E. In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we\'ll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x.\n\nWe are also testing T at position 1, M at position 4, and S at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s proceed with ""TEAMS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).\n- A is in the correct position (third letter, marked as ✓).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked as -).\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _, and it contains the letter E (which must be in position 1, 2, or 4). For the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, or N.\n- Include E in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""teams"" fits well:\n- It has A as the third letter (matching the known position).\n- It places E in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- It uses new letters (T, M, S) that haven\'t been tried yet, maximizing information gain.\n- It avoids C, R, and N.\n\n<guess>teams</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: teams -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Guess 2: ""teams""
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is E)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A, which we already knew)
- M: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. The secret word has the form: _ E A _ _ 
   (because from ""teams"", E is correct at position 2 and A at position 3).

2. The word contains the letters:
   - E (at position 2)
   - A (at position 3)
   - T (somewhere, but not at position 1, because in ""teams"" it was at position 1 and marked as wrong position)
   - S (somewhere, but not at position 5, because in ""teams"" it was at position 5 and marked as wrong position)

3. Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
   - E is in the word (and now we know it's at position 2, so that's confirmed).
   - The word does not contain C, R, N, or M.

4. The word must have 5 letters, so we have the pattern: [1] E A [4] [5]

We know that T is in the word but not at position 1, and S is in the word but not at position 5.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, S. We must avoid C, R, N, M.

Available letters: we can use other common letters like B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5], with the constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be T (because T was at position 1 in ""teams"" and was marked as present but wrong position). Also, it cannot be C, R, N, M (excluded letters).
- Position 4: can be any letter except the excluded ones, but note that we don't have direct constraints yet.
- Position 5: cannot be S (because S was at position 5 in ""teams"" and marked as wrong position). Also, cannot be C, R, N, M.

Moreover, the word must contain T and S, but not at the positions we've already tried.

So T must be in position 4 or 5? But position 5 cannot be S, but T could be at position 5? However, we have two letters that must be placed: T and S.

We know T is in the word and not at position 1, and S is in the word and not at position 5.

Possible positions for T: position 4 or 5? But we have two positions left: 4 and 5.

Similarly, S must be in position 1 or 4? Because position 5 is excluded for S.

But note: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill, and we have two letters that must be included: T and S. So one of the positions will be filled by a new letter? Or could there be duplicate letters? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

Let me denote the positions:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is not C, R, N, M, and not T (because T was at 1 and was wrong). Also, it cannot be E or A (because they are fixed at 2 and 3). So position 1 must be a new letter or S? But S is allowed at position 1? Yes, because we haven't tried S at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: can be T? Or S? Or a new letter.

Position 5: can be T? Or a new letter? But not S.

We have two known letters to place: T and S. And one more letter that we don't know.

So the word must contain T and S, and one more letter (for the remaining position).

Possible cases:

Case 1: Position 1 is S, then position 4 and 5 must be T and a new letter? But we have two positions and two letters: T and one new. But note: if position 1 is S, then S is at position 1, which is allowed because we only know S is not at 5. Then position 4 and 5: one is T and the other is a new letter, say X.

But T cannot be at position 1, but it can be at 4 or 5. Similarly, S is at 1.

Case 2: Position 1 is not S, then it must be a new letter, say Y. Then we have to place T and S in positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be S, so S must be at position 4, and T at position 5? Or could T be at 4 and S at 5? But position 5 cannot be S, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, if position 1 is not S, then S must be at position 4, and T must be at position 5? Because position 5 is the only one left for T? But we have position 4 and 5: if S is at 4, then T must be at 5? Or if T is at 4, then S must be at 5? But S cannot be at 5. So the only possibility is S at 4 and T at 5.

But wait, we have three positions: 1, 4, 5. We have two known letters (T and S) and one unknown. So if position 1 is not S, then we must put S at 4 and T at 5? Then position 1 is a new letter.

Alternatively, if position 1 is S, then we put S at 1, and then T and a new letter at 4 and 5 (with T at 4 or 5).

So two main possibilities:

Option A: [S] E A [T] [X]  or [S] E A [X] [T]  (where X is a new letter)
Option B: [Y] E A [S] [T]  (where Y is a new letter, and S at 4, T at 5)

But note: in Option B, we have T at position 5. Is that allowed? We don't have any information that T cannot be at 5. Similarly, in Option A, T can be at 4 or 5.

However, we must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Option B: pattern [Y] E A [S] [T] -> _ E A S T

What words have the pattern _ E A S T?
- We can have: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N, M. So:
- BEAST: B is allowed (not excluded), and we haven't used B. Also, S and T are already known to be in the word. But note: in this word, S is at position 4 and T at 5. Also, we are testing B at position 1.

Similarly, FEAST: F is allowed.
LEAST: L is allowed.
YEAST: Y is allowed.

But we also have to consider if these words are valid.

Now, Option A: pattern [S] E A [T] [X] or [S] E A [X] [T]

For [S] E A [T] [X]: S E A T X -> e.g., words like ""SEATS"" (but that has two S's? S E A T S -> but then position 5 is S, which we know is not allowed? Because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, in this pattern, if we put T at 4, then position 5 must be a new letter, but not S. So the word would be S E A T X, where X is not S and not any excluded letter.

What words? ""SEATS"" is S E A T S -> invalid because of two S's and S at 5? Actually, ""seats"" has S at 1 and 5. But we know S cannot be at 5, so ""seats"" would be invalid because of the S at 5. Similarly, ""sweat"" is only 5 letters? S W E A T -> but that's 5 letters: S(1), W(2), E(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Our pattern requires position 3 to be A, so it must be S E A ... 

So for S E A T X: we need a word starting with ""SEAT"" and then one more letter. But ""SEAT"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word. Examples: ""SEATS"" (but S at 5, which is invalid) or ""SEATH"" (not common) or ""SEATO"" (not a common word). 

Alternatively, S E A X T: e.g., ""SEATT"" is not a word. ""SEATS"" again has S at 5. 

Actually, I can't think of a common word that starts with ""SEA"" and then T and then a letter that is not S. For example, ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but it has S at 5. So Option A might be less likely.

Therefore, Option B seems more promising: words ending with ""EAST"".

So let's list possible words for pattern _ E A S T:

- BEAST
- FEAST
- LEAST
- YEAST
- HEAST? (not a word)
- PEAST? (not common, but ""feast"" is common)

We must avoid C, R, N, M. So B, F, L, Y are all allowed.

Now, we also have to consider that we haven't used these letters.

But note: we have to test these words. However, we can make a guess that uses common letters and might help us distinguish.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 3. We can try to guess one of these if we are confident.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the possibilities without necessarily being one of these words, to get more information.

But the pattern is fixed: the word must be _ E A _ _ and must contain T and S. And from the pattern, if we assume that the word ends with ""ST"", then we have the above options.

But wait, we don't know that the word ends with ""ST"". We only know that S and T are in the word and must be placed in positions 1,4,5 with the constraints.

In Option B, we have [Y] E A [S] [T] -> so the word ends with ""ST"". But is that the only possibility? No, because Option A is also possible, but we had trouble finding words for Option A.

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, maybe S appears twice? But we haven't seen that.

But let's not assume. We can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

We know the pattern is [1] E A [4] [5]. We need to find what goes in 1,4,5.

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be T, C, R, N, M. It can be S or another letter.
- Position 4: can be any letter except C, R, N, M. It can be T, S, or another letter.
- Position 5: cannot be S, C, R, N, M. It can be T or another letter.

And the word must contain T and S.

We can try a word that has S at position 1 and T at position 4, for example, and a new letter at 5. But we need a valid word.

For example: ""SEATS"" is invalid because of S at 5. What about ""SETAE""? But that's S E T A E -> but the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

So pattern must be [1] E A [4] [5]. So if we put S at 1, then the word is S E A [4] [5]. We need to choose [4] and [5] such that it's a word and includes T.

For example:
- ""SEATS"": S E A T S -> but S at 5 is invalid (we know S is not at 5).
- ""SEATO"": not a common word.
- ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but invalid.

What about ""SEAZE""? Not a word.

So perhaps Option A is not feasible? Then the only possibility is Option B: the word ends with ""ST"", i.e., [Y] E A S T.

Therefore, the secret word is one of: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.

Now, we can try to guess one of these. But which one? We have to choose one that tests the first letter.

We can use a guess that includes multiple candidates? But we are limited to one word.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but helps us distinguish the possibilities.

But since we are at guess 3 and we have a strong pattern, we might guess one of the candidates.

To maximize information, we could choose a word that tests the first letter with a common letter.

But let's see the candidates: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST. The first letters are B, F, L, Y.

We haven't used any of these letters. We can try, for example, ""LEAST"" to test L.

But if we guess ""LEAST"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and the other letters.

But note: in ""LEAST"", the letters are L, E, A, S, T. We know E and A are correct at positions 2 and 3. S and T are at positions 4 and 5, which we believe are correct in this pattern.

But if we guess ""LEAST"" and it's not the word, we might get feedback that S and T are correct? Or not.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses a new set of letters to test the first position without committing to the ""ST"" ending.

For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] with [1] being a common letter, and [4] and [5] being new letters, but we must include T and S? How?

We know T and S must be in the word, so we have to include them in positions 1,4,5.

But if we put T at position 4 and S at position 1, we have the word ""S E A T [5]"". But we need a valid word with that pattern and [5] not being S. As before, we couldn't find one.

Similarly, if we put T at position 5 and S at position 4: [1] E A S T, which is the Option B we have.

So it seems we are forced into the pattern [1] E A S T.

Therefore, I think the secret word is one of the ""EAST"" words.

Now, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a common letter. For example, ""LEAST"" is a common word.

But let's see the frequency of the first letters: B, F, L, Y. L and B are more common than F and Y.

We can also consider ""HEAST"" is not a word, ""GEAST"" not a word, ""PEAST"" not common, ""WEAST"" not common. So the common ones are BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.

We can try ""LEAST"" because L is a common letter.

But note: we have not used L in previous guesses, so we don't know about L.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests L and also other letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

I think we should guess ""LEAST"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BEAST"" and we guess ""LEAST"": 
- L: not in the word (x)
- E: correct (✓)
- A: correct (✓)
- S: correct (✓) because in ""BEAST"", S is at position 4, and in ""LEAST"" it's also at 4? 
  - ""LEAST"": L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  - ""BEAST"": B(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  So if we guess ""LEAST"" and the secret is ""BEAST"", then:
  - L: x (not in secret)
  - E: ✓
  - A: ✓
  - S: ✓ (position 4 is correct)
  - T: ✓ (position 5 is correct)

But we would get four correct and one wrong, and we would know that the first letter is not L, so it must be B, F, or Y.

Similarly, if the secret is ""LEAST"", we get all correct.

But we are at guess 3, so we can afford to guess one of them.

To save a guess, we might guess a word that can test multiple first letters? But we can't because the pattern is fixed.

Another idea: guess a word that is not in this set but includes the letters B, F, L, Y to test which one is present? But we are constrained by the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] and we know [4] and [5] must be S and T? Not necessarily, but in this case, we think they are S and T.

But let's not jump to conclusions. We have to consider that there might be other possibilities.

For example, could the word be ""DEALT""? 
- Pattern: D E A L T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T. 
  This fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5]. 
  Now, does it contain T? Yes, at position 5. 
  Does it contain S? No. But we know from the feedback that S is in the word. 
  How do we know S is in the word? 
  From the second guess ""teams"": S was marked as present but wrong position. So S must be in the word. 
  Therefore, ""DEALT"" does not have S, so it cannot be the word.

Similarly, ""HELLO"" doesn't fit.

What about ""PEALS""? P E A L S -> but third letter is A? P(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). But S is at position 5, which is not allowed because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, invalid.

""TEALS"": T E A L S -> but T at position 1: in ""teams"", T was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so T cannot be at 1. Also, S at 5 is invalid.

""MEALS"": M is excluded.

So indeed, the only possibilities are the words ending with ""ST"" for positions 4 and 5: S at 4 and T at 5.

Therefore, the word must be [1] E A S T.

So we can guess one of them. I'll go with ""LEAST"" because it's a common word.

But to be thorough, let's list all common words: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.

We can also consider ""WEAST"" (not common) or ""FEAST"" is common.

I think ""LEAST"" is a good guess.

So next guess: ""LEAST""

But note: if we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us the first letter is not L, and then we can guess among the others.

We have 4 tries left after this, so it's safe.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LEAST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and N are not in the word (x). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
- **Guess 2 (teams)**: T is in the word but not in position 1 (-). E is in the correct position (✓, position 2). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). M is not in the word (x). S is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **? E A ? ?** (positions 2 and 3 are E and A, respectively).
- The word **must contain T and S**, but:
  - T cannot be in position 1 (from ""teams"" feedback).
  - S cannot be in position 5 (from ""teams"" feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, M (from both guesses).
- E is confirmed at position 2, and A at position 3.

### Deductions:
- **Positions 1, 4, and 5** need to be filled with valid letters, including T and S.
- Since S cannot be in position 5, and T cannot be in position 1, the only feasible pattern that fits common English words is **? E A S T** (S in position 4, T in position 5). This is because:
  - If S were in position 1, no common 5-letter words exist with the pattern ""S E A ? ?"" that include T and avoid S in position 5 (e.g., ""seats"" is invalid due to S in position 5).
  - Thus, S must be in position 4, and T must be in position 5.
- The only unknown is position 1, which must be a letter not excluded (not C, R, N, M) and not E, A, T, or S. Common options are B, F, L, or Y (e.g., BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the pattern **? E A S T** by guessing a common word like **LEAST**.
  - L is a high-frequency consonant not yet tested.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on L (and confirmation of S/T positions) will narrow down the options (e.g., if L is absent, the word is likely BEAST, FEAST, or YEAST).

<guess>least</guess>",least,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Guess 2: ""teams""
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is E)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A, which we already knew)
- M: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. The secret word has the form: _ E A _ _ 
   (because from ""teams"", E is correct at position 2 and A at position 3).

2. The word contains the letters:
   - E (at position 2)
   - A (at position 3)
   - T (somewhere, but not at position 1, because in ""teams"" it was at position 1 and marked as wrong position)
   - S (somewhere, but not at position 5, because in ""teams"" it was at position 5 and marked as wrong position)

3. Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
   - E is in the word (and now we know it's at position 2, so that's confirmed).
   - The word does not contain C, R, N, or M.

4. The word must have 5 letters, so we have the pattern: [1] E A [4] [5]

We know that T is in the word but not at position 1, and S is in the word but not at position 5.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, S. We must avoid C, R, N, M.

Available letters: we can use other common letters like B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5], with the constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be T (because T was at position 1 in ""teams"" and was marked as present but wrong position). Also, it cannot be C, R, N, M (excluded letters).
- Position 4: can be any letter except the excluded ones, but note that we don't have direct constraints yet.
- Position 5: cannot be S (because S was at position 5 in ""teams"" and marked as wrong position). Also, cannot be C, R, N, M.

Moreover, the word must contain T and S, but not at the positions we've already tried.

So T must be in position 4 or 5? But position 5 cannot be S, but T could be at position 5? However, we have two letters that must be placed: T and S.

We know T is in the word and not at position 1, and S is in the word and not at position 5.

Possible positions for T: position 4 or 5? But we have two positions left: 4 and 5.

Similarly, S must be in position 1 or 4? Because position 5 is excluded for S.

But note: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill, and we have two letters that must be included: T and S. So one of the positions will be filled by a new letter? Or could there be duplicate letters? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

Let me denote the positions:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is not C, R, N, M, and not T (because T was at 1 and was wrong). Also, it cannot be E or A (because they are fixed at 2 and 3). So position 1 must be a new letter or S? But S is allowed at position 1? Yes, because we haven't tried S at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: can be T? Or S? Or a new letter.

Position 5: can be T? Or a new letter? But not S.

We have two known letters to place: T and S. And one more letter that we don't know.

So the word must contain T and S, and one more letter (for the remaining position).

Possible cases:

Case 1: Position 1 is S, then position 4 and 5 must be T and a new letter? But we have two positions and two letters: T and one new. But note: if position 1 is S, then S is at position 1, which is allowed because we only know S is not at 5. Then position 4 and 5: one is T and the other is a new letter, say X.

But T cannot be at position 1, but it can be at 4 or 5. Similarly, S is at 1.

Case 2: Position 1 is not S, then it must be a new letter, say Y. Then we have to place T and S in positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be S, so S must be at position 4, and T at position 5? Or could T be at 4 and S at 5? But position 5 cannot be S, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, if position 1 is not S, then S must be at position 4, and T must be at position 5? Because position 5 is the only one left for T? But we have position 4 and 5: if S is at 4, then T must be at 5? Or if T is at 4, then S must be at 5? But S cannot be at 5. So the only possibility is S at 4 and T at 5.

But wait, we have three positions: 1, 4, 5. We have two known letters (T and S) and one unknown. So if position 1 is not S, then we must put S at 4 and T at 5? Then position 1 is a new letter.

Alternatively, if position 1 is S, then we put S at 1, and then T and a new letter at 4 and 5 (with T at 4 or 5).

So two main possibilities:

Option A: [S] E A [T] [X]  or [S] E A [X] [T]  (where X is a new letter)
Option B: [Y] E A [S] [T]  (where Y is a new letter, and S at 4, T at 5)

But note: in Option B, we have T at position 5. Is that allowed? We don't have any information that T cannot be at 5. Similarly, in Option A, T can be at 4 or 5.

However, we must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Option B: pattern [Y] E A [S] [T] -> _ E A S T

What words have the pattern _ E A S T?
- We can have: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N, M. So:
- BEAST: B is allowed (not excluded), and we haven't used B. Also, S and T are already known to be in the word. But note: in this word, S is at position 4 and T at 5. Also, we are testing B at position 1.

Similarly, FEAST: F is allowed.
LEAST: L is allowed.
YEAST: Y is allowed.

But we also have to consider if these words are valid.

Now, Option A: pattern [S] E A [T] [X] or [S] E A [X] [T]

For [S] E A [T] [X]: S E A T X -> e.g., words like ""SEATS"" (but that has two S's? S E A T S -> but then position 5 is S, which we know is not allowed? Because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, in this pattern, if we put T at 4, then position 5 must be a new letter, but not S. So the word would be S E A T X, where X is not S and not any excluded letter.

What words? ""SEATS"" is S E A T S -> invalid because of two S's and S at 5? Actually, ""seats"" has S at 1 and 5. But we know S cannot be at 5, so ""seats"" would be invalid because of the S at 5. Similarly, ""sweat"" is only 5 letters? S W E A T -> but that's 5 letters: S(1), W(2), E(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Our pattern requires position 3 to be A, so it must be S E A ... 

So for S E A T X: we need a word starting with ""SEAT"" and then one more letter. But ""SEAT"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word. Examples: ""SEATS"" (but S at 5, which is invalid) or ""SEATH"" (not common) or ""SEATO"" (not a common word). 

Alternatively, S E A X T: e.g., ""SEATT"" is not a word. ""SEATS"" again has S at 5. 

Actually, I can't think of a common word that starts with ""SEA"" and then T and then a letter that is not S. For example, ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but it has S at 5. So Option A might be less likely.

Therefore, Option B seems more promising: words ending with ""EAST"".

So let's list possible words for pattern _ E A S T:

- BEAST
- FEAST
- LEAST
- YEAST
- HEAST? (not a word)
- PEAST? (not common, but ""feast"" is common)

We must avoid C, R, N, M. So B, F, L, Y are all allowed.

Now, we also have to consider that we haven't used these letters.

But note: we have to test these words. However, we can make a guess that uses common letters and might help us distinguish.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 3. We can try to guess one of these if we are confident.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the possibilities without necessarily being one of these words, to get more information.

But the pattern is fixed: the word must be _ E A _ _ and must contain T and S. And from the pattern, if we assume that the word ends with ""ST"", then we have the above options.

But wait, we don't know that the word ends with ""ST"". We only know that S and T are in the word and must be placed in positions 1,4,5 with the constraints.

In Option B, we have [Y] E A [S] [T] -> so the word ends with ""ST"". But is that the only possibility? No, because Option A is also possible, but we had trouble finding words for Option A.

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, maybe S appears twice? But we haven't seen that.

But let's not assume. We can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

We know the pattern is [1] E A [4] [5]. We need to find what goes in 1,4,5.

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be T, C, R, N, M. It can be S or another letter.
- Position 4: can be any letter except C, R, N, M. It can be T, S, or another letter.
- Position 5: cannot be S, C, R, N, M. It can be T or another letter.

And the word must contain T and S.

We can try a word that has S at position 1 and T at position 4, for example, and a new letter at 5. But we need a valid word.

For example: ""SEATS"" is invalid because of S at 5. What about ""SETAE""? But that's S E T A E -> but the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

So pattern must be [1] E A [4] [5]. So if we put S at 1, then the word is S E A [4] [5]. We need to choose [4] and [5] such that it's a word and includes T.

For example:
- ""SEATS"": S E A T S -> but S at 5 is invalid (we know S is not at 5).
- ""SEATO"": not a common word.
- ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but invalid.

What about ""SEAZE""? Not a word.

So perhaps Option A is not feasible? Then the only possibility is Option B: the word ends with ""ST"", i.e., [Y] E A S T.

Therefore, the secret word is one of: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.

Now, we can try to guess one of these. But which one? We have to choose one that tests the first letter.

We can use a guess that includes multiple candidates? But we are limited to one word.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but helps us distinguish the possibilities.

But since we are at guess 3 and we have a strong pattern, we might guess one of the candidates.

To maximize information, we could choose a word that tests the first letter with a common letter.

But let's see the candidates: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST. The first letters are B, F, L, Y.

We haven't used any of these letters. We can try, for example, ""LEAST"" to test L.

But if we guess ""LEAST"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and the other letters.

But note: in ""LEAST"", the letters are L, E, A, S, T. We know E and A are correct at positions 2 and 3. S and T are at positions 4 and 5, which we believe are correct in this pattern.

But if we guess ""LEAST"" and it's not the word, we might get feedback that S and T are correct? Or not.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses a new set of letters to test the first position without committing to the ""ST"" ending.

For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] with [1] being a common letter, and [4] and [5] being new letters, but we must include T and S? How?

We know T and S must be in the word, so we have to include them in positions 1,4,5.

But if we put T at position 4 and S at position 1, we have the word ""S E A T [5]"". But we need a valid word with that pattern and [5] not being S. As before, we couldn't find one.

Similarly, if we put T at position 5 and S at position 4: [1] E A S T, which is the Option B we have.

So it seems we are forced into the pattern [1] E A S T.

Therefore, I think the secret word is one of the ""EAST"" words.

Now, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a common letter. For example, ""LEAST"" is a common word.

But let's see the frequency of the first letters: B, F, L, Y. L and B are more common than F and Y.

We can also consider ""HEAST"" is not a word, ""GEAST"" not a word, ""PEAST"" not common, ""WEAST"" not common. So the common ones are BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.

We can try ""LEAST"" because L is a common letter.

But note: we have not used L in previous guesses, so we don't know about L.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests L and also other letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

I think we should guess ""LEAST"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BEAST"" and we guess ""LEAST"": 
- L: not in the word (x)
- E: correct (✓)
- A: correct (✓)
- S: correct (✓) because in ""BEAST"", S is at position 4, and in ""LEAST"" it's also at 4? 
  - ""LEAST"": L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  - ""BEAST"": B(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  So if we guess ""LEAST"" and the secret is ""BEAST"", then:
  - L: x (not in secret)
  - E: ✓
  - A: ✓
  - S: ✓ (position 4 is correct)
  - T: ✓ (position 5 is correct)

But we would get four correct and one wrong, and we would know that the first letter is not L, so it must be B, F, or Y.

Similarly, if the secret is ""LEAST"", we get all correct.

But we are at guess 3, so we can afford to guess one of them.

To save a guess, we might guess a word that can test multiple first letters? But we can't because the pattern is fixed.

Another idea: guess a word that is not in this set but includes the letters B, F, L, Y to test which one is present? But we are constrained by the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] and we know [4] and [5] must be S and T? Not necessarily, but in this case, we think they are S and T.

But let's not jump to conclusions. We have to consider that there might be other possibilities.

For example, could the word be ""DEALT""? 
- Pattern: D E A L T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T. 
  This fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5]. 
  Now, does it contain T? Yes, at position 5. 
  Does it contain S? No. But we know from the feedback that S is in the word. 
  How do we know S is in the word? 
  From the second guess ""teams"": S was marked as present but wrong position. So S must be in the word. 
  Therefore, ""DEALT"" does not have S, so it cannot be the word.

Similarly, ""HELLO"" doesn't fit.

What about ""PEALS""? P E A L S -> but third letter is A? P(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). But S is at position 5, which is not allowed because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, invalid.

""TEALS"": T E A L S -> but T at position 1: in ""teams"", T was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so T cannot be at 1. Also, S at 5 is invalid.

""MEALS"": M is excluded.

So indeed, the only possibilities are the words ending with ""ST"" for positions 4 and 5: S at 4 and T at 5.

Therefore, the word must be [1] E A S T.

So we can guess one of them. I'll go with ""LEAST"" because it's a common word.

But to be thorough, let's list all common words: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.

We can also consider ""WEAST"" (not common) or ""FEAST"" is common.

I think ""LEAST"" is a good guess.

So next guess: ""LEAST""

But note: if we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us the first letter is not L, and then we can guess among the others.

We have 4 tries left after this, so it's safe.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LEAST"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and N are not in the word (x). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
- **Guess 2 (teams)**: T is in the word but not in position 1 (-). E is in the correct position (✓, position 2). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). M is not in the word (x). S is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **? E A ? ?** (positions 2 and 3 are E and A, respectively).
- The word **must contain T and S**, but:
  - T cannot be in position 1 (from ""teams"" feedback).
  - S cannot be in position 5 (from ""teams"" feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, M (from both guesses).
- E is confirmed at position 2, and A at position 3.

### Deductions:
- **Positions 1, 4, and 5** need to be filled with valid letters, including T and S.
- Since S cannot be in position 5, and T cannot be in position 1, the only feasible pattern that fits common English words is **? E A S T** (S in position 4, T in position 5). This is because:
  - If S were in position 1, no common 5-letter words exist with the pattern ""S E A ? ?"" that include T and avoid S in position 5 (e.g., ""seats"" is invalid due to S in position 5).
  - Thus, S must be in position 4, and T must be in position 5.
- The only unknown is position 1, which must be a letter not excluded (not C, R, N, M) and not E, A, T, or S. Common options are B, F, L, or Y (e.g., BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the pattern **? E A S T** by guessing a common word like **LEAST**.
  - L is a high-frequency consonant not yet tested.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on L (and confirmation of S/T positions) will narrow down the options (e.g., if L is absent, the word is likely BEAST, FEAST, or YEAST).",Guess 3: least -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is A (because A is in the correct position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in the fifth position in ""crane"" and is marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

Also, the word contains the letter E, but not at the end. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid using the letters C, R, and N in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'A' as the third letter.
- Includes the letter 'E' (but not in the fifth position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The word must have the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It must contain an 'E' that is not at the end (so positions 1, 2, or 4).

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ A _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E A _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ A E _

We also want to test other common consonants to get more information.

Let's consider some words:

Option 1: Start with E in position 1.
- Example: ""EATER"" -> but we know A is in position 3, so if we put E at position 1, then the word would be E _ A _ _. But ""EATER"" has E at 1, A at 3, T at 2, E at 4, R at 5. But R is excluded (we cannot use R). So not valid.

We must avoid R, so words with R are out.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E A _ _
- Example: ""LEAST"" -> L E A S T. But we have S and T which are new. Also, note that in the feedback, E was marked as present but not in position 5, so it could be in position 2. However, we must avoid using N (which is not in ""least"") and R (also not in ""least""). So this is a candidate.

But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" had E as present, so we must include E in our next guess? Actually, we should because we know E is in the word and we want to find its position.

But note: the feedback does not require us to use E again? Actually, we can choose not to, but it would be inefficient because we know E is in the word and we need to find where. So we should include E and try it in a different position.

In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So in the next guess, we should try E in a different position (1, 2, or 4).

But we also have the constraint that the third letter is A.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include E and avoid C, R, N.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

With E in position 1: 
- ""EAGLE"" -> E A G L E -> but the third letter is G, not A? Wait, no: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:G -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

So for E in position 1: the word would be E _ A _ _
Examples: 
- ""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but second letter is A? Then third would be T? No: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:T -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Actually, we need the third letter to be A, so the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So if we put E at position 1, then the word is E [2] A [4] [5]. The second letter can be any letter (except C, R, N) and the fourth and fifth as well.

So let's try to find words with pattern E _ A _ _ 
But note: the second letter must not be A? It can be, but we don't know. Actually, we don't have any information about the second letter yet.

Example words: 
- ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E. This avoids C, R, N. And it has E at position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (from the feedback of ""crane"": E was at 5 and marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So if we use ""ELATE"", we are putting E at 5 again, which we know is not correct. But that's okay because we are testing other positions. However, we are also testing E at position 1.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our next guess, we don't have to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

So for pattern E _ A _ _ (E at 1) and then the fifth letter is not E. Example: 
- ""EXAMS"" -> but we have X and M, and S. But ""exams"" is a word? Yes. But let's see: E X A M S. This avoids C, R, N. And E is at 1, and the fifth is S (not E). So that's a candidate.

But is ""exams"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""EBAY"" -> not 5 letters. 

""ELANS"" -> but N is excluded. So no.

""EVADE"": E V A D E -> but then E is at 5 again, which we know is not the position. So avoid.

""EDGES"": E D G E S -> but the third letter is G, not A? No, we need the third letter to be A. So pattern: E _ A _ _ -> so the third letter is A. So ""EDGES"" is E D G E S -> third letter is G, so not matching.

So let me think: we need the word to have the third letter A. So for E at position 1, the word must be: E [letter] A [letter] [letter]. And the last letter should not be E (to avoid the known wrong position). 

Examples:
- ""EXALT"": E X A L T -> avoids C, R, N. And no E at the end. So that's a candidate.

Similarly, with E at position 2: pattern _ E A _ _
Examples: 
- ""STEAL"": S T E A L -> but the third letter is E? Then the pattern would be S T E A L -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't work. 

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is [1][2]A[4][5]. If we want E at position 2, then the word is [1] E A [4] [5]. 

So examples: 
- ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. Avoids C, R, N. And E is at position 2. This is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TEAMS"": T E A M S -> same pattern.

Or ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> but D and S.

With E at position 4: pattern _ _ A E _
Examples: 
- ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but E is at position 5? Actually, the pattern would be [1][2]A[4][5] and we want E at position 4: so [1][2]A E [5]. 
Example: ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we want the fifth letter not to be E? Actually, we can have E at position 4 and the fifth can be anything. But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, that's fine.

But in ""SHADE"", the E is at position 5? Let me check: 
- S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So E is at 5. We don't want that because we know E is not at 5. So we need a word with pattern [1][2]A E [5] and [5] is not E. 

Example: ""SHAPE"": S H A P E -> again E at 5. 
""GRACE"": but G and R -> R is excluded.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> E at 5 again.

It's hard to find a word with E at position 4 and not at 5? Actually, the fifth letter can be any letter except E? But we don't have to avoid E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 again? But we know it's not there, so it's a wasted opportunity. So better to avoid.

Therefore, let's focus on E at position 1 or 2.

Candidates:
1. E _ A _ _ with no E at 5: e.g., ""EXALT"" (E X A L T)
2. _ E A _ _ : e.g., ""SEAMS"" (S E A M S), ""TEAMS"" (T E A M S), ""BEADS"" (B E A D S), ""HEADS"" (H E A D S), etc.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We should avoid C, R, N. So available letters: we can use common letters like S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.

In ""EXALT"": letters E, X, A, L, T. We already know A and E are in the word. So we are testing X, L, T. X is not very common.

In ""SEAMS"": S, E, A, M, S. We are testing S and M. But S appears twice? Actually, it's two S's? The word ""seams"" has two S's? S-E-A-M-S: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. So two S's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one S, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TEAMS"": T, E, A, M, S. All distinct letters. This tests T, E, A, M, S. We know E and A are in the word, so we are testing T, M, S.

Similarly, ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S. Distinct letters, tests B, D, S.

Another candidate: ""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S.

We can also consider ""LEADS"": but L, E, A, D, S. But we haven't used L.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. So it's okay to have duplicates? But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.

So let's choose a word with distinct new letters and that includes E in a new position (either 1 or 2) and avoids C, R, N.

I think ""TEAMS"" is a good candidate: 
- T is a common letter, E at position 2 (which we haven't tried), A at 3 (known), M and S are common.

Another option: ""BEADS"" (B, E, A, D, S) or ""HEADS"" (H, E, A, D, S). But H is less common than T.

We could also consider ""STEAM"": but pattern? S T E A M -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:M -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn't fit. We must have A at position 3.

So ""STEAM"" is not valid because the third letter is E, not A.

Therefore, I think ""TEAMS"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""TEAMS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So I'll go with ""TEAMS"".

Alternatively, ""SEAMS"" is also valid, but it has two S's. So ""TEAMS"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Therefore, next guess: ""TEAMS""

But note: we are also testing the position of E. In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x.

We are also testing T at position 1, M at position 4, and S at position 5.

So let's proceed with ""TEAMS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).
- A is in the correct position (third letter, marked as ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked as -).

The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _, and it contains the letter E (which must be in position 1, 2, or 4). For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include E in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""teams"" fits well:
- It has A as the third letter (matching the known position).
- It places E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It uses new letters (T, M, S) that haven't been tried yet, maximizing information gain.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: teams -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Guess 2: ""teams""
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is E)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A, which we already knew)
- M: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. The secret word has the form: _ E A _ _ 
   (because from ""teams"", E is correct at position 2 and A at position 3).

2. The word contains the letters:
   - E (at position 2)
   - A (at position 3)
   - T (somewhere, but not at position 1, because in ""teams"" it was at position 1 and marked as wrong position)
   - S (somewhere, but not at position 5, because in ""teams"" it was at position 5 and marked as wrong position)

3. Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
   - E is in the word (and now we know it's at position 2, so that's confirmed).
   - The word does not contain C, R, N, or M.

4. The word must have 5 letters, so we have the pattern: [1] E A [4] [5]

We know that T is in the word but not at position 1, and S is in the word but not at position 5.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, S. We must avoid C, R, N, M.

Available letters: we can use other common letters like B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5], with the constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be T (because T was at position 1 in ""teams"" and was marked as present but wrong position). Also, it cannot be C, R, N, M (excluded letters).
- Position 4: can be any letter except the excluded ones, but note that we don't have direct constraints yet.
- Position 5: cannot be S (because S was at position 5 in ""teams"" and marked as wrong position). Also, cannot be C, R, N, M.

Moreover, the word must contain T and S, but not at the positions we've already tried.

So T must be in position 4 or 5? But position 5 cannot be S, but T could be at position 5? However, we have two letters that must be placed: T and S.

We know T is in the word and not at position 1, and S is in the word and not at position 5.

Possible positions for T: position 4 or 5? But we have two positions left: 4 and 5.

Similarly, S must be in position 1 or 4? Because position 5 is excluded for S.

But note: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill, and we have two letters that must be included: T and S. So one of the positions will be filled by a new letter? Or could there be duplicate letters? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

Let me denote the positions:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is not C, R, N, M, and not T (because T was at 1 and was wrong). Also, it cannot be E or A (because they are fixed at 2 and 3). So position 1 must be a new letter or S? But S is allowed at position 1? Yes, because we haven't tried S at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: can be T? Or S? Or a new letter.

Position 5: can be T? Or a new letter? But not S.

We have two known letters to place: T and S. And one more letter that we don't know.

So the word must contain T and S, and one more letter (for the remaining position).

Possible cases:

Case 1: Position 1 is S, then position 4 and 5 must be T and a new letter? But we have two positions and two letters: T and one new. But note: if position 1 is S, then S is at position 1, which is allowed because we only know S is not at 5. Then position 4 and 5: one is T and the other is a new letter, say X.

But T cannot be at position 1, but it can be at 4 or 5. Similarly, S is at 1.

Case 2: Position 1 is not S, then it must be a new letter, say Y. Then we have to place T and S in positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be S, so S must be at position 4, and T at position 5? Or could T be at 4 and S at 5? But position 5 cannot be S, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, if position 1 is not S, then S must be at position 4, and T must be at position 5? Because position 5 is the only one left for T? But we have position 4 and 5: if S is at 4, then T must be at 5? Or if T is at 4, then S must be at 5? But S cannot be at 5. So the only possibility is S at 4 and T at 5.

But wait, we have three positions: 1, 4, 5. We have two known letters (T and S) and one unknown. So if position 1 is not S, then we must put S at 4 and T at 5? Then position 1 is a new letter.

Alternatively, if position 1 is S, then we put S at 1, and then T and a new letter at 4 and 5 (with T at 4 or 5).

So two main possibilities:

Option A: [S] E A [T] [X]  or [S] E A [X] [T]  (where X is a new letter)
Option B: [Y] E A [S] [T]  (where Y is a new letter, and S at 4, T at 5)

But note: in Option B, we have T at position 5. Is that allowed? We don't have any information that T cannot be at 5. Similarly, in Option A, T can be at 4 or 5.

However, we must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, Option B: pattern [Y] E A [S] [T] -> _ E A S T

What words have the pattern _ E A S T?
- We can have: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N, M. So:
- BEAST: B is allowed (not excluded), and we haven't used B. Also, S and T are already known to be in the word. But note: in this word, S is at position 4 and T at 5. Also, we are testing B at position 1.

Similarly, FEAST: F is allowed.
LEAST: L is allowed.
YEAST: Y is allowed.

But we also have to consider if these words are valid.

Now, Option A: pattern [S] E A [T] [X] or [S] E A [X] [T]

For [S] E A [T] [X]: S E A T X -> e.g., words like ""SEATS"" (but that has two S's? S E A T S -> but then position 5 is S, which we know is not allowed? Because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, in this pattern, if we put T at 4, then position 5 must be a new letter, but not S. So the word would be S E A T X, where X is not S and not any excluded letter.

What words? ""SEATS"" is S E A T S -> invalid because of two S's and S at 5? Actually, ""seats"" has S at 1 and 5. But we know S cannot be at 5, so ""seats"" would be invalid because of the S at 5. Similarly, ""sweat"" is only 5 letters? S W E A T -> but that's 5 letters: S(1), W(2), E(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that's not matching. Our pattern requires position 3 to be A, so it must be S E A ... 

So for S E A T X: we need a word starting with ""SEAT"" and then one more letter. But ""SEAT"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word. Examples: ""SEATS"" (but S at 5, which is invalid) or ""SEATH"" (not common) or ""SEATO"" (not a common word). 

Alternatively, S E A X T: e.g., ""SEATT"" is not a word. ""SEATS"" again has S at 5. 

Actually, I can't think of a common word that starts with ""SEA"" and then T and then a letter that is not S. For example, ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but it has S at 5. So Option A might be less likely.

Therefore, Option B seems more promising: words ending with ""EAST"".

So let's list possible words for pattern _ E A S T:

- BEAST
- FEAST
- LEAST
- YEAST
- HEAST? (not a word)
- PEAST? (not common, but ""feast"" is common)

We must avoid C, R, N, M. So B, F, L, Y are all allowed.

Now, we also have to consider that we haven't used these letters.

But note: we have to test these words. However, we can make a guess that uses common letters and might help us distinguish.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 3. We can try to guess one of these if we are confident.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the possibilities without necessarily being one of these words, to get more information.

But the pattern is fixed: the word must be _ E A _ _ and must contain T and S. And from the pattern, if we assume that the word ends with ""ST"", then we have the above options.

But wait, we don't know that the word ends with ""ST"". We only know that S and T are in the word and must be placed in positions 1,4,5 with the constraints.

In Option B, we have [Y] E A [S] [T] -> so the word ends with ""ST"". But is that the only possibility? No, because Option A is also possible, but we had trouble finding words for Option A.

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, maybe S appears twice? But we haven't seen that.

But let's not assume. We can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

We know the pattern is [1] E A [4] [5]. We need to find what goes in 1,4,5.

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be T, C, R, N, M. It can be S or another letter.
- Position 4: can be any letter except C, R, N, M. It can be T, S, or another letter.
- Position 5: cannot be S, C, R, N, M. It can be T or another letter.

And the word must contain T and S.

We can try a word that has S at position 1 and T at position 4, for example, and a new letter at 5. But we need a valid word.

For example: ""SEATS"" is invalid because of S at 5. What about ""SETAE""? But that's S E T A E -> but the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

So pattern must be [1] E A [4] [5]. So if we put S at 1, then the word is S E A [4] [5]. We need to choose [4] and [5] such that it's a word and includes T.

For example:
- ""SEATS"": S E A T S -> but S at 5 is invalid (we know S is not at 5).
- ""SEATO"": not a common word.
- ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but invalid.

What about ""SEAZE""? Not a word.

So perhaps Option A is not feasible? Then the only possibility is Option B: the word ends with ""ST"", i.e., [Y] E A S T.

Therefore, the secret word is one of: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.

Now, we can try to guess one of these. But which one? We have to choose one that tests the first letter.

We can use a guess that includes multiple candidates? But we are limited to one word.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but helps us distinguish the possibilities.

But since we are at guess 3 and we have a strong pattern, we might guess one of the candidates.

To maximize information, we could choose a word that tests the first letter with a common letter.

But let's see the candidates: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST. The first letters are B, F, L, Y.

We haven't used any of these letters. We can try, for example, ""LEAST"" to test L.

But if we guess ""LEAST"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and the other letters.

But note: in ""LEAST"", the letters are L, E, A, S, T. We know E and A are correct at positions 2 and 3. S and T are at positions 4 and 5, which we believe are correct in this pattern.

But if we guess ""LEAST"" and it's not the word, we might get feedback that S and T are correct? Or not.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses a new set of letters to test the first position without committing to the ""ST"" ending.

For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] with [1] being a common letter, and [4] and [5] being new letters, but we must include T and S? How?

We know T and S must be in the word, so we have to include them in positions 1,4,5.

But if we put T at position 4 and S at position 1, we have the word ""S E A T [5]"". But we need a valid word with that pattern and [5] not being S. As before, we couldn't find one.

Similarly, if we put T at position 5 and S at position 4: [1] E A S T, which is the Option B we have.

So it seems we are forced into the pattern [1] E A S T.

Therefore, I think the secret word is one of the ""EAST"" words.

Now, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a common letter. For example, ""LEAST"" is a common word.

But let's see the frequency of the first letters: B, F, L, Y. L and B are more common than F and Y.

We can also consider ""HEAST"" is not a word, ""GEAST"" not a word, ""PEAST"" not common, ""WEAST"" not common. So the common ones are BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.

We can try ""LEAST"" because L is a common letter.

But note: we have not used L in previous guesses, so we don't know about L.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests L and also other letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

I think we should guess ""LEAST"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BEAST"" and we guess ""LEAST"": 
- L: not in the word (x)
- E: correct (✓)
- A: correct (✓)
- S: correct (✓) because in ""BEAST"", S is at position 4, and in ""LEAST"" it's also at 4? 
  - ""LEAST"": L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  - ""BEAST"": B(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  So if we guess ""LEAST"" and the secret is ""BEAST"", then:
  - L: x (not in secret)
  - E: ✓
  - A: ✓
  - S: ✓ (position 4 is correct)
  - T: ✓ (position 5 is correct)

But we would get four correct and one wrong, and we would know that the first letter is not L, so it must be B, F, or Y.

Similarly, if the secret is ""LEAST"", we get all correct.

But we are at guess 3, so we can afford to guess one of them.

To save a guess, we might guess a word that can test multiple first letters? But we can't because the pattern is fixed.

Another idea: guess a word that is not in this set but includes the letters B, F, L, Y to test which one is present? But we are constrained by the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] and we know [4] and [5] must be S and T? Not necessarily, but in this case, we think they are S and T.

But let's not jump to conclusions. We have to consider that there might be other possibilities.

For example, could the word be ""DEALT""? 
- Pattern: D E A L T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T. 
  This fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5]. 
  Now, does it contain T? Yes, at position 5. 
  Does it contain S? No. But we know from the feedback that S is in the word. 
  How do we know S is in the word? 
  From the second guess ""teams"": S was marked as present but wrong position. So S must be in the word. 
  Therefore, ""DEALT"" does not have S, so it cannot be the word.

Similarly, ""HELLO"" doesn't fit.

What about ""PEALS""? P E A L S -> but third letter is A? P(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). But S is at position 5, which is not allowed because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, invalid.

""TEALS"": T E A L S -> but T at position 1: in ""teams"", T was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so T cannot be at 1. Also, S at 5 is invalid.

""MEALS"": M is excluded.

So indeed, the only possibilities are the words ending with ""ST"" for positions 4 and 5: S at 4 and T at 5.

Therefore, the word must be [1] E A S T.

So we can guess one of them. I'll go with ""LEAST"" because it's a common word.

But to be thorough, let's list all common words: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.

We can also consider ""WEAST"" (not common) or ""FEAST"" is common.

I think ""LEAST"" is a good guess.

So next guess: ""LEAST""

But note: if we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us the first letter is not L, and then we can guess among the others.

We have 4 tries left after this, so it's safe.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LEAST"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and N are not in the word (x). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
- **Guess 2 (teams)**: T is in the word but not in position 1 (-). E is in the correct position (✓, position 2). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). M is not in the word (x). S is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **? E A ? ?** (positions 2 and 3 are E and A, respectively).
- The word **must contain T and S**, but:
  - T cannot be in position 1 (from ""teams"" feedback).
  - S cannot be in position 5 (from ""teams"" feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, M (from both guesses).
- E is confirmed at position 2, and A at position 3.

### Deductions:
- **Positions 1, 4, and 5** need to be filled with valid letters, including T and S.
- Since S cannot be in position 5, and T cannot be in position 1, the only feasible pattern that fits common English words is **? E A S T** (S in position 4, T in position 5). This is because:
  - If S were in position 1, no common 5-letter words exist with the pattern ""S E A ? ?"" that include T and avoid S in position 5 (e.g., ""seats"" is invalid due to S in position 5).
  - Thus, S must be in position 4, and T must be in position 5.
- The only unknown is position 1, which must be a letter not excluded (not C, R, N, M) and not E, A, T, or S. Common options are B, F, L, or Y (e.g., BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the pattern **? E A S T** by guessing a common word like **LEAST**.
  - L is a high-frequency consonant not yet tested.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on L (and confirmation of S/T positions) will narrow down the options (e.g., if L is absent, the word is likely BEAST, FEAST, or YEAST).

This avoids C, R, N. And it has E at position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (from the feedback of ""crane"": E was at 5 and marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So if we use ""ELATE"", we are putting E at 5 again, which we know is not correct. But that\'s okay because we are testing other positions. However, we are also testing E at position 1.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our next guess, we don\'t have to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can put E at position 5 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it\'s not there. So it\'s better to try E in a new position.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nSo for pattern E _ A _ _ (E at 1) and then the fifth letter is not E. Example: \n- ""EXAMS"" -> but we have X and M, and S. But ""exams"" is a word? Yes. But let\'s see: E X A M S. This avoids C, R, N. And E is at 1, and the fifth is S (not E). So that\'s a candidate.\n\nBut is ""exams"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""EBAY"" -> not 5 letters. \n\n""ELANS"" -> but N is excluded. So no.\n\n""EVADE"": E V A D E -> but then E is at 5 again, which we know is not the position. So avoid.\n\n""EDGES"": E D G E S -> but the third letter is G, not A? No, we need the third letter to be A. So pattern: E _ A _ _ -> so the third letter is A. So ""EDGES"" is E D G E S -> third letter is G, so not matching.\n\nSo let me think: we need the word to have the third letter A. So for E at position 1, the word must be: E [letter] A [letter] [letter]. And the last letter should not be E (to avoid the known wrong position). \n\nExamples:\n- ""EXALT"": E X A L T -> avoids C, R, N. And no E at the end. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, with E at position 2: pattern _ E A _ _\nExamples: \n- ""STEAL"": S T E A L -> but the third letter is E? Then the pattern would be S T E A L -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn\'t work. \n\nWait, we need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is [1][2]A[4][5]. If we want E at position 2, then the word is [1] E A [4] [5]. \n\nSo examples: \n- ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. Avoids C, R, N. And E is at position 2. This is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""TEAMS"": T E A M S -> same pattern.\n\nOr ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> but D and S.\n\nWith E at position 4: pattern _ _ A E _\nExamples: \n- ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but E is at position 5? Actually, the pattern would be [1][2]A[4][5] and we want E at position 4: so [1][2]A E [5]. \nExample: ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we want the fifth letter not to be E? Actually, we can have E at position 4 and the fifth can be anything. But we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, that\'s fine.\n\nBut in ""SHADE"", the E is at position 5? Let me check: \n- S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So E is at 5. We don\'t want that because we know E is not at 5. So we need a word with pattern [1][2]A E [5] and [5] is not E. \n\nExample: ""SHAPE"": S H A P E -> again E at 5. \n""GRACE"": but G and R -> R is excluded.\n\n""BLAME"": B L A M E -> E at 5 again.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with E at position 4 and not at 5? Actually, the fifth letter can be any letter except E? But we don\'t have to avoid E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 again? But we know it\'s not there, so it\'s a wasted opportunity. So better to avoid.\n\nTherefore, let\'s focus on E at position 1 or 2.\n\nCandidates:\n1. E _ A _ _ with no E at 5: e.g., ""EXALT"" (E X A L T)\n2. _ E A _ _ : e.g., ""SEAMS"" (S E A M S), ""TEAMS"" (T E A M S), ""BEADS"" (B E A D S), ""HEADS"" (H E A D S), etc.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We should avoid C, R, N. So available letters: we can use common letters like S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.\n\nIn ""EXALT"": letters E, X, A, L, T. We already know A and E are in the word. So we are testing X, L, T. X is not very common.\n\nIn ""SEAMS"": S, E, A, M, S. We are testing S and M. But S appears twice? Actually, it\'s two S\'s? The word ""seams"" has two S\'s? S-E-A-M-S: positions 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:M, 5:S. So two S\'s. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one S, we might get confusing feedback. But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""TEAMS"": T, E, A, M, S. All distinct letters. This tests T, E, A, M, S. We know E and A are in the word, so we are testing T, M, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S. Distinct letters, tests B, D, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S.\n\nWe can also consider ""LEADS"": but L, E, A, D, S. But we haven\'t used L.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. So it\'s okay to have duplicates? But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with distinct new letters and that includes E in a new position (either 1 or 2) and avoids C, R, N.\n\nI think ""TEAMS"" is a good candidate: \n- T is a common letter, E at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried), A at 3 (known), M and S are common.\n\nAnother option: ""BEADS"" (B, E, A, D, S) or ""HEADS"" (H, E, A, D, S). But H is less common than T.\n\nWe could also consider ""STEAM"": but pattern? S T E A M -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:M -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that doesn\'t fit. We must have A at position 3.\n\nSo ""STEAM"" is not valid because the third letter is E, not A.\n\nTherefore, I think ""TEAMS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""TEAMS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TEAMS"".\n\nAlternatively, ""SEAMS"" is also valid, but it has two S\'s. So ""TEAMS"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""TEAMS""\n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of E. In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we\'ll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x.\n\nWe are also testing T at position 1, M at position 4, and S at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s proceed with ""TEAMS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).\n- A is in the correct position (third letter, marked as ✓).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked as -).\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _, and it contains the letter E (which must be in position 1, 2, or 4). For the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, or N.\n- Include E in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""teams"" fits well:\n- It has A as the third letter (matching the known position).\n- It places E in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- It uses new letters (T, M, S) that haven\'t been tried yet, maximizing information gain.\n- It avoids C, R, and N.\n\n<guess>teams</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: teams -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nGuess 2: ""teams""\n- T: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is E)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A, which we already knew)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- S: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nNow, let\'s summarize what we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the form: _ E A _ _ \n   (because from ""teams"", E is correct at position 2 and A at position 3).\n\n2. The word contains the letters:\n   - E (at position 2)\n   - A (at position 3)\n   - T (somewhere, but not at position 1, because in ""teams"" it was at position 1 and marked as wrong position)\n   - S (somewhere, but not at position 5, because in ""teams"" it was at position 5 and marked as wrong position)\n\n3. Additionally, from the first guess, we know:\n   - E is in the word (and now we know it\'s at position 2, so that\'s confirmed).\n   - The word does not contain C, R, N, or M.\n\n4. The word must have 5 letters, so we have the pattern: [1] E A [4] [5]\n\nWe know that T is in the word but not at position 1, and S is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nAlso, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, S. We must avoid C, R, N, M.\n\nAvailable letters: we can use other common letters like B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5], with the constraints:\n- Position 1: cannot be T (because T was at position 1 in ""teams"" and was marked as present but wrong position). Also, it cannot be C, R, N, M (excluded letters).\n- Position 4: can be any letter except the excluded ones, but note that we don\'t have direct constraints yet.\n- Position 5: cannot be S (because S was at position 5 in ""teams"" and marked as wrong position). Also, cannot be C, R, N, M.\n\nMoreover, the word must contain T and S, but not at the positions we\'ve already tried.\n\nSo T must be in position 4 or 5? But position 5 cannot be S, but T could be at position 5? However, we have two letters that must be placed: T and S.\n\nWe know T is in the word and not at position 1, and S is in the word and not at position 5.\n\nPossible positions for T: position 4 or 5? But we have two positions left: 4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, S must be in position 1 or 4? Because position 5 is excluded for S.\n\nBut note: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill, and we have two letters that must be included: T and S. So one of the positions will be filled by a new letter? Or could there be duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but we haven\'t seen duplicates so far.\n\nLet me denote the positions:\n- Position 1: must be a letter that is not C, R, N, M, and not T (because T was at 1 and was wrong). Also, it cannot be E or A (because they are fixed at 2 and 3). So position 1 must be a new letter or S? But S is allowed at position 1? Yes, because we haven\'t tried S at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: can be T? Or S? Or a new letter.\n\nPosition 5: can be T? Or a new letter? But not S.\n\nWe have two known letters to place: T and S. And one more letter that we don\'t know.\n\nSo the word must contain T and S, and one more letter (for the remaining position).\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: Position 1 is S, then position 4 and 5 must be T and a new letter? But we have two positions and two letters: T and one new. But note: if position 1 is S, then S is at position 1, which is allowed because we only know S is not at 5. Then position 4 and 5: one is T and the other is a new letter, say X.\n\nBut T cannot be at position 1, but it can be at 4 or 5. Similarly, S is at 1.\n\nCase 2: Position 1 is not S, then it must be a new letter, say Y. Then we have to place T and S in positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be S, so S must be at position 4, and T at position 5? Or could T be at 4 and S at 5? But position 5 cannot be S, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, if position 1 is not S, then S must be at position 4, and T must be at position 5? Because position 5 is the only one left for T? But we have position 4 and 5: if S is at 4, then T must be at 5? Or if T is at 4, then S must be at 5? But S cannot be at 5. So the only possibility is S at 4 and T at 5.\n\nBut wait, we have three positions: 1, 4, 5. We have two known letters (T and S) and one unknown. So if position 1 is not S, then we must put S at 4 and T at 5? Then position 1 is a new letter.\n\nAlternatively, if position 1 is S, then we put S at 1, and then T and a new letter at 4 and 5 (with T at 4 or 5).\n\nSo two main possibilities:\n\nOption A: [S] E A [T] [X]  or [S] E A [X] [T]  (where X is a new letter)\nOption B: [Y] E A [S] [T]  (where Y is a new letter, and S at 4, T at 5)\n\nBut note: in Option B, we have T at position 5. Is that allowed? We don\'t have any information that T cannot be at 5. Similarly, in Option A, T can be at 4 or 5.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, Option B: pattern [Y] E A [S] [T] -> _ E A S T\n\nWhat words have the pattern _ E A S T?\n- We can have: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid C, R, N, M. So:\n- BEAST: B is allowed (not excluded), and we haven\'t used B. Also, S and T are already known to be in the word. But note: in this word, S is at position 4 and T at 5. Also, we are testing B at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, FEAST: F is allowed.\nLEAST: L is allowed.\nYEAST: Y is allowed.\n\nBut we also have to consider if these words are valid.\n\nNow, Option A: pattern [S] E A [T] [X] or [S] E A [X] [T]\n\nFor [S] E A [T] [X]: S E A T X -> e.g., words like ""SEATS"" (but that has two S\'s? S E A T S -> but then position 5 is S, which we know is not allowed? Because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, in this pattern, if we put T at 4, then position 5 must be a new letter, but not S. So the word would be S E A T X, where X is not S and not any excluded letter.\n\nWhat words? ""SEATS"" is S E A T S -> invalid because of two S\'s and S at 5? Actually, ""seats"" has S at 1 and 5. But we know S cannot be at 5, so ""seats"" would be invalid because of the S at 5. Similarly, ""sweat"" is only 5 letters? S W E A T -> but that\'s 5 letters: S(1), W(2), E(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need the third letter to be A, so that\'s not matching. Our pattern requires position 3 to be A, so it must be S E A ... \n\nSo for S E A T X: we need a word starting with ""SEAT"" and then one more letter. But ""SEAT"" is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word. Examples: ""SEATS"" (but S at 5, which is invalid) or ""SEATH"" (not common) or ""SEATO"" (not a common word). \n\nAlternatively, S E A X T: e.g., ""SEATT"" is not a word. ""SEATS"" again has S at 5. \n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word that starts with ""SEA"" and then T and then a letter that is not S. For example, ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but it has S at 5. So Option A might be less likely.\n\nTherefore, Option B seems more promising: words ending with ""EAST"".\n\nSo let\'s list possible words for pattern _ E A S T:\n\n- BEAST\n- FEAST\n- LEAST\n- YEAST\n- HEAST? (not a word)\n- PEAST? (not common, but ""feast"" is common)\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, M. So B, F, L, Y are all allowed.\n\nNow, we also have to consider that we haven\'t used these letters.\n\nBut note: we have to test these words. However, we can make a guess that uses common letters and might help us distinguish.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 3. We can try to guess one of these if we are confident.\n\nAlternatively, we can make a guess that tests the possibilities without necessarily being one of these words, to get more information.\n\nBut the pattern is fixed: the word must be _ E A _ _ and must contain T and S. And from the pattern, if we assume that the word ends with ""ST"", then we have the above options.\n\nBut wait, we don\'t know that the word ends with ""ST"". We only know that S and T are in the word and must be placed in positions 1,4,5 with the constraints.\n\nIn Option B, we have [Y] E A [S] [T] -> so the word ends with ""ST"". But is that the only possibility? No, because Option A is also possible, but we had trouble finding words for Option A.\n\nAnother possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, maybe S appears twice? But we haven\'t seen that.\n\nBut let\'s not assume. We can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.\n\nWe know the pattern is [1] E A [4] [5]. We need to find what goes in 1,4,5.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: cannot be T, C, R, N, M. It can be S or another letter.\n- Position 4: can be any letter except C, R, N, M. It can be T, S, or another letter.\n- Position 5: cannot be S, C, R, N, M. It can be T or another letter.\n\nAnd the word must contain T and S.\n\nWe can try a word that has S at position 1 and T at position 4, for example, and a new letter at 5. But we need a valid word.\n\nFor example: ""SEATS"" is invalid because of S at 5. What about ""SETAE""? But that\'s S E T A E -> but the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.\n\nSo pattern must be [1] E A [4] [5]. So if we put S at 1, then the word is S E A [4] [5]. We need to choose [4] and [5] such that it\'s a word and includes T.\n\nFor example:\n- ""SEATS"": S E A T S -> but S at 5 is invalid (we know S is not at 5).\n- ""SEATO"": not a common word.\n- ""SEATS"" is the only common one, but invalid.\n\nWhat about ""SEAZE""? Not a word.\n\nSo perhaps Option A is not feasible? Then the only possibility is Option B: the word ends with ""ST"", i.e., [Y] E A S T.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is one of: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST, etc.\n\nNow, we can try to guess one of these. But which one? We have to choose one that tests the first letter.\n\nWe can use a guess that includes multiple candidates? But we are limited to one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but helps us distinguish the possibilities.\n\nBut since we are at guess 3 and we have a strong pattern, we might guess one of the candidates.\n\nTo maximize information, we could choose a word that tests the first letter with a common letter.\n\nBut let\'s see the candidates: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST. The first letters are B, F, L, Y.\n\nWe haven\'t used any of these letters. We can try, for example, ""LEAST"" to test L.\n\nBut if we guess ""LEAST"", and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and the other letters.\n\nBut note: in ""LEAST"", the letters are L, E, A, S, T. We know E and A are correct at positions 2 and 3. S and T are at positions 4 and 5, which we believe are correct in this pattern.\n\nBut if we guess ""LEAST"" and it\'s not the word, we might get feedback that S and T are correct? Or not.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses a new set of letters to test the first position without committing to the ""ST"" ending.\n\nFor example, we can guess a word that has the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] with [1] being a common letter, and [4] and [5] being new letters, but we must include T and S? How?\n\nWe know T and S must be in the word, so we have to include them in positions 1,4,5.\n\nBut if we put T at position 4 and S at position 1, we have the word ""S E A T [5]"". But we need a valid word with that pattern and [5] not being S. As before, we couldn\'t find one.\n\nSimilarly, if we put T at position 5 and S at position 4: [1] E A S T, which is the Option B we have.\n\nSo it seems we are forced into the pattern [1] E A S T.\n\nTherefore, I think the secret word is one of the ""EAST"" words.\n\nNow, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a common letter. For example, ""LEAST"" is a common word.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of the first letters: B, F, L, Y. L and B are more common than F and Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""HEAST"" is not a word, ""GEAST"" not a word, ""PEAST"" not common, ""WEAST"" not common. So the common ones are BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.\n\nWe can try ""LEAST"" because L is a common letter.\n\nBut note: we have not used L in previous guesses, so we don\'t know about L.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests L and also other letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nI think we should guess ""LEAST"".\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BEAST"" and we guess ""LEAST"": \n- L: not in the word (x)\n- E: correct (✓)\n- A: correct (✓)\n- S: correct (✓) because in ""BEAST"", S is at position 4, and in ""LEAST"" it\'s also at 4? \n  - ""LEAST"": L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n  - ""BEAST"": B(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n  So if we guess ""LEAST"" and the secret is ""BEAST"", then:\n  - L: x (not in secret)\n  - E: ✓\n  - A: ✓\n  - S: ✓ (position 4 is correct)\n  - T: ✓ (position 5 is correct)\n\nBut we would get four correct and one wrong, and we would know that the first letter is not L, so it must be B, F, or Y.\n\nSimilarly, if the secret is ""LEAST"", we get all correct.\n\nBut we are at guess 3, so we can afford to guess one of them.\n\nTo save a guess, we might guess a word that can test multiple first letters? But we can\'t because the pattern is fixed.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that is not in this set but includes the letters B, F, L, Y to test which one is present? But we are constrained by the pattern [1] E A [4] [5] and we know [4] and [5] must be S and T? Not necessarily, but in this case, we think they are S and T.\n\nBut let\'s not jump to conclusions. We have to consider that there might be other possibilities.\n\nFor example, could the word be ""DEALT""? \n- Pattern: D E A L T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T. \n  This fits the pattern [1] E A [4] [5]. \n  Now, does it contain T? Yes, at position 5. \n  Does it contain S? No. But we know from the feedback that S is in the word. \n  How do we know S is in the word? \n  From the second guess ""teams"": S was marked as present but wrong position. So S must be in the word. \n  Therefore, ""DEALT"" does not have S, so it cannot be the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""HELLO"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nWhat about ""PEALS""? P E A L S -> but third letter is A? P(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). But S is at position 5, which is not allowed because in ""teams"", S was at 5 and marked as wrong position, so S cannot be at 5. Therefore, invalid.\n\n""TEALS"": T E A L S -> but T at position 1: in ""teams"", T was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so T cannot be at 1. Also, S at 5 is invalid.\n\n""MEALS"": M is excluded.\n\nSo indeed, the only possibilities are the words ending with ""ST"" for positions 4 and 5: S at 4 and T at 5.\n\nTherefore, the word must be [1] E A S T.\n\nSo we can guess one of them. I\'ll go with ""LEAST"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s list all common words: BEAST, FEAST, LEAST, YEAST.\n\nWe can also consider ""WEAST"" (not common) or ""FEAST"" is common.\n\nI think ""LEAST"" is a good guess.\n\nSo next guess: ""LEAST""\n\nBut note: if we are wrong, we get feedback that tells us the first letter is not L, and then we can guess among the others.\n\nWe have 4 tries left after this, so it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""LEAST"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and N are not in the word (x). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n- **Guess 2 (teams)**: T is in the word but not in position 1 (-). E is in the correct position (✓, position 2). A is in the correct position (✓, position 3). M is not in the word (x). S is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **?

This is because:\n  - If S were in position 1, no common 5-letter words exist with the pattern ""S E A ? ?"" that include T and avoid S in position 5 (e.g., ""seats"" is invalid due to S in position 5).\n  - Thus, S must be in position 4, and T must be in position 5.\n- The only unknown is position 1, which must be a letter not excluded (not C, R, N, M) and not E, A, T, or S.

We received feedback for Guess 3: least -> L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
This means:
- L is not in the word (x).
- E, A, S, T are all correct (✓) and in their positions: positions 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But wait, the word has the pattern: [1] E A S T.
And from the feedback:
- L at position 1 is not in the word (x). So the first letter is not L.

But E, A, S, T are all confirmed and in the correct positions for positions 2,3,4,5.

Therefore, the secret word must be ? E A S T, and the first letter is a letter that is not L and not excluded (excluded letters: C, R, N, M, and L is newly excluded).

We know from previous feedback that:
- The word contains T (which is at position 5) and S (at position 4), which are now confirmed.

Possible words: 
- BEAST (B at position 1)
- FEAST (F at position 1)
- YEAST (Y at position 1)

Since L is excluded, ""LEAST"" is not the word.

Now, we can guess one of these.

But note: we have only one letter to determine: the first letter.

We have used guesses: 1,2,3. So we are at guess 4, with 2 left.

We can try ""BEAST"" or ""FEAST"" or ""YEAST"".

To decide, note that B and F are more common than Y.

But ""FEAST"" might be more common? Actually, let's think about frequency.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities, but since the pattern is fixed, we have to guess one of these words.

So let's choose ""BEAST"" as the next guess.

If we guess ""BEAST"":
- If it's correct, we win.
- If not, then the word must be ""FEAST"" or ""YEAST"", and we can guess one of them in the next try.

Similarly, we could start with ""FEAST"".

But consider the letter B: we haven't tested B before, so we don't know about it.

Similarly for F and Y.

Since ""YEAST"" is less common, perhaps we should try ""BEAST"" or ""FEAST"" first.

I think ""BEAST"" is a good choice.

So next guess: ""BEAST""

But note: the pattern must be [1]EAST, and we know all positions except 1.

After the feedback from ""least"", we know that:
- Positions 2,3,4,5 are E,A,S,T respectively and are fixed.
- Position 1 is the only unknown, and it must be a letter not excluded and not L.

So yes, it's B, F, or Y.

We can guess ""BEAST"".

Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Confirmed A at position 3 and E in the word (but not position 5). Excluded C, R, N.
- **Guess 2 (teams)**: Confirmed E at position 2 and A at position 3. T and S are in the word but not at positions 1 or 5, respectively. Excluded M.
- **Guess 3 (least)**: Confirmed:
  - L is not in the word (x).
  - E at position 2 (✓), A at position 3 (✓), S at position 4 (✓), T at position 5 (✓).
- The secret word is now known to be in the form: **? E A S T** (positions 2-5 confirmed).

### Key Deductions:
- Position 1 must be a letter not yet excluded (exclusions: C, L, M, N, R) and not a duplicate of E, A, S, or T.
- The word must be a valid English 5-letter word ending with ""EAST"". Common options: **BEAST**, **FEAST**, or **YEAST**.
- Since L is excluded, ""LEAST"" is incorrect.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **BEAST** to resolve the first letter:
  - B is a common consonant not previously tested.
  - If correct, the word is solved. If incorrect, feedback on B will confirm whether the word is FEAST or YEAST.
