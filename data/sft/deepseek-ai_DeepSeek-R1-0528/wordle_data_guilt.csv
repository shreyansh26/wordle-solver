We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are starting with no correct letters. The feedback for ""crane"" was all incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since these are common vowels and consonants, we need to choose a word that avoids these letters entirely.

 Let's think of common letters that are not in {C, R, A, N, E}. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 left.

 We should aim for a word that uses other common letters to maximize information. Common letters include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" because it uses S, L, O, T, H, which are common and not in the excluded set.

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to cover as many new letters as possible. Another popular choice is ""PIOUS"" but that uses O, U, S, and I, which are also common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""BUMPY"" but that has B, U, M, P, Y. But Y is less common.

 Let's consider ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y. But we don't know about I and Y.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. However, O and U are vowels we haven't tried.

 Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should try other vowels: O, U, I, and sometimes Y.

 We can try a word with multiple vowels? But note: we have to avoid A, E, and also R, C, N.

 Let's list available vowels: O, U, I (and Y as semi-vowel).

 A good candidate might be ""POULT"" (meaning a young chicken) but that's obscure. Better to use common words.

 How about ""MOIST""? It uses M, O, I, S, T. All common and avoids the excluded letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is common? But let's check: P, I, O, U, S.

 But we want to maximize coverage. ""MOIST"" has O, I and consonants M, S, T.

 Another one: ""DUCHY"" - D, U, C, H, Y. But C is already excluded? Wait, C was in the first guess and was excluded, so we cannot use C. So ""DUCHY"" is invalid because of C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So, for ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the excluded set? 
 - C: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - R: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - A: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - N: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - E: excluded -> not in MOIST

 So ""MOIST"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T. Also valid.

 But ""MOIST"" has the advantage of testing two vowels (O and I) and three common consonants.

 We can also consider ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P. This avoids the excluded letters and uses common consonants.

 However, we haven't tested O or U. Since we don't have any vowels yet (because A and E are out), we should test other vowels.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"" because it tests O and I, and also S and T which are very common.

 So, the second guess is ""MOIST"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), none of these letters appear in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these excluded letters entirely and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

I selected ""moist"" because:
- It uses high-frequency letters not yet tested (M, O, I, S, T).

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(x), T(✓). This means:
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).
   - M, O, S are absent (not in the word at all).

So, we know:
- The secret word has I as the third letter and T as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is: _ _ I _ T
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ? ? I ? T

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S. The remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We should try to use a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y

We can try to form words with the pattern _ _ I _ T.

Some possibilities:
- LIGHT: L I G H T -> but we have I in third and T in fifth, so L I G H T would be L(?) I(✓) G(?) H(?) T(✓). But note: the first letter is L, second is I? Wait, no: L is first, then second letter is unknown, then I (third), then H (fourth), then T (fifth). So the pattern is: ? ? I ? T -> so for ""light"": positions: 1:L, 2:I? -> no, ""light"" is L-I-G-H-T, so:
  - Position 1: L
  - Position 2: I -> but we need the third to be I, so this is not matching. The third letter is G, not I. So ""light"" doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the third letter to be I and fifth to be T.

Examples of words that fit ? ? I ? T:
- DAILY: D-A-I-L-Y -> but fifth letter is Y, not T.
- BUILT: B-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:T -> this fits: B U I L T
- GUILT: G-U-I-L-T -> G U I L T
- QUILT: Q-U-I-L-T -> Q U I L T
- FLIRT: F-L-I-R-T -> but R is excluded (from first guess: R(x)), so R is not allowed.
- FLINT: F-L-I-N-T -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so not allowed.
- TWIST: T-W-I-S-T -> but S is excluded (from second guess: S(x)), and also the first letter T? But we have T at the end, but if we put T at the beginning, that's a different T? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" had T at the fifth position as correct, but that doesn't prevent T from appearing elsewhere? However, in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T(✓) at the fifth position, meaning that T is in the word and at the fifth position. But it doesn't say anything about T in other positions. However, we don't know if the word has multiple T's.

But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters in the positions we guessed. For ""moist"", we guessed T at the fifth position and it was correct. But the secret word might have T only at the end or also elsewhere.

However, in the pattern, we know the fifth is T, and third is I. So the word is ? ? I ? T.

Now, let's list possible words from the available letters (avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S) and with I in third and T in fifth.

Possible words:
- BUILT: B, U, I, L, T -> all letters are allowed? B, U, L are not excluded. Yes.
- GUILT: G, U, I, L, T -> G, U, L allowed.
- QUILT: Q, U, I, L, T -> Q, U, L allowed.
- FLIRT: F, L, I, R, T -> but R is excluded (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.
- BLITZ: B, L, I, T, Z -> but the fifth letter is Z, not T? And the pattern requires fifth to be T. ""BLITZ"" is B-L-I-T-Z, so fifth is Z, not T. So no.
- EXIST: but E and S are excluded.
- WRIT: too short.

Other words: 
- KITTY: K-I-T-T-Y -> but third letter is T, not I? And fifth is Y. Doesn't fit.
- PITHY: P-I-T-H-Y -> fifth is Y, not T.
- WITHY: W-I-T-H-Y -> same.

So the common ones are: BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

But we also have:
- JUIST? Not a word.
- DUIST? Not a word.

Another one: ""SULPH"" but doesn't fit.

What about ""UNLIT""? U-N-L-I-T -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so invalid.

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D -> fifth is D, not T.

""FRUIT"": F-R-U-I-T -> but R is excluded.

So the main candidates are: BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We need to choose one that tests new letters. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one that uses letters we haven't tried to get more information.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But in the candidates:
- BUILT: uses B, U, L
- GUILT: uses G, U, L
- QUILT: uses Q, U, L

We can also consider ""BUILT"" and ""GUILT"" because Q is less common. But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that isn't necessarily one of these but tests more letters? However, we know that the word must have I in the third and T in the fifth. So if we guess a word that isn't one of these, it might not be valid? But we must guess a valid word.

We could guess a word that has I in third and T in fifth, but also includes other letters to test. But the pattern is fixed: third is I, fifth is T.

So we have to guess a word of the form: [letter1][letter2]I[letter4]T

And letter1, letter2, letter4 must be from the available set and form a valid word.

We can try to use a word that uses as many new letters as possible to get feedback.

For example, if we guess ""BUILT"", we test B, U, L. If it's not the word, we get feedback on these.

Similarly, ""GUILT"" tests G, U, L.

But note: U and L appear in all three. So we might get information about U and L.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters, but the options are limited.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> but third letter is V, not I. Doesn't fit.

""EXIST"" -> excluded.

""JOIST"": J-O-I-S-T -> but O and S are excluded.

""TOUCH"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

So we are limited to the words like BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We can also consider ""FLINT"" but N is excluded.

""BLITZ"" doesn't end with T.

""GRIFT"": G-R-I-F-T -> R excluded.

So let's choose one. Since we have no information on U and L, and they are common, we can guess ""BUILT"" to test B, U, L.

But note: if the word is ""QUILT"", then guessing ""BUILT"" might not reveal Q. But we can get feedback on the letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses a letter not in these candidates to test more broadly? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could guess ""PITHY"" but it doesn't end with T.

Or ""WIGHT"": W-I-G-H-T -> positions: 1:W, 2:I? -> no, it's W-I-G-H-T, so third letter is G, not I. Doesn't fit.

""LIGHT"": L-I-G-H-T -> third letter is G, not I.

""FIGHT"": F-I-G-H-T -> third is G.

So no.

Another possibility: ""DICHT""? Not a common word.

""BIGHT"": B-I-G-H-T -> third is G.

So the only common words are BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We can also consider ""UNITY"": U-N-I-T-Y -> but N is excluded, and fifth is Y, not T? ""UNITY"" is U-N-I-T-Y, so five letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we need fifth to be T, not Y. And N is excluded.

So I think we have to choose among BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

Let's pick ""BUILT"" because it uses B which is common, and we can see if B is in the word.

If we guess ""BUILT"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B, U, L.

But note: the feedback will tell us for each letter:
- If B is in the correct position? (first)
- If U is in the correct position? (second)
- If I is correct (third, we already know it is, so it will be ✓)
- If L is in the correct position? (fourth)
- T is correct (fifth, ✓)

But if the word is ""GUILT"", then in ""BUILT"", the B would be wrong, U would be correct (if it's in second position for ""GUILT""? No, for ""GUILT"" the second letter is U, same as in ""BUILT"". So if we guess ""BUILT"" and the word is ""GUILT"", then:
- B: not in word -> x
- U: in word and in correct position (second) -> ✓
- I: ✓
- L: in word and in correct position (fourth) -> ✓
- T: ✓

So we would get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)

Then we would know the word is ? U I L T, and since B is not in it, and we know G is possible, we might guess ""GUILT"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""QUILT"", we get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓), and then we know it's ? U I L T, and we have to try Q.

But we have only used 3 guesses so far, so we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But we must have I in third and T in fifth.

For example, we can guess ""DUVET"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""PULPY"": P-U-L-P-Y -> but third letter is L, not I, and fifth is Y.

Not possible.

Another idea: guess ""QUICK"" but doesn't fit pattern and C is excluded.

So we have to stick to the pattern.

We can try to use a word that has duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are present.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and are common.

But in the pattern, we are limited.

We can try ""BUILT"" as the next guess.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more new letters. For example, ""QUILT"" uses Q which is rare, so if we guess ""BUILT"" and it's wrong, we still have to try ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"". But we have 4 tries left.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but has I in third and T in fifth and uses letters that might be in other positions? But we have to guess a valid word.

Another word: ""TWIST"" -> but S is excluded and the pattern: T-W-I-S-T -> but S is excluded, and also the first letter T: we don't know if T can be at the beginning. But the secret word has T at the end, but it might have T at the beginning too? However, in ""TWIST"", the fifth is T, which is correct, but the first is T. But we don't know if the word has two T's. But S is excluded, so we cannot use ""TWIST"".

Similarly, ""TRUST"" has R and S excluded.

So I think ""BUILT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's consider: we have not tried U and L. If we guess ""BUILT"", we test U and L in positions 2 and 4.

If we get U and L correct, then the word is either BUILT or if not, then it must be GUILT or QUILT, but we would have to guess again.

To save a guess, we could try a word that includes G or Q? But we can't include both.

For example, if we guess ""GUILT"", we test G, U, L.

If it's not the word, and we get feedback, we might know if G is present.

Similarly for ""QUILT"".

But since Q is rare, it's less likely. So perhaps start with ""BUILT"" or ""GUILT"".

I think ""BUILT"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""BUILT"".

<guess>built</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- From ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.
- From ""moist"": 
  - I is correct and in position 3 (third letter).
  - T is correct and in position 5 (fifth letter).
  - M, O, S are absent and excluded.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ I _ T  
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.  
Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Given the pattern and exclusions, possible words include BUILT, GUILT, and QUILT. I chose ""built"" to test B, U, and L in positions 1, 2, and 4. This guess maximizes information by covering common letters and maintaining the required pattern.

<guess>built</guess>",built,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(x), T(✓). This means:
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).
   - M, O, S are absent (not in the word at all).

So, we know:
- The secret word has I as the third letter and T as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is: _ _ I _ T
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ? ? I ? T

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S. The remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We should try to use a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y

We can try to form words with the pattern _ _ I _ T.

Some possibilities:
- LIGHT: L I G H T -> but we have I in third and T in fifth, so L I G H T would be L(?) I(✓) G(?) H(?) T(✓). But note: the first letter is L, second is I? Wait, no: L is first, then second letter is unknown, then I (third), then H (fourth), then T (fifth). So the pattern is: ? ? I ? T -> so for ""light"": positions: 1:L, 2:I? -> no, ""light"" is L-I-G-H-T, so:
  - Position 1: L
  - Position 2: I -> but we need the third to be I, so this is not matching. The third letter is G, not I. So ""light"" doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the third letter to be I and fifth to be T.

Examples of words that fit ? ? I ? T:
- DAILY: D-A-I-L-Y -> but fifth letter is Y, not T.
- BUILT: B-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:T -> this fits: B U I L T
- GUILT: G-U-I-L-T -> G U I L T
- QUILT: Q-U-I-L-T -> Q U I L T
- FLIRT: F-L-I-R-T -> but R is excluded (from first guess: R(x)), so R is not allowed.
- FLINT: F-L-I-N-T -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so not allowed.
- TWIST: T-W-I-S-T -> but S is excluded (from second guess: S(x)), and also the first letter T? But we have T at the end, but if we put T at the beginning, that's a different T? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" had T at the fifth position as correct, but that doesn't prevent T from appearing elsewhere? However, in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T(✓) at the fifth position, meaning that T is in the word and at the fifth position. But it doesn't say anything about T in other positions. However, we don't know if the word has multiple T's.

However, in the pattern, we know the fifth is T, and third is I. So the word is ? ? I ? T.

Now, let's list possible words from the available letters (avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S) and with I in third and T in fifth.

Possible words:
- BUILT: B, U, I, L, T -> all letters are allowed? B, U, L are not excluded. Yes.
- GUILT: G, U, I, L, T -> G, U, L allowed.
- QUILT: Q, U, I, L, T -> Q, U, L allowed.
- FLIRT: F, L, I, R, T -> but R is excluded (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.
- BLITZ: B, L, I, T, Z -> but the fifth letter is Z, not T? And the pattern requires fifth to be T. ""BLITZ"" is B-L-I-T-Z, so fifth is Z, not T. So no.
- EXIST: but E and S are excluded.
- WRIT: too short.

Other words: 
- KITTY: K-I-T-T-Y -> but third letter is T, not I? And fifth is Y. Doesn't fit.
- PITHY: P-I-T-H-Y -> fifth is Y, not T.
- WITHY: W-I-T-H-Y -> same.

So the common ones are: BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

But we also have:
- JUIST? Not a word.
- DUIST? Not a word.

Another one: ""SULPH"" but doesn't fit.

What about ""UNLIT""? U-N-L-I-T -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so invalid.

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D -> fifth is D, not T.

""FRUIT"": F-R-U-I-T -> but R is excluded.

So the main candidates are: BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We need to choose one that tests new letters. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one that uses letters we haven't tried to get more information.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

""TOUCH"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

So we are limited to the words like BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We can also consider ""FLINT"" but N is excluded.

""BLITZ"" doesn't end with T.

""GRIFT"": G-R-I-F-T -> R excluded.

So let's choose one. Since we have no information on U and L, and they are common, we can guess ""BUILT"" to test B, U, L.

But note: if the word is ""QUILT"", then guessing ""BUILT"" might not reveal Q. But we can get feedback on the letters.

""LIGHT"": L-I-G-H-T -> third letter is G, not I.

""FIGHT"": F-I-G-H-T -> third is G.

So no.

Another possibility: ""DICHT""? Not a common word.

""BIGHT"": B-I-G-H-T -> third is G.

So the only common words are BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We can also consider ""UNITY"": U-N-I-T-Y -> but N is excluded, and fifth is Y, not T? ""UNITY"" is U-N-I-T-Y, so five letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we need fifth to be T, not Y. And N is excluded.

- I: ✓
- L: in word and in correct position (fourth) -> ✓
- T: ✓

So we would get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)

Then we would know the word is ? U I L T, and since B is not in it, and we know G is possible, we might guess ""GUILT"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""QUILT"", we get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓), and then we know it's ? U I L T, and we have to try Q.

We can try to use a word that has duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are present.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting with no correct letters. The feedback for ""crane"" was all incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since these are common vowels and consonants, we need to choose a word that avoids these letters entirely.

 Let's think of common letters that are not in {C, R, A, N, E}. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 left.

 We should aim for a word that uses other common letters to maximize information. Common letters include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" because it uses S, L, O, T, H, which are common and not in the excluded set.

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to cover as many new letters as possible. Another popular choice is ""PIOUS"" but that uses O, U, S, and I, which are also common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""BUMPY"" but that has B, U, M, P, Y. But Y is less common.

 Let's consider ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y. But we don't know about I and Y.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. However, O and U are vowels we haven't tried.

 Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should try other vowels: O, U, I, and sometimes Y.

 We can try a word with multiple vowels? But note: we have to avoid A, E, and also R, C, N.

 Let's list available vowels: O, U, I (and Y as semi-vowel).

 A good candidate might be ""POULT"" (meaning a young chicken) but that's obscure. Better to use common words.

 How about ""MOIST""? It uses M, O, I, S, T. All common and avoids the excluded letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is common? But let's check: P, I, O, U, S.

 But we want to maximize coverage. ""MOIST"" has O, I and consonants M, S, T.

 Another one: ""DUCHY"" - D, U, C, H, Y. But C is already excluded? Wait, C was in the first guess and was excluded, so we cannot use C. So ""DUCHY"" is invalid because of C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So, for ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the excluded set? 
 - C: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - R: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - A: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - N: excluded -> not in MOIST
 - E: excluded -> not in MOIST

 So ""MOIST"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T. Also valid.

 But ""MOIST"" has the advantage of testing two vowels (O and I) and three common consonants.

 We can also consider ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P. This avoids the excluded letters and uses common consonants.

 However, we haven't tested O or U. Since we don't have any vowels yet (because A and E are out), we should test other vowels.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"" because it tests O and I, and also S and T which are very common.

 So, the second guess is ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), none of these letters appear in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these excluded letters entirely and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

I selected ""moist"" because:
- It uses high-frequency letters not yet tested (M, O, I, S, T).
- It includes two new vowels (O, I) since A and E are excluded.
- The consonants (M, S, T) are common and likely to appear in the secret word.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing coverage.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(x), T(✓). This means:
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).
   - M, O, S are absent (not in the word at all).

So, we know:
- The secret word has I as the third letter and T as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is: _ _ I _ T
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ? ? I ? T

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S. The remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We should try to use a word that tests common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y

We can try to form words with the pattern _ _ I _ T.

Some possibilities:
- LIGHT: L I G H T -> but we have I in third and T in fifth, so L I G H T would be L(?) I(✓) G(?) H(?) T(✓). But note: the first letter is L, second is I? Wait, no: L is first, then second letter is unknown, then I (third), then H (fourth), then T (fifth). So the pattern is: ? ? I ? T -> so for ""light"": positions: 1:L, 2:I? -> no, ""light"" is L-I-G-H-T, so:
  - Position 1: L
  - Position 2: I -> but we need the third to be I, so this is not matching. The third letter is G, not I. So ""light"" doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the third letter to be I and fifth to be T.

Examples of words that fit ? ? I ? T:
- DAILY: D-A-I-L-Y -> but fifth letter is Y, not T.
- BUILT: B-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:T -> this fits: B U I L T
- GUILT: G-U-I-L-T -> G U I L T
- QUILT: Q-U-I-L-T -> Q U I L T
- FLIRT: F-L-I-R-T -> but R is excluded (from first guess: R(x)), so R is not allowed.
- FLINT: F-L-I-N-T -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so not allowed.
- TWIST: T-W-I-S-T -> but S is excluded (from second guess: S(x)), and also the first letter T? But we have T at the end, but if we put T at the beginning, that's a different T? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" had T at the fifth position as correct, but that doesn't prevent T from appearing elsewhere? However, in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T(✓) at the fifth position, meaning that T is in the word and at the fifth position. But it doesn't say anything about T in other positions. However, we don't know if the word has multiple T's.

But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters in the positions we guessed. For ""moist"", we guessed T at the fifth position and it was correct. But the secret word might have T only at the end or also elsewhere.

However, in the pattern, we know the fifth is T, and third is I. So the word is ? ? I ? T.

Now, let's list possible words from the available letters (avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S) and with I in third and T in fifth.

Possible words:
- BUILT: B, U, I, L, T -> all letters are allowed? B, U, L are not excluded. Yes.
- GUILT: G, U, I, L, T -> G, U, L allowed.
- QUILT: Q, U, I, L, T -> Q, U, L allowed.
- FLIRT: F, L, I, R, T -> but R is excluded (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.
- BLITZ: B, L, I, T, Z -> but the fifth letter is Z, not T? And the pattern requires fifth to be T. ""BLITZ"" is B-L-I-T-Z, so fifth is Z, not T. So no.
- EXIST: but E and S are excluded.
- WRIT: too short.

Other words: 
- KITTY: K-I-T-T-Y -> but third letter is T, not I? And fifth is Y. Doesn't fit.
- PITHY: P-I-T-H-Y -> fifth is Y, not T.
- WITHY: W-I-T-H-Y -> same.

So the common ones are: BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

But we also have:
- JUIST? Not a word.
- DUIST? Not a word.

Another one: ""SULPH"" but doesn't fit.

What about ""UNLIT""? U-N-L-I-T -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so invalid.

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D -> fifth is D, not T.

""FRUIT"": F-R-U-I-T -> but R is excluded.

So the main candidates are: BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We need to choose one that tests new letters. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one that uses letters we haven't tried to get more information.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But in the candidates:
- BUILT: uses B, U, L
- GUILT: uses G, U, L
- QUILT: uses Q, U, L

We can also consider ""BUILT"" and ""GUILT"" because Q is less common. But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that isn't necessarily one of these but tests more letters? However, we know that the word must have I in the third and T in the fifth. So if we guess a word that isn't one of these, it might not be valid? But we must guess a valid word.

We could guess a word that has I in third and T in fifth, but also includes other letters to test. But the pattern is fixed: third is I, fifth is T.

So we have to guess a word of the form: [letter1][letter2]I[letter4]T

And letter1, letter2, letter4 must be from the available set and form a valid word.

We can try to use a word that uses as many new letters as possible to get feedback.

For example, if we guess ""BUILT"", we test B, U, L. If it's not the word, we get feedback on these.

Similarly, ""GUILT"" tests G, U, L.

But note: U and L appear in all three. So we might get information about U and L.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters, but the options are limited.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> but third letter is V, not I. Doesn't fit.

""EXIST"" -> excluded.

""JOIST"": J-O-I-S-T -> but O and S are excluded.

""TOUCH"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

So we are limited to the words like BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We can also consider ""FLINT"" but N is excluded.

""BLITZ"" doesn't end with T.

""GRIFT"": G-R-I-F-T -> R excluded.

So let's choose one. Since we have no information on U and L, and they are common, we can guess ""BUILT"" to test B, U, L.

But note: if the word is ""QUILT"", then guessing ""BUILT"" might not reveal Q. But we can get feedback on the letters.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses a letter not in these candidates to test more broadly? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could guess ""PITHY"" but it doesn't end with T.

Or ""WIGHT"": W-I-G-H-T -> positions: 1:W, 2:I? -> no, it's W-I-G-H-T, so third letter is G, not I. Doesn't fit.

""LIGHT"": L-I-G-H-T -> third letter is G, not I.

""FIGHT"": F-I-G-H-T -> third is G.

So no.

Another possibility: ""DICHT""? Not a common word.

""BIGHT"": B-I-G-H-T -> third is G.

So the only common words are BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

We can also consider ""UNITY"": U-N-I-T-Y -> but N is excluded, and fifth is Y, not T? ""UNITY"" is U-N-I-T-Y, so five letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we need fifth to be T, not Y. And N is excluded.

So I think we have to choose among BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.

Let's pick ""BUILT"" because it uses B which is common, and we can see if B is in the word.

If we guess ""BUILT"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B, U, L.

But note: the feedback will tell us for each letter:
- If B is in the correct position? (first)
- If U is in the correct position? (second)
- If I is correct (third, we already know it is, so it will be ✓)
- If L is in the correct position? (fourth)
- T is correct (fifth, ✓)

But if the word is ""GUILT"", then in ""BUILT"", the B would be wrong, U would be correct (if it's in second position for ""GUILT""? No, for ""GUILT"" the second letter is U, same as in ""BUILT"". So if we guess ""BUILT"" and the word is ""GUILT"", then:
- B: not in word -> x
- U: in word and in correct position (second) -> ✓
- I: ✓
- L: in word and in correct position (fourth) -> ✓
- T: ✓

So we would get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)

Then we would know the word is ? U I L T, and since B is not in it, and we know G is possible, we might guess ""GUILT"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""QUILT"", we get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓), and then we know it's ? U I L T, and we have to try Q.

But we have only used 3 guesses so far, so we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But we must have I in third and T in fifth.

For example, we can guess ""DUVET"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""PULPY"": P-U-L-P-Y -> but third letter is L, not I, and fifth is Y.

Not possible.

Another idea: guess ""QUICK"" but doesn't fit pattern and C is excluded.

So we have to stick to the pattern.

We can try to use a word that has duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are present.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and are common.

But in the pattern, we are limited.

We can try ""BUILT"" as the next guess.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more new letters. For example, ""QUILT"" uses Q which is rare, so if we guess ""BUILT"" and it's wrong, we still have to try ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"". But we have 4 tries left.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but has I in third and T in fifth and uses letters that might be in other positions? But we have to guess a valid word.

Another word: ""TWIST"" -> but S is excluded and the pattern: T-W-I-S-T -> but S is excluded, and also the first letter T: we don't know if T can be at the beginning. But the secret word has T at the end, but it might have T at the beginning too? However, in ""TWIST"", the fifth is T, which is correct, but the first is T. But we don't know if the word has two T's. But S is excluded, so we cannot use ""TWIST"".

Similarly, ""TRUST"" has R and S excluded.

So I think ""BUILT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's consider: we have not tried U and L. If we guess ""BUILT"", we test U and L in positions 2 and 4.

If we get U and L correct, then the word is either BUILT or if not, then it must be GUILT or QUILT, but we would have to guess again.

To save a guess, we could try a word that includes G or Q? But we can't include both.

For example, if we guess ""GUILT"", we test G, U, L.

If it's not the word, and we get feedback, we might know if G is present.

Similarly for ""QUILT"".

But since Q is rare, it's less likely. So perhaps start with ""BUILT"" or ""GUILT"".

I think ""BUILT"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""BUILT"".

<guess>built</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- From ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.
- From ""moist"": 
  - I is correct and in position 3 (third letter).
  - T is correct and in position 5 (fifth letter).
  - M, O, S are absent and excluded.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ I _ T  
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.  
Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Given the pattern and exclusions, possible words include BUILT, GUILT, and QUILT. I chose ""built"" to test B, U, and L in positions 1, 2, and 4. This guess maximizes information by covering common letters and maintaining the required pattern.

But we can get feedback on the letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses a letter not in these candidates to test more broadly? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nFor example, we could guess ""PITHY"" but it doesn\'t end with T.\n\nOr ""WIGHT"": W-I-G-H-T -> positions: 1:W, 2:I? -> no, it\'s W-I-G-H-T, so third letter is G, not I. Doesn\'t fit.\n\n""LIGHT"": L-I-G-H-T -> third letter is G, not I.\n\n""FIGHT"": F-I-G-H-T -> third is G.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DICHT""? Not a common word.\n\n""BIGHT"": B-I-G-H-T -> third is G.\n\nSo the only common words are BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.\n\nWe can also consider ""UNITY"": U-N-I-T-Y -> but N is excluded, and fifth is Y, not T? ""UNITY"" is U-N-I-T-Y, so five letters: positions 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we need fifth to be T, not Y. And N is excluded.\n\nSo I think we have to choose among BUILT, GUILT, QUILT.\n\nLet\'s pick ""BUILT"" because it uses B which is common, and we can see if B is in the word.\n\nIf we guess ""BUILT"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on B, U, L.\n\nBut note: the feedback will tell us for each letter:\n- If B is in the correct position? (first)\n- If U is in the correct position? (second)\n- If I is correct (third, we already know it is, so it will be ✓)\n- If L is in the correct position? (fourth)\n- T is correct (fifth, ✓)\n\nBut if the word is ""GUILT"", then in ""BUILT"", the B would be wrong, U would be correct (if it\'s in second position for ""GUILT""? No, for ""GUILT"" the second letter is U, same as in ""BUILT"". So if we guess ""BUILT"" and the word is ""GUILT"", then:\n- B: not in word -> x\n- U: in word and in correct position (second) -> ✓\n- I: ✓\n- L: in word and in correct position (fourth) -> ✓\n- T: ✓\n\nSo we would get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)\n\nThen we would know the word is ? U I L T, and since B is not in it, and we know G is possible, we might guess ""GUILT"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""QUILT"", we get: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓), and then we know it\'s ? U I L T, and we have to try Q.\n\nBut we have only used 3 guesses so far, so we have more tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But we must have I in third and T in fifth.\n\nFor example, we can guess ""DUVET"" but it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nOr ""PULPY"": P-U-L-P-Y -> but third letter is L, not I, and fifth is Y.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother idea: guess ""QUICK"" but doesn\'t fit pattern and C is excluded.\n\nSo we have to stick to the pattern.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nBut to maximize information, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried and are common.\n\nBut in the pattern, we are limited.\n\nWe can try ""BUILT"" as the next guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses more new letters. For example, ""QUILT"" uses Q which is rare, so if we guess ""BUILT"" and it\'s wrong, we still have to try ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"". But we have 4 tries left.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but has I in third and T in fifth and uses letters that might be in other positions? But we have to guess a valid word.\n\nAnother word: ""TWIST"" -> but S is excluded and the pattern: T-W-I-S-T -> but S is excluded, and also the first letter T: we don\'t know if T can be at the beginning. But the secret word has T at the end, but it might have T at the beginning too? However, in ""TWIST"", the fifth is T, which is correct, but the first is T. But we don\'t know if the word has two T\'s. But S is excluded, so we cannot use ""TWIST"".\n\nSimilarly, ""TRUST"" has R and S excluded.\n\nSo I think ""BUILT"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have not tried U and L. If we guess ""BUILT"", we test U and L in positions 2 and 4.\n\nIf we get U and L correct, then the word is either BUILT or if not, then it must be GUILT or QUILT, but we would have to guess again.\n\nTo save a guess, we could try a word that includes G or Q? But we can\'t include both.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""GUILT"", we test G, U, L.\n\nIf it\'s not the word, and we get feedback, we might know if G is present.\n\nSimilarly for ""QUILT"".\n\nBut since Q is rare, it\'s less likely. So perhaps start with ""BUILT"" or ""GUILT"".\n\nI think ""BUILT"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BUILT"".\n\n<guess>built</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- From ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.\n- From ""moist"": \n  - I is correct and in position 3 (third letter).\n  - T is correct and in position 5 (fifth letter).\n  - M, O, S are absent and excluded.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ I _ T  \nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.  \nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\nGiven the pattern and exclusions, possible words include BUILT, GUILT, and QUILT. I chose ""built"" to test B, U, and L in positions 1, 2, and 4. This guess maximizes information by covering common letters and maintaining the required pattern.\n\n<guess>built</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(✓)\nGuess 3: built -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M and O and S absent, I correct (position 3), T correct (position 5).
3. ""built"" -> B absent, U correct (position 2), I correct (position 3), L correct (position 4), T correct (position 5).

So, from the feedback, we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ U I L T  (since U is in position 2, I in 3, L in 4, T in 5)
- The first letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, B.

From ""crane"": excluded C, R, A, N, E.
From ""moist"": excluded M, O, S.
From ""built"": excluded B.

So total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word pattern is: [first letter] U I L T

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with one of the available letters, then U, I, L, T.

Possible words:
- GUILT: G is available -> G U I L T
- But note, we already have ""built"" and ""guilt"" is similar. In fact, ""GUILT"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

Other possibilities:
- QUILT: Q U I L T -> Q is available.
- There is also ""HILT"" but that's 4 letters, not 5.
- ""WILT"" is 4 letters.
- ""TILT"" has T at the beginning, but we don't know if T can be at the beginning? But the pattern is first letter unknown, then U, I, L, T. So ""TILT"" doesn't have U, so no.
- ""BUILT"" we already guessed, and B is excluded.

So the only common words that fit are ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"".

We have feedback from ""built"": 
- For ""built"", we had U(✓), I(✓), L(✓), T(✓), and B(x). 
- Since the word is _ U I L T, and ""built"" had B in the first position which was absent, so the first letter is not B.

Now, if we consider ""GUILT"", it has G in the first position. Similarly, ""QUILT"" has Q.

We can guess ""GUILT"" because G is more common than Q.

But note: we have not tried G or Q yet.

Since we have only two possibilities, we can guess one of them.

If we guess ""GUILT"" and it's correct, we win. If not, then it must be ""QUILT"".

We have two guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 total).

So let's guess ""GUILT"".

But to be thorough, are there any other words?

For example, ""SULPH"" is not a word and doesn't fit.

""DUCHY"" has C and H, but C is excluded.

""JUICY"" has C and Y, but C excluded, and pattern: J U I C Y -> but we need L in the fourth position? No, the pattern is _ U I L T, so fourth must be L. ""JUICY"" has fourth letter C, not L.

""FLUID"" doesn't end with T.

""FRUIT"" has R, excluded.

So I think only ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"" are possible.

Therefore, we guess ""GUILT"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded from the secret word.
- **Guess 2: moist** → I is correct (✓) in position 3, T is correct (✓) in position 5, and M, O, S are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- **Guess 3: built** → U is correct (✓) in position 2, I is correct (✓) in position 3, L is correct (✓) in position 4, T is correct (✓) in position 5, and B is absent (x), so B is excluded.

### What We Know:
- The secret word pattern is: **? U I L T** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=U, 3=I, 4=L, 5=T).
- **Excluded letters (cannot be in the word)**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, B.
- **Available letters (for position 1)**: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Analysis:
- The secret word must be a valid 5-letter English word ending with ""UILT"".
- Common words fitting this pattern are ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"", as they use available letters (G or Q for position 1) and avoid excluded letters.
- ""GUILT"" (G in position 1) is more common than ""QUILT"" (Q in position 1), so it is prioritized to test first.
- If ""GUILT"" is incorrect, the only remaining common word is ""QUILT"", which can be guessed next.

### Next Guess:
- **GUILT** is chosen to test G in position 1 while confirming the known pattern (U, I, L, T in positions 2–5). If correct, the game is won. If not, ""QUILT"" will be the next logical guess.

- ""TILT"" has T at the beginning, but we don't know if T can be at the beginning? But the pattern is first letter unknown, then U, I, L, T. So ""TILT"" doesn't have U, so no.

We can guess ""GUILT"" because G is more common than Q.

""FLUID"" doesn't end with T.

""FRUIT"" has R, excluded.

So I think only ""GUILT"" and ""QUILT"" are possible.

Therefore, we guess ""GUILT"".
