We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

First, the secret word is 5 letters, and I'm given feedback from my first guess ""crane"":

- C: x (not in the word)

- R: ✓ (in the correct position, so R is the second letter)

- A: x (not in the word)

- N: ✓ (in the correct position, so N is the fourth letter)

- E: x (not in the word)

From this, I know that:

- R is the second letter of the secret word.

- N is the fourth letter of the secret word.

- The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

Since R and N are confirmed in their positions, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

Now, I need to guess another 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses letters not excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, E

Included letters: R (position 2), N (position 4)

I should avoid using C, A, E in my next guess because we know they're not in the word.

Possible letters: Since I'm eliminating vowels, A and E are out, so maybe other vowels like I, O, U could be in the word. Also consonants.

Common letters: I can think of words that have R as second letter and N as fourth letter.

Structure: ? R ? N ?

What words fit this pattern?

For example:

- BRINK: B R I N K

- BRING: B R I N G

- DRINK: D R I N K

- ORANG: but that's not common, and it's usually ""orange"" but ""orange"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- PRINT: P R I N T – here N is third letter? No, positions: P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) – so N is fourth letter? Position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: N, position 5: T. Yes.

Similarly:

- GRIND: G R I N D

- CRONY: but C is excluded, so can't have C.

C is excluded, so no words starting with C.

I should guess a word that has R in position 2, N in position 4, and doesn't contain C, A, E.

Also, since I have limited guesses, I want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

For instance, I could try including vowels like I or O or U.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ N _

- PRINT: P R I N T

- BRINE: but E is excluded, so BRINE has E, which is bad.

- BRAIN: has A, which is excluded.

A is excluded, so no A.

E is excluded.

So possible:

- BRINK: B R I N K

- BRING: B R I N G

- DRINK: D R I N K

- FRONT: F R O N T – O is a vowel, might be good to test.

- GRIND: G R I N D

- IRONS: I R O N S – but I in position 1?

Position: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), S (5). N is fourth, good.

Similarly, PRANK: but A is excluded, so no PRANK.

With excluded letters: avoid C, A, E.

Since R and N are fixed, I need to find letters for positions 1,3,5.

Position 1: can be consonant like B, D, F, G, P, etc., or vowel like I, U? But usually consonants.

Position 3: often a vowel in English words.

Position 5: consonant or vowel.

I should choose a word that has letters I haven't tried yet, to get more information.

For example, in first guess ""crane"", I tested C, R, A, N, E. R and N correct position, C,A,E absent.

So untested letters include B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

But only 5-letter words.

Common vowels left: I, O, U.

I could include one of them in position 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 5 could be consonants.

Let me think of examples.

Suppose I guess ""BRINK"": letters B, I, K new.

If I get feedback, I might learn about B, I, K.

Similarly, ""PRINT"": P, I, T.

""GRIND"": G, I, D.

""FRONT"": F, O, T.

Since position 3 might be a vowel, I should test a vowel there.

Options: I or O, as U is less common.

U possible, but rare.

For example, ""TRUNK"": T R U N K – but U in position 3.

But let's see.

First, I need a valid word.

Perhaps ""PRINT"" is a good choice because it uses P, I, T which are common, and I haven't tried them yet.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P O I N T – but position: P(1), O(2)? Wait, position 2 is R, must be R.

Position 2 is fixed as R, so it has to be ? R ? N ?

""POINT"" – P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) – but O is in position 2? No, position 2 is O, but it needs to be R. So ""POINT"" has O in position 2, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R.

So only words where second letter is R and fourth is N.

Like ""CRANE"" has R second, N fourth, but we already guessed that.

Other words: ""ORANG"" is not standard, better to pick common words.

Let's search for words ending with ""R _ N"" pattern? Wait, not ending.

Second letter R, fourth letter N.

So positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

Words: begin, brine, crone, drone, front, grain, grind, irons, crown, drown, frown, groin, groan, grown, brand, grand, grant, print, spent, sprint (too long), etc.

But exclude those with C, A, E.

- Begin: B E G I N – has E, excluded.

- Brine: B R I N E – has E.

- Crone: C R O N E – has C and E.

- Drone: D R O N E – has E.

- Front: F R O N T – good, no C,A,E.

- Grain: G R A I N – has A.

- Grind: G R I N D – good, no C,A,E.

- Irons: I R O N S – good.

- Crown: C R O W N – has C.

- Drown: D R O W N – good.

- Frown: F R O W N – good.

- Groin: G R O I N – positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4)? No, fourth letter should be N, but groin is G,R,O,I,N – position 4 is I, not N. Groin is 5 letters: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5). But N is fifth, not fourth. So not.

Fourth letter must be N, so position 4 N.

Groan: G R O A N – has A.

Groan: G,R,O,A,N – position 3 O, position 4 A? No, position 4 is A if we count: 1-G, 2-R, 3-O, 4-A, 5-N. But N is fifth, not fourth. Groan has N at end.

To have N at fourth position, it must be that fifth letter is something else.

For example, ""brand"": B R A N D – positions: 1-B, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-D. So N is fourth.

But ""brand"" has A, which is excluded.

Similarly, ""grand"": G R A N D – has A.

""Grant"": G R A N T – has A.

""Print"": P R I N T – no A, C, E. Good.

Irons: I R O N S – positions: 1-I,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-S.

Good.

""Spent"": S P E N T – has E, excluded.

Now, considering words without A and E:

- Print: P R I N T

- Grind: G R I N D

- Frond: F R O N D – F R O N D, but frond is a word.

- Front: F R O N T

- Drown: D R O W N – positions: D(1),R(2),O(3),W(4)? Wait, drown: D-R-O-W-N, so position 1-D,2-R,3-O,4-W,5-N. W is fourth? N is fifth? So not fourth N.

Drown has N at position 5.

To have N at position 4, it needs to be followed by another consonant or vowel.

Like ""drunk"": D R U N K – positions: D(1),R(2),U(3),N(4),K(5). U is third, N fourth.

Yes.

Similarly, ""trunk"": T R U N K

""Brink"": B R I N K

""Bring"": B R I N G

""Crony"": C R O N Y – has C.

Now, excluded C, so no crony.

So possible: print, grind, brink, bring, drunk, trunk, front, frond, irons, etc.

But avoid E: bring has no E? bring: B-R-I-N-G, no E.

grind: G-R-I-N-D, no E.

print: P-R-I-N-T, no E.

front: F-R-O-N-T, no E.

frond: F-R-O-N-D, no E.

irons: I-R-O-N-S, no E.

drunk: D-R-U-N-K, no E.

trunk: T-R-U-N-K, no E.

Bring has G at the end.

Now, I need to choose one to maximize information.

Since position 3 is a vowel, testing different vowels might be good.

In ""crane"", I guessed A which was wrong, and E was wrong, so vowels I or O or U could be an option.

U is less common, so perhaps I or O.

I could guess a word with I or O in position 3.

Also, test different consonants in position 1 and 5.

For example, guessing ""print"": if I guess PRINT, I'll get feedback on P, I, T.

Similarly, ""front"" has F,O,T.

""Grind"" has G,I,D.

""Brink"" has B,I,K.

B is not very common, but possible.

I recall that in Wordle, it's good to use words with diverse letters.

But here, position 2 and 4 are fixed, so I have to work around that.

Perhaps ""print"" is a solid choice because P and T are common letters, and I is a common vowel.

Similarly, ""front"" has O instead of I.

Another word: ""crony"" but C excluded.

""Prong"": P R O N G – positions: 1-P,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-G. Yes, N at fourth.

But ""prong"" doesn't have C,A,E, good.

""Wrong"": W R O N G – same.

But W and G are new.

But position 2 R and position 4 N.

Wrong: W(1),R(2),O(3),N(4),G(5). Yes.

Similarly, ""wring"": W R I N G – W(1),R(2),I(3),N(4),G(5)? ""wring"" is W-R-I-N-G, yes N at fourth? Positions: 1-W,2-R,3-I,4-N,5-G. N is fourth? In wring, it's four letters? No, wring is 5 letters: W,R,I,N,G. So position 4 is N? Sequence: letter 1: W, letter 2: R, letter 3: I, letter 4: N, letter 5: G. So yes, position 4 is N.

But the secret word has N as fourth letter, confirmed from feedback.

In guess ""crane"", position 4 was N, and it was correct, so N is indeed at position 4.

Back to guess.

I think ""print"" is a good option: P R I N T

Letters: P, I, T are all new.

Similarly, ""irons"" has I,O,S.

But in ""irons"", position 1 is I, which could be a vowel, but I can test it.

Position 1 doesn't have to be consonant; it could be vowel like in ""irons"".

""Irons"" might be good: tests I in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 5.

But position 1 I is less common as a vowel start, but possible.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""print"".

So I'll guess PRINT.

Confirm letters: P, R, I, N, T – R and N are fixed, P, I, T new.

Away from C,A,E, all good.

After this guess, I'll get feedback on these positions.

So, my second guess should be ""print"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word, so avoid words containing C.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A is not in the word, so avoid words containing A.
- N is in the correct position (fourth letter).
- E is not in the word, so avoid words containing E.

The secret word must be of the form: _ R _ N _, and it cannot contain C, A, or E.

I need to make a new guess that fits this pattern and tests new letters to gather more information. Possible words include:
- ""print"" (P R I N T)
- ""grind"" (G R I N D)
- ""front"" (F R O N T)
- ""irons"" (I R O N S)

""print"" is a good choice because:
- It includes the common vowel ""I"" in position 3 and consonants ""P"" and ""T"" in positions 1 and 5, all of which are untested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, A, and E.
- Testing ""I"" is valuable since other vowels (A, E) are already excluded, narrowing down the vowel options.

The guess ""print"" will provide feedback on P, I, and T, helping to refine the possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

<guess>print</guess>",print,"First, the secret word is 5 letters, and I'm given feedback from my first guess ""crane"":

- C: x (not in the word)

- R: ✓ (in the correct position, so R is the second letter)

- A: x (not in the word)

- N: ✓ (in the correct position, so N is the fourth letter)

- E: x (not in the word)

From this, I know that:

- R is the second letter of the secret word.

- N is the fourth letter of the secret word.

- The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

Since R and N are confirmed in their positions, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

Now, I need to guess another 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses letters not excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, E

Included letters: R (position 2), N (position 4)

I should avoid using C, A, E in my next guess because we know they're not in the word.

- BRINK: B R I N K

- BRING: B R I N G

- DRINK: D R I N K

- ORANG: but that's not common, and it's usually ""orange"" but ""orange"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- PRINT: P R I N T – here N is third letter? No, positions: P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) – so N is fourth letter? Position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: N, position 5: T. Yes.

Similarly:

- GRIND: G R I N D

- CRONY: but C is excluded, so can't have C.

C is excluded, so no words starting with C.

I should guess a word that has R in position 2, N in position 4, and doesn't contain C, A, E.

Also, since I have limited guesses, I want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

For instance, I could try including vowels like I or O or U.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ N _

- PRINT: P R I N T

- BRINE: but E is excluded, so BRINE has E, which is bad.

- BRAIN: has A, which is excluded.

A is excluded, so no A.

E is excluded.

So possible:

- BRINK: B R I N K

- BRING: B R I N G

- DRINK: D R I N K

- FRONT: F R O N T – O is a vowel, might be good to test.

- GRIND: G R I N D

- IRONS: I R O N S – but I in position 1?

Position: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), S (5). N is fourth, good.

Similarly, PRANK: but A is excluded, so no PRANK.

With excluded letters: avoid C, A, E.

Since R and N are fixed, I need to find letters for positions 1,3,5.

Position 1: can be consonant like B, D, F, G, P, etc., or vowel like I, U? But usually consonants.

Position 3: often a vowel in English words.

Position 5: consonant or vowel.

I should choose a word that has letters I haven't tried yet, to get more information.

For example, in first guess ""crane"", I tested C, R, A, N, E. R and N correct position, C,A,E absent.

So untested letters include B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

But only 5-letter words.

Common vowels left: I, O, U.

I could include one of them in position 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 5 could be consonants.

Let me think of examples.

Suppose I guess ""BRINK"": letters B, I, K new.

If I get feedback, I might learn about B, I, K.

Similarly, ""PRINT"": P, I, T.

""GRIND"": G, I, D.

""FRONT"": F, O, T.

Since position 3 might be a vowel, I should test a vowel there.

Options: I or O, as U is less common.

U possible, but rare.

For example, ""TRUNK"": T R U N K – but U in position 3.

But let's see.

First, I need a valid word.

Perhaps ""PRINT"" is a good choice because it uses P, I, T which are common, and I haven't tried them yet.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P O I N T – but position: P(1), O(2)? Wait, position 2 is R, must be R.

Position 2 is fixed as R, so it has to be ? R ? N ?

""POINT"" – P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) – but O is in position 2? No, position 2 is O, but it needs to be R. So ""POINT"" has O in position 2, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R.

So only words where second letter is R and fourth is N.

Like ""CRANE"" has R second, N fourth, but we already guessed that.

Other words: ""ORANG"" is not standard, better to pick common words.

Let's search for words ending with ""R _ N"" pattern? Wait, not ending.

Second letter R, fourth letter N.

So positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

Words: begin, brine, crone, drone, front, grain, grind, irons, crown, drown, frown, groin, groan, grown, brand, grand, grant, print, spent, sprint (too long), etc.

But exclude those with C, A, E.

- Begin: B E G I N – has E, excluded.

- Brine: B R I N E – has E.

- Crone: C R O N E – has C and E.

- Drone: D R O N E – has E.

- Front: F R O N T – good, no C,A,E.

- Grain: G R A I N – has A.

- Grind: G R I N D – good, no C,A,E.

- Irons: I R O N S – good.

- Crown: C R O W N – has C.

- Drown: D R O W N – good.

- Frown: F R O W N – good.

- Groin: G R O I N – positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4)? No, fourth letter should be N, but groin is G,R,O,I,N – position 4 is I, not N. Groin is 5 letters: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5). But N is fifth, not fourth. So not.

Fourth letter must be N, so position 4 N.

Groan: G R O A N – has A.

Groan: G,R,O,A,N – position 3 O, position 4 A? No, position 4 is A if we count: 1-G, 2-R, 3-O, 4-A, 5-N. But N is fifth, not fourth. Groan has N at end.

To have N at fourth position, it must be that fifth letter is something else.

For example, ""brand"": B R A N D – positions: 1-B, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-D. So N is fourth.

But ""brand"" has A, which is excluded.

Similarly, ""grand"": G R A N D – has A.

""Grant"": G R A N T – has A.

""Print"": P R I N T – no A, C, E. Good.

Irons: I R O N S – positions: 1-I,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-S.

Good.

""Spent"": S P E N T – has E, excluded.

Now, considering words without A and E:

- Print: P R I N T

- Grind: G R I N D

- Frond: F R O N D – F R O N D, but frond is a word.

- Front: F R O N T

- Drown: D R O W N – positions: D(1),R(2),O(3),W(4)? Wait, drown: D-R-O-W-N, so position 1-D,2-R,3-O,4-W,5-N. W is fourth? N is fifth? So not fourth N.

Drown has N at position 5.

To have N at position 4, it needs to be followed by another consonant or vowel.

Like ""drunk"": D R U N K – positions: D(1),R(2),U(3),N(4),K(5). U is third, N fourth.

Yes.

Similarly, ""trunk"": T R U N K

""Brink"": B R I N K

""Bring"": B R I N G

""Crony"": C R O N Y – has C.

Now, excluded C, so no crony.

So possible: print, grind, brink, bring, drunk, trunk, front, frond, irons, etc.

But avoid E: bring has no E? bring: B-R-I-N-G, no E.

grind: G-R-I-N-D, no E.

print: P-R-I-N-T, no E.

front: F-R-O-N-T, no E.

frond: F-R-O-N-D, no E.

irons: I-R-O-N-S, no E.

drunk: D-R-U-N-K, no E.

trunk: T-R-U-N-K, no E.

Bring has G at the end.

Now, I need to choose one to maximize information.

Since position 3 is a vowel, testing different vowels might be good.

In ""crane"", I guessed A which was wrong, and E was wrong, so vowels I or O or U could be an option.

U is less common, so perhaps I or O.

I could guess a word with I or O in position 3.

Also, test different consonants in position 1 and 5.

For example, guessing ""print"": if I guess PRINT, I'll get feedback on P, I, T.

Similarly, ""front"" has F,O,T.

""Grind"" has G,I,D.

""Brink"" has B,I,K.

B is not very common, but possible.

I recall that in Wordle, it's good to use words with diverse letters.

But here, position 2 and 4 are fixed, so I have to work around that.

Perhaps ""print"" is a solid choice because P and T are common letters, and I is a common vowel.

Similarly, ""front"" has O instead of I.

Another word: ""crony"" but C excluded.

""Prong"": P R O N G – positions: 1-P,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-G. Yes, N at fourth.

But ""prong"" doesn't have C,A,E, good.

""Wrong"": W R O N G – same.

But W and G are new.

But position 2 R and position 4 N.

Wrong: W(1),R(2),O(3),N(4),G(5). Yes.

Similarly, ""wring"": W R I N G – W(1),R(2),I(3),N(4),G(5)? ""wring"" is W-R-I-N-G, yes N at fourth? Positions: 1-W,2-R,3-I,4-N,5-G. N is fourth? In wring, it's four letters? No, wring is 5 letters: W,R,I,N,G. So position 4 is N? Sequence: letter 1: W, letter 2: R, letter 3: I, letter 4: N, letter 5: G. So yes, position 4 is N.

But the secret word has N as fourth letter, confirmed from feedback.

In guess ""crane"", position 4 was N, and it was correct, so N is indeed at position 4.

Back to guess.

I think ""print"" is a good option: P R I N T

Letters: P, I, T are all new.

Similarly, ""irons"" has I,O,S.

But in ""irons"", position 1 is I, which could be a vowel, but I can test it.

Position 1 doesn't have to be consonant; it could be vowel like in ""irons"".

""Irons"" might be good: tests I in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 5.

But position 1 I is less common as a vowel start, but possible.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""print"".

So I'll guess PRINT.

Confirm letters: P, R, I, N, T – R and N are fixed, P, I, T new.

Away from C,A,E, all good.

After this guess, I'll get feedback on these positions.

So, my second guess should be ""print"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word, so avoid words containing C.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A is not in the word, so avoid words containing A.
- N is in the correct position (fourth letter).
- E is not in the word, so avoid words containing E.

The secret word must be of the form: _ R _ N _, and it cannot contain C, A, or E.

I need to make a new guess that fits this pattern and tests new letters to gather more information. Possible words include:
- ""print"" (P R I N T)
- ""grind"" (G R I N D)
- ""front"" (F R O N T)
- ""irons"" (I R O N S)

""print"" is a good choice because:
- It includes the common vowel ""I"" in position 3 and consonants ""P"" and ""T"" in positions 1 and 5, all of which are untested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, A, and E.
- Testing ""I"" is valuable since other vowels (A, E) are already excluded, narrowing down the vowel options.

The guess ""print"" will provide feedback on P, I, and T, helping to refine the possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.",Guess 2: print -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FRONT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the secret word is 5 letters, and I'm given feedback from my first guess ""crane"":

- C: x (not in the word)

- R: ✓ (in the correct position, so R is the second letter)

- A: x (not in the word)

- N: ✓ (in the correct position, so N is the fourth letter)

- E: x (not in the word)

From this, I know that:

- R is the second letter of the secret word.

- N is the fourth letter of the secret word.

- The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

Since R and N are confirmed in their positions, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

Now, I need to guess another 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses letters not excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, E

Included letters: R (position 2), N (position 4)

I should avoid using C, A, E in my next guess because we know they're not in the word.

Possible letters: Since I'm eliminating vowels, A and E are out, so maybe other vowels like I, O, U could be in the word. Also consonants.

Common letters: I can think of words that have R as second letter and N as fourth letter.

Structure: ? R ? N ?

What words fit this pattern?

For example:

- BRINK: B R I N K

- BRING: B R I N G

- DRINK: D R I N K

- ORANG: but that's not common, and it's usually ""orange"" but ""orange"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- PRINT: P R I N T – here N is third letter? No, positions: P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) – so N is fourth letter? Position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: N, position 5: T. Yes.

Similarly:

- GRIND: G R I N D

- CRONY: but C is excluded, so can't have C.

C is excluded, so no words starting with C.

I should guess a word that has R in position 2, N in position 4, and doesn't contain C, A, E.

Also, since I have limited guesses, I want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

For instance, I could try including vowels like I or O or U.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ N _

- PRINT: P R I N T

- BRINE: but E is excluded, so BRINE has E, which is bad.

- BRAIN: has A, which is excluded.

A is excluded, so no A.

E is excluded.

So possible:

- BRINK: B R I N K

- BRING: B R I N G

- DRINK: D R I N K

- FRONT: F R O N T – O is a vowel, might be good to test.

- GRIND: G R I N D

- IRONS: I R O N S – but I in position 1?

Position: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), S (5). N is fourth, good.

Similarly, PRANK: but A is excluded, so no PRANK.

With excluded letters: avoid C, A, E.

Since R and N are fixed, I need to find letters for positions 1,3,5.

Position 1: can be consonant like B, D, F, G, P, etc., or vowel like I, U? But usually consonants.

Position 3: often a vowel in English words.

Position 5: consonant or vowel.

I should choose a word that has letters I haven't tried yet, to get more information.

For example, in first guess ""crane"", I tested C, R, A, N, E. R and N correct position, C,A,E absent.

So untested letters include B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

But only 5-letter words.

Common vowels left: I, O, U.

I could include one of them in position 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 5 could be consonants.

Let me think of examples.

Suppose I guess ""BRINK"": letters B, I, K new.

If I get feedback, I might learn about B, I, K.

Similarly, ""PRINT"": P, I, T.

""GRIND"": G, I, D.

""FRONT"": F, O, T.

Since position 3 might be a vowel, I should test a vowel there.

Options: I or O, as U is less common.

U possible, but rare.

For example, ""TRUNK"": T R U N K – but U in position 3.

But let's see.

First, I need a valid word.

Perhaps ""PRINT"" is a good choice because it uses P, I, T which are common, and I haven't tried them yet.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P O I N T – but position: P(1), O(2)? Wait, position 2 is R, must be R.

Position 2 is fixed as R, so it has to be ? R ? N ?

""POINT"" – P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) – but O is in position 2? No, position 2 is O, but it needs to be R. So ""POINT"" has O in position 2, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern because position 2 must be R.

So only words where second letter is R and fourth is N.

Like ""CRANE"" has R second, N fourth, but we already guessed that.

Other words: ""ORANG"" is not standard, better to pick common words.

Let's search for words ending with ""R _ N"" pattern? Wait, not ending.

Second letter R, fourth letter N.

So positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

Words: begin, brine, crone, drone, front, grain, grind, irons, crown, drown, frown, groin, groan, grown, brand, grand, grant, print, spent, sprint (too long), etc.

But exclude those with C, A, E.

- Begin: B E G I N – has E, excluded.

- Brine: B R I N E – has E.

- Crone: C R O N E – has C and E.

- Drone: D R O N E – has E.

- Front: F R O N T – good, no C,A,E.

- Grain: G R A I N – has A.

- Grind: G R I N D – good, no C,A,E.

- Irons: I R O N S – good.

- Crown: C R O W N – has C.

- Drown: D R O W N – good.

- Frown: F R O W N – good.

- Groin: G R O I N – positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4)? No, fourth letter should be N, but groin is G,R,O,I,N – position 4 is I, not N. Groin is 5 letters: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5). But N is fifth, not fourth. So not.

Fourth letter must be N, so position 4 N.

Groan: G R O A N – has A.

Groan: G,R,O,A,N – position 3 O, position 4 A? No, position 4 is A if we count: 1-G, 2-R, 3-O, 4-A, 5-N. But N is fifth, not fourth. Groan has N at end.

To have N at fourth position, it must be that fifth letter is something else.

For example, ""brand"": B R A N D – positions: 1-B, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-D. So N is fourth.

But ""brand"" has A, which is excluded.

Similarly, ""grand"": G R A N D – has A.

""Grant"": G R A N T – has A.

""Print"": P R I N T – no A, C, E. Good.

Irons: I R O N S – positions: 1-I,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-S.

Good.

""Spent"": S P E N T – has E, excluded.

Now, considering words without A and E:

- Print: P R I N T

- Grind: G R I N D

- Frond: F R O N D – F R O N D, but frond is a word.

- Front: F R O N T

- Drown: D R O W N – positions: D(1),R(2),O(3),W(4)? Wait, drown: D-R-O-W-N, so position 1-D,2-R,3-O,4-W,5-N. W is fourth? N is fifth? So not fourth N.

Drown has N at position 5.

To have N at position 4, it needs to be followed by another consonant or vowel.

Like ""drunk"": D R U N K – positions: D(1),R(2),U(3),N(4),K(5). U is third, N fourth.

Yes.

Similarly, ""trunk"": T R U N K

""Brink"": B R I N K

""Bring"": B R I N G

""Crony"": C R O N Y – has C.

Now, excluded C, so no crony.

So possible: print, grind, brink, bring, drunk, trunk, front, frond, irons, etc.

But avoid E: bring has no E? bring: B-R-I-N-G, no E.

grind: G-R-I-N-D, no E.

print: P-R-I-N-T, no E.

front: F-R-O-N-T, no E.

frond: F-R-O-N-D, no E.

irons: I-R-O-N-S, no E.

drunk: D-R-U-N-K, no E.

trunk: T-R-U-N-K, no E.

Bring has G at the end.

Now, I need to choose one to maximize information.

Since position 3 is a vowel, testing different vowels might be good.

In ""crane"", I guessed A which was wrong, and E was wrong, so vowels I or O or U could be an option.

U is less common, so perhaps I or O.

I could guess a word with I or O in position 3.

Also, test different consonants in position 1 and 5.

For example, guessing ""print"": if I guess PRINT, I'll get feedback on P, I, T.

Similarly, ""front"" has F,O,T.

""Grind"" has G,I,D.

""Brink"" has B,I,K.

B is not very common, but possible.

I recall that in Wordle, it's good to use words with diverse letters.

But here, position 2 and 4 are fixed, so I have to work around that.

Perhaps ""print"" is a solid choice because P and T are common letters, and I is a common vowel.

Similarly, ""front"" has O instead of I.

Another word: ""crony"" but C excluded.

""Prong"": P R O N G – positions: 1-P,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-G. Yes, N at fourth.

But ""prong"" doesn't have C,A,E, good.

""Wrong"": W R O N G – same.

But W and G are new.

But position 2 R and position 4 N.

Wrong: W(1),R(2),O(3),N(4),G(5). Yes.

Similarly, ""wring"": W R I N G – W(1),R(2),I(3),N(4),G(5)? ""wring"" is W-R-I-N-G, yes N at fourth? Positions: 1-W,2-R,3-I,4-N,5-G. N is fourth? In wring, it's four letters? No, wring is 5 letters: W,R,I,N,G. So position 4 is N? Sequence: letter 1: W, letter 2: R, letter 3: I, letter 4: N, letter 5: G. So yes, position 4 is N.

But the secret word has N as fourth letter, confirmed from feedback.

In guess ""crane"", position 4 was N, and it was correct, so N is indeed at position 4.

Back to guess.

I think ""print"" is a good option: P R I N T

Letters: P, I, T are all new.

Similarly, ""irons"" has I,O,S.

But in ""irons"", position 1 is I, which could be a vowel, but I can test it.

Position 1 doesn't have to be consonant; it could be vowel like in ""irons"".

""Irons"" might be good: tests I in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 5.

But position 1 I is less common as a vowel start, but possible.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""print"".

So I'll guess PRINT.

Confirm letters: P, R, I, N, T – R and N are fixed, P, I, T new.

Away from C,A,E, all good.

After this guess, I'll get feedback on these positions.

So, my second guess should be ""print"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word, so avoid words containing C.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A is not in the word, so avoid words containing A.
- N is in the correct position (fourth letter).
- E is not in the word, so avoid words containing E.

The secret word must be of the form: _ R _ N _, and it cannot contain C, A, or E.

I need to make a new guess that fits this pattern and tests new letters to gather more information. Possible words include:
- ""print"" (P R I N T)
- ""grind"" (G R I N D)
- ""front"" (F R O N T)
- ""irons"" (I R O N S)

""print"" is a good choice because:
- It includes the common vowel ""I"" in position 3 and consonants ""P"" and ""T"" in positions 1 and 5, all of which are untested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, A, and E.
- Testing ""I"" is valuable since other vowels (A, E) are already excluded, narrowing down the vowel options.

The guess ""print"" will provide feedback on P, I, and T, helping to refine the possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

Wait, not ending.\n\nSecond letter R, fourth letter N.\n\nSo positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?\n\nWords: begin, brine, crone, drone, front, grain, grind, irons, crown, drown, frown, groin, groan, grown, brand, grand, grant, print, spent, sprint (too long), etc.\n\nBut exclude those with C, A, E.\n\n- Begin: B E G I N – has E, excluded.\n\n- Brine: B R I N E – has E.\n\n- Crone: C R O N E – has C and E.\n\n- Drone: D R O N E – has E.\n\n- Front: F R O N T – good, no C,A,E.\n\n- Grain: G R A I N – has A.\n\n- Grind: G R I N D – good, no C,A,E.\n\n- Irons: I R O N S – good.\n\n- Crown: C R O W N – has C.\n\n- Drown: D R O W N – good.\n\n- Frown: F R O W N – good.\n\n- Groin: G R O I N – positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4)? No, fourth letter should be N, but groin is G,R,O,I,N – position 4 is I, not N. Groin is 5 letters: G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5). But N is fifth, not fourth. So not.\n\nFourth letter must be N, so position 4 N.\n\nGroan: G R O A N – has A.\n\nGroan: G,R,O,A,N – position 3 O, position 4 A? No, position 4 is A if we count: 1-G, 2-R, 3-O, 4-A, 5-N. But N is fifth, not fourth. Groan has N at end.\n\nTo have N at fourth position, it must be that fifth letter is something else.\n\nFor example, ""brand"": B R A N D – positions: 1-B, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-D. So N is fourth.\n\nBut ""brand"" has A, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""grand"": G R A N D – has A.\n\n""Grant"": G R A N T – has A.\n\n""Print"": P R I N T – no A, C, E. Good.\n\nIrons: I R O N S – positions: 1-I,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-S.\n\nGood.\n\n""Spent"": S P E N T – has E, excluded.\n\nNow, considering words without A and E:\n\n- Print: P R I N T\n\n- Grind: G R I N D\n\n- Frond: F R O N D – F R O N D, but frond is a word.\n\n- Front: F R O N T\n\n- Drown: D R O W N – positions: D(1),R(2),O(3),W(4)? Wait, drown: D-R-O-W-N, so position 1-D,2-R,3-O,4-W,5-N. W is fourth? N is fifth? So not fourth N.\n\nDrown has N at position 5.\n\nTo have N at position 4, it needs to be followed by another consonant or vowel.\n\nLike ""drunk"": D R U N K – positions: D(1),R(2),U(3),N(4),K(5). U is third, N fourth.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, ""trunk"": T R U N K\n\n""Brink"": B R I N K\n\n""Bring"": B R I N G\n\n""Crony"": C R O N Y – has C.\n\nNow, excluded C, so no crony.\n\nSo possible: print, grind, brink, bring, drunk, trunk, front, frond, irons, etc.\n\nBut avoid E: bring has no E? bring: B-R-I-N-G, no E.\n\ngrind: G-R-I-N-D, no E.\n\nprint: P-R-I-N-T, no E.\n\nfront: F-R-O-N-T, no E.\n\nfrond: F-R-O-N-D, no E.\n\nirons: I-R-O-N-S, no E.\n\ndrunk: D-R-U-N-K, no E.\n\ntrunk: T-R-U-N-K, no E.\n\nBring has G at the end.\n\nNow, I need to choose one to maximize information.\n\nSince position 3 is a vowel, testing different vowels might be good.\n\nIn ""crane"", I guessed A which was wrong, and E was wrong, so vowels I or O or U could be an option.\n\nU is less common, so perhaps I or O.\n\nI could guess a word with I or O in position 3.\n\nAlso, test different consonants in position 1 and 5.\n\nFor example, guessing ""print"": if I guess PRINT, I\'ll get feedback on P, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""front"" has F,O,T.\n\n""Grind"" has G,I,D.\n\n""Brink"" has B,I,K.\n\nB is not very common, but possible.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, it\'s good to use words with diverse letters.\n\nBut here, position 2 and 4 are fixed, so I have to work around that.\n\nPerhaps ""print"" is a solid choice because P and T are common letters, and I is a common vowel.\n\nSimilarly, ""front"" has O instead of I.\n\nAnother word: ""crony"" but C excluded.\n\n""Prong"": P R O N G – positions: 1-P,2-R,3-O,4-N,5-G. Yes, N at fourth.\n\nBut ""prong"" doesn\'t have C,A,E, good.\n\n""Wrong"": W R O N G – same.\n\nBut W and G are new.\n\nBut position 2 R and position 4 N.\n\nWrong: W(1),R(2),O(3),N(4),G(5). Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""wring"": W R I N G – W(1),R(2),I(3),N(4),G(5)? ""wring"" is W-R-I-N-G, yes N at fourth? Positions: 1-W,2-R,3-I,4-N,5-G. N is fourth? In wring, it\'s four letters? No, wring is 5 letters: W,R,I,N,G. So position 4 is N? Sequence: letter 1: W, letter 2: R, letter 3: I, letter 4: N, letter 5: G. So yes, position 4 is N.\n\nBut the secret word has N as fourth letter, confirmed from feedback.\n\nIn guess ""crane"", position 4 was N, and it was correct, so N is indeed at position 4.\n\nBack to guess.\n\nI think ""print"" is a good option: P R I N T\n\nLetters: P, I, T are all new.\n\nSimilarly, ""irons"" has I,O,S.\n\nBut in ""irons"", position 1 is I, which could be a vowel, but I can test it.\n\nPosition 1 doesn\'t have to be consonant; it could be vowel like in ""irons"".\n\n""Irons"" might be good: tests I in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 5.\n\nBut position 1 I is less common as a vowel start, but possible.\n\nTo keep it simple, I\'ll go with ""print"".\n\nSo I\'ll guess PRINT.\n\nConfirm letters: P, R, I, N, T – R and N are fixed, P, I, T new.\n\nAway from C,A,E, all good.\n\nAfter this guess, I\'ll get feedback on these positions.\n\nSo, my second guess should be ""print"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word, so avoid words containing C.\n- R is in the correct position (second letter).\n- A is not in the word, so avoid words containing A.\n- N is in the correct position (fourth letter).\n- E is not in the word, so avoid words containing E.\n\nThe secret word must be of the form: _ R _ N _, and it cannot contain C, A, or E.\n\nI need to make a new guess that fits this pattern and tests new letters to gather more information. Possible words include:\n- ""print"" (P R I N T)\n- ""grind"" (G R I N D)\n- ""front"" (F R O N T)\n- ""irons"" (I R O N S)\n\n""print"" is a good choice because:\n- It includes the common vowel ""I"" in position 3 and consonants ""P"" and ""T"" in positions 1 and 5, all of which are untested.\n- It avoids the excluded letters C, A, and E.\n- Testing ""I"" is valuable since other vowels (A, E) are already excluded, narrowing down the vowel options.\n\nThe guess ""print"" will provide feedback on P, I, and T, helping to refine the possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n<guess>print</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: print -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is R
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) -> so the fourth letter is N
- E: not in the word (x)

Guess 2: ""print""
- P: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) -> confirmed second letter R
- I: not in the word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) -> confirmed fourth letter N
- T: correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter is T

From the feedback of ""print"", we see that T is in the correct position (fifth letter). Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N T

Additionally, we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, A, E, P, I.

We must avoid using these letters: C, A, E, P, I.

Now, the secret word pattern is: [letter1] R [letter3] N T

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, P, I

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we are forming a 5-letter word: position1, R (fixed), position3, N (fixed), T (fixed).

So we only need to choose a letter for position1 and position3.

Position1: must be a consonant (since vowels A, E, I are excluded, and O, U, Y are possible but Y is sometimes a consonant). However, in English, position1 can be a vowel (like O, U) or consonant.

Position3: must be a vowel or consonant, but given that we have few vowels left (O, U, and sometimes Y), it might be a vowel.

We have two positions to determine: position1 and position3.

We should choose a word that tests common letters for these positions.

Possible words that fit _ R _ N T:

- ""front"": F R O N T -> but we haven't tried F or O.
- ""grunt"": G R U N T -> G and U.
- ""brunt"": B R U N T -> B and U.
- ""trout"": T R O U T -> but T is already at the end, and we have T at position5, but in ""trout"", position1 is T and position5 is T? Let's see: T(1), R(2), O(3), U(4)? No, the pattern is _ R _ N T, so position4 must be N. ""trout"" is T-R-O-U-T, so position4 is U, not N. So not.

We need position4 to be N, so the word must have N at position4 and T at position5.

So, words ending with ""NT"": but specifically, the second letter is R.

So, the pattern is: [1]R[3]NT

Now, what words have this pattern?

- front: F R O N T
- grunt: G R U N T
- brunt: B R U N T
- burnt: B U R N T? No, that would be B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5) -> but position2 is U, not R. So not.

""burnt"" has R at position3, but we need R at position2.

So, only words where the second letter is R and fourth is N, fifth is T.

Other words:
- ""wrist"": W R I S T -> but position4 is S, not N. And I is excluded.
- ""frost"": F R O S T -> position4 is S, not N.
- ""grant"": G R A N T -> but A is excluded.
- ""brand"": B R A N D -> A excluded, and ends with D, not T.

So, back to the list: front, grunt, brunt.

Also, ""dront"" is not a word.

""prunt"" not a word.

""trant"" not common.

""wrunt"" not a word.

Another one: ""aroint"" is too long.

Perhaps ""crwth"" is not 5 letters.

So, common words: front, grunt, brunt.

But ""brunt"" and ""grunt"" are valid.

Also, ""fro nt"" no.

What about ""wrynt""? Not a word.

So, we have:
- front: F R O N T
- grunt: G R U N T
- brunt: B R U N T

Now, we need to choose one to guess. Since we have to test both position1 and position3, we can pick one that uses a common letter for position3.

But we also want to maximize information. However, since two positions are fixed (R, N, T), and only two are unknown, we might solve it in this guess.

But we have three possibilities: front, grunt, brunt.

We can guess one of them.

But note that in ""front"", the third letter is O, and in ""grunt"" and ""brunt"", the third letter is U.

We don't know which vowel it is.

Also, position1 could be F, G, or B.

We should guess a word that includes letters we haven't tried to get more information if it's not correct.

But since we have only two unknowns, if we guess one and it's wrong, we can deduce.

But we have three options, so if we guess ""front"" and it's wrong, then we know it's not F and not O, so it must be either ""grunt"" or ""brunt"", meaning position1 is B or G, and position3 is U.

Similarly, if we guess ""grunt"" and it's wrong, then it could be ""front"" or ""brunt"".

But to be efficient, we might guess a word that can test multiple possibilities.

However, with the constraints, we don't have a word that tests both F and B, for example, because the pattern is fixed.

Another idea: is there a word that has the pattern but with different letters? For example, ""draft"" is D R A F T, but A excluded and position4 is F, not N.

No.

""drift"": D R I F T, I excluded and position4 F.

No.

So, only a few options.

We can also consider ""wront"" but not a word.

Or ""croft"": C R O F T, C excluded and position4 F.

No.

So, back to front, grunt, brunt.

Now, we have excluded P and I from the second guess, so we can't use them.

In the feedback for ""print"", T was correct, so T is fixed at position5.

Now, for the next guess, I should choose one of these.

But let's see the letters: for position3, it could be O or U.

We haven't tested O or U yet.

Similarly, for position1, we haven't tested F, B, G.

So, if I guess ""front"", I test F and O.

If I get feedback that F is correct and O is correct, then it's ""front"".

If F is correct but O is wrong, then O is not in the word, but in the pattern, position3 must be a letter, so if O is wrong, then it must be U, but ""front"" has O, so if O is not correct, then ""front"" is not the word.

Similarly, if F is not in the word, then position1 is not F, so it must be B or G.

But we don't get direct feedback on position3 if we guess ""front"".

The feedback will tell us for each letter:

- Position1: F, if it's in the word and correct position or not.

- Position2: R, which we know is correct.

- Position3: O, if it's in the word and if it's in correct position.

- Position4: N, correct.

- Position5: T, correct.

So, for position3, if we get O(✓), then O is correct and in position.

If we get O(x), then O is not in the word at all.

If we get O(-), then O is in the word but wrong position, but since position3 is the only unknown position, and O is not there, it might be elsewhere, but the word has only 5 letters, and we know positions 2,4,5 are fixed, position1 is unknown, but if O is in the word, it must be in position1 or position3. But position1 is a consonant usually, but not necessarily.

For example, if O is in the word but not in position3, it could be in position1? But position1 is the first letter, which can be a vowel, like in ""ocean"", but we have pattern _ R _ N T, so if O is in position1, then the word would be O R ? N T, and position3 must be filled.

But in that case, if we guess ""front"", and O is in position1, but we have F in position1, so if F is not correct, and O is present, we might get O(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position.

But let's not overcomplicate.

Given the pattern, the only possibilities are front, grunt, brunt.

We can list them:

1. front: F R O N T

2. grunt: G R U N T

3. brunt: B R U N T

Now, to distinguish, we can guess one.

Since ""brunt"" and ""grunt"" both have U in position3, if we guess ""front"" and it's not correct, then we know that position3 must be U, and position1 is either B or G.

Then we can guess between them.

Similarly, if we guess ""grunt"", and it's not correct, then it could be front or brunt.

But ""front"" has O, ""brunt"" has U, so if we guess ""grunt"" and get U(✓), then it's either grunt or brunt, but position1 would be G or B.

If U is not correct, then it must be front.

But U not correct would mean U is not in the word, so then position3 must be O, so it must be ""front"".

Similarly, if we guess ""front"" and O is not correct, then O is not in the word, so position3 must be U, and then position1 is B or G.

Then we need another guess.

To minimize worst case, we might guess a word that can cover more.

But we don't have such a word.

Another word: is ""trout"" possible? No, because position4 must be N.

""Wrought"" is too long.

I think we have to choose from the three.

Perhaps ""brent"" but ""brent"" is B R E N T, but E is excluded, and it's 5 letters? B,R,E,N,T. But E is excluded, so not.

Similarly, ""drent"" not a word.

So, only front, grunt, brunt.

Now, let's see the frequency or commonality.

""Front"" is a common word, so perhaps start with that.

But we can also consider that in position1, B, F, G are all possible.

Similarly, for position3, O or U.

I think I'll go with ""front"" as it tests O, which is a vowel we haven't tried.

So, guess ""front"".

If it's not ""front"", then we know position3 is U, and position1 is not F, so B or G.

Then we can guess ""grunt"" or ""brunt"" next.

But since we have only 6 guesses, we are on guess 3, so we have room.

So, let's guess ""front"".

<guess>front</guess>

But let's confirm the format.

In the feedback, for ""print"", T was correct, so we have _ R _ N T.

And ""front"" fits: F R O N T.

Yes.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)**  
  This means:  
  - C, A, and E are not in the word.  
  - R is in the correct position (position 2).  
  - N is in the correct position (position 4).  
  The secret word pattern is: _ R _ N _

- **Guess 2: ""print"" → Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - P and I are not in the word.  
  - R, N, and T are in the correct positions (positions 2, 4, and 5).  
  The secret word pattern is now: _ R _ N T

**Excluded letters (not in the word):** C, A, E, P, I  
**Included letters with positions:**  
- Position 2: R (fixed)  
- Position 4: N (fixed)  
- Position 5: T (fixed)  

**Unknown positions:**  
- Position 1: Must be a letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Position 3: Must be a letter not excluded (same as above), and likely a vowel (O or U) since A, E, I are excluded.  

**Possible words fitting the pattern _ R _ N T and avoiding excluded letters:**  
- ""front"" (F R O N T)  
- ""grunt"" (G R U N T)  
- ""brunt"" (B R U N T)  

**Strategy for the next guess:**  
- ""front"" is chosen to test the common vowel ""O"" in position 3 and ""F"" in position 1.  
- If ""front"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the options:  
  - If O is absent (x), position 3 must be U (since it's the only vowel option left), and position 1 would be B or G.  
  - If F is absent (x), position 1 must be B or G.  
- This guess maximizes information by testing new letters (F and O) while fitting the known pattern.

<guess>front</guess>",front,"We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is R
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) -> so the fourth letter is N
- E: not in the word (x)

Guess 2: ""print""
- P: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) -> confirmed second letter R
- I: not in the word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) -> confirmed fourth letter N
- T: correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter is T

From the feedback of ""print"", we see that T is in the correct position (fifth letter). Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N T

Additionally, we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, A, E, P, I.

We must avoid using these letters: C, A, E, P, I.

Now, the secret word pattern is: [letter1] R [letter3] N T

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, P, I

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we are forming a 5-letter word: position1, R (fixed), position3, N (fixed), T (fixed).

So we only need to choose a letter for position1 and position3.

Position1: must be a consonant (since vowels A, E, I are excluded, and O, U, Y are possible but Y is sometimes a consonant). However, in English, position1 can be a vowel (like O, U) or consonant.

Position3: must be a vowel or consonant, but given that we have few vowels left (O, U, and sometimes Y), it might be a vowel.

We have two positions to determine: position1 and position3.

We should choose a word that tests common letters for these positions.

Possible words that fit _ R _ N T:

- ""front"": F R O N T -> but we haven't tried F or O.
- ""grunt"": G R U N T -> G and U.
- ""brunt"": B R U N T -> B and U.
- ""trout"": T R O U T -> but T is already at the end, and we have T at position5, but in ""trout"", position1 is T and position5 is T? Let's see: T(1), R(2), O(3), U(4)? No, the pattern is _ R _ N T, so position4 must be N. ""trout"" is T-R-O-U-T, so position4 is U, not N. So not.

We need position4 to be N, so the word must have N at position4 and T at position5.

So, words ending with ""NT"": but specifically, the second letter is R.

So, the pattern is: [1]R[3]NT

Now, what words have this pattern?

- front: F R O N T
- grunt: G R U N T
- brunt: B R U N T
- burnt: B U R N T? No, that would be B(1), U(2), R(3), N(4), T(5) -> but position2 is U, not R. So not.

""burnt"" has R at position3, but we need R at position2.

So, only words where the second letter is R and fourth is N, fifth is T.

Other words:
- ""wrist"": W R I S T -> but position4 is S, not N. And I is excluded.
- ""frost"": F R O S T -> position4 is S, not N.
- ""grant"": G R A N T -> but A is excluded.
- ""brand"": B R A N D -> A excluded, and ends with D, not T.

So, back to the list: front, grunt, brunt.

Also, ""dront"" is not a word.

""prunt"" not a word.

""trant"" not common.

""wrunt"" not a word.

Another one: ""aroint"" is too long.

Perhaps ""crwth"" is not 5 letters.

So, common words: front, grunt, brunt.

But ""brunt"" and ""grunt"" are valid.

Also, ""fro nt"" no.

What about ""wrynt""? Not a word.

So, we have:
- front: F R O N T
- grunt: G R U N T
- brunt: B R U N T

Now, we need to choose one to guess. Since we have to test both position1 and position3, we can pick one that uses a common letter for position3.

But we also want to maximize information. However, since two positions are fixed (R, N, T), and only two are unknown, we might solve it in this guess.

But we have three possibilities: front, grunt, brunt.

We can guess one of them.

But note that in ""front"", the third letter is O, and in ""grunt"" and ""brunt"", the third letter is U.

We don't know which vowel it is.

Also, position1 could be F, G, or B.

We should guess a word that includes letters we haven't tried to get more information if it's not correct.

But since we have only two unknowns, if we guess one and it's wrong, we can deduce.

But we have three options, so if we guess ""front"" and it's wrong, then we know it's not F and not O, so it must be either ""grunt"" or ""brunt"", meaning position1 is B or G, and position3 is U.

Similarly, if we guess ""grunt"" and it's wrong, then it could be ""front"" or ""brunt"".

But to be efficient, we might guess a word that can test multiple possibilities.

However, with the constraints, we don't have a word that tests both F and B, for example, because the pattern is fixed.

Another idea: is there a word that has the pattern but with different letters? For example, ""draft"" is D R A F T, but A excluded and position4 is F, not N.

No.

""drift"": D R I F T, I excluded and position4 F.

No.

So, only a few options.

We can also consider ""wront"" but not a word.

Or ""croft"": C R O F T, C excluded and position4 F.

No.

So, back to front, grunt, brunt.

Now, we have excluded P and I from the second guess, so we can't use them.

In the feedback for ""print"", T was correct, so T is fixed at position5.

Now, for the next guess, I should choose one of these.

But let's see the letters: for position3, it could be O or U.

We haven't tested O or U yet.

Similarly, for position1, we haven't tested F, B, G.

So, if I guess ""front"", I test F and O.

If I get feedback that F is correct and O is correct, then it's ""front"".

If F is correct but O is wrong, then O is not in the word, but in the pattern, position3 must be a letter, so if O is wrong, then it must be U, but ""front"" has O, so if O is not correct, then ""front"" is not the word.

Similarly, if F is not in the word, then position1 is not F, so it must be B or G.

But we don't get direct feedback on position3 if we guess ""front"".

The feedback will tell us for each letter:

- Position1: F, if it's in the word and correct position or not.

- Position2: R, which we know is correct.

- Position3: O, if it's in the word and if it's in correct position.

- Position4: N, correct.

- Position5: T, correct.

So, for position3, if we get O(✓), then O is correct and in position.

If we get O(x), then O is not in the word at all.

If we get O(-), then O is in the word but wrong position, but since position3 is the only unknown position, and O is not there, it might be elsewhere, but the word has only 5 letters, and we know positions 2,4,5 are fixed, position1 is unknown, but if O is in the word, it must be in position1 or position3. But position1 is a consonant usually, but not necessarily.

For example, if O is in the word but not in position3, it could be in position1? But position1 is the first letter, which can be a vowel, like in ""ocean"", but we have pattern _ R _ N T, so if O is in position1, then the word would be O R ? N T, and position3 must be filled.

But in that case, if we guess ""front"", and O is in position1, but we have F in position1, so if F is not correct, and O is present, we might get O(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position.

But let's not overcomplicate.

Given the pattern, the only possibilities are front, grunt, brunt.

We can list them:

1. front: F R O N T

2. grunt: G R U N T

3. brunt: B R U N T

Now, to distinguish, we can guess one.

Since ""brunt"" and ""grunt"" both have U in position3, if we guess ""front"" and it's not correct, then we know that position3 must be U, and position1 is either B or G.

Then we can guess between them.

Similarly, if we guess ""grunt"", and it's not correct, then it could be front or brunt.

But ""front"" has O, ""brunt"" has U, so if we guess ""grunt"" and get U(✓), then it's either grunt or brunt, but position1 would be G or B.

If U is not correct, then it must be front.

But U not correct would mean U is not in the word, so then position3 must be O, so it must be ""front"".

Similarly, if we guess ""front"" and O is not correct, then O is not in the word, so position3 must be U, and then position1 is B or G.

Then we need another guess.

To minimize worst case, we might guess a word that can cover more.

But we don't have such a word.

Another word: is ""trout"" possible? No, because position4 must be N.

""Wrought"" is too long.

I think we have to choose from the three.

Perhaps ""brent"" but ""brent"" is B R E N T, but E is excluded, and it's 5 letters? B,R,E,N,T. But E is excluded, so not.

Similarly, ""drent"" not a word.

So, only front, grunt, brunt.

Now, let's see the frequency or commonality.

""Front"" is a common word, so perhaps start with that.

But we can also consider that in position1, B, F, G are all possible.

Similarly, for position3, O or U.

I think I'll go with ""front"" as it tests O, which is a vowel we haven't tried.

So, guess ""front"".

If it's not ""front"", then we know position3 is U, and position1 is not F, so B or G.

Then we can guess ""grunt"" or ""brunt"" next.

But since we have only 6 guesses, we are on guess 3, so we have room.

So, let's guess ""front"".

<guess>front</guess>

But let's confirm the format.

In the feedback, for ""print"", T was correct, so we have _ R _ N T.

And ""front"" fits: F R O N T.

Yes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)**  
  This means:  
  - C, A, and E are not in the word.  
  - R is in the correct position (position 2).  
  - N is in the correct position (position 4).  
  The secret word pattern is: _ R _ N _

- **Guess 2: ""print"" → Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - P and I are not in the word.  
  - R, N, and T are in the correct positions (positions 2, 4, and 5).  
  The secret word pattern is now: _ R _ N T

**Excluded letters (not in the word):** C, A, E, P, I  
**Included letters with positions:**  
- Position 2: R (fixed)  
- Position 4: N (fixed)  
- Position 5: T (fixed)  

**Unknown positions:**  
- Position 1: Must be a letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Position 3: Must be a letter not excluded (same as above), and likely a vowel (O or U) since A, E, I are excluded.  

**Possible words fitting the pattern _ R _ N T and avoiding excluded letters:**  
- ""front"" (F R O N T)  
- ""grunt"" (G R U N T)  
- ""brunt"" (B R U N T)  

**Strategy for the next guess:**  
- ""front"" is chosen to test the common vowel ""O"" in position 3 and ""F"" in position 1.  
- If ""front"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the options:  
  - If O is absent (x), position 3 must be U (since it's the only vowel option left), and position 1 would be B or G.  
  - If F is absent (x), position 1 must be B or G.  
- This guess maximizes information by testing new letters (F and O) while fitting the known pattern.",Guess 3: front -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
