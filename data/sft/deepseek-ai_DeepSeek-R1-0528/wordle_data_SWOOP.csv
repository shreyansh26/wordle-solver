We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle are like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, and N is also common).

 So my first guess will be: CRANE
</think>
My initial thought is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters, including both vowels and consonants, to test multiple frequent letters at once. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which often appear in English words. This should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

We are given feedback that for the guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since we have no correct letters so far, we need a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Let's think about common English letters. After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the remaining letters include:
 Vowels: O, U, I (though I is sometimes a consonant, but we treat it as vowel here for simplicity)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We should aim for a word that includes some of the most frequent remaining consonants: S, T, L, M, etc., and possibly vowels O or U.

 A good candidate for the next guess might be ""SPOUT"" or ""MOIST"", but let's see:

 Option 1: ""SPOUT"" - uses S, P, O, U, T (all letters not excluded)
 Option 2: ""MOIST"" - uses M, O, I, S, T (also all allowed)

 However, let me check if there are better options. Another common starting word when excluding these letters is ""BUILT"", but we don't have B.

 Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L.

 But note: we want to maximize the use of common letters and cover as many new letters as possible.

 After some consideration, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T which are all common.

 Alternatively, ""LUCKY"" is not possible because C and Y might not be as common and also we excluded C. Actually, C is excluded.

 Let me list words that avoid C, R, A, N, E:

 Some possibilities: light, might, sight, tight, but these have G, H, T, and I.

 However, we don't know if G, H, T, I are in the word. We are going to test.

 Another common word: ""DOUBT"" - D,O,U,B,T. But B is also common.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters if possible? But since we have no hits, we can use any.

 Actually, we are allowed to repeat letters? But in the guess we are not repeating because we don't know.

 I think ""SLIMY"" might be an option, but let's avoid Y for now? Or use it?

 Another good word: ""HOUSE"" - but E is excluded, so not allowed.

 Wait, E is excluded so we cannot use E. Therefore, ""HOUSE"" is not allowed.

 Similarly, ""MOIST"" is allowed: M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" - P, O, I, U, S. That's also good.

 But let's choose ""MOIST"" because it has a good mix.

 After thinking, I will go with ""MOIST"".

 Guess 2: moist

 Let's see what feedback we get.
</think>
Our first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word). This eliminates 5 common letters. For our second guess, we need a word with entirely new letters. 

I'll choose **""MOIST""** because:
- It avoids C, R, A, N, E completely
- Contains high-frequency consonants (S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- Tests new letters: M, O, I, S, T
- Gives broad coverage of remaining common English letters

This sets us up to efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: so the secret word has none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"":
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -)
- M, I, T are not in the word (marked with x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", O was in the second position and S was in the fourth position. So in the secret word, O is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- The secret word does not contain M, I, T (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

Now, we also know that the secret word must have O and S, and we have to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes O and S (since they are in the word, and we want to find their correct positions)
- Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.
- Uses other common letters to test.

Available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones: 
Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, T (8 letters)
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and S must be in the word, so we should include them in our next guess.

We also know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""moist"") and S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that has O and S, and three other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Common letters left: L, U, D, P, G, B, etc.

Let's try to form a word that has O and S, and also includes other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""LOUSE"" but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- ""SOULS"" but that has two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates. But we must avoid E.

Another idea: ""SCOLD"" but C is excluded -> not allowed.

""BOLUS"" - B, O, L, U, S. This uses B, O, L, U, S. All available letters.

But let's check the positions: we need to place O and S in positions that are not forbidden for this guess? Actually, the feedback only said that in ""moist"", O was not in position 2 and S not in position 4. But in a new word, we can try O in other positions and S in other positions.

We can try to put O in a different position and S in a different position to test.

In ""BOLUS"":
- B in position 1
- O in position 2 -> but wait, we know that O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback from ""moist"" said that O is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't mean O cannot be in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, it means that in the secret word, O is present but not in the second position. So if we put O in position 2 in our new guess, we might get a ""x"" if it's wrong, but we already know it's not position 2? Actually, we can use that to test other positions.

But note: we are allowed to put O in position 2 again? But we know it's not correct, so it might be a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting S in position 4.

So in our new guess, we should put O in a position other than 2, and S in a position other than 4.

In ""BOLUS"", we have:
Position 1: B
Position 2: O -> this is position 2, which we know is wrong for O. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has O not in position 2 and S not in position 4.

Let me think of words with O and S, and without the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But Y is available? Yes. And positions: 
  L (1), O (2) -> O in position 2 again? We know O is not in position 2, so we shouldn't put it there.

We need to avoid position 2 for O.

So let's try to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, S should not be in position 4, so we can put S in 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with O in position 1, for example.

- ""OUCHS"" - not a word.
- ""OUNCES"" - too long.

How about ""SOUTH"": S, O, U, T, H. But T is excluded? Yes, T is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback, T is x). So we cannot use T.

Another: ""SOWED"" - but E and D? E is excluded.

""SOLID"" - but I is excluded? From ""moist"", I is x, so excluded.

""SOLAR"" - but A and R are excluded.

""SOGGY"" - S, O, G, G, Y. But two G's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But it's a valid word. However, we are testing new letters.

But let's see: S in position 1, O in position 2 -> O in position 2 is not allowed? We know O is not in position 2 in the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we will get a ""-"" or ""x""? Actually, since O is in the word but not in position 2, if we put it in position 2, we would get a ""-"" (meaning it's in the word but wrong position) or if the secret word has only one O and we put it in position 2, we get ""-"". But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. We should avoid using position 2 for O to save a spot for testing a new position.

So we want to put O in a position we haven't tried. In ""moist"", O was in position 2, so we haven't tried positions 1,3,4,5 for O.

Similarly, S was in position 4 in ""moist"", so we haven't tried positions 1,2,3,5 for S.

So ideally, we put O in one of {1,3,4,5} and S in one of {1,2,3,5}.

Let me try to form such a word.

Option: put O in position 3 and S in position 1? For example, ""USOLE"" not a word.

Or O in position 1: ""OAKS"" too short? 5-letter: ""OASIS"" but has two S and A is excluded. A is excluded.

""OLLAS"" - not common.

How about ""FOCUS"" - F, O, C, U, S. But C is excluded.

""DOGES"" - D, O, G, E, S. E is excluded.

""GOLFS"" - G, O, L, F, S. This seems possible. 
Positions: G(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again? We are trying to avoid that.

We need to avoid position 2 for O.

So let's try O in position 3: 
For example, ""BLOBS"" - B, L, O, B, S -> but two B's? And O in position 3. S in position 5. 
But ""BLOBS"" is a word? Yes, but we have duplicate B. Also, we can test.

But let's see: positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: O -> this is a new position for O (not tried before)
4: B -> duplicate, but we don't know if B is in the word or not.
5: S -> and S is not in position 4, so position 5 is new for S.

But we are using B twice, which might not be efficient.

Another word: ""PLOPS"" - similar issue.

""SHOWN"" - S, H, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""SHOWY"" - S, H, O, W, Y. 
Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). 
This seems good: 
- O is in position 3 (new position) 
- S is in position 1 (new position, since previously it was in 4)
- Avoids excluded letters: S, H, O, W, Y are all allowed (since not in excluded list: A,C,E,I,M,N,R,T)

Excluded: A,C,E,I,M,N,R,T. So H, O, W, Y are available.

So ""SHOWY"" is a valid word.

But note: we are using O and S, and we are testing H, W, Y.

Another possibility: ""SOUPY"" - S, O, U, P, Y. 
Positions: S(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again, which we want to avoid.

So ""SHOWY"" is better because O is in position 3.

Another word: ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S. 
Positions: F(1), O(2) -> again position 2 for O.

""LOUIS"" - L, O, U, I, S. But I is excluded.

""DOUBS"" - D, O, U, B, S. 
Positions: D(1), O(2) -> O in position 2.

We are having trouble avoiding position 2 for O.

How about O in position 4 or 5?

For example, ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But two S's? And O not included.

We need to include O.

""GUILD"" - no O.

""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. 
Positions: W(1), O(2) -> again position 2.

""FLOPS"" - F, L, O, P, S. 
Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), P(4), S(5). 
This is good: 
- O in position 3 (new) 
- S in position 5 (new, since previously it was in 4)
- Letters: F, L, O, P, S. All available (not excluded).

And ""FLOPS"" is a valid English word.

Similarly, ""CLOPS"" but C is excluded.

So ""FLOPS"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""GLOSS"" but two S's and O in position 2? ""GLOSS"" is G,L,O,S,S -> O in position 3? 
Positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), S(4), S(5). 
But S in position 4: we know from feedback that S is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback said S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4, we might get a ""-"" or ""x""? But we know it's not position 4, so it would be a waste? Actually, if the secret word has only one S, then putting S in position 4 would get an ""x"" because it's the wrong position? But we already know it's not position 4, so we don't gain new information. We should avoid position 4 for S.

In ""GLOSS"", we have S in position 4 and 5. We are testing position 4 for S, which we know is wrong, so that might not be efficient. Also, we are using duplicate S.

So ""FLOPS"" is better: no duplicates, and positions for O and S are new.

Another word: ""POLLS"" - P, O, L, L, S. O in position 2? No: P(1), O(2) -> position 2 for O.

""VOLKS"" - not a word.

""BOWLS"" - B, O, W, L, S. O in position 2.

I think ""FLOPS"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the letters: F, L, O, P, S. 
- F: not excluded
- L: not excluded
- O: we know is in the word
- P: not excluded
- S: we know is in the word

And positions: 
1: F (new)
2: L (new)
3: O (we haven't tried position 3 for O before)
4: P (new)
5: S (we haven't tried position 5 for S before)

This should give us good information.

So I'll go with ""FLOPS"".

But note: we are also testing F, L, P, which are new letters.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts O in position 1 or 5, but I couldn't find a common word without excluded letters.

For example, ""OFLAG"" not a word.

""OLEOS"" - O, L, E, O, S. But E is excluded.

So ""FLOPS"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FLOPS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" showed that O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively. M, I, T are absent.

The secret word must include O and S, while avoiding C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. For the next guess:
- O must be placed in a new position (not 2) to test its location.
- S must be placed in a new position (not 4) to test its location.
- New letters should be tested to gather more information.

I chose **""FLOPS""** because:
- It includes O (position 3) and S (position 5), both in untested positions.
- It uses new common letters: F, L, P.
- All letters are valid and not excluded (F, L, O, P, S).
- It avoids duplicate letters and inefficient position reuse.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces three new consonants.

<guess>flops</guess>",flops,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: so the secret word has none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"":
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -)
- M, I, T are not in the word (marked with x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", O was in the second position and S was in the fourth position. So in the secret word, O is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- The secret word does not contain M, I, T (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

Now, we also know that the secret word must have O and S, and we have to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes O and S (since they are in the word, and we want to find their correct positions)
- Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.
- Uses other common letters to test.

Available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones: 
Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, T (8 letters)
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and S must be in the word, so we should include them in our next guess.

We also know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""moist"") and S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that has O and S, and three other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Common letters left: L, U, D, P, G, B, etc.

Let's try to form a word that has O and S, and also includes other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""LOUSE"" but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- ""SOULS"" but that has two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates. But we must avoid E.

Another idea: ""SCOLD"" but C is excluded -> not allowed.

""BOLUS"" - B, O, L, U, S. This uses B, O, L, U, S. All available letters.

But let's check the positions: we need to place O and S in positions that are not forbidden for this guess? Actually, the feedback only said that in ""moist"", O was not in position 2 and S not in position 4. But in a new word, we can try O in other positions and S in other positions.

We can try to put O in a different position and S in a different position to test.

In ""BOLUS"":
- B in position 1
- O in position 2 -> but wait, we know that O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback from ""moist"" said that O is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't mean O cannot be in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, it means that in the secret word, O is present but not in the second position. So if we put O in position 2 in our new guess, we might get a ""x"" if it's wrong, but we already know it's not position 2? Actually, we can use that to test other positions.

But note: we are allowed to put O in position 2 again? But we know it's not correct, so it might be a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting S in position 4.

So in our new guess, we should put O in a position other than 2, and S in a position other than 4.

In ""BOLUS"", we have:
Position 1: B
Position 2: O -> this is position 2, which we know is wrong for O. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has O not in position 2 and S not in position 4.

Let me think of words with O and S, and without the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But Y is available? Yes. And positions: 
  L (1), O (2) -> O in position 2 again? We know O is not in position 2, so we shouldn't put it there.

We need to avoid position 2 for O.

So let's try to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, S should not be in position 4, so we can put S in 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with O in position 1, for example.

- ""OUCHS"" - not a word.
- ""OUNCES"" - too long.

How about ""SOUTH"": S, O, U, T, H. But T is excluded? Yes, T is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback, T is x). So we cannot use T.

Another: ""SOWED"" - but E and D? E is excluded.

""SOLID"" - but I is excluded? From ""moist"", I is x, so excluded.

""SOLAR"" - but A and R are excluded.

""SOGGY"" - S, O, G, G, Y. But two G's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But it's a valid word. However, we are testing new letters.

But let's see: S in position 1, O in position 2 -> O in position 2 is not allowed? We know O is not in position 2 in the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we will get a ""-"" or ""x""? Actually, since O is in the word but not in position 2, if we put it in position 2, we would get a ""-"" (meaning it's in the word but wrong position) or if the secret word has only one O and we put it in position 2, we get ""-"". But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. We should avoid using position 2 for O to save a spot for testing a new position.

So we want to put O in a position we haven't tried. In ""moist"", O was in position 2, so we haven't tried positions 1,3,4,5 for O.

Similarly, S was in position 4 in ""moist"", so we haven't tried positions 1,2,3,5 for S.

So ideally, we put O in one of {1,3,4,5} and S in one of {1,2,3,5}.

Let me try to form such a word.

Option: put O in position 3 and S in position 1? For example, ""USOLE"" not a word.

Or O in position 1: ""OAKS"" too short? 5-letter: ""OASIS"" but has two S and A is excluded. A is excluded.

""OLLAS"" - not common.

How about ""FOCUS"" - F, O, C, U, S. But C is excluded.

""DOGES"" - D, O, G, E, S. E is excluded.

""GOLFS"" - G, O, L, F, S. This seems possible. 
Positions: G(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again? We are trying to avoid that.

We need to avoid position 2 for O.

So let's try O in position 3: 
For example, ""BLOBS"" - B, L, O, B, S -> but two B's? And O in position 3. S in position 5. 
But ""BLOBS"" is a word? Yes, but we have duplicate B. Also, we can test.

But let's see: positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: O -> this is a new position for O (not tried before)
4: B -> duplicate, but we don't know if B is in the word or not.
5: S -> and S is not in position 4, so position 5 is new for S.

But we are using B twice, which might not be efficient.

Another word: ""PLOPS"" - similar issue.

""SHOWN"" - S, H, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""SHOWY"" - S, H, O, W, Y. 
Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). 
This seems good: 
- O is in position 3 (new position) 
- S is in position 1 (new position, since previously it was in 4)
- Avoids excluded letters: S, H, O, W, Y are all allowed (since not in excluded list: A,C,E,I,M,N,R,T)

Excluded: A,C,E,I,M,N,R,T. So H, O, W, Y are available.

So ""SHOWY"" is a valid word.

But note: we are using O and S, and we are testing H, W, Y.

Another possibility: ""SOUPY"" - S, O, U, P, Y. 
Positions: S(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again, which we want to avoid.

So ""SHOWY"" is better because O is in position 3.

Another word: ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S. 
Positions: F(1), O(2) -> again position 2 for O.

""LOUIS"" - L, O, U, I, S. But I is excluded.

""DOUBS"" - D, O, U, B, S. 
Positions: D(1), O(2) -> O in position 2.

We are having trouble avoiding position 2 for O.

How about O in position 4 or 5?

For example, ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But two S's? And O not included.

We need to include O.

""GUILD"" - no O.

""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. 
Positions: W(1), O(2) -> again position 2.

""FLOPS"" - F, L, O, P, S. 
Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), P(4), S(5). 
This is good: 
- O in position 3 (new) 
- S in position 5 (new, since previously it was in 4)
- Letters: F, L, O, P, S. All available (not excluded).

And ""FLOPS"" is a valid English word.

Similarly, ""CLOPS"" but C is excluded.

So ""FLOPS"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""GLOSS"" but two S's and O in position 2? ""GLOSS"" is G,L,O,S,S -> O in position 3? 
Positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), S(4), S(5). 
But S in position 4: we know from feedback that S is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback said S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4, we might get a ""-"" or ""x""? But we know it's not position 4, so it would be a waste? Actually, if the secret word has only one S, then putting S in position 4 would get an ""x"" because it's the wrong position? But we already know it's not position 4, so we don't gain new information. We should avoid position 4 for S.

In ""GLOSS"", we have S in position 4 and 5. We are testing position 4 for S, which we know is wrong, so that might not be efficient. Also, we are using duplicate S.

So ""FLOPS"" is better: no duplicates, and positions for O and S are new.

Another word: ""POLLS"" - P, O, L, L, S. O in position 2? No: P(1), O(2) -> position 2 for O.

""VOLKS"" - not a word.

""BOWLS"" - B, O, W, L, S. O in position 2.

I think ""FLOPS"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the letters: F, L, O, P, S. 
- F: not excluded
- L: not excluded
- O: we know is in the word
- P: not excluded
- S: we know is in the word

And positions: 
1: F (new)
2: L (new)
3: O (we haven't tried position 3 for O before)
4: P (new)
5: S (we haven't tried position 5 for S before)

This should give us good information.

So I'll go with ""FLOPS"".

But note: we are also testing F, L, P, which are new letters.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts O in position 1 or 5, but I couldn't find a common word without excluded letters.

For example, ""OFLAG"" not a word.

""OLEOS"" - O, L, E, O, S. But E is excluded.

So ""FLOPS"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FLOPS"".Based on the feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" showed that O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively. M, I, T are absent.

The secret word must include O and S, while avoiding C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. For the next guess:
- O must be placed in a new position (not 2) to test its location.
- S must be placed in a new position (not 4) to test its location.
- New letters should be tested to gather more information.

I chose **""FLOPS""** because:
- It includes O (position 3) and S (position 5), both in untested positions.
- It uses new common letters: F, L, P.
- All letters are valid and not excluded (F, L, O, P, S).
- It avoids duplicate letters and inefficient position reuse.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces three new consonants.",Guess 3: flops -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) P(-) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SWOOP,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle are like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, and N is also common).

 So my first guess will be: CRANEMy initial thought is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters, including both vowels and consonants, to test multiple frequent letters at once. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which often appear in English words. This should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback that for the guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since we have no correct letters so far, we need a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Let's think about common English letters. After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the remaining letters include:
 Vowels: O, U, I (though I is sometimes a consonant, but we treat it as vowel here for simplicity)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We should aim for a word that includes some of the most frequent remaining consonants: S, T, L, M, etc., and possibly vowels O or U.

 A good candidate for the next guess might be ""SPOUT"" or ""MOIST"", but let's see:

 Option 1: ""SPOUT"" - uses S, P, O, U, T (all letters not excluded)
 Option 2: ""MOIST"" - uses M, O, I, S, T (also all allowed)

 However, let me check if there are better options. Another common starting word when excluding these letters is ""BUILT"", but we don't have B.

 Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L.

 But note: we want to maximize the use of common letters and cover as many new letters as possible.

 After some consideration, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T which are all common.

 Alternatively, ""LUCKY"" is not possible because C and Y might not be as common and also we excluded C. Actually, C is excluded.

 Let me list words that avoid C, R, A, N, E:

 Some possibilities: light, might, sight, tight, but these have G, H, T, and I.

 However, we don't know if G, H, T, I are in the word. We are going to test.

 Another common word: ""DOUBT"" - D,O,U,B,T. But B is also common.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters if possible? But since we have no hits, we can use any.

 Actually, we are allowed to repeat letters? But in the guess we are not repeating because we don't know.

 I think ""SLIMY"" might be an option, but let's avoid Y for now? Or use it?

 Another good word: ""HOUSE"" - but E is excluded, so not allowed.

 Wait, E is excluded so we cannot use E. Therefore, ""HOUSE"" is not allowed.

 Similarly, ""MOIST"" is allowed: M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" - P, O, I, U, S. That's also good.

 But let's choose ""MOIST"" because it has a good mix.

 After thinking, I will go with ""MOIST"".

 Guess 2: moist

 Let's see what feedback we get.Our first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word). This eliminates 5 common letters. For our second guess, we need a word with entirely new letters. 

I'll choose **""MOIST""** because:
- It avoids C, R, A, N, E completely
- Contains high-frequency consonants (S, T) and vowels (O, I)
- Tests new letters: M, O, I, S, T
- Gives broad coverage of remaining common English letters

This sets us up to efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: so the secret word has none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x)

The feedback for ""moist"":
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -)
- M, I, T are not in the word (marked with x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains O and S, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", O was in the second position and S was in the fourth position. So in the secret word, O is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- The secret word does not contain M, I, T (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

Now, we also know that the secret word must have O and S, and we have to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes O and S (since they are in the word, and we want to find their correct positions)
- Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.
- Uses other common letters to test.

Available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones: 
Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, T (8 letters)
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and S must be in the word, so we should include them in our next guess.

We also know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""moist"") and S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that has O and S, and three other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Common letters left: L, U, D, P, G, B, etc.

Let's try to form a word that has O and S, and also includes other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""LOUSE"" but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- ""SOULS"" but that has two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates. But we must avoid E.

Another idea: ""SCOLD"" but C is excluded -> not allowed.

""BOLUS"" - B, O, L, U, S. This uses B, O, L, U, S. All available letters.

But let's check the positions: we need to place O and S in positions that are not forbidden for this guess? Actually, the feedback only said that in ""moist"", O was not in position 2 and S not in position 4. But in a new word, we can try O in other positions and S in other positions.

We can try to put O in a different position and S in a different position to test.

In ""BOLUS"":
- B in position 1
- O in position 2 -> but wait, we know that O cannot be in position 2? Actually, the feedback from ""moist"" said that O is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't mean O cannot be in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, it means that in the secret word, O is present but not in the second position. So if we put O in position 2 in our new guess, we might get a ""x"" if it's wrong, but we already know it's not position 2? Actually, we can use that to test other positions.

But note: we are allowed to put O in position 2 again? But we know it's not correct, so it might be a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting S in position 4.

So in our new guess, we should put O in a position other than 2, and S in a position other than 4.

In ""BOLUS"", we have:
Position 1: B
Position 2: O -> this is position 2, which we know is wrong for O. So we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has O not in position 2 and S not in position 4.

Let me think of words with O and S, and without the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But Y is available? Yes. And positions: 
  L (1), O (2) -> O in position 2 again? We know O is not in position 2, so we shouldn't put it there.

We need to avoid position 2 for O.

So let's try to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, S should not be in position 4, so we can put S in 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with O in position 1, for example.

- ""OUCHS"" - not a word.
- ""OUNCES"" - too long.

How about ""SOUTH"": S, O, U, T, H. But T is excluded? Yes, T is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback, T is x). So we cannot use T.

Another: ""SOWED"" - but E and D? E is excluded.

""SOLID"" - but I is excluded? From ""moist"", I is x, so excluded.

""SOLAR"" - but A and R are excluded.

""SOGGY"" - S, O, G, G, Y. But two G's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But it's a valid word. However, we are testing new letters.

But let's see: S in position 1, O in position 2 -> O in position 2 is not allowed? We know O is not in position 2 in the secret word, so if we put O in position 2, we will get a ""-"" or ""x""? Actually, since O is in the word but not in position 2, if we put it in position 2, we would get a ""-"" (meaning it's in the word but wrong position) or if the secret word has only one O and we put it in position 2, we get ""-"". But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. We should avoid using position 2 for O to save a spot for testing a new position.

So we want to put O in a position we haven't tried. In ""moist"", O was in position 2, so we haven't tried positions 1,3,4,5 for O.

Similarly, S was in position 4 in ""moist"", so we haven't tried positions 1,2,3,5 for S.

So ideally, we put O in one of {1,3,4,5} and S in one of {1,2,3,5}.

Let me try to form such a word.

Option: put O in position 3 and S in position 1? For example, ""USOLE"" not a word.

Or O in position 1: ""OAKS"" too short? 5-letter: ""OASIS"" but has two S and A is excluded. A is excluded.

""OLLAS"" - not common.

How about ""FOCUS"" - F, O, C, U, S. But C is excluded.

""DOGES"" - D, O, G, E, S. E is excluded.

""GOLFS"" - G, O, L, F, S. This seems possible. 
Positions: G(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again? We are trying to avoid that.

We need to avoid position 2 for O.

So let's try O in position 3: 
For example, ""BLOBS"" - B, L, O, B, S -> but two B's? And O in position 3. S in position 5. 
But ""BLOBS"" is a word? Yes, but we have duplicate B. Also, we can test.

But let's see: positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: O -> this is a new position for O (not tried before)
4: B -> duplicate, but we don't know if B is in the word or not.
5: S -> and S is not in position 4, so position 5 is new for S.

But we are using B twice, which might not be efficient.

Another word: ""PLOPS"" - similar issue.

""SHOWN"" - S, H, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""SHOWY"" - S, H, O, W, Y. 
Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). 
This seems good: 
- O is in position 3 (new position) 
- S is in position 1 (new position, since previously it was in 4)
- Avoids excluded letters: S, H, O, W, Y are all allowed (since not in excluded list: A,C,E,I,M,N,R,T)

Excluded: A,C,E,I,M,N,R,T. So H, O, W, Y are available.

So ""SHOWY"" is a valid word.

But note: we are using O and S, and we are testing H, W, Y.

Another possibility: ""SOUPY"" - S, O, U, P, Y. 
Positions: S(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again, which we want to avoid.

So ""SHOWY"" is better because O is in position 3.

Another word: ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S. 
Positions: F(1), O(2) -> again position 2 for O.

""LOUIS"" - L, O, U, I, S. But I is excluded.

""DOUBS"" - D, O, U, B, S. 
Positions: D(1), O(2) -> O in position 2.

We are having trouble avoiding position 2 for O.

How about O in position 4 or 5?

For example, ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But two S's? And O not included.

We need to include O.

""GUILD"" - no O.

""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. 
Positions: W(1), O(2) -> again position 2.

""FLOPS"" - F, L, O, P, S. 
Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), P(4), S(5). 
This is good: 
- O in position 3 (new) 
- S in position 5 (new, since previously it was in 4)
- Letters: F, L, O, P, S. All available (not excluded).

And ""FLOPS"" is a valid English word.

Similarly, ""CLOPS"" but C is excluded.

So ""FLOPS"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""GLOSS"" but two S's and O in position 2? ""GLOSS"" is G,L,O,S,S -> O in position 3? 
Positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), S(4), S(5). 
But S in position 4: we know from feedback that S is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback said S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4, we might get a ""-"" or ""x""? But we know it's not position 4, so it would be a waste? Actually, if the secret word has only one S, then putting S in position 4 would get an ""x"" because it's the wrong position? But we already know it's not position 4, so we don't gain new information. We should avoid position 4 for S.

In ""GLOSS"", we have S in position 4 and 5. We are testing position 4 for S, which we know is wrong, so that might not be efficient. Also, we are using duplicate S.

So ""FLOPS"" is better: no duplicates, and positions for O and S are new.

Another word: ""POLLS"" - P, O, L, L, S. O in position 2? No: P(1), O(2) -> position 2 for O.

""VOLKS"" - not a word.

""BOWLS"" - B, O, W, L, S. O in position 2.

I think ""FLOPS"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the letters: F, L, O, P, S. 
- F: not excluded
- L: not excluded
- O: we know is in the word
- P: not excluded
- S: we know is in the word

And positions: 
1: F (new)
2: L (new)
3: O (we haven't tried position 3 for O before)
4: P (new)
5: S (we haven't tried position 5 for S before)

This should give us good information.

So I'll go with ""FLOPS"".

But note: we are also testing F, L, P, which are new letters.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts O in position 1 or 5, but I couldn't find a common word without excluded letters.

For example, ""OFLAG"" not a word.

""OLEOS"" - O, L, E, O, S. But E is excluded.

So ""FLOPS"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FLOPS"".Based on the feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" showed that O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively. M, I, T are absent.

The secret word must include O and S, while avoiding C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. For the next guess:
- O must be placed in a new position (not 2) to test its location.
- S must be placed in a new position (not 4) to test its location.
- New letters should be tested to gather more information.

I chose **""FLOPS""** because:
- It includes O (position 3) and S (position 5), both in untested positions.
- It uses new common letters: F, L, P.
- All letters are valid and not excluded (F, L, O, P, S).
- It avoids duplicate letters and inefficient position reuse.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces three new consonants.

So H, O, W, Y are available.\n\nSo ""SHOWY"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we are using O and S, and we are testing H, W, Y.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SOUPY"" - S, O, U, P, Y. \nPositions: S(1), O(2) -> O in position 2 again, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo ""SHOWY"" is better because O is in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S. \nPositions: F(1), O(2) -> again position 2 for O.\n\n""LOUIS"" - L, O, U, I, S. But I is excluded.\n\n""DOUBS"" - D, O, U, B, S. \nPositions: D(1), O(2) -> O in position 2.\n\nWe are having trouble avoiding position 2 for O.\n\nHow about O in position 4 or 5?\n\nFor example, ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But two S\'s? And O not included.\n\nWe need to include O.\n\n""GUILD"" - no O.\n\n""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. \nPositions: W(1), O(2) -> again position 2.\n\n""FLOPS"" - F, L, O, P, S. \nPositions: F(1), L(2), O(3), P(4), S(5). \nThis is good: \n- O in position 3 (new) \n- S in position 5 (new, since previously it was in 4)\n- Letters: F, L, O, P, S. All available (not excluded).\n\nAnd ""FLOPS"" is a valid English word.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLOPS"" but C is excluded.\n\nSo ""FLOPS"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""GLOSS"" but two S\'s and O in position 2? ""GLOSS"" is G,L,O,S,S -> O in position 3? \nPositions: G(1), L(2), O(3), S(4), S(5). \nBut S in position 4: we know from feedback that S is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback said S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4, we might get a ""-"" or ""x""? But we know it\'s not position 4, so it would be a waste? Actually, if the secret word has only one S, then putting S in position 4 would get an ""x"" because it\'s the wrong position? But we already know it\'s not position 4, so we don\'t gain new information. We should avoid position 4 for S.\n\nIn ""GLOSS"", we have S in position 4 and 5. We are testing position 4 for S, which we know is wrong, so that might not be efficient. Also, we are using duplicate S.\n\nSo ""FLOPS"" is better: no duplicates, and positions for O and S are new.\n\nAnother word: ""POLLS"" - P, O, L, L, S. O in position 2? No: P(1), O(2) -> position 2 for O.\n\n""VOLKS"" - not a word.\n\n""BOWLS"" - B, O, W, L, S. O in position 2.\n\nI think ""FLOPS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: F, L, O, P, S. \n- F: not excluded\n- L: not excluded\n- O: we know is in the word\n- P: not excluded\n- S: we know is in the word\n\nAnd positions: \n1: F (new)\n2: L (new)\n3: O (we haven\'t tried position 3 for O before)\n4: P (new)\n5: S (we haven\'t tried position 5 for S before)\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FLOPS"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing F, L, P, which are new letters.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that puts O in position 1 or 5, but I couldn\'t find a common word without excluded letters.\n\nFor example, ""OFLAG"" not a word.\n\n""OLEOS"" - O, L, E, O, S. But E is excluded.\n\nSo ""FLOPS"" seems a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""FLOPS"".Based on the feedback:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.\n- ""moist"" showed that O and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively. M, I, T are absent.\n\nThe secret word must include O and S, while avoiding C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T. For the next guess:\n- O must be placed in a new position (not 2) to test its location.\n- S must be placed in a new position (not 4) to test its location.\n- New letters should be tested to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""FLOPS""** because:\n- It includes O (position 3) and S (position 5), both in untested positions.\n- It uses new common letters: F, L, P.\n- All letters are valid and not excluded (F, L, O, P, S).\n- It avoids duplicate letters and inefficient position reuse.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces three new consonants.\n\n<guess>flops</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: flops -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) P(-) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x). So excluded also M, I, T. And we know O and S are in the word, but O not in position 2, S not in position 4.
3. ""flops"" -> F(x), L(x), O(✓), P(-), S(-).

Feedback for ""flops"":
- F: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- O: correct position (✓) - at position 3? Let's see: flops, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-O, 4-P, 5-S. So O is in position 3 and correctly placed. That means in the secret word, O is fixed in position 3.
- P: in the word but wrong position (-). Since in ""flops"" P was in position 4, it cannot be in position 4 in the secret word.
- S: in the word but wrong position (-). In ""flops"", S was in position 5, so it cannot be in position 5.

Also, from ""moist"", S was in position 4 and we knew it wasn't there, so now S cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, for P, we know it's in the word but not in position 4.

Now, we know:
- Secret word has O in position 3: _ _ O _ _
- Secret word contains P and S, but P not in position 4, S not in position 4 or 5.
- Also, from ""moist"", O was not in position 2, which is consistent since now O is in position 3.

Excluded letters: from guess1: C, R, A, N, E; guess2: M, I, T; guess3: F, L. So excluded: A, C, E, F, I, L, M, N, R, T.

We can list them: A, C, E, F, I, L, M, N, R, T.

So available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But O, P, S are in the word. So we need to choose a word that:
- Has O in position 3: so pattern like _ _ O _ _
- Includes P and S (since they are in the word)
- Avoids excluded letters.

Also, since P and S are in the word but not in certain positions.

S cannot be in position 4 or 5. Possible positions for S: 1, 2.

Similarly, P cannot be in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

Now, we need to form a word with the pattern _ _ O _ _

We must place S in position 1 or 2, and P in position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, the word must not have any excluded letters.

Let us consider possible words.

First, suppose S in position 1: S _ O _ _

Then we need to fill the rest. The second position must be from available letters (not excluded). Fourth and fifth positions similarly.

Also, P must be in one of the positions: 2, 5? Since position 4 is not allowed for P? Position 4 can be filled by P? No, feedback says P is not in position 4.

In pattern: position 4 cannot be P, but position 2 or 5 could be P.

Similarly, position 4 must be a letter that is not P and not S? Not necessarily; it could be another letter.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is fixed at position 3, and we are using S and P elsewhere.

We need two more letters.

Try to find words with pattern S _ O _ _

And including P.

For example:
- S H O P ? -> ""SHOP"" only 4 letters, need 5. ""SHOPS"" - but S at the end, but we need S at position 1 and another S? ""SHOPS"": S(1), H(2), O(3), P(4), S(5). But note: S is in position 1 and 5. But we know that S cannot be in position 5 (from feedback of ""flops""). So for ""SHOPS"", we have S at position 5, which is not allowed because we know S is not in position 5. Also, P is at position 4, but we know P cannot be at position 4? Exactly, from ""flops"" P is not in position 4.

So ""SHOPS"" would have P in position 4 and S in position 5, both which are not allowed.

Similarly, other words: ""SCOOP"" but C is excluded.

""SNOOP"" but N is excluded.

""SWOOP"" -> S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). Has two O's? And O is fixed at position 3, so position 4 could be O? But let's see if it's valid.

But ""SWOOP"": positions: S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). 
- We know O is only in position 3? The secret word might have another O? But we don't know. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. It's possible.

But from feedback, in ""moist"", there was one O and one S. Similarly in ""flops"", one O and one S. But it could have more.

But let's see the constraints:
- S is at position 1: that's a new position (we haven't tested S in position 1 before).
- P is at position 5: we haven't tested P in position 5.

Also, O is at position 4? But in secret word, we have O fixed at position 3. So if the word has another O at position 4, that's fine.

But ""SWOOP"" is a valid word? Yes.

But check excluded letters: W and P are not excluded.

Excluded: A,C,E,F,I,L,M,N,R,T. So W and P are allowed.

Now, feedback possibilities: we need to see if S can be at position 1? Yes, since we haven't tried it.

Similarly, P at position 5 is possible.

Position 4 is O, which we know isn't a problem.

But we must avoid having S or P in forbidden positions? Only S cannot be in 4 or 5, but here S is in 1, so OK. P cannot be in 4, but here P is in 5, not 4. Position 4 is O.

Now, another candidate: suppose S in position 2.

Pattern: _ S O _ _

Then we need to fill position 1 and 4,5.

And include P somewhere.

Possible words:
- ""USOPS"" not a word.
- ""PSOAS"" - P,S,O,A,S. But A is excluded.
- ""ESTOP"" but E excluded.

Another: ""HYPOS"" - H,Y,P,O,S? But positions: if we have pattern _ S O _ _, ""HYPOS"" would be H(1), Y(2), P(3), O(4), S(5) — but that doesn't match because we need O at position 3, but here P is at position 3.

We need O at position 3, so pattern must be _ _ O _ _

If S is at position 2, then first position is some letter, then S, then O, then two more.

For example, ""PSOXY"" not a word.

""BSOOK"" not a word.

Perhaps ""WOPS"" is too short.

With S in position 2, it might be harder.

Let me list possible options.

Option: ""S U O P ?"" not easy.

Another word: When S is at position 1: S _ O _ _

We need two more letters, one of which is P (since P must be included). But we also have the fourth and fifth positions.

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (available letters).

But we are also including P in the word, so if P is not at position 2, it could be at position 4 or 5.

Position 4 cannot have P? From feedback, P is in the word but not at position 4, so we can have it at position 5.

Similarly, position 4 can have another letter.

Words: 
- ""SHOP"" only 4 letters.
- ""SHOPED"" too long.

Perhaps ""SCOWL"" but C excluded.

""SHOWL"" not a word.

""SWOON"" but O at position 4 and N excluded.

""SPOON"" but P is at position 2? ""SPOON"": S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), N(5). N is excluded.

""SPOOL"" -> S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). But L is excluded? From guess3, L is x, so excluded.

""SKOOL"" not standard.

""STOOL"" but T excluded.

Therefore, perhaps ""SWOOP"" is acceptable: S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5).

Letters: S, W, O, P — all available except we have two O's? But that's fine. And it uses P.

We can also consider: ""SAPPY"" but A and P? A excluded.

""DUCHY"" no O.

Perhaps ""GYPSY"" but no O.

Back to S in position 2: pattern like ? position 1, then S at 2, O at 3, then two more.

Position 4 and 5.

And include P somewhere.

Possible: P at position 1,4,5? But not 4? P cannot be in position 4.

So P can be in position 1 or 5.

Example: P at position 1: ""P S O ? ?""

Like ""PSOAS"" but A excluded.

""PIOUS"" but I and U? I excluded.

""POUSY"" - P,O,U,S,Y. But O would be at position 2? Here pattern: P(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), Y(5) — but O must be at position 3, not 2? So not matching our pattern since we need O at 3.

Our pattern: position 1-1, 2-S, 3-O, 4-?, 5-?

So with S at position 2: word must be X S O Y Z.

Now, include P: so P must be at position 1, or 4, or 5? But position 4 cannot be P? So if P is at position 4, not allowed. So P must be at position 1 or 5.

Option: P at position 1: ""P S O ? ?""

What letters for position 4 and 5 that form a word.

Possible: ""PSOAK"" not a word.
""PSORA"" not common.

Alternatively, no common words.

P at position 5: ""X S O Y P""

For example, ""US ORP"" not a word.
""BSORP"" not a word.

Perhaps ""JOUPS"" but J,O,U,P,S: J(1), O(2), U(3), P(4), S(5) — but we need O at position 3? Position 3 is U.

No: we need exactly position 3 O.

Pattern: ? at 1, S at 2, O at 3, then ? at 4, P at 5.

So: letter at 4 can be from available: B,D,G,H,J,K,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words: ""ASCOP"" not a word.
""WSCOP"" not.

Perhaps ""VISOP"" not.

It seems difficult.

Another possibility: ""PSYOP"" - P,S,Y,O,P — 5 letters? P(1), S(2), Y(3), O(4), P(5). But position 3 must be O? Here Y is at position 3 and O at position 4. Not match.

Thus, back to S in position 1: ""S _ O _ _"" 

And we have ""SWOOP"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5).

This is a valid word.

Another option: ""SCOOP"" C excluded.

""STOOP"" T excluded.

""WHOOP"" - W,H,O,O,P -> positions: S not included? ""WHOOP"" is W(1), H(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). Here S is missing? But we must have S in the word.

Our guess must include S, because it's in the secret word.

""WHOOP"" does not have S, so invalid guess.

So we must include S.

Therefore, for ""S _ O _ _"", we need S at position 1, and then P must be included, so in position 2,4, or5? But position 4 cannot be P? So position 2 or 5.

If P at position 2: ""S P O _ _""

Then we need to find the last two positions.

Possible words: ""SPOUT"" but T excluded.
""SPOOF"" - S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). F is excluded.
""SPOOK"" - K: S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), K(5). K is available? Yes, not excluded.
But O at position 4? And K at 5.

""SPOOK"" is a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""SPOOL"" L excluded.
""SPOON"" N excluded.

So ""SPOOK"": S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), K(5).

Positions:
- S at position 1: new position, we haven't tried before. We know S cannot be in 4 or 5, but 1 is possible.
- P at position 2: we haven't tried P in position 2? We tried P in position 4 (in flops), but not in 2.
- O at position 3: correct as we know.
- O at position 4: we don't know if there is a second O? Possible.
- K at position 5: new letter.

But note: from feedback, only one S is indicated? But possible to have two O's? The feedback has not contradicted that.

Similarly, ""SWOOP"" had two O's.

Now, compare ""SWOOP"" and ""SPOOK"".

Both use S at position 1 and P at position 5? ""SWOOP"" has P at position 5? ""SWOOP"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). Yes.

In ""SPOOK"", P is at position 2.

Which is better?

In ""SWOOP"", we test W at position 2, which is a new letter, and P at position 5.

In ""SPOOK"", we test P at position 2 and K at position 5.

But note: if P is at position 2, and the secret word has P somewhere else, we might get feedback that it's there but wrong position, etc.

But also, we save a letter? Both introduce one new letter: W or K.

Either is acceptable.

Another possibility: ""SOPPY"" but P at position 4: S O P P Y, but O at position 2? Not position 3.

Doesn't work.

""SOWP"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""SHOPP"" not a word.

I think ""SPOOK"" or ""SWOOP"" are possible.

But let me see if there is a word without duplicate letters.

For example, ""SCOUR"" C excluded.

""SHOUT"" T excluded.

""SOULP"" not a word.

""DOLPH"" no S.

Perhaps ""SYNOP"" but N excluded and Y? ""SYNOP"" is not common.

I could use ""BOSPY"" not a word.

Therefore, we can go with ""SPOOK"" or ""SWOOP"".

But ""SPOOK"" has P at position 2, which might be a position for P? We haven't tested it before.

Similarly, in ""SWOOP"", W is at position 2.

Since we want to determine the correct position of S and P, and we know S must be in position 1 or 2? Now, if we put S at position 1, and P at position 2 as in ""SPOOK"", then we can get direct feedback.

But if P is in fact at position 2, then we would get ✓ for P? But we don't know.

Alternatively, to maximize information, perhaps put S in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and P in position 5 (also new).

""SWOOP"" does that: S at 1, P at 5, and O at 3 and 4? But secret has O at 3, and may have another at 4.

But in ""SWOOP"", position 4 is O.

If the secret word has no O at position 4, then we get feedback.

Similarly, in ""SPOOK"", position 4 is O.

Both test for a second O.

But note: we also need to consider that P could be at position 1? Not in this pattern.

Let's decide on ""SPOOK"".

Or another word: ""SOUPS"" - S(1), O(2), U(3), P(4), S(5). But position 2 is O? But we know O is fixed at position 3? So not possible because we must have O at position 3.

Pattern must be _ _ O _ _.

So ""SOUPS"" has O at position 2, which we know is wrong.

Therefore, not possible.

We can choose ""SPOOK"".

But let's see feedback constraints.

Another option: ""SHOPS"" we rejected because of S at position 5 and P at position 4.

Now, if we use ""SKIPS"" but I excluded.

I think ""SPOOK"" is better because it puts S at position 1, which is allowed, and P at position 2 (a new position for P), and K new.

Similarly, ""SWOOP"" puts S at 1, W new, P at 5.

Both are valid.

Let me pick ""SPOOK"" for now.

But ""SPOOK"":

- Position 1: S — is S allowed in position 1? Yes, since we haven't tested position 1 for S.
- Position 2: P — we know P is in the word, not in position 4. Position 2 is new for P.
- Position 3: O — correct.
- Position 4: O — another O? Possible, but if not, it will be x or -? If not in word, x; if in word but wrong position, -; but we already have one O at position 3, so if no second O, it will be x.
- Position 5: K

Alternatively, we can use ""SOWLP"" not a word.

Or ""SAPP O"" no.

Perhaps ""PSYOP"" nope.

I think ""SPOOK"" is an option, but let's check if there is a word with S at position 1 and P at position 5.

For example, in ""SWOOP"", P is at position 5.

""SHOUP"" not a word.

""  S_ O _ P""

Position 4 cannot be P? But in ""S_ O _ P"", P at position 5 is fine.

For example, ""SCOOP"" C excluded.

""STOOP"" T excluded.

""WHOOP"" H and W: S not included.

""BLOOP"" L excluded and B? But L excluded.

Therefore, ""SWOOP"" is valid.

Now, comparing ""SPOOK"" and ""SWOOP"":
- ""SPOOK"": tests S at 1, P at 2, O at 4 (second O?), K at 5
- ""SWOOP"": tests S at 1, W at 2, O at 4 (second O?), P at 5

Both introduce one new letter: K vs W.

W is more common in English words than K? But both are acceptable.

Perhaps we can choose one that doesn't have duplicate O to avoid complexity? But both have duplicate O.

To avoid duplicate, let's find a word with different letters.

For example, ""SIGOP"" not a word.

""SHOGS"" H and G: ""SHOGS"" - S(1), H(2), O(3), G(4), S(5). But S at position 5? We know S cannot be at position 5. So not allowed.

Similarly, ""SLOGS"" L excluded and S at 5.

""SPOKE"" but K at 4, but also E excluded.

""SPIKY"" I excluded.

""SPUD O"" No.

Therefore, it's hard to find a word without duplicate O or with S not in 1 and not in conflict.

So we have to use one of these.

I'll go with ""SWOOP"" because it places P at position 5, which is a position we haven't tested for P, and also avoids placing P at position 2 when it might not be there.

Or simply, both are fine.

But let me think about the feedback from ""moist"": O was in the word but not position 2, so O is at some other position. Now we know it's position 3.

Also, S was not in position 4.

In ""flops"", O at position 3 correct, P at position 4 gets minus, so P is not at position 4, and S at position 5 gets minus, so S not at 5.

Thus for S, possible positions: 1 or 2 (in a 5-letter word with position 3 O).
Similarly for P: not position 4, so possible 1,2,5.

In ""SWOOP"":
- S at 1: if S is somewhere else, we get minus or x? But if S is in position 1, we get ✓ or minus? We'll see.
- W at 2: new letter, could be in word or not.
- O at 3: correct.
- O at 4: could be correct or not.
- P at 5: could be correct or not.

If we guess, and get feedback, we can use that.

In ""SPOOK"":
- S at 1
- P at 2: we don't know if P can be at 2 or not.
- O at 3
- O at 4
- K at 5

Perhaps to reduce complexity, we could try a word with only one O for position 3.

For example, ""S _ O P _""

Pattern with P not at position 4? But here P is at position 4? No: positions 1,2,3,4,5: if ""S _ O P _"", then P at position 4, but we know P is not in position 4? So cannot put P in position 4.

Similarly, ""S _ O _ P"", with P at position 5.

Then position 4 can be various letters.

For example, ""SWOSP"" not a word.

""SCOLP"" C excluded.

""SHOLP"" not a word.

""  S B O D P"" not a word.

"" "" S U O M P"" M excluded.

It seems difficult to find a common word.

Therefore, I will choose ""SWOOP"".

Alternatively, ""SPOOK"" is also acceptable.

Let's flip a coin? No, better to choose one.

I choose ""SWOOP"".

So next guess: ""swoop""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Previous Feedback Summary:
1. **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - Letters **C, R, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, E**.

2. **Guess 2: moist → FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)**  
   - **M, I, T** are **not** in the secret word (excluded).  
   - **O** is in the secret word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
   - **S** is in the secret word but **not in position 4** (marked with `-`).  
   - Updated excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T**.

3. **Guess 3: flops → FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) P(-) S(-)**  
   - **F, L** are **not** in the secret word (excluded).  
   - **O** is **correctly placed at position 3** (marked with `✓`). This confirms:  
     - Secret word pattern: `_ _ O _ _`.  
   - **P** is in the secret word but **not in position 4** (marked with `-`).  
   - **S** is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  
   - Updated excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, F, L**.

#### Key Constraints from Feedback:
- **O** must be in **position 3**: Secret word pattern is fixed as `_ _ O _ _`.
- **S** must be in the secret word but **cannot be in positions 4 or 5** (per feedback from ""moist"" and ""flops""). Thus, possible positions for **S** are **1 or 2**.
- **P** must be in the secret word but **cannot be in position 4** (per ""flops""). Thus, possible positions for **P** are **1, 2, or 5**.
- All excluded letters cannot appear: **A, C, E, F, I, L, M, N, R, T**.
- Available letters for guesses: **B, D, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
  - **O, P, S** are confirmed in the word, so the new guess must include these.

#### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize testing **S** in a new position (1 or 2) and **P** in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to resolve their locations efficiently.
- Avoid reusing excluded letters and disallowed positions for **S** and **P**.
- Introduce new letters (e.g., **W**, **K**, **H**) to maximize information gain.
- Ideal word structure: `S _ O _ _` or `_ S O _ _` (since **S** must be in position 1 or 2).
- Given the constraints, words like **SWOOP** or **SPOOK** fit, but:
  - **SWOOP** (S in position 1, W in position 2, O in position 3, O in position 4, P in position 5) is valid:
    - Tests **S** at **position 1** (untested).
    - Tests **P** at **position 5** (untested).
    - Introduces **W** as a new letter.
    - O in position 4 tests for a potential duplicate **O** (allowed in Wordle rules).
  - Alternative **SPOOK** (S in position 1, P in position 2, O, O, K) was considered, but **SWOOP** is preferred to avoid placing **P** in position 2 prematurely, as position testing for **P** is flexible.
- **SWOOP** is a valid English word and adheres to all constraints.

Given this, **SWOOP** is the optimal next guess to test variable positions and gather critical feedback.

<guess>swoop</guess>",swoop,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(-), I(x), S(-), T(x). So excluded also M, I, T. And we know O and S are in the word, but O not in position 2, S not in position 4.
3. ""flops"" -> F(x), L(x), O(✓), P(-), S(-).

Feedback for ""flops"":
- F: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- O: correct position (✓) - at position 3? Let's see: flops, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-O, 4-P, 5-S. So O is in position 3 and correctly placed. That means in the secret word, O is fixed in position 3.
- P: in the word but wrong position (-). Since in ""flops"" P was in position 4, it cannot be in position 4 in the secret word.
- S: in the word but wrong position (-). In ""flops"", S was in position 5, so it cannot be in position 5.

Also, from ""moist"", S was in position 4 and we knew it wasn't there, so now S cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, for P, we know it's in the word but not in position 4.

Now, we know:
- Secret word has O in position 3: _ _ O _ _
- Secret word contains P and S, but P not in position 4, S not in position 4 or 5.
- Also, from ""moist"", O was not in position 2, which is consistent since now O is in position 3.

Excluded letters: from guess1: C, R, A, N, E; guess2: M, I, T; guess3: F, L. So excluded: A, C, E, F, I, L, M, N, R, T.

We can list them: A, C, E, F, I, L, M, N, R, T.

So available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But O, P, S are in the word. So we need to choose a word that:
- Has O in position 3: so pattern like _ _ O _ _
- Includes P and S (since they are in the word)
- Avoids excluded letters.

Also, since P and S are in the word but not in certain positions.

S cannot be in position 4 or 5. Possible positions for S: 1, 2.

Similarly, P cannot be in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

Now, we need to form a word with the pattern _ _ O _ _

We must place S in position 1 or 2, and P in position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, the word must not have any excluded letters.

Let us consider possible words.

First, suppose S in position 1: S _ O _ _

Then we need to fill the rest. The second position must be from available letters (not excluded). Fourth and fifth positions similarly.

Also, P must be in one of the positions: 2, 5? Since position 4 is not allowed for P? Position 4 can be filled by P? No, feedback says P is not in position 4.

In pattern: position 4 cannot be P, but position 2 or 5 could be P.

Similarly, position 4 must be a letter that is not P and not S? Not necessarily; it could be another letter.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is fixed at position 3, and we are using S and P elsewhere.

We need two more letters.

Try to find words with pattern S _ O _ _

And including P.

For example:
- S H O P ? -> ""SHOP"" only 4 letters, need 5. ""SHOPS"" - but S at the end, but we need S at position 1 and another S? ""SHOPS"": S(1), H(2), O(3), P(4), S(5). But note: S is in position 1 and 5. But we know that S cannot be in position 5 (from feedback of ""flops""). So for ""SHOPS"", we have S at position 5, which is not allowed because we know S is not in position 5. Also, P is at position 4, but we know P cannot be at position 4? Exactly, from ""flops"" P is not in position 4.

So ""SHOPS"" would have P in position 4 and S in position 5, both which are not allowed.

Similarly, other words: ""SCOOP"" but C is excluded.

""SNOOP"" but N is excluded.

""SWOOP"" -> S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). Has two O's? And O is fixed at position 3, so position 4 could be O? But let's see if it's valid.

But ""SWOOP"": positions: S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). 
- We know O is only in position 3? The secret word might have another O? But we don't know. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. It's possible.

But from feedback, in ""moist"", there was one O and one S. Similarly in ""flops"", one O and one S. But it could have more.

But let's see the constraints:
- S is at position 1: that's a new position (we haven't tested S in position 1 before).
- P is at position 5: we haven't tested P in position 5.

Also, O is at position 4? But in secret word, we have O fixed at position 3. So if the word has another O at position 4, that's fine.

But ""SWOOP"" is a valid word? Yes.

But check excluded letters: W and P are not excluded.

Excluded: A,C,E,F,I,L,M,N,R,T. So W and P are allowed.

Now, feedback possibilities: we need to see if S can be at position 1? Yes, since we haven't tried it.

Similarly, P at position 5 is possible.

Position 4 is O, which we know isn't a problem.

But we must avoid having S or P in forbidden positions? Only S cannot be in 4 or 5, but here S is in 1, so OK. P cannot be in 4, but here P is in 5, not 4. Position 4 is O.

Now, another candidate: suppose S in position 2.

Pattern: _ S O _ _

Then we need to fill position 1 and 4,5.

And include P somewhere.

Possible words:
- ""USOPS"" not a word.
- ""PSOAS"" - P,S,O,A,S. But A is excluded.
- ""ESTOP"" but E excluded.

Another: ""HYPOS"" - H,Y,P,O,S? But positions: if we have pattern _ S O _ _, ""HYPOS"" would be H(1), Y(2), P(3), O(4), S(5) — but that doesn't match because we need O at position 3, but here P is at position 3.

We need O at position 3, so pattern must be _ _ O _ _

If S is at position 2, then first position is some letter, then S, then O, then two more.

For example, ""PSOXY"" not a word.

""BSOOK"" not a word.

Perhaps ""WOPS"" is too short.

With S in position 2, it might be harder.

Let me list possible options.

Option: ""S U O P ?"" not easy.

Another word: When S is at position 1: S _ O _ _

We need two more letters, one of which is P (since P must be included). But we also have the fourth and fifth positions.

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (available letters).

But we are also including P in the word, so if P is not at position 2, it could be at position 4 or 5.

Position 4 cannot have P? From feedback, P is in the word but not at position 4, so we can have it at position 5.

Similarly, position 4 can have another letter.

Words: 
- ""SHOP"" only 4 letters.
- ""SHOPED"" too long.

Perhaps ""SCOWL"" but C excluded.

""SHOWL"" not a word.

""SWOON"" but O at position 4 and N excluded.

""SPOON"" but P is at position 2? ""SPOON"": S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), N(5). N is excluded.

""SPOOL"" -> S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), L(5). But L is excluded? From guess3, L is x, so excluded.

""SKOOL"" not standard.

""STOOL"" but T excluded.

Therefore, perhaps ""SWOOP"" is acceptable: S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5).

Letters: S, W, O, P — all available except we have two O's? But that's fine. And it uses P.

We can also consider: ""SAPPY"" but A and P? A excluded.

""DUCHY"" no O.

Perhaps ""GYPSY"" but no O.

Back to S in position 2: pattern like ? position 1, then S at 2, O at 3, then two more.

Position 4 and 5.

And include P somewhere.

Possible: P at position 1,4,5? But not 4? P cannot be in position 4.

So P can be in position 1 or 5.

Example: P at position 1: ""P S O ? ?""

Like ""PSOAS"" but A excluded.

""PIOUS"" but I and U? I excluded.

""POUSY"" - P,O,U,S,Y. But O would be at position 2? Here pattern: P(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), Y(5) — but O must be at position 3, not 2? So not matching our pattern since we need O at 3.

Our pattern: position 1-1, 2-S, 3-O, 4-?, 5-?

So with S at position 2: word must be X S O Y Z.

Now, include P: so P must be at position 1, or 4, or 5? But position 4 cannot be P? So if P is at position 4, not allowed. So P must be at position 1 or 5.

Option: P at position 1: ""P S O ? ?""

What letters for position 4 and 5 that form a word.

Possible: ""PSOAK"" not a word.
""PSORA"" not common.

Alternatively, no common words.

P at position 5: ""X S O Y P""

For example, ""US ORP"" not a word.
""BSORP"" not a word.

Perhaps ""JOUPS"" but J,O,U,P,S: J(1), O(2), U(3), P(4), S(5) — but we need O at position 3? Position 3 is U.

No: we need exactly position 3 O.

Pattern: ? at 1, S at 2, O at 3, then ? at 4, P at 5.

So: letter at 4 can be from available: B,D,G,H,J,K,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words: ""ASCOP"" not a word.
""WSCOP"" not.

Perhaps ""VISOP"" not.

It seems difficult.

Another possibility: ""PSYOP"" - P,S,Y,O,P — 5 letters? P(1), S(2), Y(3), O(4), P(5). But position 3 must be O? Here Y is at position 3 and O at position 4. Not match.

Thus, back to S in position 1: ""S _ O _ _"" 

And we have ""SWOOP"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5).

This is a valid word.

Another option: ""SCOOP"" C excluded.

""STOOP"" T excluded.

""WHOOP"" - W,H,O,O,P -> positions: S not included? ""WHOOP"" is W(1), H(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). Here S is missing? But we must have S in the word.

Our guess must include S, because it's in the secret word.

""WHOOP"" does not have S, so invalid guess.

So we must include S.

Therefore, for ""S _ O _ _"", we need S at position 1, and then P must be included, so in position 2,4, or5? But position 4 cannot be P? So position 2 or 5.

If P at position 2: ""S P O _ _""

Then we need to find the last two positions.

Possible words: ""SPOUT"" but T excluded.
""SPOOF"" - S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). F is excluded.
""SPOOK"" - K: S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), K(5). K is available? Yes, not excluded.
But O at position 4? And K at 5.

""SPOOK"" is a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""SPOOL"" L excluded.
""SPOON"" N excluded.

So ""SPOOK"": S(1), P(2), O(3), O(4), K(5).

Positions:
- S at position 1: new position, we haven't tried before. We know S cannot be in 4 or 5, but 1 is possible.
- P at position 2: we haven't tried P in position 2? We tried P in position 4 (in flops), but not in 2.
- O at position 3: correct as we know.
- O at position 4: we don't know if there is a second O? Possible.
- K at position 5: new letter.

But note: from feedback, only one S is indicated? But possible to have two O's? The feedback has not contradicted that.

Similarly, ""SWOOP"" had two O's.

Now, compare ""SWOOP"" and ""SPOOK"".

Both use S at position 1 and P at position 5? ""SWOOP"" has P at position 5? ""SWOOP"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). Yes.

In ""SPOOK"", P is at position 2.

Which is better?

In ""SWOOP"", we test W at position 2, which is a new letter, and P at position 5.

In ""SPOOK"", we test P at position 2 and K at position 5.

But note: if P is at position 2, and the secret word has P somewhere else, we might get feedback that it's there but wrong position, etc.

But also, we save a letter? Both introduce one new letter: W or K.

Either is acceptable.

Another possibility: ""SOPPY"" but P at position 4: S O P P Y, but O at position 2? Not position 3.

Doesn't work.

""SOWP"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""SHOPP"" not a word.

I think ""SPOOK"" or ""SWOOP"" are possible.

But let me see if there is a word without duplicate letters.

For example, ""SCOUR"" C excluded.

""SHOUT"" T excluded.

""SOULP"" not a word.

""DOLPH"" no S.

Perhaps ""SYNOP"" but N excluded and Y? ""SYNOP"" is not common.

I could use ""BOSPY"" not a word.

Therefore, we can go with ""SPOOK"" or ""SWOOP"".

But ""SPOOK"" has P at position 2, which might be a position for P? We haven't tested it before.

Similarly, in ""SWOOP"", W is at position 2.

Since we want to determine the correct position of S and P, and we know S must be in position 1 or 2? Now, if we put S at position 1, and P at position 2 as in ""SPOOK"", then we can get direct feedback.

But if P is in fact at position 2, then we would get ✓ for P? But we don't know.

Alternatively, to maximize information, perhaps put S in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and P in position 5 (also new).

""SWOOP"" does that: S at 1, P at 5, and O at 3 and 4? But secret has O at 3, and may have another at 4.

But in ""SWOOP"", position 4 is O.

If the secret word has no O at position 4, then we get feedback.

Similarly, in ""SPOOK"", position 4 is O.

Both test for a second O.

But note: we also need to consider that P could be at position 1? Not in this pattern.

Let's decide on ""SPOOK"".

Or another word: ""SOUPS"" - S(1), O(2), U(3), P(4), S(5). But position 2 is O? But we know O is fixed at position 3? So not possible because we must have O at position 3.

Pattern must be _ _ O _ _.

So ""SOUPS"" has O at position 2, which we know is wrong.

Therefore, not possible.

We can choose ""SPOOK"".

But let's see feedback constraints.

Another option: ""SHOPS"" we rejected because of S at position 5 and P at position 4.

Now, if we use ""SKIPS"" but I excluded.

I think ""SPOOK"" is better because it puts S at position 1, which is allowed, and P at position 2 (a new position for P), and K new.

Similarly, ""SWOOP"" puts S at 1, W new, P at 5.

Both are valid.

Let me pick ""SPOOK"" for now.

But ""SPOOK"":

- Position 1: S — is S allowed in position 1? Yes, since we haven't tested position 1 for S.
- Position 2: P — we know P is in the word, not in position 4. Position 2 is new for P.
- Position 3: O — correct.
- Position 4: O — another O? Possible, but if not, it will be x or -? If not in word, x; if in word but wrong position, -; but we already have one O at position 3, so if no second O, it will be x.
- Position 5: K

Alternatively, we can use ""SOWLP"" not a word.

Or ""SAPP O"" no.

Perhaps ""PSYOP"" nope.

I think ""SPOOK"" is an option, but let's check if there is a word with S at position 1 and P at position 5.

For example, in ""SWOOP"", P is at position 5.

""SHOUP"" not a word.

""  S_ O _ P""

Position 4 cannot be P? But in ""S_ O _ P"", P at position 5 is fine.

For example, ""SCOOP"" C excluded.

""STOOP"" T excluded.

""WHOOP"" H and W: S not included.

""BLOOP"" L excluded and B? But L excluded.

Therefore, ""SWOOP"" is valid.

Now, comparing ""SPOOK"" and ""SWOOP"":
- ""SPOOK"": tests S at 1, P at 2, O at 4 (second O?), K at 5
- ""SWOOP"": tests S at 1, W at 2, O at 4 (second O?), P at 5

Both introduce one new letter: K vs W.

W is more common in English words than K? But both are acceptable.

Perhaps we can choose one that doesn't have duplicate O to avoid complexity? But both have duplicate O.

To avoid duplicate, let's find a word with different letters.

For example, ""SIGOP"" not a word.

""SHOGS"" H and G: ""SHOGS"" - S(1), H(2), O(3), G(4), S(5). But S at position 5? We know S cannot be at position 5. So not allowed.

Similarly, ""SLOGS"" L excluded and S at 5.

""SPOKE"" but K at 4, but also E excluded.

""SPIKY"" I excluded.

""SPUD O"" No.

Therefore, it's hard to find a word without duplicate O or with S not in 1 and not in conflict.

So we have to use one of these.

I'll go with ""SWOOP"" because it places P at position 5, which is a position we haven't tested for P, and also avoids placing P at position 2 when it might not be there.

Or simply, both are fine.

But let me think about the feedback from ""moist"": O was in the word but not position 2, so O is at some other position. Now we know it's position 3.

Also, S was not in position 4.

In ""flops"", O at position 3 correct, P at position 4 gets minus, so P is not at position 4, and S at position 5 gets minus, so S not at 5.

Thus for S, possible positions: 1 or 2 (in a 5-letter word with position 3 O).
Similarly for P: not position 4, so possible 1,2,5.

In ""SWOOP"":
- S at 1: if S is somewhere else, we get minus or x? But if S is in position 1, we get ✓ or minus? We'll see.
- W at 2: new letter, could be in word or not.
- O at 3: correct.
- O at 4: could be correct or not.
- P at 5: could be correct or not.

If we guess, and get feedback, we can use that.

In ""SPOOK"":
- S at 1
- P at 2: we don't know if P can be at 2 or not.
- O at 3
- O at 4
- K at 5

Perhaps to reduce complexity, we could try a word with only one O for position 3.

For example, ""S _ O P _""

Pattern with P not at position 4? But here P is at position 4? No: positions 1,2,3,4,5: if ""S _ O P _"", then P at position 4, but we know P is not in position 4? So cannot put P in position 4.

Similarly, ""S _ O _ P"", with P at position 5.

Then position 4 can be various letters.

For example, ""SWOSP"" not a word.

""SCOLP"" C excluded.

""SHOLP"" not a word.

""  S B O D P"" not a word.

"" "" S U O M P"" M excluded.

It seems difficult to find a common word.

Therefore, I will choose ""SWOOP"".

Alternatively, ""SPOOK"" is also acceptable.

Let's flip a coin? No, better to choose one.

I choose ""SWOOP"".

So next guess: ""swoop""### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Previous Feedback Summary:
1. **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - Letters **C, R, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
   - Excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, E**.

2. **Guess 2: moist → FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)**  
   - **M, I, T** are **not** in the secret word (excluded).  
   - **O** is in the secret word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
   - **S** is in the secret word but **not in position 4** (marked with `-`).  
   - Updated excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T**.

3. **Guess 3: flops → FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) P(-) S(-)**  
   - **F, L** are **not** in the secret word (excluded).  
   - **O** is **correctly placed at position 3** (marked with `✓`). This confirms:  
     - Secret word pattern: `_ _ O _ _`.  
   - **P** is in the secret word but **not in position 4** (marked with `-`).  
   - **S** is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  
   - Updated excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, F, L**.

#### Key Constraints from Feedback:
- **O** must be in **position 3**: Secret word pattern is fixed as `_ _ O _ _`.
- **S** must be in the secret word but **cannot be in positions 4 or 5** (per feedback from ""moist"" and ""flops""). Thus, possible positions for **S** are **1 or 2**.
- **P** must be in the secret word but **cannot be in position 4** (per ""flops""). Thus, possible positions for **P** are **1, 2, or 5**.
- All excluded letters cannot appear: **A, C, E, F, I, L, M, N, R, T**.
- Available letters for guesses: **B, D, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
  - **O, P, S** are confirmed in the word, so the new guess must include these.

#### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize testing **S** in a new position (1 or 2) and **P** in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to resolve their locations efficiently.
- Avoid reusing excluded letters and disallowed positions for **S** and **P**.
- Introduce new letters (e.g., **W**, **K**, **H**) to maximize information gain.
- Ideal word structure: `S _ O _ _` or `_ S O _ _` (since **S** must be in position 1 or 2).
- Given the constraints, words like **SWOOP** or **SPOOK** fit, but:
  - **SWOOP** (S in position 1, W in position 2, O in position 3, O in position 4, P in position 5) is valid:
    - Tests **S** at **position 1** (untested).
    - Tests **P** at **position 5** (untested).
    - Introduces **W** as a new letter.
    - O in position 4 tests for a potential duplicate **O** (allowed in Wordle rules).
  - Alternative **SPOOK** (S in position 1, P in position 2, O, O, K) was considered, but **SWOOP** is preferred to avoid placing **P** in position 2 prematurely, as position testing for **P** is flexible.
- **SWOOP** is a valid English word and adheres to all constraints.

Given this, **SWOOP** is the optimal next guess to test variable positions and gather critical feedback.",Guess 4: swoop -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(✓) O(✓) O(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
