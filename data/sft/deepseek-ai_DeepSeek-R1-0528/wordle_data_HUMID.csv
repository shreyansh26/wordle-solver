We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). That means none of these letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Some common letters in English 5-letter words are: S, T, O, L, I, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We want a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible and avoids the excluded ones.

 Let me try to form a word. For example, ""SLOTH"" uses S, L, O, T, H. But we have to check if these are allowed: none of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E). So that's good.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. Also allowed.

 Another common word is ""BUILD"" but B, U, I, L, D. Also allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the information. We might choose a word that has letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.

 Let me consider the word ""OUIJA"" but that might be too rare. We should stick to common words.

 Another idea: ""SLUMP"" - S, L, U, M, P. All allowed.

 But let's look for a word that has more vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 

 We could use a word with I and O. For example, ""PILOT"" but P, I, L, O, T. However, we have to avoid A, E, and also note that R is excluded so that's fine.

 But wait, we have to avoid R? Actually, we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. So P, I, L, O, T are all allowed.

 However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. Let me think of a word that is common and covers more frequent letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the top letters are: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, Y, etc.

 We can try to use S, T, O, L, I. But we can't use all in one word? Let's form a word: ""TOILS"" or ""STOIC"" but STOIC has C which is excluded. So avoid C.

 Another word: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. All allowed.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"" - P, O, U, N, D ... but N is excluded! We cannot use N because it was in the first guess and was marked as not in the word. So we must avoid N.

 Similarly, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So for ""POUND"", N is excluded, so that's invalid.

 Let me try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the excluded set. So that's a valid guess.

 Another option: ""LUCKY"" but C is excluded and Y might be less common? Also, C is excluded so we can't use it.

 Another common word: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L. All allowed.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we get to check M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"" - S, L, I, M, Y. Also allowed.

 But I'll go with ""MOIST"" for now.

 However, note that we are avoiding E and A, so the word must be without those. ""MOIST"" is without E and A.

 So let's choose ""MOIST"".

 But wait, is there a word that might cover more of the high-frequency letters? The letters in ""MOIST"" are: M, O, I, S, T. These are all relatively common.

 Alternatively, we could use ""BUILT"" - B, U, I, L, T. Also allowed.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is fine.

 Let me check the frequency: 
 S is very common, T is common, O is common, I is common, M is moderately common.

 Another word: ""SHIFT"" - S, H, I, F, T. Also allowed and F is a less common letter? Maybe we want to test more common ones.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with ""MOIST"".

After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word), I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. The secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E. 

I should prioritize common English letters not yet tested, such as S, T, O, I, L, M, P, U, B, H, G, Y, etc. To maximize information, I'll pick a word with high-frequency letters and no repeats. 

Good candidates include:
- **MOIST**: Uses M, O, I, S, T (all common, none excluded). 
- **BUILT**: Uses B, U, I, L, T (also strong, but U is less frequent).
- **SLIMY**: Uses S, L, I, M, Y (Y is less common).

I choose **MOIST** because it covers five frequent letters (S, T, O, I, M) efficiently and is a valid English word. This will help test multiple common letters in new positions.

All allowed.\n\n Alternatively, ""POUND"" - P, O, U, N, D ... but N is excluded! We cannot use N because it was in the first guess and was marked as not in the word. So we must avoid N.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So for ""POUND"", N is excluded, so that\'s invalid.\n\n Let me try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the excluded set. So that\'s a valid guess.\n\n Another option: ""LUCKY"" but C is excluded and Y might be less common? Also, C is excluded so we can\'t use it.\n\n Another common word: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L. All allowed.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we get to check M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLIMY"" - S, L, I, M, Y. Also allowed.\n\n But I\'ll go with ""MOIST"" for now.\n\n However, note that we are avoiding E and A, so the word must be without those. ""MOIST"" is without E and A.\n\n So let\'s choose ""MOIST"".\n\n But wait, is there a word that might cover more of the high-frequency letters? The letters in ""MOIST"" are: M, O, I, S, T. These are all relatively common.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""BUILT"" - B, U, I, L, T. Also allowed.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is fine.\n\n Let me check the frequency: \n S is very common, T is common, O is common, I is common, M is moderately common.\n\n Another word: ""SHIFT"" - S, H, I, F, T. Also allowed and F is a less common letter? Maybe we want to test more common ones.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""MOIST"".\n\n<guess>moist</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word), I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. The secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E. \n\nI should prioritize common English letters not yet tested, such as S, T, O, I, L, M, P, U, B, H, G, Y, etc. To maximize information, I\'ll pick a word with high-frequency letters and no repeats. \n\nGood candidates include:\n- **MOIST**: Uses M, O, I, S, T (all common, none excluded). \n- **BUILT**: Uses B, U, I, L, T (also strong, but U is less frequent).\n- **SLIMY**: Uses S, L, I, M, Y (Y is less common).\n\nI choose **MOIST** because it covers five frequent letters (S, T, O, I, M) efficiently and is a valid English word. This will help test multiple common letters in new positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" -> M: wrong position (-), O: not in word (x), I: wrong position (-), S: not in word (x), T: not in word (x).

From ""moist"":
- M is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked wrong position in the first slot). Since we guessed ""moist"", M was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 of the secret word.
- I is in the word but not in the third position (since we placed it in position 3 and it's wrong position). So I must be in a different position: 1,2,4,5.
- O, S, T are not in the word at all. So we can exclude O, S, T.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains M and I, but not O, S, T.
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and now O, S, T.

Letters we know are in the word: M and I (each appearing at least once).

Letters we know are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.

We can now choose a new word that:
1. Contains M and I (since we know they are present).
2. Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.
3. Places M and I in different positions than previously tried to find their correct spots.

Specifically, in ""moist"", M was in position 1 and I in position 3. Since both were marked as wrong position, we should try M and I in other positions.

Possible positions for M: Since it's not in position 1, try in positions 2,3,4,5.
Similarly for I: not in position 3, so try in positions 1,2,4,5.

We must use a valid 5-letter English word.

Now, what letters are left? We've used: C,R,A,N,E,O,S,T and we know M and I are in.

So remaining letters: any letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,O,S,T} and including M and I (but M and I can be reused? Actually, we don't know if duplicates occur. Since the feedback doesn't mark duplicates specially, we should assume no duplicates unless more clues come. In the feedback, each mark is for the letter at that position. So it's possible that a letter appears multiple times, but for now, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume unique letters.

But in the feedback for M and I, they were both marked but we don't know if they appear once or more. So we'll assume at least one each.

For building a word, we can include M and I only once? Not necessarily, but since we're guessing, we might try without duplicates first.

Available letters: whole alphabet minus excluded letters: 
Excluded: A,C,E,N,O,R,S,T
Remaining: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we also know M and I must be present.

Now, let's try to form a word that has M and I and three other letters from the remaining set, and does not put M in position 1 or I in position 3.

Position restrictions:
- Position 1: cannot be M (because M was in pos1 and was wrong position? Actually, it was marked as wrong position, meaning the letter M is in the word but not in position 1. So position 1 should not be M in the new guess? Or can we place M elsewhere? We can place M in positions 2,3,4,5.

Similarly, avoid I in position 3.

We must avoid the excluded letters.

Idea: let's choose a word that places M in position 2 or 4 or 5 and I in position 1 or 4 or 5 (avoiding I in position 3 and M in position 1).

But note that in addition to M and I, we need three other letters. We must cover more letters to gather information.

Also, we should aim for common letters: from the remaining, B,D,F,G,H,L,P,U,V,W,Y are fairly common.

For example: words like ""MILKY"", but K and Y are available? But let's check:

Possible words:

- If we put I in position 1 and M in position 4: e.g., ""I H M ? ?"" -> hard

Another idea: ""LIMIT"" but L,I,M,I,T - but T is excluded, and duplicate I? Not allowed, also T is out.

""GUILD"" has G,U,I,L,D - but no M? We must include M.

We need M.

Other words: ""MIGHT"" has M,I,G,H,T but T is excluded -> not possible.

Since T is excluded, we can't use it.

So T is out, we can't use any with T.

Similarly, O,S are out.

Another word: ""BUILD"" doesn't have M.

We need word with M and I.

Word possibilities: ""MIXED"" but E and D? E is excluded (from first guess), so no.

""JUMPY"" - J,U,M,P,Y - but no I? Doesn't have I.

We must include I.

So we need a word that has both I and M.

Examples: ""PRIME"" but E and R are excluded? R is excluded and E is excluded -> not valid.

""CLAIM"" has C,L,A,I,M -> but C and A excluded -> no.

""LUMPY"" has L,U,M,P,Y but no I.

""IMPEL"" has I,M,P,E,L -> E excluded -> no.

""WIMPY"" has W,I,M,P,Y -> no excluded letters? Check: W, I, M, P, Y. Excluded are: A,C,E,N,O,R,S,T. So W,I,M,P,Y are all allowed.

Is ""WIMPY"" a word? Yes, meaning weak or cowardly.

But what about the positions? We have M and I: 
In ""WIMPY"":
- Position 1: W
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: M
- Position : P
- Position 5: Y

Now, for I: previously it was in position 3, now we put it in position 2? That's okay because we need to try different positions. 
Similarly, M was in position 1, now in position 3.

Feedback: M is in the word but not in position 1, so trying position 3 is fine. 
I is in the word but not in position 3, now trying position 2.

So ""WIMPY"" seems a valid guess.

Another word: ""DIMLY"" - D,I,M,L,Y -> D, I, M, L, Y. All allowed.

In ""DIMLY"": I in position 1? Wait, position 1: D, position 2: I, position 3: M? Then we have I in position 2 and M in position 3.

Same as above? But ""DIMLY"" is a word?

Let me see: ""dimly"" is an adverb meaning with inadequate light.

So that's valid.

But both ""WIMPY"" and ""DIMLY"" are acceptable.

Another possibility: ""MIDST"" has S and T which are excluded -> invalid.

""HUMID"" has H,U,M,I,D -> excluded? U? U is allowed, H,U,M,I,D are all allowed.

In ""HUMID"": 
Position 1: H
Position 2: U
Position 3: M
Position 4: I
Position 5: D

But we have I in position 4? Previously I was in position 3 and now position 4? That's okay.

And M in position 3? Previously M was in position 1, now in position 3.

But we can try.

However, we don't know if there is a U or anything else.

We could also consider ""MILKY"", which has M,I,L,K,Y. But K? K is not excluded? Excluded letters: A,C,E,N,O,R,S,T. So K is allowed.

In ""MILKY"": M in position 1? But M was wrong in position 1, so we shouldn't put M in position 1 again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient because we already know position 1 is not M. So better to put M in a different position.

Therefore, avoid position 1 for M.

Similarly, avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, in ""MILKY"", M is in position 1 — avoid.

In ""HUMID"", M is in position 3 — okay.

In ""DIMLY"", M is in position 3 and I in position 2 — okay.

In ""WIMPY"", M is in position 3 and I in position 2 — same as above.

But let's see if we can place M and I in other positions to test.

For example, putting I in position 1: 
Words like ""IMAGE"" has A,E excluded -> no.
""ITCHY"" has T and H? T excluded -> no.
""INPUT"" has N,U,P,T -> N and T excluded -> no.

So hard to put I in position 1 without excluded letters.

Putting I in position 4: 
E.g., ""PLUMB"" doesn't have I.
""BLIMP"" has B,L,I,M,P? 
""BLIMP"": B(position1), L(pos2), I(pos3)? But wait, I in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for I.

If we put I in position 4: 
For example, ""ALIGN"" has A and N excluded.
""ODIUM"" is a word? Meaning hate, but O is excluded -> no.

So difficult to find a word with I in position 4 and M not in position 1.

Perhaps I in position 5: e.g., ""DUTCH"" has D,U,T,C -> T,C excluded -> no.

So now position 2 for I seems feasible.

Similarly, we can put M in position 4: 
E.g., ""BLIMP"" has I in position 3? If we spell ""BLIMP"": 
B,L,I,M,P — M is in position 4? 
Position 1: B
Position 2: L
Position 3: I — but we want to avoid I in position 3? 
No, we can avoid by choosing a different word? 
How about ""PLUMY"" Y? no I.

""JUMBY""? Not common.

Perhaps M in position 5: 
Words like ""MAXIM"" has M,X,I,M — duplicate M? and X? but X is allowed? 
But M is duplicated? And position 1 M? Avoid M in position 1.

""MAXIM"" has M in position 1 and 5? Not good because we can't put M in position 1.

Alternatively, ""BALMY"" has B,A,L,M,Y -> A excluded -> no.

""QUICK"" has Q,U,I,C,K -> C excluded -> no.

So, given the constraints, the best bets are words with I in position 2 and M in position 3 or 4 or 5.

In ""DIMLY"": I at pos2, M at pos3.
In ""WIMPY"": I at pos2, M at pos3.
In ""HUMID"": M at pos3, I at pos4 — so I is at position 4, which is new position (not 3) — and M at pos3.

Similarly, ""LUMBI""? Not a word.

""GUILD"" doesn't have M.

So among these, ""DIMLY"", ""WIMPY"", ""HUMID"" are options.

Now, which is best? We want to include new letters to broaden coverage.

For ""DIMLY"": letters: D, I, M, L, Y. 
- I and M are known to be present. 
- New letters: D, L, Y.

For ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y — new letters: W, P, Y.

For ""HUMID"": H, U, M, I, D — new letters: H, U, D.

All are fine.

Let me see letter frequency: 
D, L, Y are letters. L is very common, D and Y relatively common.

In ""WIMPY"", W, P. P is common, W is less common.

In ""HUMID"", H, U, D. H and D are common, U less common.

Since we have only B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z available? Actually, the unused letters are many.

But we might prioritize frequent ones.

Also, note that in the secret word, M is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3.

I think ""HUMID"" might be a good choice because it places I in a new position (position 4) and M in position 3. Also, it uses U which might be tested.

But let me look for words that don't keep M and I adjacent? But not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose ""PIDGE"" — no, not a word.

Perhaps ""BUGGY"" but no I or M? Must include both.

Another idea: ""IMBUE"" — I,M,B,U,E — but E excluded -> not possible.

""KILIM"" is a word? A type of rug, but not common. Also, K and I, L, I, M — duplicate I? Probably not.

So sticking with first thoughts.

I will choose ""HUMID"" because it tests U and H, and puts I in a different position (position 4).

So guess: ""HUMID""

Now, in ""HUMID"": 
- H in position 1: could be any
- U in position 2: could be any
- M in position 3: we know M is in the word, but is it in position 3? Could be correct or wrong.
- I in position 4: could be correct or wrong
- D in position 5

All letters are not excluded.

But note: from previous, we know M is not in position 1, so if position 3 is wrong, then we know M must be in 2,4, or 5? But we don't know.

Similarly, I is not in position 3, so if position 4 is wrong, then I must be in 1,2, or 5? But position 1 is H in this guess.

So let's go with ""HUMID"".

Alternatively, ""DIMLY"" is shorter and common? But both are valid.

I think ""HUMID"" is acceptable.

Or to test more common letters: ""DIMLY"" has L and Y? But L is common.

Another word: ""MILCH""? But M in position1? Avoid.

I think ""HUMID"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""HUMID"".
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""moist"")**: 
  - M is in the word but not in position 1 (marked ""-"" for position 1).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"" for position 3).
  - O, S, T are not in the word (all ""x"").

From this, we know:
- **Secret word contains**: M and I, but not O, S, T.
- **Secret word excludes**: C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1) and O, S, T (from Guess 2). So excluded letters are: A, C, E, N, O, R, S, T.
- **Constraints for next guess**: 
  - M must be included but not in position 1 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2).
  - I must be included but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2).
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize words including M and I, placing them in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively.
- Use additional high-frequency letters (e.g., L, U, D, H, P, Y) to maximize information.
- Possible options: 
  - ""HUMID"": Places M in position 3 and I in position 4, testing H, U, and D.
  - ""DIMLY"": Places M in position 3 and I in position 2, testing D, L, and Y.
  - ""WIMPY"": Places M in position 3 and I in position 2, testing W, P, and Y.
- Chose **""HUMID""** because:
  - Covers M and I while respecting position constraints (M not in pos 1, I not in pos 3).
  - Tests H, U, D—all common letters not yet attempted and allowing additional coverage.
  - Balances familiar letter frequency and valid word structure.

So, given the constraints, the best bets are words with I in position 2 and M in position 3 or 4 or 5.

In ""DIMLY"": I at pos2, M at pos3.
In ""WIMPY"": I at pos2, M at pos3.
In ""HUMID"": M at pos3, I at pos4 — so I is at position 4, which is new position (not 3) — and M at pos3.

Similarly, ""LUMBI""? Not a word.

""GUILD"" doesn't have M.

So among these, ""DIMLY"", ""WIMPY"", ""HUMID"" are options.

Now, which is best? We want to include new letters to broaden coverage.

For ""DIMLY"": letters: D, I, M, L, Y. 
- I and M are known to be present. 
- New letters: D, L, Y.

For ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y — new letters: W, P, Y.

For ""HUMID"": H, U, M, I, D — new letters: H, U, D.

All are fine.

Let me see letter frequency: 
D, L, Y are letters. L is very common, D and Y relatively common.

In ""WIMPY"", W, P. P is common, W is less common.

In ""HUMID"", H, U, D. H and D are common, U less common.

Since we have only B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z available? Actually, the unused letters are many.

But we might prioritize frequent ones.

Also, note that in the secret word, M is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3.

I think ""HUMID"" might be a good choice because it places I in a new position (position 4) and M in position 3. Also, it uses U which might be tested.

But let me look for words that don't keep M and I adjacent? But not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose ""PIDGE"" — no, not a word.

Perhaps ""BUGGY"" but no I or M? Must include both.

Another idea: ""IMBUE"" — I,M,B,U,E — but E excluded -> not possible.

""KILIM"" is a word? A type of rug, but not common. Also, K and I, L, I, M — duplicate I? Probably not.

So sticking with first thoughts.

I will choose ""HUMID"" because it tests U and H, and puts I in a different position (position 4).

So guess: ""HUMID""

Now, in ""HUMID"": 
- H in position 1: could be any
- U in position 2: could be any
- M in position 3: we know M is in the word, but is it in position 3? Could be correct or wrong.
- I in position 4: could be correct or wrong
- D in position 5

All letters are not excluded.

But note: from previous, we know M is not in position 1, so if position 3 is wrong, then we know M must be in 2,4, or 5? But we don't know.

Similarly, I is not in position 3, so if position 4 is wrong, then I must be in 1,2, or 5? But position 1 is H in this guess.

So let's go with ""HUMID"".

Alternatively, ""DIMLY"" is shorter and common? But both are valid.

I think ""HUMID"" is acceptable.

Or to test more common letters: ""DIMLY"" has L and Y? But L is common.

Another word: ""MILCH""? But M in position1? Avoid.

I think ""HUMID"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""HUMID"".Based on previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""moist"")**: 
  - M is in the word but not in position 1 (marked ""-"" for position 1).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"" for position 3).
  - O, S, T are not in the word (all ""x"").

From this, we know:
- **Secret word contains**: M and I, but not O, S, T.
- **Secret word excludes**: C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1) and O, S, T (from Guess 2). So excluded letters are: A, C, E, N, O, R, S, T.
- **Constraints for next guess**: 
  - M must be included but not in position 1 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2).
  - I must be included but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2).
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize words including M and I, placing them in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively.
- Use additional high-frequency letters (e.g., L, U, D, H, P, Y) to maximize information.
- Possible options: 
  - ""HUMID"": Places M in position 3 and I in position 4, testing H, U, and D.
  - ""DIMLY"": Places M in position 3 and I in position 2, testing D, L, and Y.
  - ""WIMPY"": Places M in position 3 and I in position 2, testing W, P, and Y.
- Chose **""HUMID""** because:
  - Covers M and I while respecting position constraints (M not in pos 1, I not in pos 3).
  - Tests H, U, D—all common letters not yet attempted and allowing additional coverage.
  - Balances familiar letter frequency and valid word structure.",Guess 3: humid -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
