We are starting a new game. We have no prior information, so we need an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- Ideally have letters that are not repeated so we can test more letters.

Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains five distinct letters.
- The letters are among the most common in English: C, R, A, N, E.

So, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

However, note that the rules require a 5-letter English word and we have 6 tries. Since it's the first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This maximizes the potential for getting informative feedback across multiple positions, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses. The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.

We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E
  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got '-', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)
  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got '-')

Also, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

Now, for our second guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) 
- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.

We also note the positions:
- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: 
  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don't know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

We should also consider common words containing R and E.

Additionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.

Possible words: let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Example: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it's better to use all unique letters.

But note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.

Let me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven't been tested.

In ""crane"", position 1: we know it's not C, but we don't know what it is. Similarly for other positions.

We tested:
- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.

But note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.

Let me try to list possible positions for R and E:

- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).

But note: the word has 5 positions.

Now, for our second guess, we want to cover:
- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).
- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).
- Also, test for other common letters.

Since we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.

So, for example, let's consider words that:
- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.
- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Common starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?

I think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let's check:
- R in position 1 (which wasn't tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)
- O, U, T, E: and we don't know about O,U,T.

But we must see if it fits.

Alternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.

So we cannot use words containing A, C, N.

Therefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.

Similarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it's valid.

But we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won't give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.

So putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn't at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.

So ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that's new. Or at 3,4,5.

But we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven't tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.

Therefore, for R: let's put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it's not at position 1? Or wait, if it's misplaced, we get '-' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get '-', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the '-' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.

Similarly, for E: let's put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.

So let's try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn't common? Also, it has 'S' and 'T', which haven't been tested.

But note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.

ROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.

In this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).

Also, O,L,S are new letters.

Similarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.

Another: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn't stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it's not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it's better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?

Yes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.

Therefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That's the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be '-', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don't know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.

So if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.

So better avoid ""tried"".

How about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.

Another word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don't know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don't know about 3 and 4? But we can't put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?

But STREP isn't common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven't tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.

Also, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.

But note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.

""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.

Another: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.

I think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.

Now, with ""RIDES"":
- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is '✓', then R is at 1? Or if '-'? Then R is not at 1? Or 'x'? But that can't happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get 'x' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either '✓' or '-'. Similarly for E at position 4: either '✓' or '-'.

Also, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.

For example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? 
- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? 
Wait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E's position? So it's a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? 

But in ""STORES"", it's 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That's 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be '-'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? 

Also, S,T,O? We don't know.

But compare ""RIDES"": 
- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? 
- R at position 1? Also new? We don't know status? 

So ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven't tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? 

Whereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? 

So I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? 

Another word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? 

Or ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.

Therefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".

But let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.

So guess: ""RIDES""

But note: position in ""RIDES"":
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: D
- 4: E
- 5: S

We expect:
- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?
- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?
- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.

This should give us good information.

So my second guess: ""RIDES""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:
- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N
- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Positions tested in the first guess**:
  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).
  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).
  - Position 4: N is absent.
  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).

For the second guess, the goal is to:
1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.
2. Avoid using C, A, or N.
3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.

The word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).
- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).
- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).
- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.

This approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.

<guess>rides</guess>",rides,"We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E
  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got '-', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)
  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got '-')

Also, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We should also consider common words containing R and E.

Additionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.

We tested:
- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.

- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).

Therefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.

Similarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it's valid.

But we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won't give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.

So putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn't at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.

So ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that's new. Or at 3,4,5.

But we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven't tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.

Therefore, for R: let's put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it's not at position 1? Or wait, if it's misplaced, we get '-' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get '-', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the '-' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.

Similarly, for E: let's put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.

So let's try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn't common? Also, it has 'S' and 'T', which haven't been tested.

But note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.

ROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.

In this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).

Also, O,L,S are new letters.

Similarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.

Another: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn't stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it's not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it's better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?

Yes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.

Therefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That's the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be '-', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don't know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.

So if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.

So better avoid ""tried"".

How about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.

Another word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don't know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don't know about 3 and 4? But we can't put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?

But STREP isn't common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven't tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.

Also, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.

But note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.

""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.

Another: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.

I think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.

Now, with ""RIDES"":
- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is '✓', then R is at 1? Or if '-'? Then R is not at 1? Or 'x'? But that can't happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get 'x' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either '✓' or '-'. Similarly for E at position 4: either '✓' or '-'.

Also, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.

For example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? 
- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? 
Wait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E's position? So it's a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? 

But in ""STORES"", it's 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That's 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be '-'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? 

Also, S,T,O? We don't know.

But compare ""RIDES"": 
- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? 
- R at position 1? Also new? We don't know status? 

So ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven't tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? 

Whereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? 

So I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? 

Another word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? 

Or ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.

Therefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".

But let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.

So guess: ""RIDES""

But note: position in ""RIDES"":
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: D
- 4: E
- 5: S

We expect:
- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?
- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?
- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.

This should give us good information.

So my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:
- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N
- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Positions tested in the first guess**:
  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).
  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).
  - Position 4: N is absent.
  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).

For the second guess, the goal is to:
1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.
2. Avoid using C, A, or N.
3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.

The word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).
- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).
- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).
- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.

This approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.",Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,mower,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior information, so we need an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- Ideally have letters that are not repeated so we can test more letters.

Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains five distinct letters.
- The letters are among the most common in English: C, R, A, N, E.

So, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

However, note that the rules require a 5-letter English word and we have 6 tries. Since it's the first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This maximizes the potential for getting informative feedback across multiple positions, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses. The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E
  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got '-', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)
  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got '-')

Also, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

Now, for our second guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) 
- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.

We also note the positions:
- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: 
  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don't know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

We should also consider common words containing R and E.

Additionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.

Possible words: let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Example: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it's better to use all unique letters.

But note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.

Let me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven't been tested.

In ""crane"", position 1: we know it's not C, but we don't know what it is. Similarly for other positions.

We tested:
- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.

But note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.

Let me try to list possible positions for R and E:

- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).

But note: the word has 5 positions.

Now, for our second guess, we want to cover:
- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).
- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).
- Also, test for other common letters.

Since we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.

So, for example, let's consider words that:
- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.
- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Common starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?

I think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let's check:
- R in position 1 (which wasn't tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)
- O, U, T, E: and we don't know about O,U,T.

But we must see if it fits.

Alternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.

So we cannot use words containing A, C, N.

Therefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.

Similarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it's valid.

But we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won't give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.

So putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn't at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.

So ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that's new. Or at 3,4,5.

But we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven't tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.

Therefore, for R: let's put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it's not at position 1? Or wait, if it's misplaced, we get '-' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get '-', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the '-' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.

Similarly, for E: let's put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.

So let's try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn't common? Also, it has 'S' and 'T', which haven't been tested.

But note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.

ROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.

In this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).

Also, O,L,S are new letters.

Similarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.

Another: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn't stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it's not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it's better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?

Yes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.

Therefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That's the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be '-', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don't know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.

So if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.

So better avoid ""tried"".

How about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.

Another word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don't know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don't know about 3 and 4? But we can't put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?

But STREP isn't common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven't tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.

Also, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.

But note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.

""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.

Another: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.

I think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.

Now, with ""RIDES"":
- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is '✓', then R is at 1? Or if '-'? Then R is not at 1? Or 'x'? But that can't happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get 'x' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either '✓' or '-'. Similarly for E at position 4: either '✓' or '-'.

Also, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.

For example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? 
- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? 
Wait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E's position? So it's a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? 

But in ""STORES"", it's 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That's 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be '-'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? 

Also, S,T,O? We don't know.

But compare ""RIDES"": 
- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? 
- R at position 1? Also new? We don't know status? 

So ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven't tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? 

Whereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? 

So I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? 

Another word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? 

Or ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.

Therefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".

But let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.

So guess: ""RIDES""

But note: position in ""RIDES"":
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: D
- 4: E
- 5: S

We expect:
- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?
- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?
- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.

This should give us good information.

So my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:
- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N
- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Positions tested in the first guess**:
  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).
  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).
  - Position 4: N is absent.
  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).

For the second guess, the goal is to:
1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.
2. Avoid using C, A, or N.
3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.

The word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).
- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).
- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).
- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.

This approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.

We have no prior information, so we need an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.\n\nA good starting word should:\n- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.\n- Ideally have letters that are not repeated so we can test more letters.\n\nSome common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.\n\nLet me choose ""CRANE"" because:\n- It contains five distinct letters.\n- The letters are among the most common in English: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, I\'ll start with ""CRANE"".\n\nHowever, note that the rules require a 5-letter English word and we have 6 tries. Since it\'s the first guess, any valid word is acceptable.\n\nSo, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This maximizes the potential for getting informative feedback across multiple positions, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses. The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this:\n- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N\n- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E\n  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got \'-\', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)\n  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got \'-\')\n\nAlso, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we should try a word that:\n- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) \n- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.\n- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.\n\nWe also note the positions:\n- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: \n  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don\'t know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nMoreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nWe should also consider common words containing R and E.\n\nAdditionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.\n\nPossible words: let\'s think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.\n\nExample: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it\'s better to use all unique letters.\n\nBut note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.\n\nLet me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven\'t been tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", position 1: we know it\'s not C, but we don\'t know what it is. Similarly for other positions.\n\nWe tested:\n- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.\n\nBut note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.\n\nLet me try to list possible positions for R and E:\n\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).\n- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we want to cover:\n- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).\n- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).\n- Also, test for other common letters.\n\nSince we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.\n\nSo, for example, let\'s consider words that:\n- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.\n- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, C, N.\n\nCommon starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?\n\nI think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let\'s check:\n- R in position 1 (which wasn\'t tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)\n- O, U, T, E: and we don\'t know about O,U,T.\n\nBut we must see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.\n\nSo we cannot use words containing A, C, N.\n\nTherefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.\n\nSimilarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked \'-\' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won\'t give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.\n\nSo putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn\'t at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven\'t tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.\n\nSo ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that\'s new. Or at 3,4,5.\n\nBut we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven\'t tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.\n\nTherefore, for R: let\'s put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it\'s not at position 1? Or wait, if it\'s misplaced, we get \'-\' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get \'-\', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the \'-\' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.\n\nSimilarly, for E: let\'s put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.\n\nSo let\'s try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn\'t common? Also, it has \'S\' and \'T\', which haven\'t been tested.\n\nBut note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.\n\nROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.\n\nIn this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).\n\nAlso, O,L,S are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn\'t stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it\'s not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it\'s better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?\n\nYes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.\n\nTherefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That\'s the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be \'-\', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don\'t know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.\n\nSo better avoid ""tried"".\n\nHow about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don\'t know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don\'t know about 3 and 4? But we can\'t put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?\n\nBut STREP isn\'t common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.\n\nAlso, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.\n\nBut note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.\n\n""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.\n\nAnother: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.\n\nI think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.\n\nNow, with ""RIDES"":\n- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is \'✓\', then R is at 1? Or if \'-\'? Then R is not at 1? Or \'x\'? But that can\'t happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get \'x\' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either \'✓\' or \'-\'. Similarly for E at position 4: either \'✓\' or \'-\'.\n\nAlso, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.\n\nFor example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? \n- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? \nWait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E\'s position? So it\'s a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? \n\nBut in ""STORES"", it\'s 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That\'s 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be \'-\'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? \n\nAlso, S,T,O? We don\'t know.\n\nBut compare ""RIDES"": \n- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? \n- R at position 1? Also new? We don\'t know status? \n\nSo ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven\'t tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? \n\nWhereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? \n\nSo I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? \n\nAnother word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? \n\nOr ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.\n\nTherefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".\n\nBut let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""RIDES""\n\nBut note: position in ""RIDES"":\n- 1: R\n- 2: I\n- 3: D\n- 4: E\n- 5: S\n\nWe expect:\n- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?\n- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?\n- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:\n- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N\n- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- **Positions tested in the first guess**:\n  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).\n  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).\n  - Position 4: N is absent.\n  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n\nFor the second guess, the goal is to:\n1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.\n2. Avoid using C, A, or N.\n3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:\n- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).\n- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).\n- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).\n- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>rides</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":
- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it's not at position 1.
- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.
- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it's correct!
- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.

Additionally, from first guess feedback:
- C, A, N: x → not in word.
- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).
- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.

Summary of what we know:
- E is in position 4: ✓.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).
  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.

So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Letters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven't identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.

Therefore, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include R? Because we haven't fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it's not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.

Also, we need to guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Because it's fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don't? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it's correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.

So any guess must have E at position 4.

Also, the word must contain R? But we don't know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it's correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? 

But note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let's list the positions:

Positions:
- Position 4: E (fixed)

Now, R must be at 3 or 5? So:
- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? 

But we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? 

But since we are testing? We can create a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Always.
- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? 

Moreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? 

So available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.

But note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that's four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.

Since E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?

For example: 
- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can't use D.

Similarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.

Common words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: R? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: T? 

But we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven't ruled out multiple E? So it's possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it's in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? 

Also? We must see? But let's consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? 

Another word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? 

I'm considering putting R at 3? Then let's think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It's _ _ R E? 

Actually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? 

Another? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? 

""CHORE""? C is absent? No? 

""PLUMBER""? Too long? 

""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that's good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn't have R? 

So we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? 
- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? 

Valid words: 
- ""OGRED""? But D absent? 
- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? 

Now, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? 
- 1: B? 
- 2: E? 
- 3: R? 
- 4: E? 
- 5: T? 

But we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That's good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don't know about other E? 

But in terms of information? We test:
- Position 1: B? If it's present? 
- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don't assume anything? 
- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? 

Therefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? 

Alternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? 

""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? 

""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? 

But with feedback? We want to get information? 

However? ""purER"" might be valid? But let's see? 

Another: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. 

""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? 

So? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? 

But note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? 

But our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? 

Alternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? 

Words: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? 

""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? 

And letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? 

Then? We test R at position 5? 

Similarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? 

But by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? 

So ""TOTER"": 
- Position 1: T? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: T? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: R? 

Then? We test:
- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if '-'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? 
- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? 

But if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don't care? 

But? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? 

However? We can do? 

But preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? 

But? Back to feedback? 

Since R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? 

But let's choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? 

Another word: ""BOULE""? But no R? 

Perhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? 

So? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? 

Consideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? 

But which one is better? 

Perhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": 
- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? 
- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? 
- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? 

Actually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be '-' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be '-' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that's impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give 'x'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be 'x'. 

Similarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. 

So? With ""BERET""?
- Position 1: B - will show if B present? 
- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if '-': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if 'x': E not present at 2? And no additional E? 
- Position 3: R - we care about R position?
- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? 
- Position 5: T

But? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? 

But? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? 

Similarly? For position 5? T? 

Now? Back to? TOTER? 

But? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? 

To avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? 

For example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? 

Words? Like ""CURE""? But too short? 

5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? 

""RARED""? Has A? Absent? 

""TIRED""? But I and D absent? 

""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? 

""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? 

But we want R at 3? 

""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? 

""HERPS""? Not common? 

""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? 

So? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? 

For example? ""TRECK"" not word? 

""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? 

""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? 

With available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? 

So possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" 

Other words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? 

""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? 

""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? 

Words like ""CREEK""? C absent? 

Perhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? 

Also, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be 'x'? Or if duplicate? 

But it's messy? 

Since valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let's accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? 

Therefore? I choose ""BERET""

So? Third guess: ""BERET""

Perhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? 

""KEREL""? Obscure? 

So? BERET is standard? 

Thus: guess ""BERET""

### Reasoning for Guess 3:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C, A, N are absent (x).  
  - R is present but misplaced (-).  
  - E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  
  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  
  - I, D, S are absent (x).  
  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.

**Key deductions**:  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - R and E must be in the word.  
  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  
- **Position constraints for R**:  
  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  
  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  
  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn't in) must hold a new letter.

**Strategy for Guess 3**:  
- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  
- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  
- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  
- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  
- The word **""BERET""** fits:  
  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  
  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  
  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  
  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.

**Expected outcomes**:  
- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  
- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  
- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.

<guess>beret</guess>",beret,"We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":
- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it's not at position 1.
- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.
- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it's correct!
- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.

Additionally, from first guess feedback:
- C, A, N: x → not in word.
- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).
- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.

Summary of what we know:
- E is in position 4: ✓.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).
  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.

So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Letters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven't identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.

Therefore, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include R? Because we haven't fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it's not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.

Also, we need to guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Because it's fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don't? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it's correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.

So any guess must have E at position 4.

Also, the word must contain R? But we don't know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it's correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? 

But note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let's list the positions:

Positions:
- Position 4: E (fixed)

Now, R must be at 3 or 5? So:
- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? 

But we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? 

But since we are testing? We can create a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Always.
- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? 

Moreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? 

So available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.

But note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that's four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.

Since E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?

For example: 
- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can't use D.

Similarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.

Common words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: R? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: T? 

But we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven't ruled out multiple E? So it's possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it's in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? 

Also? We must see? But let's consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? 

Another word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? 

I'm considering putting R at 3? Then let's think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It's _ _ R E? 

Actually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? 

Another? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? 

""CHORE""? C is absent? No? 

""PLUMBER""? Too long? 

""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that's good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn't have R? 

So we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? 
- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? 

Valid words: 
- ""OGRED""? But D absent? 
- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? 

Now, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? 
- 1: B? 
- 2: E? 
- 3: R? 
- 4: E? 
- 5: T? 

But we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That's good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don't know about other E? 

But in terms of information? We test:
- Position 1: B? If it's present? 
- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don't assume anything? 
- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? 

Therefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? 

Alternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? 

""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? 

""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? 

But with feedback? We want to get information? 

However? ""purER"" might be valid? But let's see? 

Another: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. 

""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? 

So? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? 

But note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? 

But our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? 

Alternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? 

Words: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? 

""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? 

And letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? 

Then? We test R at position 5? 

Similarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? 

But by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? 

So ""TOTER"": 
- Position 1: T? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: T? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: R? 

Then? We test:
- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if '-'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? 
- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? 

But if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don't care? 

But? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? 

However? We can do? 

But preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? 

But? Back to feedback? 

Since R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? 

But let's choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? 

Another word: ""BOULE""? But no R? 

Perhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? 

So? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? 

Consideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? 

But which one is better? 

Perhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": 
- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? 
- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? 
- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? 

Actually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be '-' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be '-' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that's impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give 'x'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be 'x'. 

Similarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. 

So? With ""BERET""?
- Position 1: B - will show if B present? 
- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if '-': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if 'x': E not present at 2? And no additional E? 
- Position 3: R - we care about R position?
- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? 
- Position 5: T

But? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? 

But? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? 

Similarly? For position 5? T? 

Now? Back to? TOTER? 

But? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? 

To avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? 

For example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? 

Words? Like ""CURE""? But too short? 

5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? 

""RARED""? Has A? Absent? 

""TIRED""? But I and D absent? 

""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? 

""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? 

But we want R at 3? 

""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? 

""HERPS""? Not common? 

""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? 

So? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? 

For example? ""TRECK"" not word? 

""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? 

""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? 

With available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? 

So possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" 

Other words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? 

""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? 

""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? 

Words like ""CREEK""? C absent? 

Perhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? 

Also, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be 'x'? Or if duplicate? 

But it's messy? 

Since valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let's accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? 

Therefore? I choose ""BERET""

<guess>beret</guess>### Reasoning for Guess 3:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C, A, N are absent (x).  
  - R is present but misplaced (-).  
  - E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  
  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  
  - I, D, S are absent (x).  
  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.

**Key deductions**:  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - R and E must be in the word.  
  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  
- **Position constraints for R**:  
  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  
  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  
  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn't in) must hold a new letter.

**Strategy for Guess 3**:  
- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  
- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  
- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  
- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  
- The word **""BERET""** fits:  
  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  
  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  
  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  
  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.

**Expected outcomes**:  
- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  
- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  
- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.",Guess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,mower,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior information, so we need an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- Ideally have letters that are not repeated so we can test more letters.

Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains five distinct letters.
- The letters are among the most common in English: C, R, A, N, E.

So, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

However, note that the rules require a 5-letter English word and we have 6 tries. Since it's the first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This maximizes the potential for getting informative feedback across multiple positions, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses. The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E
  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got '-', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)
  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got '-')

Also, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

Now, for our second guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) 
- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.

We also note the positions:
- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: 
  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don't know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

We should also consider common words containing R and E.

Additionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.

Possible words: let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Example: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it's better to use all unique letters.

But note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.

Let me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven't been tested.

In ""crane"", position 1: we know it's not C, but we don't know what it is. Similarly for other positions.

We tested:
- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.

But note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.

Let me try to list possible positions for R and E:

- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).

But note: the word has 5 positions.

Now, for our second guess, we want to cover:
- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).
- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).
- Also, test for other common letters.

Since we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.

So, for example, let's consider words that:
- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.
- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Common starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?

I think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let's check:
- R in position 1 (which wasn't tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)
- O, U, T, E: and we don't know about O,U,T.

But we must see if it fits.

Alternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.

So we cannot use words containing A, C, N.

Therefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.

Similarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it's valid.

But we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won't give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.

So putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn't at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.

So ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that's new. Or at 3,4,5.

But we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven't tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.

Therefore, for R: let's put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it's not at position 1? Or wait, if it's misplaced, we get '-' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get '-', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the '-' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.

Similarly, for E: let's put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.

So let's try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn't common? Also, it has 'S' and 'T', which haven't been tested.

But note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.

ROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.

In this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).

Also, O,L,S are new letters.

Similarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.

Another: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn't stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it's not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it's better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?

Yes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.

Therefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That's the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be '-', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don't know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.

So if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.

So better avoid ""tried"".

How about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.

Another word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don't know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don't know about 3 and 4? But we can't put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?

But STREP isn't common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven't tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.

Also, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.

But note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.

""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.

Another: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.

I think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.

Now, with ""RIDES"":
- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is '✓', then R is at 1? Or if '-'? Then R is not at 1? Or 'x'? But that can't happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get 'x' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either '✓' or '-'. Similarly for E at position 4: either '✓' or '-'.

Also, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.

For example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? 
- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? 
Wait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E's position? So it's a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? 

But in ""STORES"", it's 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That's 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be '-'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? 

Also, S,T,O? We don't know.

But compare ""RIDES"": 
- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? 
- R at position 1? Also new? We don't know status? 

So ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven't tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? 

Whereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? 

So I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? 

Another word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? 

Or ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.

Therefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".

But let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.

So guess: ""RIDES""

But note: position in ""RIDES"":
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: D
- 4: E
- 5: S

We expect:
- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?
- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?
- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.

This should give us good information.

So my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:
- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N
- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Positions tested in the first guess**:
  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).
  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).
  - Position 4: N is absent.
  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).

For the second guess, the goal is to:
1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.
2. Avoid using C, A, or N.
3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.

The word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).
- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).
- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).
- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.

This approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.

<guess>rides</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":
- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it's not at position 1.
- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.
- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it's correct!
- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.

Additionally, from first guess feedback:
- C, A, N: x → not in word.
- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).
- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.

Summary of what we know:
- E is in position 4: ✓.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).
  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.

So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Letters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven't identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.

Therefore, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include R? Because we haven't fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it's not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.

Also, we need to guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Because it's fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don't? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it's correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.

So any guess must have E at position 4.

Also, the word must contain R? But we don't know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it's correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? 

But note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let's list the positions:

Positions:
- Position 4: E (fixed)

Now, R must be at 3 or 5? So:
- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? 

But we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? 

But since we are testing? We can create a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Always.
- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? 

Moreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? 

So available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.

But note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that's four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.

Since E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?

For example: 
- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can't use D.

Similarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.

Common words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: R? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: T? 

But we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven't ruled out multiple E? So it's possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it's in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? 

Also? We must see? But let's consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? 

Another word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? 

I'm considering putting R at 3? Then let's think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It's _ _ R E? 

Actually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? 

Another? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? 

""CHORE""? C is absent? No? 

""PLUMBER""? Too long? 

""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that's good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn't have R? 

So we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? 
- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? 

Valid words: 
- ""OGRED""? But D absent? 
- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? 

Now, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? 
- 1: B? 
- 2: E? 
- 3: R? 
- 4: E? 
- 5: T? 

But we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That's good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don't know about other E? 

But in terms of information? We test:
- Position 1: B? If it's present? 
- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don't assume anything? 
- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? 

Therefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? 

Alternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? 

""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? 

""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? 

But with feedback? We want to get information? 

However? ""purER"" might be valid? But let's see? 

Another: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. 

""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? 

So? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? 

But note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? 

But our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? 

Alternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? 

Words: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? 

""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? 

And letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? 

Then? We test R at position 5? 

Similarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? 

But by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? 

So ""TOTER"": 
- Position 1: T? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: T? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: R? 

Then? We test:
- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if '-'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? 
- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? 

But if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don't care? 

But? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? 

However? We can do? 

But preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? 

But? Back to feedback? 

Since R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? 

But let's choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? 

Another word: ""BOULE""? But no R? 

Perhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? 

So? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? 

Consideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? 

But which one is better? 

Perhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": 
- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? 
- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? 
- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? 

Actually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be '-' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be '-' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that's impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give 'x'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be 'x'. 

Similarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. 

So? With ""BERET""?
- Position 1: B - will show if B present? 
- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if '-': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if 'x': E not present at 2? And no additional E? 
- Position 3: R - we care about R position?
- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? 
- Position 5: T

But? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? 

But? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? 

Similarly? For position 5? T? 

Now? Back to? TOTER? 

But? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? 

To avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? 

For example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? 

Words? Like ""CURE""? But too short? 

5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? 

""RARED""? Has A? Absent? 

""TIRED""? But I and D absent? 

""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? 

""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? 

But we want R at 3? 

""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? 

""HERPS""? Not common? 

""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? 

So? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? 

For example? ""TRECK"" not word? 

""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? 

""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? 

With available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? 

So possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" 

Other words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? 

""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? 

""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? 

Words like ""CREEK""? C absent? 

Perhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? 

Also, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be 'x'? Or if duplicate? 

But it's messy? 

Since valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let's accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? 

Therefore? I choose ""BERET""

So? Third guess: ""BERET""

Perhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? 

""KEREL""? Obscure? 

So? BERET is standard? 

Thus: guess ""BERET""

<guess>beret</guess>### Reasoning for Guess 3:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C, A, N are absent (x).  
  - R is present but misplaced (-).  
  - E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  
  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  
  - I, D, S are absent (x).  
  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.

**Key deductions**:  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - R and E must be in the word.  
  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  
- **Position constraints for R**:  
  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  
  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  
  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn't in) must hold a new letter.

**Strategy for Guess 3**:  
- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  
- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  
- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  
- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  
- The word **""BERET""** fits:  
  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  
  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  
  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  
  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.

**Expected outcomes**:  
- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  
- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  
- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.

The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this:\n- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N\n- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E\n  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got \'-\', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)\n  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got \'-\')\n\nAlso, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we should try a word that:\n- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) \n- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.\n- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.\n\nWe also note the positions:\n- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: \n  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don\'t know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nMoreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nWe should also consider common words containing R and E.\n\nAdditionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.\n\nPossible words: let\'s think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.\n\nExample: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it\'s better to use all unique letters.\n\nBut note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.\n\nLet me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven\'t been tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", position 1: we know it\'s not C, but we don\'t know what it is. Similarly for other positions.\n\nWe tested:\n- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.\n\nBut note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.\n\nLet me try to list possible positions for R and E:\n\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).\n- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we want to cover:\n- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).\n- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).\n- Also, test for other common letters.\n\nSince we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.\n\nSo, for example, let\'s consider words that:\n- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.\n- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, C, N.\n\nCommon starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?\n\nI think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let\'s check:\n- R in position 1 (which wasn\'t tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)\n- O, U, T, E: and we don\'t know about O,U,T.\n\nBut we must see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.\n\nSo we cannot use words containing A, C, N.\n\nTherefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.\n\nSimilarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked \'-\' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won\'t give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.\n\nSo putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn\'t at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven\'t tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.\n\nSo ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that\'s new. Or at 3,4,5.\n\nBut we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven\'t tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.\n\nTherefore, for R: let\'s put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it\'s not at position 1? Or wait, if it\'s misplaced, we get \'-\' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get \'-\', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the \'-\' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.\n\nSimilarly, for E: let\'s put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.\n\nSo let\'s try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn\'t common? Also, it has \'S\' and \'T\', which haven\'t been tested.\n\nBut note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.\n\nROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.\n\nIn this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).\n\nAlso, O,L,S are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn\'t stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it\'s not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it\'s better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?\n\nYes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.\n\nTherefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That\'s the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be \'-\', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don\'t know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.\n\nSo better avoid ""tried"".\n\nHow about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don\'t know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don\'t know about 3 and 4? But we can\'t put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?\n\nBut STREP isn\'t common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.\n\nAlso, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.\n\nBut note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.\n\n""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.\n\nAnother: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.\n\nI think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.\n\nNow, with ""RIDES"":\n- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is \'✓\', then R is at 1? Or if \'-\'? Then R is not at 1? Or \'x\'? But that can\'t happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get \'x\' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either \'✓\' or \'-\'. Similarly for E at position 4: either \'✓\' or \'-\'.\n\nAlso, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.\n\nFor example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? \n- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? \nWait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E\'s position? So it\'s a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? \n\nBut in ""STORES"", it\'s 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That\'s 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be \'-\'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? \n\nAlso, S,T,O? We don\'t know.\n\nBut compare ""RIDES"": \n- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? \n- R at position 1? Also new? We don\'t know status? \n\nSo ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven\'t tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? \n\nWhereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? \n\nSo I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? \n\nAnother word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? \n\nOr ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.\n\nTherefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".\n\nBut let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""RIDES""\n\nBut note: position in ""RIDES"":\n- 1: R\n- 2: I\n- 3: D\n- 4: E\n- 5: S\n\nWe expect:\n- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?\n- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?\n- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:\n- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N\n- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- **Positions tested in the first guess**:\n  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).\n  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).\n  - Position 4: N is absent.\n  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n\nFor the second guess, the goal is to:\n1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.\n2. Avoid using C, A, or N.\n3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:\n- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).\n- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).\n- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).\n- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>rides</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it\'s not at position 1.\n- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.\n- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it\'s correct!\n- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from first guess feedback:\n- C, A, N: x → not in word.\n- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).\n- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.\n\nSummary of what we know:\n- E is in position 4: ✓.\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:\n  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).\n  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.\n\nSo absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.\n\nLetters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven\'t identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.\n\nTherefore, for the third guess, we need to:\n- Include R? Because we haven\'t fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it\'s not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.\n\nAlso, we need to guess a word that:\n- Has E at position 4? Because it\'s fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don\'t? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it\'s correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.\n\nSo any guess must have E at position 4.\n\nAlso, the word must contain R? But we don\'t know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it\'s correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? \n\nBut note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let\'s list the positions:\n\nPositions:\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n\nNow, R must be at 3 or 5? So:\n- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? \n\nBut we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? \n\nBut since we are testing? We can create a word that:\n- Has E at position 4? Always.\n- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? \n\nMoreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? \n\nSo available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nBut note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that\'s four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.\n\nSince E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.\n\nNow, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?\n\nFor example: \n- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can\'t use D.\n\nSimilarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.\n\nCommon words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": \n- Position 1: B? \n- Position 2: E? \n- Position 3: R? \n- Position 4: E? \n- Position 5: T? \n\nBut we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven\'t ruled out multiple E? So it\'s possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it\'s in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? \n\nAlso? We must see? But let\'s consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? \n\nAnother word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? \n\nI\'m considering putting R at 3? Then let\'s think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It\'s _ _ R E? \n\nActually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? \n\nAnother? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? \n\n""CHORE""? C is absent? No? \n\n""PLUMBER""? Too long? \n\n""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that\'s good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn\'t have R? \n\nSo we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? \n\nExamples: \n- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? \n- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? \n\nValid words: \n- ""OGRED""? But D absent? \n- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? \n\nNow, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? \n- 1: B? \n- 2: E? \n- 3: R? \n- 4: E? \n- 5: T? \n\nBut we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That\'s good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don\'t know about other E? \n\nBut in terms of information? We test:\n- Position 1: B? If it\'s present? \n- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don\'t assume anything? \n- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? \n\nTherefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? \n\nAlternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? \n\n""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? \n\n""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? \n\nBut with feedback? We want to get information? \n\nHowever? ""purER"" might be valid? But let\'s see? \n\nAnother: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. \n\n""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? \n\nSo? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? \n\nBut note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? \n\nBut our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? \n\nAlternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? \n\nWords: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? \n\n""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? \n\nAnd letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? \n\nThen? We test R at position 5? \n\nSimilarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? \n\nBut by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? \n\nSo ""TOTER"": \n- Position 1: T? \n- Position 2: O? \n- Position 3: T? \n- Position 4: E? \n- Position 5: R? \n\nThen? We test:\n- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if \'-\'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? \n- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? \n\nBut if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don\'t care? \n\nBut? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? \n\nHowever? We can do? \n\nBut preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? \n\nBut? Back to feedback? \n\nSince R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? \n\nBut let\'s choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? \n\nAnother word: ""BOULE""? But no R? \n\nPerhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? \n\nSo? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? \n\nConsideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nPerhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": \n- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? \n- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? \n- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? \n\nActually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be \'-\' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be \'-\' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that\'s impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give \'x\'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be \'x\'. \n\nSimilarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. \n\nSo? With ""BERET""?\n- Position 1: B - will show if B present? \n- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if \'-\': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if \'x\': E not present at 2? And no additional E? \n- Position 3: R - we care about R position?\n- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? \n- Position 5: T\n\nBut? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? \n\nBut? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be \'x\'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? \n\nSimilarly? For position 5? T? \n\nNow? Back to? TOTER? \n\nBut? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? \n\nTo avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? \n\nFor example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? \n\nWords? Like ""CURE""? But too short? \n\n5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? \n\n""RARED""? Has A? Absent? \n\n""TIRED""? But I and D absent? \n\n""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? \n\n""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? \n\nBut we want R at 3? \n\n""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? \n\n""HERPS""? Not common? \n\n""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? \n\nSo? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? \n\nFor example? ""TRECK"" not word? \n\n""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? \n\n""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? \n\nWe need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? \n\nWith available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? \n\nSo possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" \n\nOther words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? \n\n""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? \n\nWe need position 3:R? \n\n""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? \n\nWords like ""CREEK""? C absent? \n\nPerhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? \n\nAlso, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be \'x\'? Or if duplicate? \n\nBut it\'s messy? \n\nSince valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let\'s accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? \n\nTherefore? I choose ""BERET""\n\nSo? Third guess: ""BERET""\n\nPerhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? \n\n""KEREL""? Obscure? \n\nSo? BERET is standard? \n\nThus: guess ""BERET"" \n\nRefine:\n<guess>beret</guess>### Reasoning for Guess 3:\n\nBased on the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  \n  - C, A, N are absent (x).  \n  - R is present but misplaced (-).  \n  - E is present but misplaced (-).  \n- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  \n  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  \n  - I, D, S are absent (x).  \n  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.\n\n**Key deductions**:  \n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  \n- **Present letters**:  \n  - R and E must be in the word.  \n  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  \n- **Position constraints for R**:  \n  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  \n  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  \n- **Unknown positions**:  \n  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  \n  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn\'t in) must hold a new letter.\n\n**Strategy for Guess 3**:  \n- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  \n- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  \n- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  \n- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  \n- The word **""BERET""** fits:  \n  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  \n  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  \n  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  \n  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  \n  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.\n\n**Expected outcomes**:  \n- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  \n- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  \n- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.\n\n<guess>beret</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""beret"":
- B: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 2
- R: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 3
- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4, as expected
- T: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (from all feedback: crane, rides, beret)
- From guess 1: C, A, N absent
- From guess 2: I, D, S absent
- From guess 3: B, T absent

**Present Letters**:
- E: confirmed at position 4 (✓ in beret)
- R: present but not at position 1, 2, or 3 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3 respectively)

Also, from the feedback of beret:
- The E at position 2 is misplaced (-). This means there is another E in the word? But wait, we already have E at position 4. So if E at position 2 is misplaced, it implies that the secret word has at least two E's? Or is that necessarily true?

Let me think: 
- We know E is at position 4 (fixed).
- We guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.
- Since we already have E at position 4, the '-' for position 2 must mean that there is an additional E in the word? Because if there were only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 would be an incorrect position for the only E, so it should be marked as 'x' (absent) for that position? But it was marked as '-', which means it is present but misplaced. Therefore, there must be at least two E's in the word.

So, the secret word has at least two E's: one at position 4, and at least one more elsewhere.

Also, R is present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the word has 5 positions, R must be at position 5? Because position 4 is E.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → so must be at 5? But we have 5 positions, so R must be at position 5? 

But let's confirm: 
- From guess 1: R was at position 2 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 2: R was at position 1 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 3: R was at position 3 → misplaced (-)
- Therefore, R is not at 1,2,3. And position 4 is E, so R must be at position 5.

So R is at position 5.

Now, we have:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

And we know there is at least one more E (since E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning another E exists). The only positions left are 1,2,3. So one of positions 1,2,3 must be E? But we have three positions and we know one of them is E (the second E).

Also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. So we cannot use these.

Now, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ E R

And we know one of the first three positions is E (the second E). Also, the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: We have to avoid C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. Also, we have E and R already, but E can be repeated.

The alphabet: A to Z, minus absent: 
Absent: A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T → so available: E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we know the word must have at least two E's, so one E is at position 4, and another E at one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word is of the form: X Y Z E R, where one of X,Y,Z is E, and the other two are from the available letters.

Now, for our next guess, we need to test possibilities for positions 1,2,3.

We know one of them is E, but we don't know which one. Also, the other two are unknown.

We should try to guess a word that has E in one of the positions 1,2,3 and uses common letters for the others to test.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are at guess 4 of 6.

Possible strategies:

1. Test E at position 1: then the word would be E ? ? E R. But we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.

2. Or test E at position 2: ? E ? E R

3. Or test E at position 3: ? ? E E R

We can choose one of these and use common letters for the unknowns.

But we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Moreover, we can get information about the other positions.

Let me list possible words:

First, if E is at position 1: E _ _ E R

Possible words: EATER? But A and T are absent? A absent, T absent (from beret, T is absent). So not.

EAGER? A absent.

EASER? A and S absent.

No, because A and T are out.

Similarly, words like EGGER? G,G? E G G E R? That's a word (one who gathers eggs). Letters: E,G,G,E,R. Avoid absent? G is not absent? And E,R are in. Absent are A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T. So G is available.

Similarly, EGGER: positions:1:E,2:G,3:G,4:E,5:R.

But we have two G's? That's fine.

Similarly, other words: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHOS? But C and S absent.

So EGGER is a possibility.

But we don't know if E is at position 1.

Similarly, if E is at position 2: _ E _ E R

Words: ? E ? E R

Like: LEVER? L E V E R? But V? Available? Yes. L not absent.

LEVER: positions:1:L,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R.

Similarly, FEWER? F E W E R? F and W available.

Or HEXER? H E X E R? H and X available.

But we need to choose.

If E is at position 3: _ _ E E R

Words: ? ? E E R

Like: UPPER? U P P E R? U and P available.

But UPPER: positions:1:U,2:P,3:P,4:E,5:R? But position 3 is P, not E? We need position 3 to be E.

Pattern: position 3 must be E? So _ _ E E R.

Examples: AGREE? But A and G? A absent.

BLEED? B and D absent.

FLEER? F L E E R? F and L available? FLEER is a word? Meaning to mock or jeer.

Similarly, GLEEK? Not E E R.

So FLEER: F L E E R? Positions:1:F,2:L,3:E,4:E,5:R.

Yes.

Now, back to the feedback: we need to design a guess that can distinguish the position of the second E.

Since we have three possibilities (E at 1, E at 2, or E at 3), we can choose a word that tests one of these.

But we also want to test common letters for the other positions.

Moreover, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover as much as possible.

Another idea: since we know the word ends with E R, and has E at 4, R at 5, and one more E in 1-3, we can guess a word that has E at position 1, for example, to see if it's there.

If we guess a word with E at position 1, and it is correct (green), then we know E is at 1. If it is misplaced, then E is not at 1, but since we know there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3. Similarly, if we get 'x' for E at 1? But we know there is another E, so it cannot be 'x'? It must be either green or yellow? Because E is present elsewhere.

Similarly for other positions.

So, let's choose to test E at position 1.

Guess a word: E _ _ E R

With available letters.

For example, EGGER: E G G E R

But we have to avoid absent letters, and G is available.

EGGER is a valid word.

If we guess EGGER:
- Position 1: E → if green, then E is at position 1. If yellow, then E is not at 1 (so must be at 2 or 3).
- Position 2: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 2?
- Position 3: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 3? But if G is present, it might show yellow or green? But we have two G's? So if the word has G, it might be complicated.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters if possible.

But in EGGER, we have two G's.

Alternative: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHER? Not.

Another word: EATER? But A and T absent.

Not possible.

Perhaps ""EMMER""? E M M E R? M is available? E M M E R? That's a word (a type of wheat). Positions:1:E,2:M,3:M,4:E,5:R.

Still duplicate M.

""EVERR""? Not a word.

""EXERT""? But X and T? T is absent? From beret, T is absent? So cannot.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""EXPEL""? But P and L? But ends with L, not R? Not.

So, it's hard to find a word with E at 1 and distinct letters? Because the pattern E _ _ E R requires the middle two letters to form a word.

Another: ""EGRET""? E G R E T? But R is at position 3? And T is absent? Also, we have R at position 3, but we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have R at position 3? Because R is only at position 5? So the word must not have R except at position 5? But in EGRET, R is at position 3? So if we guess that, position 3 R would be wrong? But we know R is at 5? So it would be a wasted guess? Better not to use R in other positions.

Therefore, in our guess, we should not use R except at position 5? Because we know R is fixed at 5? Similarly, E at position 4 is fixed? So for positions 1,2,3, we should not use E except if we are testing it? But we are testing E at 1? So for position 1, we use E? For positions 2 and 3, we should use other letters? Not R? Not E? Unless necessary.

In EGGER, position 3 is G? Not R? So that's fine? But duplicate G.

But let's proceed with EGGER? Or find a better word.

Another word: ""EEKER""? E E K E R? But E at position 2? And we are testing E at position 1? But E at position 2 is also E? So positions:1:E,2:E,3:K,4:E,5:R? Then we have three E's? Which might be possible? But K is available.

But ""EEKER"" is not common? Perhaps not valid.

""ELVER""? E L V E R? L and V available? ELVER is a word (young eel). Positions:1:E,2:L,3:V,4:E,5:R.

This has distinct letters except for E? But E is repeated? But we are testing E at position 1? And position 4 is fixed E? So position 2 and 3 are L and V? New letters.

So ""ELVER"" might be a good choice.

Similarly, ""EMMEW""? Not common.

So I think ""ELVER"" is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback from beret: we have E at position 2 was misplaced? So there is another E? But in ELVER, we are putting E at position 1? So we can test.

Alternatively, we could test E at position 2? With a word like ? E ? E R

For example, ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But then we have E at position 2? And position 4? So if we guess LEVER, we test E at position 2? If green, then E is at 2? If yellow, then E not at 2? But since there is another E, it must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, we test L and V.

But LEVER has E at position 2 and 4? So if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 would be green? Etc.

But we don't know which position the second E is in.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests E at a specific position and uses new letters.

Since we have three positions to test (1,2,3) for E, and two of them will be other letters, we can choose one.

I think testing E at position 1 is as good as any.

So let's go with ""ELVER"".

But ""ELVER"" has E at 1, L at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

We know position 4 and 5 are fixed? So we expect E at 4 green, R at 5 green? But we don't know R at 5 is fixed? We deduced it must be? But we haven't confirmed? In the feedback, we will see.

Actually, from deduction, R must be at 5? But we need to confirm? Because if we are wrong, it might be elsewhere? But we have eliminated positions 1,2,3 for R? And position 4 is E? So only position 5 left? So it must be there.

Similarly, E at 4 is fixed.

So in ""ELVER"", position 4 and 5 should be green? And position 1: E? If green, then E is at 1? If yellow, then E is not at 1? But since there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3.

Also, position 2: L? Test if L is in the word? Position 3: V? Test if V is in the word.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""ELVER"" for guess 4.

But let's make sure: is ""ELVER"" a valid word? Yes, it means a young eel.

So guess: ELVER

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.

If we get lucky, we might solve.

Otherwise, we get more information.

So:

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback on all guesses:
- **Absent Letters (x)**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (excluded from future guesses).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: Confirmed at position 4 (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).
  - **R**: Present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 (misplaced in all guesses). Since position 4 is E, R must be at position 5.
- **Key Insight from Guess 3 (beret)**:
  - The E at position 2 was misplaced (-), meaning there is **at least one additional E** in the word (besides position 4). Thus, the secret word has two E's: one fixed at position 4, and another at position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Word Structure**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ _ E R`, with one of the first three positions being the second E, and the other two positions filled with letters not in the absent list.

**Deductions**:
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, B, C, D, I, N, S, T are absent).
- **Positions 1, 2, and 3**:
  - One must be E (the second E).
  - The other two must be from the available letters.
- **Goal for Guess 4**: Test the position of the second E (position 1, 2, or 3) while probing new common letters for the remaining positions.

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Test E at position 1**: This helps resolve the location of the second E. If E is correct (✓) at position 1, we confirm the second E is there. If misplaced (-), the second E must be at position 2 or 3.
- **Use new common letters**: For positions 2 and 3, choose high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, V) to maximize information if they are present/absent.
- **Avoid redundant positions**: Position 4 (E) and position 5 (R) are fixed, so the guess must include E at 4 and R at 5.
- **Chosen word: ""ELVER""** (a valid English word meaning a young eel):
  - **E** at position 1: Tests if the second E is here.
  - **L** at position 2: Probes a common consonant.
  - **V** at position 3: Probes a less common letter to cover more ground.
  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (expected ✓).
  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (expected ✓).

**Expected Outcomes**:
- If E at position 1 is ✓, the secret word is `E _ _ E R`, and we focus on positions 2–3 next.
- If E at position 1 is -, the second E must be at position 2 or 3, and we use the feedback on L and V to narrow options.
- Feedback on L and V will reveal if they are present, guiding the next guess.

<guess>elver</guess>",elver,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""beret"":
- B: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 2
- R: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 3
- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4, as expected
- T: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (from all feedback: crane, rides, beret)
- From guess 1: C, A, N absent
- From guess 2: I, D, S absent
- From guess 3: B, T absent

**Present Letters**:
- E: confirmed at position 4 (✓ in beret)
- R: present but not at position 1, 2, or 3 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3 respectively)

Also, from the feedback of beret:
- The E at position 2 is misplaced (-). This means there is another E in the word? But wait, we already have E at position 4. So if E at position 2 is misplaced, it implies that the secret word has at least two E's? Or is that necessarily true?

Let me think: 
- We know E is at position 4 (fixed).
- We guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.
- Since we already have E at position 4, the '-' for position 2 must mean that there is an additional E in the word? Because if there were only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 would be an incorrect position for the only E, so it should be marked as 'x' (absent) for that position? But it was marked as '-', which means it is present but misplaced. Therefore, there must be at least two E's in the word.

So, the secret word has at least two E's: one at position 4, and at least one more elsewhere.

Also, R is present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the word has 5 positions, R must be at position 5? Because position 4 is E.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → so must be at 5? But we have 5 positions, so R must be at position 5? 

But let's confirm: 
- From guess 1: R was at position 2 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 2: R was at position 1 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 3: R was at position 3 → misplaced (-)
- Therefore, R is not at 1,2,3. And position 4 is E, so R must be at position 5.

So R is at position 5.

Now, we have:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

And we know there is at least one more E (since E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning another E exists). The only positions left are 1,2,3. So one of positions 1,2,3 must be E? But we have three positions and we know one of them is E (the second E).

Also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. So we cannot use these.

Now, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ E R

And we know one of the first three positions is E (the second E). Also, the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: We have to avoid C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. Also, we have E and R already, but E can be repeated.

The alphabet: A to Z, minus absent: 
Absent: A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T → so available: E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we know the word must have at least two E's, so one E is at position 4, and another E at one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word is of the form: X Y Z E R, where one of X,Y,Z is E, and the other two are from the available letters.

Now, for our next guess, we need to test possibilities for positions 1,2,3.

We know one of them is E, but we don't know which one. Also, the other two are unknown.

We should try to guess a word that has E in one of the positions 1,2,3 and uses common letters for the others to test.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are at guess 4 of 6.

Possible strategies:

1. Test E at position 1: then the word would be E ? ? E R. But we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.

2. Or test E at position 2: ? E ? E R

3. Or test E at position 3: ? ? E E R

We can choose one of these and use common letters for the unknowns.

But we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Moreover, we can get information about the other positions.

Let me list possible words:

First, if E is at position 1: E _ _ E R

Possible words: EATER? But A and T are absent? A absent, T absent (from beret, T is absent). So not.

EAGER? A absent.

EASER? A and S absent.

No, because A and T are out.

Similarly, words like EGGER? G,G? E G G E R? That's a word (one who gathers eggs). Letters: E,G,G,E,R. Avoid absent? G is not absent? And E,R are in. Absent are A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T. So G is available.

Similarly, EGGER: positions:1:E,2:G,3:G,4:E,5:R.

But we have two G's? That's fine.

Similarly, other words: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHOS? But C and S absent.

So EGGER is a possibility.

But we don't know if E is at position 1.

Similarly, if E is at position 2: _ E _ E R

Words: ? E ? E R

Like: LEVER? L E V E R? But V? Available? Yes. L not absent.

LEVER: positions:1:L,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R.

Similarly, FEWER? F E W E R? F and W available.

Or HEXER? H E X E R? H and X available.

But we need to choose.

If E is at position 3: _ _ E E R

Words: ? ? E E R

Like: UPPER? U P P E R? U and P available.

But UPPER: positions:1:U,2:P,3:P,4:E,5:R? But position 3 is P, not E? We need position 3 to be E.

Pattern: position 3 must be E? So _ _ E E R.

Examples: AGREE? But A and G? A absent.

BLEED? B and D absent.

FLEER? F L E E R? F and L available? FLEER is a word? Meaning to mock or jeer.

Similarly, GLEEK? Not E E R.

So FLEER: F L E E R? Positions:1:F,2:L,3:E,4:E,5:R.

Yes.

Now, back to the feedback: we need to design a guess that can distinguish the position of the second E.

Since we have three possibilities (E at 1, E at 2, or E at 3), we can choose a word that tests one of these.

But we also want to test common letters for the other positions.

Moreover, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover as much as possible.

Another idea: since we know the word ends with E R, and has E at 4, R at 5, and one more E in 1-3, we can guess a word that has E at position 1, for example, to see if it's there.

If we guess a word with E at position 1, and it is correct (green), then we know E is at 1. If it is misplaced, then E is not at 1, but since we know there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3. Similarly, if we get 'x' for E at 1? But we know there is another E, so it cannot be 'x'? It must be either green or yellow? Because E is present elsewhere.

Similarly for other positions.

So, let's choose to test E at position 1.

Guess a word: E _ _ E R

With available letters.

For example, EGGER: E G G E R

But we have to avoid absent letters, and G is available.

EGGER is a valid word.

If we guess EGGER:
- Position 1: E → if green, then E is at position 1. If yellow, then E is not at 1 (so must be at 2 or 3).
- Position 2: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 2?
- Position 3: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 3? But if G is present, it might show yellow or green? But we have two G's? So if the word has G, it might be complicated.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters if possible.

But in EGGER, we have two G's.

Alternative: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHER? Not.

Another word: EATER? But A and T absent.

Not possible.

Perhaps ""EMMER""? E M M E R? M is available? E M M E R? That's a word (a type of wheat). Positions:1:E,2:M,3:M,4:E,5:R.

Still duplicate M.

""EVERR""? Not a word.

""EXERT""? But X and T? T is absent? From beret, T is absent? So cannot.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""EXPEL""? But P and L? But ends with L, not R? Not.

So, it's hard to find a word with E at 1 and distinct letters? Because the pattern E _ _ E R requires the middle two letters to form a word.

Another: ""EGRET""? E G R E T? But R is at position 3? And T is absent? Also, we have R at position 3, but we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have R at position 3? Because R is only at position 5? So the word must not have R except at position 5? But in EGRET, R is at position 3? So if we guess that, position 3 R would be wrong? But we know R is at 5? So it would be a wasted guess? Better not to use R in other positions.

Therefore, in our guess, we should not use R except at position 5? Because we know R is fixed at 5? Similarly, E at position 4 is fixed? So for positions 1,2,3, we should not use E except if we are testing it? But we are testing E at 1? So for position 1, we use E? For positions 2 and 3, we should use other letters? Not R? Not E? Unless necessary.

In EGGER, position 3 is G? Not R? So that's fine? But duplicate G.

But let's proceed with EGGER? Or find a better word.

Another word: ""EEKER""? E E K E R? But E at position 2? And we are testing E at position 1? But E at position 2 is also E? So positions:1:E,2:E,3:K,4:E,5:R? Then we have three E's? Which might be possible? But K is available.

But ""EEKER"" is not common? Perhaps not valid.

""ELVER""? E L V E R? L and V available? ELVER is a word (young eel). Positions:1:E,2:L,3:V,4:E,5:R.

This has distinct letters except for E? But E is repeated? But we are testing E at position 1? And position 4 is fixed E? So position 2 and 3 are L and V? New letters.

So ""ELVER"" might be a good choice.

Similarly, ""EMMEW""? Not common.

So I think ""ELVER"" is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback from beret: we have E at position 2 was misplaced? So there is another E? But in ELVER, we are putting E at position 1? So we can test.

Alternatively, we could test E at position 2? With a word like ? E ? E R

For example, ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But then we have E at position 2? And position 4? So if we guess LEVER, we test E at position 2? If green, then E is at 2? If yellow, then E not at 2? But since there is another E, it must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, we test L and V.

But LEVER has E at position 2 and 4? So if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 would be green? Etc.

But we don't know which position the second E is in.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests E at a specific position and uses new letters.

Since we have three positions to test (1,2,3) for E, and two of them will be other letters, we can choose one.

I think testing E at position 1 is as good as any.

So let's go with ""ELVER"".

But ""ELVER"" has E at 1, L at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

We know position 4 and 5 are fixed? So we expect E at 4 green, R at 5 green? But we don't know R at 5 is fixed? We deduced it must be? But we haven't confirmed? In the feedback, we will see.

Actually, from deduction, R must be at 5? But we need to confirm? Because if we are wrong, it might be elsewhere? But we have eliminated positions 1,2,3 for R? And position 4 is E? So only position 5 left? So it must be there.

Similarly, E at 4 is fixed.

So in ""ELVER"", position 4 and 5 should be green? And position 1: E? If green, then E is at 1? If yellow, then E is not at 1? But since there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3.

Also, position 2: L? Test if L is in the word? Position 3: V? Test if V is in the word.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""ELVER"" for guess 4.

But let's make sure: is ""ELVER"" a valid word? Yes, it means a young eel.

So guess: ELVER

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.

If we get lucky, we might solve.

Otherwise, we get more information.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior information, so we need an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- Ideally have letters that are not repeated so we can test more letters.

Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains five distinct letters.
- The letters are among the most common in English: C, R, A, N, E.

So, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

However, note that the rules require a 5-letter English word and we have 6 tries. Since it's the first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This maximizes the potential for getting informative feedback across multiple positions, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses. The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E
  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got '-', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)
  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got '-')

Also, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

Now, for our second guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) 
- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.

We also note the positions:
- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: 
  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don't know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

We should also consider common words containing R and E.

Additionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.

Possible words: let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Example: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it's better to use all unique letters.

But note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.

Let me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven't been tested.

In ""crane"", position 1: we know it's not C, but we don't know what it is. Similarly for other positions.

We tested:
- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.

But note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.

Let me try to list possible positions for R and E:

- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).

But note: the word has 5 positions.

Now, for our second guess, we want to cover:
- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).
- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).
- Also, test for other common letters.

Since we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.

So, for example, let's consider words that:
- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.
- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Common starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?

I think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let's check:
- R in position 1 (which wasn't tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)
- O, U, T, E: and we don't know about O,U,T.

But we must see if it fits.

Alternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.

So we cannot use words containing A, C, N.

Therefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.

Similarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it's valid.

But we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won't give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.

So putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn't at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.

So ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that's new. Or at 3,4,5.

But we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven't tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.

Therefore, for R: let's put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it's not at position 1? Or wait, if it's misplaced, we get '-' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get '-', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the '-' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.

Similarly, for E: let's put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.

So let's try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn't common? Also, it has 'S' and 'T', which haven't been tested.

But note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.

ROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.

In this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).

Also, O,L,S are new letters.

Similarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.

Another: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn't stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it's not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it's better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?

Yes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.

Therefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That's the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be '-', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don't know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.

So if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.

So better avoid ""tried"".

How about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.

Another word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don't know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don't know about 3 and 4? But we can't put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?

But STREP isn't common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven't tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.

Also, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.

But note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.

""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.

Another: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.

I think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.

Now, with ""RIDES"":
- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is '✓', then R is at 1? Or if '-'? Then R is not at 1? Or 'x'? But that can't happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get 'x' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either '✓' or '-'. Similarly for E at position 4: either '✓' or '-'.

Also, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.

For example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? 
- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? 
Wait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E's position? So it's a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? 

But in ""STORES"", it's 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That's 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be '-'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? 

Also, S,T,O? We don't know.

But compare ""RIDES"": 
- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? 
- R at position 1? Also new? We don't know status? 

So ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven't tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? 

Whereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? 

So I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? 

Another word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? 

Or ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.

Therefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".

But let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.

So guess: ""RIDES""

But note: position in ""RIDES"":
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: D
- 4: E
- 5: S

We expect:
- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?
- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?
- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.

This should give us good information.

So my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:
- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N
- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Positions tested in the first guess**:
  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).
  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).
  - Position 4: N is absent.
  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).

For the second guess, the goal is to:
1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.
2. Avoid using C, A, or N.
3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.

The word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).
- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).
- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).
- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.

This approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.

<guess>rides</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":
- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it's not at position 1.
- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.
- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it's correct!
- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.

Additionally, from first guess feedback:
- C, A, N: x → not in word.
- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).
- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.

Summary of what we know:
- E is in position 4: ✓.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).
  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.

So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Letters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven't identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.

Therefore, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include R? Because we haven't fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it's not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.

Also, we need to guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Because it's fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don't? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it's correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.

So any guess must have E at position 4.

Also, the word must contain R? But we don't know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it's correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? 

But note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let's list the positions:

Positions:
- Position 4: E (fixed)

Now, R must be at 3 or 5? So:
- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? 

But we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? 

But since we are testing? We can create a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Always.
- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? 

Moreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? 

So available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.

But note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that's four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.

Since E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?

For example: 
- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can't use D.

Similarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.

Common words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: R? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: T? 

But we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven't ruled out multiple E? So it's possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it's in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? 

Also? We must see? But let's consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? 

Another word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? 

I'm considering putting R at 3? Then let's think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It's _ _ R E? 

Actually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? 

Another? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? 

""CHORE""? C is absent? No? 

""PLUMBER""? Too long? 

""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that's good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn't have R? 

So we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? 
- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? 

Valid words: 
- ""OGRED""? But D absent? 
- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? 

Now, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? 
- 1: B? 
- 2: E? 
- 3: R? 
- 4: E? 
- 5: T? 

But we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That's good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don't know about other E? 

But in terms of information? We test:
- Position 1: B? If it's present? 
- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don't assume anything? 
- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? 

Therefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? 

Alternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? 

""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? 

""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? 

But with feedback? We want to get information? 

However? ""purER"" might be valid? But let's see? 

Another: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. 

""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? 

So? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? 

But note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? 

But our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? 

Alternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? 

Words: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? 

""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? 

And letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? 

Then? We test R at position 5? 

Similarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? 

But by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? 

So ""TOTER"": 
- Position 1: T? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: T? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: R? 

Then? We test:
- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if '-'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? 
- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? 

But if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don't care? 

But? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? 

However? We can do? 

But preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? 

But? Back to feedback? 

Since R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? 

But let's choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? 

Another word: ""BOULE""? But no R? 

Perhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? 

So? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? 

Consideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? 

But which one is better? 

Perhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": 
- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? 
- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? 
- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? 

Actually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be '-' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be '-' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that's impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give 'x'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be 'x'. 

Similarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. 

So? With ""BERET""?
- Position 1: B - will show if B present? 
- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if '-': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if 'x': E not present at 2? And no additional E? 
- Position 3: R - we care about R position?
- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? 
- Position 5: T

But? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? 

But? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? 

Similarly? For position 5? T? 

Now? Back to? TOTER? 

But? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? 

To avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? 

For example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? 

Words? Like ""CURE""? But too short? 

5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? 

""RARED""? Has A? Absent? 

""TIRED""? But I and D absent? 

""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? 

""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? 

But we want R at 3? 

""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? 

""HERPS""? Not common? 

""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? 

So? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? 

For example? ""TRECK"" not word? 

""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? 

""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? 

With available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? 

So possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" 

Other words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? 

""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? 

""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? 

Words like ""CREEK""? C absent? 

Perhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? 

Also, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be 'x'? Or if duplicate? 

But it's messy? 

Since valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let's accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? 

Therefore? I choose ""BERET""

So? Third guess: ""BERET""

Perhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? 

""KEREL""? Obscure? 

So? BERET is standard? 

Thus: guess ""BERET""

<guess>beret</guess>### Reasoning for Guess 3:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C, A, N are absent (x).  
  - R is present but misplaced (-).  
  - E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  
  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  
  - I, D, S are absent (x).  
  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.

**Key deductions**:  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - R and E must be in the word.  
  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  
- **Position constraints for R**:  
  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  
  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  
  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn't in) must hold a new letter.

**Strategy for Guess 3**:  
- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  
- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  
- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  
- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  
- The word **""BERET""** fits:  
  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  
  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  
  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  
  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.

**Expected outcomes**:  
- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  
- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  
- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.

<guess>beret</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the third guess ""beret"":
- B: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 2
- R: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 3
- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4, as expected
- T: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (from all feedback: crane, rides, beret)
- From guess 1: C, A, N absent
- From guess 2: I, D, S absent
- From guess 3: B, T absent

**Present Letters**:
- E: confirmed at position 4 (✓ in beret)
- R: present but not at position 1, 2, or 3 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3 respectively)

Also, from the feedback of beret:
- The E at position 2 is misplaced (-). This means there is another E in the word? But wait, we already have E at position 4. So if E at position 2 is misplaced, it implies that the secret word has at least two E's? Or is that necessarily true?

Let me think: 
- We know E is at position 4 (fixed).
- We guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.
- Since we already have E at position 4, the '-' for position 2 must mean that there is an additional E in the word? Because if there were only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 would be an incorrect position for the only E, so it should be marked as 'x' (absent) for that position? But it was marked as '-', which means it is present but misplaced. Therefore, there must be at least two E's in the word.

So, the secret word has at least two E's: one at position 4, and at least one more elsewhere.

Also, R is present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the word has 5 positions, R must be at position 5? Because position 4 is E.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → so must be at 5? But we have 5 positions, so R must be at position 5? 

But let's confirm: 
- From guess 1: R was at position 2 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 2: R was at position 1 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 3: R was at position 3 → misplaced (-)
- Therefore, R is not at 1,2,3. And position 4 is E, so R must be at position 5.

So R is at position 5.

Now, we have:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

And we know there is at least one more E (since E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning another E exists). The only positions left are 1,2,3. So one of positions 1,2,3 must be E? But we have three positions and we know one of them is E (the second E).

Also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. So we cannot use these.

Now, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ E R

And we know one of the first three positions is E (the second E). Also, the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: We have to avoid C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. Also, we have E and R already, but E can be repeated.

The alphabet: A to Z, minus absent: 
Absent: A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T → so available: E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we know the word must have at least two E's, so one E is at position 4, and another E at one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word is of the form: X Y Z E R, where one of X,Y,Z is E, and the other two are from the available letters.

Now, for our next guess, we need to test possibilities for positions 1,2,3.

We know one of them is E, but we don't know which one. Also, the other two are unknown.

We should try to guess a word that has E in one of the positions 1,2,3 and uses common letters for the others to test.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are at guess 4 of 6.

Possible strategies:

1. Test E at position 1: then the word would be E ? ? E R. But we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.

2. Or test E at position 2: ? E ? E R

3. Or test E at position 3: ? ? E E R

We can choose one of these and use common letters for the unknowns.

But we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Moreover, we can get information about the other positions.

Let me list possible words:

First, if E is at position 1: E _ _ E R

Possible words: EATER? But A and T are absent? A absent, T absent (from beret, T is absent). So not.

EAGER? A absent.

EASER? A and S absent.

No, because A and T are out.

Similarly, words like EGGER? G,G? E G G E R? That's a word (one who gathers eggs). Letters: E,G,G,E,R. Avoid absent? G is not absent? And E,R are in. Absent are A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T. So G is available.

Similarly, EGGER: positions:1:E,2:G,3:G,4:E,5:R.

But we have two G's? That's fine.

Similarly, other words: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHOS? But C and S absent.

So EGGER is a possibility.

But we don't know if E is at position 1.

Similarly, if E is at position 2: _ E _ E R

Words: ? E ? E R

Like: LEVER? L E V E R? But V? Available? Yes. L not absent.

LEVER: positions:1:L,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R.

Similarly, FEWER? F E W E R? F and W available.

Or HEXER? H E X E R? H and X available.

But we need to choose.

If E is at position 3: _ _ E E R

Words: ? ? E E R

Like: UPPER? U P P E R? U and P available.

But UPPER: positions:1:U,2:P,3:P,4:E,5:R? But position 3 is P, not E? We need position 3 to be E.

Pattern: position 3 must be E? So _ _ E E R.

Examples: AGREE? But A and G? A absent.

BLEED? B and D absent.

FLEER? F L E E R? F and L available? FLEER is a word? Meaning to mock or jeer.

Similarly, GLEEK? Not E E R.

So FLEER: F L E E R? Positions:1:F,2:L,3:E,4:E,5:R.

Yes.

Now, back to the feedback: we need to design a guess that can distinguish the position of the second E.

Since we have three possibilities (E at 1, E at 2, or E at 3), we can choose a word that tests one of these.

But we also want to test common letters for the other positions.

Moreover, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover as much as possible.

Another idea: since we know the word ends with E R, and has E at 4, R at 5, and one more E in 1-3, we can guess a word that has E at position 1, for example, to see if it's there.

If we guess a word with E at position 1, and it is correct (green), then we know E is at 1. If it is misplaced, then E is not at 1, but since we know there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3. Similarly, if we get 'x' for E at 1? But we know there is another E, so it cannot be 'x'? It must be either green or yellow? Because E is present elsewhere.

Similarly for other positions.

So, let's choose to test E at position 1.

Guess a word: E _ _ E R

With available letters.

For example, EGGER: E G G E R

But we have to avoid absent letters, and G is available.

EGGER is a valid word.

If we guess EGGER:
- Position 1: E → if green, then E is at position 1. If yellow, then E is not at 1 (so must be at 2 or 3).
- Position 2: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 2?
- Position 3: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 3? But if G is present, it might show yellow or green? But we have two G's? So if the word has G, it might be complicated.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters if possible.

But in EGGER, we have two G's.

Alternative: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHER? Not.

Another word: EATER? But A and T absent.

Not possible.

Perhaps ""EMMER""? E M M E R? M is available? E M M E R? That's a word (a type of wheat). Positions:1:E,2:M,3:M,4:E,5:R.

Still duplicate M.

""EVERR""? Not a word.

""EXERT""? But X and T? T is absent? From beret, T is absent? So cannot.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""EXPEL""? But P and L? But ends with L, not R? Not.

So, it's hard to find a word with E at 1 and distinct letters? Because the pattern E _ _ E R requires the middle two letters to form a word.

Another: ""EGRET""? E G R E T? But R is at position 3? And T is absent? Also, we have R at position 3, but we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have R at position 3? Because R is only at position 5? So the word must not have R except at position 5? But in EGRET, R is at position 3? So if we guess that, position 3 R would be wrong? But we know R is at 5? So it would be a wasted guess? Better not to use R in other positions.

Therefore, in our guess, we should not use R except at position 5? Because we know R is fixed at 5? Similarly, E at position 4 is fixed? So for positions 1,2,3, we should not use E except if we are testing it? But we are testing E at 1? So for position 1, we use E? For positions 2 and 3, we should use other letters? Not R? Not E? Unless necessary.

In EGGER, position 3 is G? Not R? So that's fine? But duplicate G.

But let's proceed with EGGER? Or find a better word.

Another word: ""EEKER""? E E K E R? But E at position 2? And we are testing E at position 1? But E at position 2 is also E? So positions:1:E,2:E,3:K,4:E,5:R? Then we have three E's? Which might be possible? But K is available.

But ""EEKER"" is not common? Perhaps not valid.

""ELVER""? E L V E R? L and V available? ELVER is a word (young eel). Positions:1:E,2:L,3:V,4:E,5:R.

This has distinct letters except for E? But E is repeated? But we are testing E at position 1? And position 4 is fixed E? So position 2 and 3 are L and V? New letters.

So ""ELVER"" might be a good choice.

Similarly, ""EMMEW""? Not common.

So I think ""ELVER"" is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback from beret: we have E at position 2 was misplaced? So there is another E? But in ELVER, we are putting E at position 1? So we can test.

Alternatively, we could test E at position 2? With a word like ? E ? E R

For example, ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But then we have E at position 2? And position 4? So if we guess LEVER, we test E at position 2? If green, then E is at 2? If yellow, then E not at 2? But since there is another E, it must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, we test L and V.

But LEVER has E at position 2 and 4? So if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 would be green? Etc.

But we don't know which position the second E is in.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests E at a specific position and uses new letters.

Since we have three positions to test (1,2,3) for E, and two of them will be other letters, we can choose one.

I think testing E at position 1 is as good as any.

So let's go with ""ELVER"".

But ""ELVER"" has E at 1, L at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

We know position 4 and 5 are fixed? So we expect E at 4 green, R at 5 green? But we don't know R at 5 is fixed? We deduced it must be? But we haven't confirmed? In the feedback, we will see.

Actually, from deduction, R must be at 5? But we need to confirm? Because if we are wrong, it might be elsewhere? But we have eliminated positions 1,2,3 for R? And position 4 is E? So only position 5 left? So it must be there.

Similarly, E at 4 is fixed.

So in ""ELVER"", position 4 and 5 should be green? And position 1: E? If green, then E is at 1? If yellow, then E is not at 1? But since there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3.

Also, position 2: L? Test if L is in the word? Position 3: V? Test if V is in the word.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""ELVER"" for guess 4.

But let's make sure: is ""ELVER"" a valid word? Yes, it means a young eel.

So guess: ELVER

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.

If we get lucky, we might solve.

Otherwise, we get more information.

So:### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback on all guesses:
- **Absent Letters (x)**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (excluded from future guesses).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: Confirmed at position 4 (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).
  - **R**: Present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 (misplaced in all guesses). Since position 4 is E, R must be at position 5.
- **Key Insight from Guess 3 (beret)**:
  - The E at position 2 was misplaced (-), meaning there is **at least one additional E** in the word (besides position 4). Thus, the secret word has two E's: one fixed at position 4, and another at position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Word Structure**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ _ E R`, with one of the first three positions being the second E, and the other two positions filled with letters not in the absent list.

**Deductions**:
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, B, C, D, I, N, S, T are absent).
- **Positions 1, 2, and 3**:
  - One must be E (the second E).
  - The other two must be from the available letters.
- **Goal for Guess 4**: Test the position of the second E (position 1, 2, or 3) while probing new common letters for the remaining positions.

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Test E at position 1**: This helps resolve the location of the second E. If E is correct (✓) at position 1, we confirm the second E is there. If misplaced (-), the second E must be at position 2 or 3.
- **Use new common letters**: For positions 2 and 3, choose high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, V) to maximize information if they are present/absent.
- **Avoid redundant positions**: Position 4 (E) and position 5 (R) are fixed, so the guess must include E at 4 and R at 5.
- **Chosen word: ""ELVER""** (a valid English word meaning a young eel):
  - **E** at position 1: Tests if the second E is here.
  - **L** at position 2: Probes a common consonant.
  - **V** at position 3: Probes a less common letter to cover more ground.
  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (expected ✓).
  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (expected ✓).

**Expected Outcomes**:
- If E at position 1 is ✓, the secret word is `E _ _ E R`, and we focus on positions 2–3 next.
- If E at position 1 is -, the second E must be at position 2 or 3, and we use the feedback on L and V to narrow options.
- Feedback on L and V will reveal if they are present, guiding the next guess.

Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it\'s better to use all unique letters.\n\nBut note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.\n\nLet me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven\'t been tested.\n\nIn ""crane"", position 1: we know it\'s not C, but we don\'t know what it is. Similarly for other positions.\n\nWe tested:\n- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.\n\nBut note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.\n\nLet me try to list possible positions for R and E:\n\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).\n- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we want to cover:\n- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).\n- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).\n- Also, test for other common letters.\n\nSince we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.\n\nSo, for example, let\'s consider words that:\n- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.\n- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, C, N.\n\nCommon starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?\n\nI think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let\'s check:\n- R in position 1 (which wasn\'t tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)\n- O, U, T, E: and we don\'t know about O,U,T.\n\nBut we must see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.\n\nSo we cannot use words containing A, C, N.\n\nTherefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.\n\nSimilarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked \'-\' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won\'t give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.\n\nSo putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn\'t at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven\'t tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.\n\nSo ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that\'s new. Or at 3,4,5.\n\nBut we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven\'t tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.\n\nTherefore, for R: let\'s put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it\'s not at position 1? Or wait, if it\'s misplaced, we get \'-\' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get \'-\', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the \'-\' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.\n\nSimilarly, for E: let\'s put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.\n\nSo let\'s try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn\'t common? Also, it has \'S\' and \'T\', which haven\'t been tested.\n\nBut note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.\n\nROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.\n\nIn this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).\n\nAlso, O,L,S are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn\'t stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it\'s not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it\'s better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?\n\nYes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.\n\nTherefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That\'s the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be \'-\', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don\'t know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.\n\nSo better avoid ""tried"".\n\nHow about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don\'t know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don\'t know about 3 and 4? But we can\'t put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?\n\nBut STREP isn\'t common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.\n\nAlso, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.\n\nBut note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.\n\n""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.\n\nAnother: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.\n\nI think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.\n\nNow, with ""RIDES"":\n- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is \'✓\', then R is at 1? Or if \'-\'? Then R is not at 1? Or \'x\'? But that can\'t happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get \'x\' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either \'✓\' or \'-\'. Similarly for E at position 4: either \'✓\' or \'-\'.\n\nAlso, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.\n\nFor example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? \n- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? \nWait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E\'s position? So it\'s a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? \n\nBut in ""STORES"", it\'s 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That\'s 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be \'-\'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? \n\nAlso, S,T,O? We don\'t know.\n\nBut compare ""RIDES"": \n- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? \n- R at position 1? Also new? We don\'t know status? \n\nSo ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven\'t tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? \n\nWhereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? \n\nSo I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? \n\nAnother word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? \n\nOr ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.\n\nTherefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".\n\nBut let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""RIDES""\n\nBut note: position in ""RIDES"":\n- 1: R\n- 2: I\n- 3: D\n- 4: E\n- 5: S\n\nWe expect:\n- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?\n- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?\n- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:\n- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N\n- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- **Positions tested in the first guess**:\n  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).\n  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).\n  - Position 4: N is absent.\n  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n\nFor the second guess, the goal is to:\n1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.\n2. Avoid using C, A, or N.\n3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:\n- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).\n- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).\n- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).\n- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>rides</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it\'s not at position 1.\n- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.\n- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it\'s correct!\n- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from first guess feedback:\n- C, A, N: x → not in word.\n- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).\n- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.\n\nSummary of what we know:\n- E is in position 4: ✓.\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:\n  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).\n  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.\n\nSo absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.\n\nLetters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven\'t identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.\n\nTherefore, for the third guess, we need to:\n- Include R? Because we haven\'t fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it\'s not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.\n\nAlso, we need to guess a word that:\n- Has E at position 4? Because it\'s fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don\'t? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it\'s correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.\n\nSo any guess must have E at position 4.\n\nAlso, the word must contain R? But we don\'t know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it\'s correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? \n\nBut note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let\'s list the positions:\n\nPositions:\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n\nNow, R must be at 3 or 5? So:\n- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? \n\nBut we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? \n\nBut since we are testing? We can create a word that:\n- Has E at position 4? Always.\n- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? \n\nMoreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? \n\nSo available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nBut note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that\'s four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.\n\nSince E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.\n\nNow, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?\n\nFor example: \n- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can\'t use D.\n\nSimilarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.\n\nCommon words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": \n- Position 1: B? \n- Position 2: E? \n- Position 3: R? \n- Position 4: E? \n- Position 5: T? \n\nBut we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven\'t ruled out multiple E? So it\'s possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it\'s in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? \n\nAlso? We must see? But let\'s consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? \n\nAnother word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? \n\nI\'m considering putting R at 3? Then let\'s think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It\'s _ _ R E? \n\nActually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? \n\nAnother? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? \n\n""CHORE""? C is absent? No? \n\n""PLUMBER""? Too long? \n\n""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that\'s good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn\'t have R? \n\nSo we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? \n\nExamples: \n- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? \n- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? \n\nValid words: \n- ""OGRED""? But D absent? \n- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? \n\nNow, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? \n- 1: B? \n- 2: E? \n- 3: R? \n- 4: E? \n- 5: T? \n\nBut we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That\'s good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don\'t know about other E? \n\nBut in terms of information? We test:\n- Position 1: B? If it\'s present? \n- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don\'t assume anything? \n- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? \n\nTherefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? \n\nAlternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? \n\n""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? \n\n""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? \n\nBut with feedback? We want to get information? \n\nHowever? ""purER"" might be valid? But let\'s see? \n\nAnother: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. \n\n""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? \n\nSo? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? \n\nBut note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? \n\nBut our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? \n\nAlternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? \n\nWords: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? \n\n""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? \n\nAnd letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? \n\nThen? We test R at position 5? \n\nSimilarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? \n\nBut by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? \n\nSo ""TOTER"": \n- Position 1: T? \n- Position 2: O? \n- Position 3: T? \n- Position 4: E? \n- Position 5: R? \n\nThen? We test:\n- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if \'-\'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? \n- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? \n\nBut if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don\'t care? \n\nBut? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? \n\nHowever? We can do? \n\nBut preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? \n\nBut? Back to feedback? \n\nSince R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? \n\nBut let\'s choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? \n\nAnother word: ""BOULE""? But no R? \n\nPerhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? \n\nSo? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? \n\nConsideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nPerhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": \n- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? \n- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? \n- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? \n\nActually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be \'-\' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be \'-\' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that\'s impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give \'x\'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be \'x\'. \n\nSimilarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. \n\nSo? With ""BERET""?\n- Position 1: B - will show if B present? \n- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if \'-\': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if \'x\': E not present at 2? And no additional E? \n- Position 3: R - we care about R position?\n- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? \n- Position 5: T\n\nBut? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? \n\nBut? Position 2: if E?

For position 5? T? \n\nNow? Back to? TOTER? \n\nBut? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? \n\nTo avoid the E duality?

And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? \n\nSo? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? \n\nFor example? ""TRECK"" not word? \n\n""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? \n\n""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1?

Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? \n\nAlso, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be \'x\'? Or if duplicate? \n\nBut it\'s messy? \n\nSince valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let\'s accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? \n\nTherefore? I choose ""BERET""\n\nSo? Third guess: ""BERET""\n\nPerhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? \n\n""KEREL""? Obscure? \n\nSo?

This means there is another E in the word? But wait, we already have E at position 4. So if E at position 2 is misplaced, it implies that the secret word has at least two E\'s? Or is that necessarily true?\n\nLet me think: \n- We know E is at position 4 (fixed).\n- We guessed E at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.\n- Since we already have E at position 4, the \'-\' for position 2 must mean that there is an additional E in the word? Because if there were only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 would be an incorrect position for the only E, so it should be marked as \'x\' (absent) for that position? But it was marked as \'-\', which means it is present but misplaced. Therefore, there must be at least two E\'s in the word.\n\nSo, the secret word has at least two E\'s: one at position 4, and at least one more elsewhere.\n\nAlso, R is present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the word has 5 positions, R must be at position 5? Because position 4 is E.\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,4,5\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → so must be at 5? But we have 5 positions, so R must be at position 5? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- From guess 1: R was at position 2 → misplaced (-)\n- From guess 2: R was at position 1 → misplaced (-)\n- From guess 3: R was at position 3 → misplaced (-)\n- Therefore, R is not at 1,2,3. And position 4 is E, so R must be at position 5.\n\nSo R is at position 5.\n\nNow, we have:\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n\nAnd we know there is at least one more E (since E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning another E exists). The only positions left are 1,2,3. So one of positions 1,2,3 must be E? But we have three positions and we know one of them is E (the second E).\n\nAlso, we have absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. So we cannot use these.\n\nNow, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ E R\n\nAnd we know one of the first three positions is E (the second E). Also, the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\nAvailable letters: We have to avoid C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. Also, we have E and R already, but E can be repeated.\n\nThe alphabet: A to Z, minus absent: \nAbsent: A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T → so available: E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut we know the word must have at least two E\'s, so one E is at position 4, and another E at one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nSo the word is of the form: X Y Z E R, where one of X,Y,Z is E, and the other two are from the available letters.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we need to test possibilities for positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe know one of them is E, but we don\'t know which one. Also, the other two are unknown.\n\nWe should try to guess a word that has E in one of the positions 1,2,3 and uses common letters for the others to test.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are at guess 4 of 6.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. Test E at position 1: then the word would be E ? ? E R. But we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.\n\n2. Or test E at position 2: ? E ? E R\n\n3. Or test E at position 3: ? ? E E R\n\nWe can choose one of these and use common letters for the unknowns.\n\nBut we also need to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nMoreover, we can get information about the other positions.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nFirst, if E is at position 1: E _ _ E R\n\nPossible words: EATER? But A and T are absent? A absent, T absent (from beret, T is absent). So not.\n\nEAGER? A absent.\n\nEASER? A and S absent.\n\nNo, because A and T are out.\n\nSimilarly, words like EGGER? G,G? E G G E R? That\'s a word (one who gathers eggs). Letters: E,G,G,E,R. Avoid absent? G is not absent? And E,R are in. Absent are A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T. So G is available.\n\nSimilarly, EGGER: positions:1:E,2:G,3:G,4:E,5:R.\n\nBut we have two G\'s? That\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, other words: EPHER? Not common.\n\nOr ECHOS? But C and S absent.\n\nSo EGGER is a possibility.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if E is at position 2: _ E _ E R\n\nWords: ? E ? E R\n\nLike: LEVER? L E V E R? But V? Available? Yes. L not absent.\n\nLEVER: positions:1:L,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R.\n\nSimilarly, FEWER? F E W E R? F and W available.\n\nOr HEXER? H E X E R? H and X available.\n\nBut we need to choose.\n\nIf E is at position 3: _ _ E E R\n\nWords: ? ? E E R\n\nLike: UPPER? U P P E R? U and P available.\n\nBut UPPER: positions:1:U,2:P,3:P,4:E,5:R? But position 3 is P, not E? We need position 3 to be E.\n\nPattern: position 3 must be E? So _ _ E E R.\n\nExamples: AGREE? But A and G? A absent.\n\nBLEED? B and D absent.\n\nFLEER? F L E E R? F and L available? FLEER is a word? Meaning to mock or jeer.\n\nSimilarly, GLEEK? Not E E R.\n\nSo FLEER: F L E E R? Positions:1:F,2:L,3:E,4:E,5:R.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to the feedback: we need to design a guess that can distinguish the position of the second E.\n\nSince we have three possibilities (E at 1, E at 2, or E at 3), we can choose a word that tests one of these.\n\nBut we also want to test common letters for the other positions.\n\nMoreover, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover as much as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know the word ends with E R, and has E at 4, R at 5, and one more E in 1-3, we can guess a word that has E at position 1, for example, to see if it\'s there.\n\nIf we guess a word with E at position 1, and it is correct (green), then we know E is at 1. If it is misplaced, then E is not at 1, but since we know there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3. Similarly, if we get \'x\' for E at 1? But we know there is another E, so it cannot be \'x\'? It must be either green or yellow? Because E is present elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nSo, let\'s choose to test E at position 1.\n\nGuess a word: E _ _ E R\n\nWith available letters.\n\nFor example, EGGER: E G G E R\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters, and G is available.\n\nEGGER is a valid word.\n\nIf we guess EGGER:\n- Position 1: E → if green, then E is at position 1. If yellow, then E is not at 1 (so must be at 2 or 3).\n- Position 2: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 2?\n- Position 3: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 3? But if G is present, it might show yellow or green? But we have two G\'s? So if the word has G, it might be complicated.\n\nTo avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters if possible.\n\nBut in EGGER, we have two G\'s.\n\nAlternative: EPHER? Not common.\n\nOr ECHER? Not.\n\nAnother word: EATER? But A and T absent.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps ""EMMER""? E M M E R? M is available? E M M E R? That\'s a word (a type of wheat). Positions:1:E,2:M,3:M,4:E,5:R.\n\nStill duplicate M.\n\n""EVERR""? Not a word.\n\n""EXERT""? But X and T? T is absent? From beret, T is absent? So cannot.\n\nT is absent, so we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, ""EXPEL""? But P and L? But ends with L, not R? Not.\n\nSo, it\'s hard to find a word with E at 1 and distinct letters? Because the pattern E _ _ E R requires the middle two letters to form a word.\n\nAnother: ""EGRET""? E G R E T? But R is at position 3? And T is absent? Also, we have R at position 3, but we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have R at position 3? Because R is only at position 5? So the word must not have R except at position 5? But in EGRET, R is at position 3? So if we guess that, position 3 R would be wrong? But we know R is at 5? So it would be a wasted guess? Better not to use R in other positions.\n\nTherefore, in our guess, we should not use R except at position 5? Because we know R is fixed at 5? Similarly, E at position 4 is fixed? So for positions 1,2,3, we should not use E except if we are testing it? But we are testing E at 1? So for position 1, we use E? For positions 2 and 3, we should use other letters? Not R? Not E? Unless necessary.\n\nIn EGGER, position 3 is G? Not R? So that\'s fine? But duplicate G.\n\nBut let\'s proceed with EGGER? Or find a better word.\n\nAnother word: ""EEKER""? E E K E R? But E at position 2? And we are testing E at position 1? But E at position 2 is also E? So positions:1:E,2:E,3:K,4:E,5:R? Then we have three E\'s? Which might be possible? But K is available.\n\nBut ""EEKER"" is not common? Perhaps not valid.\n\n""ELVER""? E L V E R? L and V available? ELVER is a word (young eel). Positions:1:E,2:L,3:V,4:E,5:R.\n\nThis has distinct letters except for E? But E is repeated? But we are testing E at position 1? And position 4 is fixed E? So position 2 and 3 are L and V? New letters.\n\nSo ""ELVER"" might be a good choice.\n\nSimilarly, ""EMMEW""? Not common.\n\nSo I think ""ELVER"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from beret: we have E at position 2 was misplaced? So there is another E? But in ELVER, we are putting E at position 1? So we can test.\n\nAlternatively, we could test E at position 2? With a word like ? E ? E R\n\nFor example, ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But then we have E at position 2? And position 4? So if we guess LEVER, we test E at position 2? If green, then E is at 2? If yellow, then E not at 2? But since there is another E, it must be at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, we test L and V.\n\nBut LEVER has E at position 2 and 4? So if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 would be green? Etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know which position the second E is in.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word that tests E at a specific position and uses new letters.\n\nSince we have three positions to test (1,2,3) for E, and two of them will be other letters, we can choose one.\n\nI think testing E at position 1 is as good as any.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ELVER"".\n\nBut ""ELVER"" has E at 1, L at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nWe know position 4 and 5 are fixed? So we expect E at 4 green, R at 5 green? But we don\'t know R at 5 is fixed? We deduced it must be? But we haven\'t confirmed? In the feedback, we will see.\n\nActually, from deduction, R must be at 5? But we need to confirm? Because if we are wrong, it might be elsewhere? But we have eliminated positions 1,2,3 for R? And position 4 is E? So only position 5 left? So it must be there.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4 is fixed.\n\nSo in ""ELVER"", position 4 and 5 should be green? And position 1: E? If green, then E is at 1? If yellow, then E is not at 1? But since there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, position 2: L? Test if L is in the word? Position 3: V? Test if V is in the word.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ELVER"" for guess 4.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: is ""ELVER"" a valid word? Yes, it means a young eel.\n\nSo guess: ELVER\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.\n\nIf we get lucky, we might solve.\n\nOtherwise, we get more information.\n\nSo:### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback on all guesses:\n- **Absent Letters (x)**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (excluded from future guesses).\n- **Present Letters**:\n  - **E**: Confirmed at position 4 (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).\n  - **R**: Present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 (misplaced in all guesses). Since position 4 is E, R must be at position 5.\n- **Key Insight from Guess 3 (beret)**:\n  - The E at position 2 was misplaced (-), meaning there is **at least one additional E** in the word (besides position 4). Thus, the secret word has two E\'s: one fixed at position 4, and another at position 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Word Structure**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ _ E R`, with one of the first three positions being the second E, and the other two positions filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\n**Deductions**:\n- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, B, C, D, I, N, S, T are absent).\n- **Positions 1, 2, and 3**:\n  - One must be E (the second E).\n  - The other two must be from the available letters.\n- **Goal for Guess 4**: Test the position of the second E (position 1, 2, or 3) while probing new common letters for the remaining positions.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4\n- **Test E at position 1**: This helps resolve the location of the second E. If E is correct (✓) at position 1, we confirm the second E is there. If misplaced (-), the second E must be at position 2 or 3.\n- **Use new common letters**: For positions 2 and 3, choose high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, V) to maximize information if they are present/absent.\n- **Avoid redundant positions**: Position 4 (E) and position 5 (R) are fixed, so the guess must include E at 4 and R at 5.\n- **Chosen word: ""ELVER""** (a valid English word meaning a young eel):\n  - **E** at position 1: Tests if the second E is here.\n  - **L** at position 2: Probes a common consonant.\n  - **V** at position 3: Probes a less common letter to cover more ground.\n  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (expected ✓).\n  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (expected ✓).\n\n**Expected Outcomes**:\n- If E at position 1 is ✓, the secret word is `E _ _ E R`, and we focus on positions 2–3 next.\n- If E at position 1 is -, the second E must be at position 2 or 3, and we use the feedback on L and V to narrow options.\n- Feedback on L and V will reveal if they are present, guiding the next guess.\n\n<guess>elver</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 4: elver -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""elver"" -> E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Let's interpret:
- E at position 1: '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 1. Since we know there is a second E (from previous feedback), this confirms that the second E is not at position 1. Therefore, the second E must be at position 2 or 3.
- L at position 2: 'x' meaning L is not in the word at all. So L is absent.
- V at position 3: 'x' meaning V is not in the word at all. So V is absent.
- E at position 4: '✓' as expected, correct.
- R at position 5: '✓' as expected, correct.

Now, update our knowledge:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T, L, V (add L and V to the list)

**Present Letters**:
- E: at position 4 and one more at either position 2 or 3.
- R: at position 5.

**Word Pattern**: _ _ _ E R, with the third character being either position 2 or 3 must be E (since not at 1, and one of 2 or 3 must be E).

Specifically, the secret word has:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- One of position 2 or 3 is E (the second E).
- The remaining two positions (the other of 2 or 3, and position 1) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters (not absent): F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and E, R are already placed, but E can be used again? No, we have exactly two E's? We know there are at least two, but could there be more? The feedback doesn't indicate more, but we don't know for sure. However, since we have only two positions left to fill (one of which is E), and the other is a new letter, it's likely only two E's. But we must consider the possibility of a third E? However, in the pattern, we have positions 1,2,3: one is E, and the other two are non-E. So only two E's in total.

So, the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R, where either letter2 is E and letter3 is something else, or letter3 is E and letter2 is something else. And letter1 is a non-E.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test whether E is at position 2 or 3, and also test possible letters for the other positions.

We have two cases:

Case 1: E at position 2 -> pattern: _ E ? E R
Case 2: E at position 3 -> pattern: _ ? E E R

We can design a guess that helps distinguish these and tests common letters.

But note: we have only two guesses left (guess 5 and 6). We need to be efficient.

Idea: Guess a word that has E at position 2 and a different letter at position 3, and a common letter at position 1. Then, if E is at position 2, we get green for position 2. If not, then E must be at position 3, and we get yellow for E at position 2? But if we put E at position 2 and the actual word has E at position 3, then the E at position 2 would be marked as absent? Or as misplaced? 

Wait: if the actual word has E only at positions 3 and 4, and we guess E at position 2, then since position 2 is not E, and there is no E at position 2 in the secret, but there is an E at position 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be marked as '-' (misplaced) because there is an E in the word but not at that position? But that would be confusing because we are trying to see if E is at 2 or 3.

Actually, the feedback for E at position 2 would be:
- If the secret has E at position 2: then green.
- If the secret has E at position 3 but not at 2: then the E at position 2 would be marked as '-' (yellow) because there is an E in the word (at position 3) but not at 2.

But in both cases, we get a yellow or green for E at position 2? We don't get an 'x'. So it doesn't directly tell us if E is at 2 or 3? 

If we get green at position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get yellow at position 2, then E is not at 2, so it must be at 3? Because we know one of 2 or 3 is E.

Similarly, if we put E at position 3, we can get similar feedback.

But we can choose to test E at position 2.

So, for guess 5, let's try a word with E at position 2 and a common letter at position 1 and 3.

For example, ""HEWER"": H E W E R? But we have E at position 2 and 4? And R at 5? But position 3 is W.

Pattern: H E W E R

But we are testing E at position 2? And we have E at position 4? So if we guess ""HEWER"", then:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: E (test for E at 2)
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E (green)
- Position 5: R (green)

Now, if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 E is green. If not, then position 2 E is yellow (because there is E at 3 or 4? But position 4 is already green, so if there is no E at 2, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow only if there is another E? But we know there is one at 4 and one at either 2 or 3. So if E is at 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow (because of the E at 3). If E is at 2, then green.

So by the feedback for position 2, we can tell:
- If green: E is at position 2.
- If yellow: E is not at position 2, so must be at position 3.

Additionally, we test H at position 1 and W at position 3.

But ""HEWER"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 4? So it's acceptable.

But note: we must avoid absent letters. H and W are not in the absent list? Absent: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T,L,V. So H and W are available.

""HEWER"" is a word (one who hews wood, etc.).

So we can use ""HEWER"".

Alternatively, we could use ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L? But L is absent? No, L is absent, so cannot.

""MEWER""? M E W E R? M is available? Yes. ""MEWER"" is a word? Meaning one who mews (a gull or a cage). But less common.

""PEEWEE""? Too long.

So ""HEWER"" is fine.

But let's see: if we guess ""HEWER"", and if the feedback for position 2 is green, then we know the word is ? E ? E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? Then we can adjust.

If position 2 is yellow, then E is at position 3, so the word is _ ? E E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? But if E is at 3, then position 3 in the secret is E, so W at position 3 in the guess would be wrong? And we get feedback for that.

So it's efficient.

Therefore, I choose ""HEWER"" for guess 5.

But note: we are at guess 5, and we have one more if needed.

So guess: HEWER

### Analysis of Feedback and Current Knowledge

**Feedback Summary**:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  → R and E are present (but misplaced); C, A, N absent.
- **Guess 2 (rides)**: R(-), I(x), D(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  → E confirmed at position 4; R not at position 1; I, D, S absent.
- **Guess 3 (beret)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), E(✓), T(x)  
  → E at position 4 confirmed again; R not at position 3; B, T absent; E at position 2 is misplaced, confirming a **second E** exists in the word.
- **Guess 4 (elver)**: E(-), L(x), V(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  → E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; E at position 1 is misplaced (so second E is not at position 1); L, V absent.

**Deductions**:
- **Absent Letters**: A, B, C, D, I, L, N, S, T, V (10 letters excluded).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: At position 4 (fixed). A second E must be at position 2 or 3 (since not at 1).
  - **R**: At position 5 (fixed).
- **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`:
  - Position 4 = E, position 5 = R (both fixed).
  - One of position 2 or 3 must be the second E.
  - Position 1 and the remaining position (2 or 3) are unknown letters.
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters left).

### Strategy for Guess 5
- **Goal**: Determine if the second E is at position 2 or 3, while testing new common letters for positions 1 and 3 (or 2).
- **Chosen Word: ""HEWER""**:
  - **H** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
  - **E** at position 2: Probes if the second E is here (if ✓, E is at 2; if -, E must be at 3).
  - **W** at position 3: Tests a less common letter to cover more possibilities.
  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (✓ expected).
  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (✓ expected).
- **Why ""HEWER""?**:
  - Efficiently distinguishes the second E's position: 
    - If E at position 2 is ✓, the word is `_ E _ E R`.
    - If E at position 2 is -, the word is `_ _ E E R` (E must be at position 3).
  - Tests H and W, which are high-frequency and not excluded.
  - Avoids absent letters and reuses known information (E at 4, R at 5).

<guess>hewer</guess>",hewer,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""elver"" -> E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Let's interpret:
- E at position 1: '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 1. Since we know there is a second E (from previous feedback), this confirms that the second E is not at position 1. Therefore, the second E must be at position 2 or 3.
- L at position 2: 'x' meaning L is not in the word at all. So L is absent.
- V at position 3: 'x' meaning V is not in the word at all. So V is absent.
- E at position 4: '✓' as expected, correct.
- R at position 5: '✓' as expected, correct.

Now, update our knowledge:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T, L, V (add L and V to the list)

**Present Letters**:
- E: at position 4 and one more at either position 2 or 3.
- R: at position 5.

**Word Pattern**: _ _ _ E R, with the third character being either position 2 or 3 must be E (since not at 1, and one of 2 or 3 must be E).

Specifically, the secret word has:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- One of position 2 or 3 is E (the second E).
- The remaining two positions (the other of 2 or 3, and position 1) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters (not absent): F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and E, R are already placed, but E can be used again? No, we have exactly two E's? We know there are at least two, but could there be more? The feedback doesn't indicate more, but we don't know for sure. However, since we have only two positions left to fill (one of which is E), and the other is a new letter, it's likely only two E's. But we must consider the possibility of a third E? However, in the pattern, we have positions 1,2,3: one is E, and the other two are non-E. So only two E's in total.

So, the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R, where either letter2 is E and letter3 is something else, or letter3 is E and letter2 is something else. And letter1 is a non-E.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test whether E is at position 2 or 3, and also test possible letters for the other positions.

We have two cases:

Case 1: E at position 2 -> pattern: _ E ? E R
Case 2: E at position 3 -> pattern: _ ? E E R

We can design a guess that helps distinguish these and tests common letters.

But note: we have only two guesses left (guess 5 and 6). We need to be efficient.

Idea: Guess a word that has E at position 2 and a different letter at position 3, and a common letter at position 1. Then, if E is at position 2, we get green for position 2. If not, then E must be at position 3, and we get yellow for E at position 2? But if we put E at position 2 and the actual word has E at position 3, then the E at position 2 would be marked as absent? Or as misplaced? 

Wait: if the actual word has E only at positions 3 and 4, and we guess E at position 2, then since position 2 is not E, and there is no E at position 2 in the secret, but there is an E at position 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be marked as '-' (misplaced) because there is an E in the word but not at that position? But that would be confusing because we are trying to see if E is at 2 or 3.

Actually, the feedback for E at position 2 would be:
- If the secret has E at position 2: then green.
- If the secret has E at position 3 but not at 2: then the E at position 2 would be marked as '-' (yellow) because there is an E in the word (at position 3) but not at 2.

But in both cases, we get a yellow or green for E at position 2? We don't get an 'x'. So it doesn't directly tell us if E is at 2 or 3? 

If we get green at position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get yellow at position 2, then E is not at 2, so it must be at 3? Because we know one of 2 or 3 is E.

Similarly, if we put E at position 3, we can get similar feedback.

But we can choose to test E at position 2.

So, for guess 5, let's try a word with E at position 2 and a common letter at position 1 and 3.

For example, ""HEWER"": H E W E R? But we have E at position 2 and 4? And R at 5? But position 3 is W.

Pattern: H E W E R

But we are testing E at position 2? And we have E at position 4? So if we guess ""HEWER"", then:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: E (test for E at 2)
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E (green)
- Position 5: R (green)

Now, if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 E is green. If not, then position 2 E is yellow (because there is E at 3 or 4? But position 4 is already green, so if there is no E at 2, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow only if there is another E? But we know there is one at 4 and one at either 2 or 3. So if E is at 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow (because of the E at 3). If E is at 2, then green.

So by the feedback for position 2, we can tell:
- If green: E is at position 2.
- If yellow: E is not at position 2, so must be at position 3.

Additionally, we test H at position 1 and W at position 3.

But ""HEWER"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 4? So it's acceptable.

But note: we must avoid absent letters. H and W are not in the absent list? Absent: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T,L,V. So H and W are available.

""HEWER"" is a word (one who hews wood, etc.).

So we can use ""HEWER"".

Alternatively, we could use ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L? But L is absent? No, L is absent, so cannot.

""MEWER""? M E W E R? M is available? Yes. ""MEWER"" is a word? Meaning one who mews (a gull or a cage). But less common.

""PEEWEE""? Too long.

So ""HEWER"" is fine.

But let's see: if we guess ""HEWER"", and if the feedback for position 2 is green, then we know the word is ? E ? E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? Then we can adjust.

If position 2 is yellow, then E is at position 3, so the word is _ ? E E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? But if E is at 3, then position 3 in the secret is E, so W at position 3 in the guess would be wrong? And we get feedback for that.

So it's efficient.

Therefore, I choose ""HEWER"" for guess 5.

But note: we are at guess 5, and we have one more if needed.

So guess: HEWER### Analysis of Feedback and Current Knowledge

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,mower,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior information, so we need an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- Ideally have letters that are not repeated so we can test more letters.

Some common starting words in Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains five distinct letters.
- The letters are among the most common in English: C, R, A, N, E.

So, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

However, note that the rules require a 5-letter English word and we have 6 tries. Since it's the first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This maximizes the potential for getting informative feedback across multiple positions, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses. The goal is to identify which letters are present and their positions efficiently.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced: R and E
  - R is in the word, but not in the second position (since the feedback shows R in position 2 got '-', meaning it is present but should be elsewhere)
  - E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (feedback shows E in position 5 got '-')

Also, since R and E are the only letters present, the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We know the word must contain R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

Now, for our second guess, we should try a word that:
- Includes R and E (to get more positional information) 
- Avoids C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Uses other common letters to probe for additional letters in the word.

We also note the positions:
- R was in position 2 and was misplaced -> so R cannot be in position 2 in the word, but must be in one of: 1,3,4,5? Wait, note that feedback: 
  - Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C and also not R? Not necessarily, we don't know what the first letter is. We only know that when R was placed in position 2, it was incorrect. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, E was in position 5 and was misplaced -> so E is not in position 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

We should also consider common words containing R and E.

Additionally, avoid letters that are not in the word (C, A, N). So we can use the alphabet minus C, A, N.

Possible words: let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Example: words like ""RIDER"" but note: we must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but our guess can have duplicates if we suspect, but without information, it's better to use all unique letters.

But note that in this case, since we are missing 3 letters, and we know R and E must be in the word, we can try to find a word that has R and E in new positions.

Let me try to find a word that places R and E in positions where they haven't been tested.

In ""crane"", position 1: we know it's not C, but we don't know what it is. Similarly for other positions.

We tested:
- Position 1: C -> not in word, so any letter except C (and excluding A,N too) is possible? Actually, the first letter could be R or E? Yes.

But note: if we put E in position 1, that would be a good test? Similarly, R could be in position 1.

Let me try to list possible positions for R and E:

- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).

But note: the word has 5 positions.

Now, for our second guess, we want to cover:
- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).
- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).
- Also, test for other common letters.

Since we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.

So, for example, let's consider words that:
- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.
- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Common starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?

I think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let's check:
- R in position 1 (which wasn't tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)
- O, U, T, E: and we don't know about O,U,T.

But we must see if it fits.

Alternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.

So we cannot use words containing A, C, N.

Therefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.

Similarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it's valid.

But we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won't give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.

So putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn't at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.

So ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that's new. Or at 3,4,5.

But we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven't tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.

Therefore, for R: let's put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it's not at position 1? Or wait, if it's misplaced, we get '-' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get '-', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the '-' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.

Similarly, for E: let's put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.

So let's try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn't common? Also, it has 'S' and 'T', which haven't been tested.

But note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.

ROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.

In this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).

Also, O,L,S are new letters.

Similarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.

Another: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn't stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it's not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it's better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?

Yes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.

Therefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That's the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be '-', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don't know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.

So if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.

So better avoid ""tried"".

How about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.

Another word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don't know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don't know about 3 and 4? But we can't put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?

But STREP isn't common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven't tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.

Also, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.

But note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.

""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.

Another: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.

I think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.

Now, with ""RIDES"":
- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is '✓', then R is at 1? Or if '-'? Then R is not at 1? Or 'x'? But that can't happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get 'x' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either '✓' or '-'. Similarly for E at position 4: either '✓' or '-'.

Also, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.

For example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? 
- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? 
Wait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E's position? So it's a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? 

But in ""STORES"", it's 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That's 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be '-'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? 

Also, S,T,O? We don't know.

But compare ""RIDES"": 
- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? 
- R at position 1? Also new? We don't know status? 

So ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven't tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? 

Whereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? 

So I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? 

Another word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? 

Or ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.

Therefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".

But let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.

So guess: ""RIDES""

But note: position in ""RIDES"":
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: D
- 4: E
- 5: S

We expect:
- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?
- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?
- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.

This should give us good information.

So my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:
- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N
- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Positions tested in the first guess**:
  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).
  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).
  - Position 4: N is absent.
  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).

For the second guess, the goal is to:
1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.
2. Avoid using C, A, or N.
3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.

The word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).
- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).
- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).
- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.

This approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.

<guess>rides</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":
- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it's not at position 1.
- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.
- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it's correct!
- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.

Additionally, from first guess feedback:
- C, A, N: x → not in word.
- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).
- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.

Summary of what we know:
- E is in position 4: ✓.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).
  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.

Also, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.

So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Letters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven't identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.

Therefore, for the third guess, we need to:
- Include R? Because we haven't fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it's not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.

Also, we need to guess a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Because it's fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don't? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it's correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.

So any guess must have E at position 4.

Also, the word must contain R? But we don't know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it's correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? 

But note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let's list the positions:

Positions:
- Position 4: E (fixed)

Now, R must be at 3 or 5? So:
- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? 

But we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? 

But since we are testing? We can create a word that:
- Has E at position 4? Always.
- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? 

Moreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? 

So available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.

But note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that's four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.

Since E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?

For example: 
- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can't use D.

Similarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.

Common words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: R? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: T? 

But we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven't ruled out multiple E? So it's possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it's in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? 

Also? We must see? But let's consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? 

Another word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? 

I'm considering putting R at 3? Then let's think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It's _ _ R E? 

Actually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? 

Another? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? 

""CHORE""? C is absent? No? 

""PLUMBER""? Too long? 

""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that's good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn't have R? 

So we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? 
- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? 

Valid words: 
- ""OGRED""? But D absent? 
- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? 

Now, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? 
- 1: B? 
- 2: E? 
- 3: R? 
- 4: E? 
- 5: T? 

But we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That's good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don't know about other E? 

But in terms of information? We test:
- Position 1: B? If it's present? 
- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don't assume anything? 
- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? 

Therefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? 

Alternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? 

""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? 

""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? 

But with feedback? We want to get information? 

However? ""purER"" might be valid? But let's see? 

Another: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. 

""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? 

So? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? 

But note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? 

But our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? 

Alternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? 

Words: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? 

""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? 

And letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? 

Then? We test R at position 5? 

Similarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? 

But by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? 

So ""TOTER"": 
- Position 1: T? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: T? 
- Position 4: E? 
- Position 5: R? 

Then? We test:
- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if '-'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? 
- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? 

But if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don't care? 

But? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? 

However? We can do? 

But preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? 

But? Back to feedback? 

Since R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? 

But let's choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? 

Another word: ""BOULE""? But no R? 

Perhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? 

So? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? 

Consideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? 

But which one is better? 

Perhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": 
- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? 
- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? 
- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? 

Actually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be '-' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be '-' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that's impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give 'x'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be 'x'. 

Similarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. 

So? With ""BERET""?
- Position 1: B - will show if B present? 
- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if '-': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if 'x': E not present at 2? And no additional E? 
- Position 3: R - we care about R position?
- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? 
- Position 5: T

But? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? 

But? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? 

Similarly? For position 5? T? 

Now? Back to? TOTER? 

But? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? 

To avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? 

For example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? 

Words? Like ""CURE""? But too short? 

5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? 

""RARED""? Has A? Absent? 

""TIRED""? But I and D absent? 

""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? 

""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? 

But we want R at 3? 

""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? 

""HERPS""? Not common? 

""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? 

So? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? 

For example? ""TRECK"" not word? 

""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? 

""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? 

With available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? 

So possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" 

Other words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? 

""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? 

We need position 3:R? 

""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? 

Words like ""CREEK""? C absent? 

Perhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? 

Also, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be 'x'? Or if duplicate? 

But it's messy? 

Since valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let's accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? 

Therefore? I choose ""BERET""

So? Third guess: ""BERET""

Perhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? 

""KEREL""? Obscure? 

So? BERET is standard? 

Thus: guess ""BERET""

<guess>beret</guess>### Reasoning for Guess 3:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C, A, N are absent (x).  
  - R is present but misplaced (-).  
  - E is present but misplaced (-).  
- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  
  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  
  - I, D, S are absent (x).  
  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.

**Key deductions**:  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - R and E must be in the word.  
  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  
- **Position constraints for R**:  
  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  
  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  
  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn't in) must hold a new letter.

**Strategy for Guess 3**:  
- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  
- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  
- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  
- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  
- The word **""BERET""** fits:  
  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  
  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  
  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  
  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.

**Expected outcomes**:  
- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  
- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  
- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.

<guess>beret</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the third guess ""beret"":
- B: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 2
- R: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 3
- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4, as expected
- T: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (from all feedback: crane, rides, beret)
- From guess 1: C, A, N absent
- From guess 2: I, D, S absent
- From guess 3: B, T absent

**Present Letters**:
- E: confirmed at position 4 (✓ in beret)
- R: present but not at position 1, 2, or 3 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3 respectively)

Also, from the feedback of beret:
- The E at position 2 is misplaced (-). This means there is another E in the word? But wait, we already have E at position 4. So if E at position 2 is misplaced, it implies that the secret word has at least two E's? Or is that necessarily true?

Let me think: 
- We know E is at position 4 (fixed).
- We guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.
- Since we already have E at position 4, the '-' for position 2 must mean that there is an additional E in the word? Because if there were only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 would be an incorrect position for the only E, so it should be marked as 'x' (absent) for that position? But it was marked as '-', which means it is present but misplaced. Therefore, there must be at least two E's in the word.

So, the secret word has at least two E's: one at position 4, and at least one more elsewhere.

Also, R is present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the word has 5 positions, R must be at position 5? Because position 4 is E.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → so must be at 5? But we have 5 positions, so R must be at position 5? 

But let's confirm: 
- From guess 1: R was at position 2 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 2: R was at position 1 → misplaced (-)
- From guess 3: R was at position 3 → misplaced (-)
- Therefore, R is not at 1,2,3. And position 4 is E, so R must be at position 5.

So R is at position 5.

Now, we have:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

And we know there is at least one more E (since E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning another E exists). The only positions left are 1,2,3. So one of positions 1,2,3 must be E? But we have three positions and we know one of them is E (the second E).

Also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. So we cannot use these.

Now, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ E R

And we know one of the first three positions is E (the second E). Also, the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: We have to avoid C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. Also, we have E and R already, but E can be repeated.

The alphabet: A to Z, minus absent: 
Absent: A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T → so available: E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But we know the word must have at least two E's, so one E is at position 4, and another E at one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word is of the form: X Y Z E R, where one of X,Y,Z is E, and the other two are from the available letters.

Now, for our next guess, we need to test possibilities for positions 1,2,3.

We know one of them is E, but we don't know which one. Also, the other two are unknown.

We should try to guess a word that has E in one of the positions 1,2,3 and uses common letters for the others to test.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are at guess 4 of 6.

Possible strategies:

1. Test E at position 1: then the word would be E ? ? E R. But we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.

2. Or test E at position 2: ? E ? E R

3. Or test E at position 3: ? ? E E R

We can choose one of these and use common letters for the unknowns.

But we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Moreover, we can get information about the other positions.

Let me list possible words:

First, if E is at position 1: E _ _ E R

Possible words: EATER? But A and T are absent? A absent, T absent (from beret, T is absent). So not.

EAGER? A absent.

EASER? A and S absent.

No, because A and T are out.

Similarly, words like EGGER? G,G? E G G E R? That's a word (one who gathers eggs). Letters: E,G,G,E,R. Avoid absent? G is not absent? And E,R are in. Absent are A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T. So G is available.

Similarly, EGGER: positions:1:E,2:G,3:G,4:E,5:R.

But we have two G's? That's fine.

Similarly, other words: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHOS? But C and S absent.

So EGGER is a possibility.

But we don't know if E is at position 1.

Similarly, if E is at position 2: _ E _ E R

Words: ? E ? E R

Like: LEVER? L E V E R? But V? Available? Yes. L not absent.

LEVER: positions:1:L,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R.

Similarly, FEWER? F E W E R? F and W available.

Or HEXER? H E X E R? H and X available.

But we need to choose.

If E is at position 3: _ _ E E R

Words: ? ? E E R

Like: UPPER? U P P E R? U and P available.

But UPPER: positions:1:U,2:P,3:P,4:E,5:R? But position 3 is P, not E? We need position 3 to be E.

Pattern: position 3 must be E? So _ _ E E R.

Examples: AGREE? But A and G? A absent.

BLEED? B and D absent.

FLEER? F L E E R? F and L available? FLEER is a word? Meaning to mock or jeer.

Similarly, GLEEK? Not E E R.

So FLEER: F L E E R? Positions:1:F,2:L,3:E,4:E,5:R.

Yes.

Now, back to the feedback: we need to design a guess that can distinguish the position of the second E.

Since we have three possibilities (E at 1, E at 2, or E at 3), we can choose a word that tests one of these.

But we also want to test common letters for the other positions.

Moreover, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover as much as possible.

Another idea: since we know the word ends with E R, and has E at 4, R at 5, and one more E in 1-3, we can guess a word that has E at position 1, for example, to see if it's there.

If we guess a word with E at position 1, and it is correct (green), then we know E is at 1. If it is misplaced, then E is not at 1, but since we know there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3. Similarly, if we get 'x' for E at 1? But we know there is another E, so it cannot be 'x'? It must be either green or yellow? Because E is present elsewhere.

Similarly for other positions.

So, let's choose to test E at position 1.

Guess a word: E _ _ E R

With available letters.

For example, EGGER: E G G E R

But we have to avoid absent letters, and G is available.

EGGER is a valid word.

If we guess EGGER:
- Position 1: E → if green, then E is at position 1. If yellow, then E is not at 1 (so must be at 2 or 3).
- Position 2: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 2?
- Position 3: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 3? But if G is present, it might show yellow or green? But we have two G's? So if the word has G, it might be complicated.

To avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters if possible.

But in EGGER, we have two G's.

Alternative: EPHER? Not common.

Or ECHER? Not.

Another word: EATER? But A and T absent.

Not possible.

Perhaps ""EMMER""? E M M E R? M is available? E M M E R? That's a word (a type of wheat). Positions:1:E,2:M,3:M,4:E,5:R.

Still duplicate M.

""EVERR""? Not a word.

""EXERT""? But X and T? T is absent? From beret, T is absent? So cannot.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""EXPEL""? But P and L? But ends with L, not R? Not.

So, it's hard to find a word with E at 1 and distinct letters? Because the pattern E _ _ E R requires the middle two letters to form a word.

Another: ""EGRET""? E G R E T? But R is at position 3? And T is absent? Also, we have R at position 3, but we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have R at position 3? Because R is only at position 5? So the word must not have R except at position 5? But in EGRET, R is at position 3? So if we guess that, position 3 R would be wrong? But we know R is at 5? So it would be a wasted guess? Better not to use R in other positions.

Therefore, in our guess, we should not use R except at position 5? Because we know R is fixed at 5? Similarly, E at position 4 is fixed? So for positions 1,2,3, we should not use E except if we are testing it? But we are testing E at 1? So for position 1, we use E? For positions 2 and 3, we should use other letters? Not R? Not E? Unless necessary.

In EGGER, position 3 is G? Not R? So that's fine? But duplicate G.

But let's proceed with EGGER? Or find a better word.

Another word: ""EEKER""? E E K E R? But E at position 2? And we are testing E at position 1? But E at position 2 is also E? So positions:1:E,2:E,3:K,4:E,5:R? Then we have three E's? Which might be possible? But K is available.

But ""EEKER"" is not common? Perhaps not valid.

""ELVER""? E L V E R? L and V available? ELVER is a word (young eel). Positions:1:E,2:L,3:V,4:E,5:R.

This has distinct letters except for E? But E is repeated? But we are testing E at position 1? And position 4 is fixed E? So position 2 and 3 are L and V? New letters.

So ""ELVER"" might be a good choice.

Similarly, ""EMMEW""? Not common.

So I think ""ELVER"" is acceptable.

But let's see the feedback from beret: we have E at position 2 was misplaced? So there is another E? But in ELVER, we are putting E at position 1? So we can test.

Alternatively, we could test E at position 2? With a word like ? E ? E R

For example, ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But then we have E at position 2? And position 4? So if we guess LEVER, we test E at position 2? If green, then E is at 2? If yellow, then E not at 2? But since there is another E, it must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, we test L and V.

But LEVER has E at position 2 and 4? So if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 would be green? Etc.

But we don't know which position the second E is in.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests E at a specific position and uses new letters.

Since we have three positions to test (1,2,3) for E, and two of them will be other letters, we can choose one.

I think testing E at position 1 is as good as any.

So let's go with ""ELVER"".

But ""ELVER"" has E at 1, L at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

We know position 4 and 5 are fixed? So we expect E at 4 green, R at 5 green? But we don't know R at 5 is fixed? We deduced it must be? But we haven't confirmed? In the feedback, we will see.

Actually, from deduction, R must be at 5? But we need to confirm? Because if we are wrong, it might be elsewhere? But we have eliminated positions 1,2,3 for R? And position 4 is E? So only position 5 left? So it must be there.

Similarly, E at 4 is fixed.

So in ""ELVER"", position 4 and 5 should be green? And position 1: E? If green, then E is at 1? If yellow, then E is not at 1? But since there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3.

Also, position 2: L? Test if L is in the word? Position 3: V? Test if V is in the word.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""ELVER"" for guess 4.

But let's make sure: is ""ELVER"" a valid word? Yes, it means a young eel.

So guess: ELVER

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.

If we get lucky, we might solve.

Otherwise, we get more information.

So:### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback on all guesses:
- **Absent Letters (x)**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (excluded from future guesses).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: Confirmed at position 4 (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).
  - **R**: Present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 (misplaced in all guesses). Since position 4 is E, R must be at position 5.
- **Key Insight from Guess 3 (beret)**:
  - The E at position 2 was misplaced (-), meaning there is **at least one additional E** in the word (besides position 4). Thus, the secret word has two E's: one fixed at position 4, and another at position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Word Structure**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ _ E R`, with one of the first three positions being the second E, and the other two positions filled with letters not in the absent list.

**Deductions**:
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, B, C, D, I, N, S, T are absent).
- **Positions 1, 2, and 3**:
  - One must be E (the second E).
  - The other two must be from the available letters.
- **Goal for Guess 4**: Test the position of the second E (position 1, 2, or 3) while probing new common letters for the remaining positions.

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Test E at position 1**: This helps resolve the location of the second E. If E is correct (✓) at position 1, we confirm the second E is there. If misplaced (-), the second E must be at position 2 or 3.
- **Use new common letters**: For positions 2 and 3, choose high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, V) to maximize information if they are present/absent.
- **Avoid redundant positions**: Position 4 (E) and position 5 (R) are fixed, so the guess must include E at 4 and R at 5.
- **Chosen word: ""ELVER""** (a valid English word meaning a young eel):
  - **E** at position 1: Tests if the second E is here.
  - **L** at position 2: Probes a common consonant.
  - **V** at position 3: Probes a less common letter to cover more ground.
  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (expected ✓).
  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (expected ✓).

**Expected Outcomes**:
- If E at position 1 is ✓, the secret word is `E _ _ E R`, and we focus on positions 2–3 next.
- If E at position 1 is -, the second E must be at position 2 or 3, and we use the feedback on L and V to narrow options.
- Feedback on L and V will reveal if they are present, guiding the next guess.

<guess>elver</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 4: elver -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""elver"" -> E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Let's interpret:
- E at position 1: '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 1. Since we know there is a second E (from previous feedback), this confirms that the second E is not at position 1. Therefore, the second E must be at position 2 or 3.
- L at position 2: 'x' meaning L is not in the word at all. So L is absent.
- V at position 3: 'x' meaning V is not in the word at all. So V is absent.
- E at position 4: '✓' as expected, correct.
- R at position 5: '✓' as expected, correct.

Now, update our knowledge:

**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T, L, V (add L and V to the list)

**Present Letters**:
- E: at position 4 and one more at either position 2 or 3.
- R: at position 5.

**Word Pattern**: _ _ _ E R, with the third character being either position 2 or 3 must be E (since not at 1, and one of 2 or 3 must be E).

Specifically, the secret word has:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- One of position 2 or 3 is E (the second E).
- The remaining two positions (the other of 2 or 3, and position 1) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters (not absent): F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and E, R are already placed, but E can be used again? No, we have exactly two E's? We know there are at least two, but could there be more? The feedback doesn't indicate more, but we don't know for sure. However, since we have only two positions left to fill (one of which is E), and the other is a new letter, it's likely only two E's. But we must consider the possibility of a third E? However, in the pattern, we have positions 1,2,3: one is E, and the other two are non-E. So only two E's in total.

So, the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R, where either letter2 is E and letter3 is something else, or letter3 is E and letter2 is something else. And letter1 is a non-E.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test whether E is at position 2 or 3, and also test possible letters for the other positions.

We have two cases:

Case 1: E at position 2 -> pattern: _ E ? E R
Case 2: E at position 3 -> pattern: _ ? E E R

We can design a guess that helps distinguish these and tests common letters.

But note: we have only two guesses left (guess 5 and 6). We need to be efficient.

Idea: Guess a word that has E at position 2 and a different letter at position 3, and a common letter at position 1. Then, if E is at position 2, we get green for position 2. If not, then E must be at position 3, and we get yellow for E at position 2? But if we put E at position 2 and the actual word has E at position 3, then the E at position 2 would be marked as absent? Or as misplaced? 

Wait: if the actual word has E only at positions 3 and 4, and we guess E at position 2, then since position 2 is not E, and there is no E at position 2 in the secret, but there is an E at position 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be marked as '-' (misplaced) because there is an E in the word but not at that position? But that would be confusing because we are trying to see if E is at 2 or 3.

Actually, the feedback for E at position 2 would be:
- If the secret has E at position 2: then green.
- If the secret has E at position 3 but not at 2: then the E at position 2 would be marked as '-' (yellow) because there is an E in the word (at position 3) but not at 2.

But in both cases, we get a yellow or green for E at position 2? We don't get an 'x'. So it doesn't directly tell us if E is at 2 or 3? 

If we get green at position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get yellow at position 2, then E is not at 2, so it must be at 3? Because we know one of 2 or 3 is E.

Similarly, if we put E at position 3, we can get similar feedback.

But we can choose to test E at position 2.

So, for guess 5, let's try a word with E at position 2 and a common letter at position 1 and 3.

For example, ""HEWER"": H E W E R? But we have E at position 2 and 4? And R at 5? But position 3 is W.

Pattern: H E W E R

But we are testing E at position 2? And we have E at position 4? So if we guess ""HEWER"", then:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: E (test for E at 2)
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E (green)
- Position 5: R (green)

Now, if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 E is green. If not, then position 2 E is yellow (because there is E at 3 or 4? But position 4 is already green, so if there is no E at 2, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow only if there is another E? But we know there is one at 4 and one at either 2 or 3. So if E is at 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow (because of the E at 3). If E is at 2, then green.

So by the feedback for position 2, we can tell:
- If green: E is at position 2.
- If yellow: E is not at position 2, so must be at position 3.

Additionally, we test H at position 1 and W at position 3.

But ""HEWER"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 4? So it's acceptable.

But note: we must avoid absent letters. H and W are not in the absent list? Absent: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T,L,V. So H and W are available.

""HEWER"" is a word (one who hews wood, etc.).

So we can use ""HEWER"".

Alternatively, we could use ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L? But L is absent? No, L is absent, so cannot.

""MEWER""? M E W E R? M is available? Yes. ""MEWER"" is a word? Meaning one who mews (a gull or a cage). But less common.

""PEEWEE""? Too long.

So ""HEWER"" is fine.

But let's see: if we guess ""HEWER"", and if the feedback for position 2 is green, then we know the word is ? E ? E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? Then we can adjust.

If position 2 is yellow, then E is at position 3, so the word is _ ? E E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? But if E is at 3, then position 3 in the secret is E, so W at position 3 in the guess would be wrong? And we get feedback for that.

So it's efficient.

Therefore, I choose ""HEWER"" for guess 5.

But note: we are at guess 5, and we have one more if needed.

So guess: HEWER### Analysis of Feedback and Current Knowledge

**Feedback Summary**:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  → R and E are present (but misplaced); C, A, N absent.
- **Guess 2 (rides)**: R(-), I(x), D(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  → E confirmed at position 4; R not at position 1; I, D, S absent.
- **Guess 3 (beret)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), E(✓), T(x)  
  → E at position 4 confirmed again; R not at position 3; B, T absent; E at position 2 is misplaced, confirming a **second E** exists in the word.
- **Guess 4 (elver)**: E(-), L(x), V(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  → E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; E at position 1 is misplaced (so second E is not at position 1); L, V absent.

**Deductions**:
- **Absent Letters**: A, B, C, D, I, L, N, S, T, V (10 letters excluded).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: At position 4 (fixed). A second E must be at position 2 or 3 (since not at 1).
  - **R**: At position 5 (fixed).
- **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`:
  - Position 4 = E, position 5 = R (both fixed).
  - One of position 2 or 3 must be the second E.
  - Position 1 and the remaining position (2 or 3) are unknown letters.
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters left).

### Strategy for Guess 5
- **Goal**: Determine if the second E is at position 2 or 3, while testing new common letters for positions 1 and 3 (or 2).
- **Chosen Word: ""HEWER""**:
  - **H** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
  - **E** at position 2: Probes if the second E is here (if ✓, E is at 2; if -, E must be at 3).
  - **W** at position 3: Tests a less common letter to cover more possibilities.
  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (✓ expected).
  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (✓ expected).
- **Why ""HEWER""?**:
  - Efficiently distinguishes the second E's position: 
    - If E at position 2 is ✓, the word is `_ E _ E R`.
    - If E at position 2 is -, the word is `_ _ E E R` (E must be at position 3).
  - Tests H and W, which are high-frequency and not excluded.
  - Avoids absent letters and reuses known information (E at 4, R at 5).

Similarly, R could be in position 1.\n\nLet me try to list possible positions for R and E:\n\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).\n- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5).\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we want to cover:\n- Test R in a new position (since position 2 was wrong).\n- Test E in a new position (since position 5 was wrong).\n- Also, test for other common letters.\n\nSince we have limited known letters (only R and E), we need to get information about other letters.\n\nSo, for example, let\'s consider words that:\n- Have E in position 1? Then we can see if E is there.\n- Or R in position 1? But we have R to place elsewhere.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid placing R and E in the same positions as the first guess? Actually, we can place them differently.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, C, N.\n\nCommon starting letters? We can try ""R"" at the beginning? Or ""E""?\n\nI think a word like ""ROUTE"" might be good? But let\'s check:\n- R in position 1 (which wasn\'t tested for R before? In crane, R was in position 2. So position 1 is new for R)\n- O, U, T, E: and we don\'t know about O,U,T.\n\nBut we must see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, ""STARE"" but S and T are common? However, note that ""crane"" had A which is not present, so ""STARE"" has A? But we know A is not in the word, so we must avoid words with A? Yes! Because A is absent.\n\nSo we cannot use words containing A, C, N.\n\nTherefore, ""stare"" is invalid because it contains A.\n\nSimilarly, ""route"" does not contain A,C,N? R-O-U-T-E -> letters: R,O,U,T,E. None are A,C,N. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we also want to test E in a different position? We had E at position 5 in crane, now at position 5? Oh, no: in ""route"" E is at position 5. But we know E is not at position 5? Because in crane, E was at position 5 and was marked \'-\' meaning that E is in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, it will be incorrect? And won\'t give new information? Actually, it would be the same as before: it will not move E? But we want to test other positions.\n\nSo putting E at position 5 again is not useful because we already know E isn\'t at position 5. Therefore, we should put E at a different position: one of 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, for R: we had it at position 2 in crane. So we can put it at 1,3,4,5? But we haven\'t tested 1,3,4,5 for R? We have tested position 2: incorrect.\n\nSo ideally, we place R at any of 1,3,4 or 5? But note: if we place it at 1, that\'s new. Or at 3,4,5.\n\nBut we want to maximize coverage? Actually, since we have only two known letters, it might be better to try putting them in positions we haven\'t tested, so that the feedback tells us if they are in that position or not.\n\nTherefore, for R: let\'s put it in position 1? Then if it turns out to be correct, we get a green ✓. If not, then we know it\'s not at position 1? Or wait, if it\'s misplaced, we get \'-\' and then we know R is not at 1? But note, if we get \'-\', that means R is in the word but not at position 1? But we already know R is in the word. So the \'-\' at position 1 would give us that R is not at position 1? Which is new information.\n\nSimilarly, for E: let\'s put it at position 1? Or position 4? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test both at once? But we must avoid A,C,N.\n\nSo let\'s try a word like ""REEST""? But that has duplicate E? And I think ""REEST"" isn\'t common? Also, it has \'S\' and \'T\', which haven\'t been tested.\n\nBut note: we can use ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 3? Then we test R at 1 and E at 3? And O,L,S are new.\n\nROLES: R in 1, O in 2, L in 3? Wait: R-O-L-E-S -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S.\n\nIn this case, E is put at position 4 (which is a new position: previously was at 5). And R at position 1 (new position).\n\nAlso, O,L,S are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""ENTRY"" but E at position 1? And we avoid N? Wait, feedback says N is not in word? So if we put N, it would be wrong? But ""entry"" has N? Not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D: has I? And D? Also, R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2? Because previous feedback? Actually, no: previous feedback was that R was not at position 2? But that doesn\'t stop us from putting R at position 2? Actually, if we put R at position 2, since we know it\'s not there? Then it will be misplaced? But we already know that? So it would waste a chance? Therefore, it\'s better not to put R at position 2 again? Similarly for E at position 5? We should avoid repeating positions for the same letter?\n\nYes, because we know R is not at position 2? So putting it at position 2 is futile? And similarly, E not at 5? So we want new positions.\n\nTherefore, in ""tried"": R is at position 2? That\'s the same as crane? Which we know is wrong? So if we put R at 2, it will automatically be \'-\', telling us R is misplaced? But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Better to put R in a position where we don\'t know the result? Like 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, E: avoid position 5? Put in 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo if we do ""tried"": T-R-I-E-D -> positions: 1:T, 2:R (bad, already tested and wrong), 3:I, 4:E, 5:D. Also, we have E at 4? That might be okay? But R at 2? Not good.\n\nSo better avoid ""tried"".\n\nHow about ""HIRED"" -> same problem? R at position 2: not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""STEER""? But has duplicate E? And we might not want dupes? Plus S,T,E,E,R? Avoiding A,C,N? But the word has S and T? However, E is at position 3 and 4? We don\'t know the position of E? Also, E at 5? We know position 5 is bad? So in STEER, E is at 3,4,5? Position 5 is bad? And we don\'t know about 3 and 4? But we can\'t put E at 5? So STEER is not great? Maybe ""STREW"": S-T-R-E-W -> positions:1:S,2:T,3:R,4:E,5:W? Then R at 3? Which is new? E at 4? Also new? And includes S,T,W? Which are new letters? So that might work? But note: W is less common? Or ""STREP""?\n\nBut STREP isn\'t common? How about ""BLUER""? B-L-U-E-R -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:E, 5:R? Then, E is at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? And R is at position 5? Also new? So both E and R are in new positions? And B,L,U are new letters? Avoiding A,C,N.\n\nAlso, ""BLUER"" is a word? It means more blue? Yes, acceptable.\n\nBut note: common vowels? U is vowel? We can also consider other words? Like ""RIDES"": R-I-D-E-S? Positions:1:R,2:I,3:D,4:E,5:S? R at 1? New position? E at 4? Also new? Avoids A,C,N? And letters D,I,S? Also common? So ""RIDES"" seems good.\n\n""ROTED"" is not a word? So no.\n\nAnother: ""PUREE"" has duplicate E and puts E at 5? Avoid.\n\nI think ""RIDES"" is a valid word: R-I-D-E-S? Meaning? Plural of ride? Yes.\n\nNow, with ""RIDES"":\n- Position 1: R -> If the feedback is \'✓\', then R is at 1? Or if \'-\'? Then R is not at 1? Or \'x\'? But that can\'t happen because R must be in word? Actually, if we get \'x\' for R? Contradicts? So we expect either \'✓\' or \'-\'. Similarly for E at position 4: either \'✓\' or \'-\'.\n\nAlso, we test I, D, S? These are new letters? So we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that uses other common consonants? Like T, L, etc.\n\nFor example, ""STORE"": S-T-O-R-E? \n- Positions:1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E? \nWait, E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5, it will be - (for sure)? Because E is in word? But we know that? And we get no new information about E\'s position? So it\'s a bit wasteful? But we are testing R at position 4? And S,T,O? \n\nBut in ""STORES"", it\'s 6 letters? Wait, store is S-T-O-R-E? That\'s 5 letters? Yes. But in feedback, E at 5 is wrong? So if we guess ""store"", E is at 5? It will be \'-\'? Confirming what we know? Then we get R at position 4? If it is correct? Or misplaced? \n\nAlso, S,T,O? We don\'t know.\n\nBut compare ""RIDES"": \n- Puts E at position 4? Which is a new untested position? \n- R at position 1? Also new? We don\'t know status? \n\nSo ""RIDES"" seems better because it tests E in a position we haven\'t tried? Before E was at 5? Now E at 4? And R was at 2? Now R at 1? \n\nWhereas ""store"" repeats E at 5? So worse? \n\nSo I think ""RIDES"" is a good option? \n\nAnother word: ""QUEST"": Q-U-E-S-T? But Q is less common? So ""RIDES"" is better? \n\nOr ""DUET"": but 4 letters? No.\n\nTherefore, I will go for ""RIDES"".\n\nBut let me think of avoiding rare letters? D and S are common? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""RIDES""\n\nBut note: position in ""RIDES"":\n- 1: R\n- 2: I\n- 3: D\n- 4: E\n- 5: S\n\nWe expect:\n- If R is at position 1? Green? Else if not, then misplaced?\n- E at position 4? Green or misplaced?\n- Also, test I, D, S? Which might be in the word? Or not.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo my second guess: ""RIDES""Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" with feedback C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we can deduce the following:\n- **Letters NOT in the secret word**: C, A, N\n- **Letters CONFIRMED in the secret word (misplaced)**: R and E\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- **Positions tested in the first guess**:\n  - Position 1: Not C (and not A, N).\n  - Position 2: R is misplaced (so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n  - Position 3: A is absent (and C, N are out).\n  - Position 4: N is absent.\n  - Position 5: E is misplaced (so E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n\nFor the second guess, the goal is to:\n1. Test new positions for R and E to gather positional information.\n2. Avoid using C, A, or N.\n3. Probe new common letters (e.g., consonants like S, D, or I) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""RIDES"" was chosen because:\n- It places R in position 1 (a new, untested position for R).\n- It places E in position 4 (a new, untested position for E).\n- It introduces new letters: I (position 2), D (position 3), and S (position 5), which are common and worth testing.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, A, N).\n- If any of these positions correctly place R or E, we get direct positional confirmation; if misplaced, it narrows their possible locations.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds on the initial feedback to reduce the solution space for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>rides</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our second guess ""rides"":\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position) → R is misplaced, and since it was guessed at position 1, it\'s not at position 1.\n- I: x (not in word) → I is not in the word.\n- D: x (not in word) → D is not in the word.\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in position 4 and it\'s correct!\n- S: x (not in word) → S is not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from first guess feedback:\n- C, A, N: x → not in word.\n- R: - → in word, not at position 2 (and now not at position 1 either).\n- E: - → in word, not at position 5, but note from second guess: E is now fixed at position 4.\n\nSummary of what we know:\n- E is in position 4: ✓.\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 → must be in position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So positions for R are 3 or 5? Yes, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have:\n  - Position 2: R was misplaced (from first guess).\n  - Position 1: R was misplaced (from second guess), so R is not in position 1 or 2? So R must be in position 3 or 5? And position 4 is taken by E? So R cannot be at 4? Then indeed R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S. And from this guess we add I, D, S to absent list.\n\nSo absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.\n\nLetters present: R, E (and E is fixed at position 4). And R must be present? Also, we know there are at least two letters? But there might be more letters? Since we have only identified R and E? With E at position 4? And one R? But possibly more letters? Wait, feedback from first guess: only R and E were identified? And we haven\'t identified others? So the secret word has R and E? And possibly three other letters? But we know that of the absent letters? So we need to avoid those.\n\nTherefore, for the third guess, we need to:\n- Include R? Because we haven\'t fixed its position? And it must be in the word? So we should put R? And test positions 3 or 5? Since we know it\'s not in 1 or 2? And we can put it at 3 or 5? To see which one is correct? And avoid the absent letters.\n\nAlso, we need to guess a word that:\n- Has E at position 4? Because it\'s fixed? So for the secret word, position 4 is E? So in our guess, position 4 must be E? Because we might not have the word if we don\'t? Actually, we must guess with E at position 4? Because we know it\'s correct? And in the rules? We can use that knowledge.\n\nSo any guess must have E at position 4.\n\nAlso, the word must contain R? But we don\'t know its position? Either 3 or 5? But we can try to put R in one of the possible positions? Say position 3? Then see if it\'s correct? If not? Then it must be at 5? Or put it at 5? Then if correct? Or not? \n\nBut note: we can also try to probe other letters? Since we know E at 4? And R must be at 3 or 5? We can guess a word that puts R at position 3? And then, for position 5? We use some other letter? And similarly? To also test other possible letters? Because there are three other positions? Position 1,2? And 5 if R is not there? Or 3 and 5? But let\'s list the positions:\n\nPositions:\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n\nNow, R must be at 3 or 5? So:\n- If we put R at position 3? Then position 5 must be something else? Or if R is at 5? Then position 3 is something else? \n\nBut we also need to fill positions 1 and 2? And if R is at 3? Then positions 1,2,5 need to be filled? Similarly if R at 5? Then positions 1,2,3? \n\nBut since we are testing? We can create a word that:\n- Has E at position 4? Always.\n- Places R in position 3? Then use letters for other positions? But avoid absent letters? And we want to test common letters? \n\nMoreover? The absent letters are: C, A, N, I, D, S? So we must avoid these? \n\nSo available letters? All letters except these? And E,R? So we can include new common letters? Like T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nBut note: we need to form a valid English word? With E at position 4? And R at position 3? For example? Like ""WORD""? But that\'s four letters? Wait, 5-letter words: position pattern: ??E?? ? But with R at position 3? Then the word is: - - R E -? So positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:E, 5:?.\n\nSince E is fixed? Guess must be: _ _ ? E? ? But with R at 3? So: _ _ R E _.\n\nNow, what words have this pattern? And avoid C,A,N,I,D,S?\n\nFor example: \n- BURET? Is that a word? Or ""PURED""? But D is absent? Not allowed? Because D is in the absent list? So we can\'t use D.\n\nSimilarly, we must have letters? For positions 1,2,5? So position 1: any letter not absent? And similarly for 2 and 5.\n\nCommon words? Like ""BERET""? But B-E-R-E-T? But position pattern: B E R E T? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:E,5:T? But wait position 4 is E? So if we put E? But in second position? We have position 4? But in ""beret"": \n- Position 1: B? \n- Position 2: E? \n- Position 3: R? \n- Position 4: E? \n- Position 5: T? \n\nBut we need to avoid repeating E? Not necessarily? The secret word might have multiple E? But so far? We know E is at position 4? And we haven\'t ruled out multiple E? So it\'s possible? But in our guess? We can use E again? But note? If we put E at position 2? That might be okay? But since E is already confirmed at position 4? Then position 2 E? If it\'s in the word? It will show? But if not? Might be misleading? \n\nAlso? We must see? But let\'s consider the feedback? We can do that? However? using common words? \n\nAnother word: ""HORIE"" not valid? Perhaps ""QUOTE""? But Q is less common? Positions: Q U O T E? Pattern: position 4? E? So? But position 3 is O? Not R? \n\nI\'m considering putting R at 3? Then let\'s think of words ending with R E? Like? But wait? It\'s _ _ R E? \n\nActually? ""FLAME""? But A and M? Maybe? But A is absent? So not? \n\nAnother? ""STORE""? But S is absent? From second guess? S is not in word? So avoid? \n\n""CHORE""? C is absent? No? \n\n""PLUMBER""? Too long? \n\n""GLOVE""? G-L-O-V-E? Pattern: position 4:E? So that\'s good? Positions:1:G,2:L,3:O,4:E,5:V? But we want to test R at position 3? Then ""GLOVE"" doesn\'t have R? \n\nSo we need a word with R at position 3? And E at position 4? \n\nExamples: \n- ""BARRE"" but has A? And A absent? Also double R? \n- ""TERRA"" has T,E,R,R,A? But A absent? \n\nValid words: \n- ""OGRED""? But D absent? \n- ""BERET"": as I thought? Letters: B,E,R,E,T? Avoid A,N,C,I,D,S? It has B,E,R,E,T? \n\nNow, B is not absent? E is already used? But we can use it? So ""BERET"": positions? \n- 1: B? \n- 2: E? \n- 3: R? \n- 4: E? \n- 5: T? \n\nBut we know E is fixed at position 4? So position 4 is E? That\'s good? Position 2? E? Would that be a problem? Not necessarily? Because we don\'t know about other E? \n\nBut in terms of information? We test:\n- Position 1: B? If it\'s present? \n- Position 2: E? Which might be? If E is also at 2? Then it would be colored? But we don\'t assume anything? \n- Position 3: R? We are specifically testing R? Because R might be at 3? So if correct? Green? Else if misplaced? Then R must be at 5? \n\nTherefore? ""BERET"" seems a candidate? \n\nAlternative? ""MIRET""? But M-I-R-E-T? I is absent? Not allowed? \n\n""PORED""? P-O-R-E-D? D absent? No? \n\n""PURER""? P-U-R-E-R? Has U? And R multiple? But D not? But the word: positions? 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:R? Then R at 3? And E at 4? And position 5 is R? But R is already present? \n\nBut with feedback? We want to get information? \n\nHowever? ""purER"" might be valid? But let\'s see? \n\nAnother: ""LURED""? But L-U-R-E-D? D absent? No. \n\n""JEWEL""? But J-E-W-E-L? Position 4?E? But position 3? is W? Not R? \n\nSo? Seems ""BERET"" is a valid word? \n\nBut note? In ""BERET"": position 2 is E? And we know E is at position 4? But is there a possibility that E is also at position 2? Yes? So we can test? \n\nBut our primary goal is to find the position of R? Putting R at 3? If it becomes green? Then we have R at 3? And E at 4? So two letters? Then we need the others? Plus? We test B at 1? T at 5? Etc? \n\nAlternatively? We could put R at position 5? Instead of 3? To test that? For example? A word like ""--- E R""? Ending with E R? But position 4 is E? Position 5? R? So: _ _ _ E R? \n\nWords: ""COVER""? But C absent? ""MAKER"" has A? Absent? ""TIMER"" has I? Absent? ""LATER"" has A? Absent? \n\n""TOTER""? T-O-T-E-R? Pattern:1:T,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:R? So position 5: R? \n\nAnd letters T,O? Not in absent list? So ""TOTER"" (meaning one who tots) is valid? \n\nThen? We test R at position 5? \n\nSimilarly? If correct? Then good? Or if misplaced? Then R must be at position 3? \n\nBut by putting R at 5? We can see? But note? Putting R at position 5? Then the word must have E at 4? \n\nSo ""TOTER"": \n- Position 1: T? \n- Position 2: O? \n- Position 3: T? \n- Position 4: E? \n- Position 5: R? \n\nThen? We test:\n- Position 5: R? If green? Then R is at position 5? Else if \'-\'? Then R is not at 5? And must be at 3? \n- Also test T at positions 1 and 3? And O at 2? \n\nBut if ""TOTER"" turns out to be the word? Then position 3 is T? But we don\'t care? \n\nBut? We might want to avoid duplicate letters? Because ""TOTER"" has two T? Which might not be efficient? Since if T is present? We get multiple feedback? But if not? We know? \n\nHowever? We can do? \n\nBut preference? Perhaps better to test R at position 3? Because if it turns out to be correct? Then we still have position 5 open? But in ""BERET""? If R at 3 is correct? Then we have B at 1? E at 2? E at 4? T at 5? But then the secret word might be _ _ R E _? With E at 4? And R at 3? So positions 1,2,5? \n\nBut? Back to feedback? \n\nSince R must be at 3 or 5? And E at 4? We can also think? That if we get R at 3 correct? Then position 5 is free? Or if not? Then position 5 must have R? \n\nBut let\'s choose a word? Either ""BERET"" or ""TOTER"" or something else? \n\nAnother word: ""BOULE""? But no R? \n\nPerhaps ""WOVEN""? No R? \n\nSo? I think between ""BERET"" and ""TOTER""? \n\nConsideration: ""BERET"" has E at position 2? Which tests whether E is also at that position? And if not? We know E is only at 4? Similarly? ""TOTER"" has two T? Tests whether T is in the word? But at position 1 and 3? \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nPerhaps? First? Test R at position 3? With ""BERET"": \n- If R is green at position 3? Then we know R is at 3? \n- Then? Position 1: B? Position 2: E? Position 5: T? \n- Position 2: E? If it is green? Then E is also at 2? But if yellow? Then E in word but not at 2? But we know E at 4? So if green? Then duplicate E? If yellow? Then impossible because E at 4 is fixed and another E would be misplaced? But wait? The letter E is already at 4? So position 2? If E? Then it should be green? Or if not? Then absence? \n\nActually? Position 2 could be E or not? And if it is E? Then green? If not? then the symbol could be \'-\' only if there is another E but at wrong position? But we have E at 4? So if we guess E at 2? And the secret word has only one E? Then position 2 E would be \'-\' meaning E is in the word but wrong position? But position 4 is already E? And only one E? So that\'s impossible? Therefore? if the secret word has only one E? Then guessing E at position 2 should give \'x\'? But we already have E at position 4? So the secret word must have E at 4? So if no duplicate E? Then guessing E at 2 should be \'x\'. \n\nSimilarly? if there is duplicate E? Then position 2 could be E? Then green. \n\nSo? With ""BERET""?\n- Position 1: B - will show if B present? \n- Position 2: E - if green: duplicate E at 2? Or if \'-\': E in word but wrong position (but since E is fixed at 4? That implies another E)? Or if \'x\': E not present at 2? And no additional E? \n- Position 3: R - we care about R position?\n- Position 4: E - green? Always? Because we know? \n- Position 5: T\n\nBut? Position 4: E? is green? Fixed? From previous? So the feedback for position 4 will be ✓? Of course? \n\nBut? Position 2: if E? If the secret word has E at 2? Then it would be ✓? Else if the word has E only at 4? Then guessing E at position 2 should be \'x\'? Because no other E? And position is wrong? \n\nSimilarly? For position 5? T? \n\nNow? Back to? TOTER? \n\nBut? I think ""BERET"" is a reasonable choice? Or another word? Without the ambiguity? But we can use that? \n\nTo avoid the E duality? We could choose a word without E at another position? Then no problem? \n\nFor example? put R at position 3? But no E except at position 4? So word pattern: _ _ R E _? With no extra E? \n\nWords? Like ""CURE""? But too short? \n\n5-letter: ""PURE""? Too short? \n\n""RARED""? Has A? Absent? \n\n""TIRED""? But I and D absent? \n\n""ROWED""? R-O-W-E-D? D absent? \n\n""FOYER""? F-O-Y-E-R? Pattern: F O Y E R? But position 4:E? Then position 5:R? So R at 5? Not 3? \n\nBut we want R at 3? \n\n""TERRY""? T-E-R-R-Y? Positions:1:T,2:E,3:R,4:R,5:Y? But then position 4 is R? But we know E is at position 4? So cannot? Must be E at 4? So ""TERRY"" has R at 4? Not good? \n\n""HERPS""? Not common? \n\n""BERME""? But E at position 5? But we know E not at 5? And also position 2 is E? So ""berme"": B-E-R-M-E? Positions:1:B,2:E,3:R,4:M,5:E? Then position 4? M? Not E? But we need E at position 4? Required? So it should be pattern: _ _ R E _? Position 4 must be E? \n\nSo? Words with pattern: ? ? R E ? ? \n\nFor example? ""TRECK"" not word? \n\n""BREED""? B-R-E-E-D? D absent? No? \n\n""GREEK""? G-R-E-E-K? Position 4:E? But pattern? G at1? R at2? E at3? E at4? K at5? So position 3? E? Not R? \n\nWe need position 3:R? So R at 3? E at 4? So? First two letters? And last letter? \n\nWith available letters? Avoid C,A,N,I,D,S? \n\nSo possible? B? E? But E at 2? in ""BERET"" \n\nOther words? ""PORES""? P-O-R-E-S? But S absent? No? \n\n""FREET""? F-R-E-E-T? Pattern:1:F,2:R,3:E,4:E,5:T? Position 3:E? Not R? \n\nWe need position 3:R? \n\n""BOREE""? B-O-R-E-E? But E at 5? And we know E not at 5? So position 5 E? Will be wrong? \n\nWords like ""CREEK""? C absent? \n\nPerhaps? ""THREE""? T-H-R-E-E? Positions:1:T,2:H,3:R,4:E,5:E? Then E at 5? Which is not allowed since we know E not at 5? \n\nAlso, ""three"" has E at 5? So if we guess ""three""? Position 4:E? Fixed? Position 5:E? If secret word has only one E? Then position 5 would be \'x\'? Or if duplicate? \n\nBut it\'s messy? \n\nSince valid words with R at 3 and E at 4 are limited? Let\'s accept ""BERET"" as a reasonable choice? \n\nTherefore? I choose ""BERET""\n\nSo? Third guess: ""BERET""\n\nPerhaps? Another? ""GUYER"" not? \n\n""KEREL""? Obscure? \n\nSo? BERET is standard? \n\nThus: guess ""BERET"" \n\nRefine:\n<guess>beret</guess>### Reasoning for Guess 3:\n\nBased on the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  \n  - C, A, N are absent (x).  \n  - R is present but misplaced (-).  \n  - E is present but misplaced (-).  \n- **Guess 2 (rides)**:  \n  - R is present but misplaced (-) → R is **not at position 1** (since it was misplaced there).  \n  - I, D, S are absent (x).  \n  - E is correct at position 4 (✓) → **E is confirmed at position 4**.\n\n**Key deductions**:  \n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (cannot be used).  \n- **Present letters**:  \n  - R and E must be in the word.  \n  - E is fixed at position 4 (✓).  \n- **Position constraints for R**:  \n  - R is not at position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 2 (from Guess 1).  \n  - Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 3 or 5.  \n- **Unknown positions**:  \n  - Positions 1 and 2 are unknown (along with position 5 if R is not there, or position 3 if R is not there).  \n  - Position 3 or 5 (whichever R isn\'t in) must hold a new letter.\n\n**Strategy for Guess 3**:  \n- We must include **E at position 4** (fixed).  \n- Test **R at position 3** (to resolve ambiguity between positions 3 and 5).  \n- Use common letters **not excluded** (e.g., B, T).  \n- Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).  \n- The word **""BERET""** fits:  \n  - B (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  \n  - E (position 2): Tests for duplicate E (if E is elsewhere).  \n  - R (position 3): Probes if R is at position 3.  \n  - E (position 4): Confirmed correct (✓).  \n  - T (position 5): Tests a common ending letter.\n\n**Expected outcomes**:  \n- If R is correct at position 3, R is fixed → focus on positions 1, 2, 5.  \n- If R is misplaced (-), R must be at position 5 → position 3 must be another letter.  \n- Feedback will reveal status of B, E (position 2), and T, further narrowing options.\n\n<guess>beret</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the third guess ""beret"":\n- B: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 2\n- R: - (in word but wrong position) → this is for position 3\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4, as expected\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (from all feedback: crane, rides, beret)\n- From guess 1: C, A, N absent\n- From guess 2: I, D, S absent\n- From guess 3: B, T absent\n\n**Present Letters**:\n- E: confirmed at position 4 (✓ in beret)\n- R: present but not at position 1, 2, or 3 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3 respectively)\n\nAlso, from the feedback of beret:\n- The E at position 2 is misplaced (-). This means there is another E in the word? But wait, we already have E at position 4. So if E at position 2 is misplaced, it implies that the secret word has at least two E\'s? Or is that necessarily true?\n\nLet me think: \n- We know E is at position 4 (fixed).\n- We guessed E at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2.\n- Since we already have E at position 4, the \'-\' for position 2 must mean that there is an additional E in the word? Because if there were only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 would be an incorrect position for the only E, so it should be marked as \'x\' (absent) for that position? But it was marked as \'-\', which means it is present but misplaced. Therefore, there must be at least two E\'s in the word.\n\nSo, the secret word has at least two E\'s: one at position 4, and at least one more elsewhere.\n\nAlso, R is present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the word has 5 positions, R must be at position 5? Because position 4 is E.\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,4,5\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → so must be at 5? But we have 5 positions, so R must be at position 5? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- From guess 1: R was at position 2 → misplaced (-)\n- From guess 2: R was at position 1 → misplaced (-)\n- From guess 3: R was at position 3 → misplaced (-)\n- Therefore, R is not at 1,2,3. And position 4 is E, so R must be at position 5.\n\nSo R is at position 5.\n\nNow, we have:\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n\nAnd we know there is at least one more E (since E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning another E exists). The only positions left are 1,2,3. So one of positions 1,2,3 must be E? But we have three positions and we know one of them is E (the second E).\n\nAlso, we have absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. So we cannot use these.\n\nNow, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ E R\n\nAnd we know one of the first three positions is E (the second E). Also, the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\nAvailable letters: We have to avoid C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T. Also, we have E and R already, but E can be repeated.\n\nThe alphabet: A to Z, minus absent: \nAbsent: A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T → so available: E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut we know the word must have at least two E\'s, so one E is at position 4, and another E at one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nSo the word is of the form: X Y Z E R, where one of X,Y,Z is E, and the other two are from the available letters.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we need to test possibilities for positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe know one of them is E, but we don\'t know which one. Also, the other two are unknown.\n\nWe should try to guess a word that has E in one of the positions 1,2,3 and uses common letters for the others to test.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are at guess 4 of 6.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. Test E at position 1: then the word would be E ? ? E R. But we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.\n\n2. Or test E at position 2: ? E ? E R\n\n3. Or test E at position 3: ? ? E E R\n\nWe can choose one of these and use common letters for the unknowns.\n\nBut we also need to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nMoreover, we can get information about the other positions.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nFirst, if E is at position 1: E _ _ E R\n\nPossible words: EATER? But A and T are absent? A absent, T absent (from beret, T is absent). So not.\n\nEAGER? A absent.\n\nEASER? A and S absent.\n\nNo, because A and T are out.\n\nSimilarly, words like EGGER? G,G? E G G E R? That\'s a word (one who gathers eggs). Letters: E,G,G,E,R. Avoid absent? G is not absent? And E,R are in. Absent are A,B,C,D,I,N,S,T. So G is available.\n\nSimilarly, EGGER: positions:1:E,2:G,3:G,4:E,5:R.\n\nBut we have two G\'s? That\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, other words: EPHER? Not common.\n\nOr ECHOS? But C and S absent.\n\nSo EGGER is a possibility.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if E is at position 2: _ E _ E R\n\nWords: ? E ? E R\n\nLike: LEVER? L E V E R? But V? Available? Yes. L not absent.\n\nLEVER: positions:1:L,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R.\n\nSimilarly, FEWER? F E W E R? F and W available.\n\nOr HEXER? H E X E R? H and X available.\n\nBut we need to choose.\n\nIf E is at position 3: _ _ E E R\n\nWords: ? ? E E R\n\nLike: UPPER? U P P E R? U and P available.\n\nBut UPPER: positions:1:U,2:P,3:P,4:E,5:R? But position 3 is P, not E? We need position 3 to be E.\n\nPattern: position 3 must be E? So _ _ E E R.\n\nExamples: AGREE? But A and G? A absent.\n\nBLEED? B and D absent.\n\nFLEER? F L E E R? F and L available? FLEER is a word? Meaning to mock or jeer.\n\nSimilarly, GLEEK? Not E E R.\n\nSo FLEER: F L E E R? Positions:1:F,2:L,3:E,4:E,5:R.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to the feedback: we need to design a guess that can distinguish the position of the second E.\n\nSince we have three possibilities (E at 1, E at 2, or E at 3), we can choose a word that tests one of these.\n\nBut we also want to test common letters for the other positions.\n\nMoreover, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover as much as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know the word ends with E R, and has E at 4, R at 5, and one more E in 1-3, we can guess a word that has E at position 1, for example, to see if it\'s there.\n\nIf we guess a word with E at position 1, and it is correct (green), then we know E is at 1. If it is misplaced, then E is not at 1, but since we know there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3. Similarly, if we get \'x\' for E at 1? But we know there is another E, so it cannot be \'x\'? It must be either green or yellow? Because E is present elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nSo, let\'s choose to test E at position 1.\n\nGuess a word: E _ _ E R\n\nWith available letters.\n\nFor example, EGGER: E G G E R\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters, and G is available.\n\nEGGER is a valid word.\n\nIf we guess EGGER:\n- Position 1: E → if green, then E is at position 1. If yellow, then E is not at 1 (so must be at 2 or 3).\n- Position 2: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 2?\n- Position 3: G → tests if G is in the word? And at position 3? But if G is present, it might show yellow or green? But we have two G\'s? So if the word has G, it might be complicated.\n\nTo avoid confusion, better to use distinct letters if possible.\n\nBut in EGGER, we have two G\'s.\n\nAlternative: EPHER? Not common.\n\nOr ECHER? Not.\n\nAnother word: EATER? But A and T absent.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps ""EMMER""? E M M E R? M is available? E M M E R? That\'s a word (a type of wheat). Positions:1:E,2:M,3:M,4:E,5:R.\n\nStill duplicate M.\n\n""EVERR""? Not a word.\n\n""EXERT""? But X and T? T is absent? From beret, T is absent? So cannot.\n\nT is absent, so we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, ""EXPEL""? But P and L? But ends with L, not R? Not.\n\nSo, it\'s hard to find a word with E at 1 and distinct letters? Because the pattern E _ _ E R requires the middle two letters to form a word.\n\nAnother: ""EGRET""? E G R E T? But R is at position 3? And T is absent? Also, we have R at position 3, but we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have R at position 3? Because R is only at position 5? So the word must not have R except at position 5? But in EGRET, R is at position 3? So if we guess that, position 3 R would be wrong? But we know R is at 5? So it would be a wasted guess? Better not to use R in other positions.\n\nTherefore, in our guess, we should not use R except at position 5? Because we know R is fixed at 5? Similarly, E at position 4 is fixed? So for positions 1,2,3, we should not use E except if we are testing it? But we are testing E at 1? So for position 1, we use E? For positions 2 and 3, we should use other letters? Not R? Not E? Unless necessary.\n\nIn EGGER, position 3 is G? Not R? So that\'s fine? But duplicate G.\n\nBut let\'s proceed with EGGER? Or find a better word.\n\nAnother word: ""EEKER""? E E K E R? But E at position 2? And we are testing E at position 1? But E at position 2 is also E? So positions:1:E,2:E,3:K,4:E,5:R? Then we have three E\'s? Which might be possible? But K is available.\n\nBut ""EEKER"" is not common? Perhaps not valid.\n\n""ELVER""? E L V E R? L and V available? ELVER is a word (young eel). Positions:1:E,2:L,3:V,4:E,5:R.\n\nThis has distinct letters except for E? But E is repeated? But we are testing E at position 1? And position 4 is fixed E? So position 2 and 3 are L and V? New letters.\n\nSo ""ELVER"" might be a good choice.\n\nSimilarly, ""EMMEW""? Not common.\n\nSo I think ""ELVER"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from beret: we have E at position 2 was misplaced? So there is another E? But in ELVER, we are putting E at position 1? So we can test.\n\nAlternatively, we could test E at position 2? With a word like ? E ? E R\n\nFor example, ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But then we have E at position 2? And position 4? So if we guess LEVER, we test E at position 2? If green, then E is at 2? If yellow, then E not at 2? But since there is another E, it must be at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, we test L and V.\n\nBut LEVER has E at position 2 and 4? So if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 would be green? Etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know which position the second E is in.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word that tests E at a specific position and uses new letters.\n\nSince we have three positions to test (1,2,3) for E, and two of them will be other letters, we can choose one.\n\nI think testing E at position 1 is as good as any.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ELVER"".\n\nBut ""ELVER"" has E at 1, L at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nWe know position 4 and 5 are fixed? So we expect E at 4 green, R at 5 green? But we don\'t know R at 5 is fixed? We deduced it must be? But we haven\'t confirmed? In the feedback, we will see.\n\nActually, from deduction, R must be at 5? But we need to confirm? Because if we are wrong, it might be elsewhere? But we have eliminated positions 1,2,3 for R? And position 4 is E? So only position 5 left? So it must be there.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4 is fixed.\n\nSo in ""ELVER"", position 4 and 5 should be green? And position 1: E? If green, then E is at 1? If yellow, then E is not at 1? But since there is another E, it must be at 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, position 2: L? Test if L is in the word? Position 3: V? Test if V is in the word.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ELVER"" for guess 4.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: is ""ELVER"" a valid word? Yes, it means a young eel.\n\nSo guess: ELVER\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.\n\nIf we get lucky, we might solve.\n\nOtherwise, we get more information.\n\nSo:### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback on all guesses:\n- **Absent Letters (x)**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T (excluded from future guesses).\n- **Present Letters**:\n  - **E**: Confirmed at position 4 (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).\n  - **R**: Present but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 (misplaced in all guesses). Since position 4 is E, R must be at position 5.\n- **Key Insight from Guess 3 (beret)**:\n  - The E at position 2 was misplaced (-), meaning there is **at least one additional E** in the word (besides position 4). Thus, the secret word has two E\'s: one fixed at position 4, and another at position 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Word Structure**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ _ E R`, with one of the first three positions being the second E, and the other two positions filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\n**Deductions**:\n- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, B, C, D, I, N, S, T are absent).\n- **Positions 1, 2, and 3**:\n  - One must be E (the second E).\n  - The other two must be from the available letters.\n- **Goal for Guess 4**: Test the position of the second E (position 1, 2, or 3) while probing new common letters for the remaining positions.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4\n- **Test E at position 1**: This helps resolve the location of the second E. If E is correct (✓) at position 1, we confirm the second E is there. If misplaced (-), the second E must be at position 2 or 3.\n- **Use new common letters**: For positions 2 and 3, choose high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, V) to maximize information if they are present/absent.\n- **Avoid redundant positions**: Position 4 (E) and position 5 (R) are fixed, so the guess must include E at 4 and R at 5.\n- **Chosen word: ""ELVER""** (a valid English word meaning a young eel):\n  - **E** at position 1: Tests if the second E is here.\n  - **L** at position 2: Probes a common consonant.\n  - **V** at position 3: Probes a less common letter to cover more ground.\n  - **E** at position 4: Fixed (expected ✓).\n  - **R** at position 5: Fixed (expected ✓).\n\n**Expected Outcomes**:\n- If E at position 1 is ✓, the secret word is `E _ _ E R`, and we focus on positions 2–3 next.\n- If E at position 1 is -, the second E must be at position 2 or 3, and we use the feedback on L and V to narrow options.\n- Feedback on L and V will reveal if they are present, guiding the next guess.\n\n<guess>elver</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: rides -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: beret -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 4: elver -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""elver"" -> E(-) L(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nLet\'s interpret:\n- E at position 1: \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at position 1. Since we know there is a second E (from previous feedback), this confirms that the second E is not at position 1. Therefore, the second E must be at position 2 or 3.\n- L at position 2: \'x\' meaning L is not in the word at all. So L is absent.\n- V at position 3: \'x\' meaning V is not in the word at all. So V is absent.\n- E at position 4: \'✓\' as expected, correct.\n- R at position 5: \'✓\' as expected, correct.\n\nNow, update our knowledge:\n\n**Absent Letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T, L, V (add L and V to the list)\n\n**Present Letters**:\n- E: at position 4 and one more at either position 2 or 3.\n- R: at position 5.\n\n**Word Pattern**: _ _ _ E R, with the third character being either position 2 or 3 must be E (since not at 1, and one of 2 or 3 must be E).\n\nSpecifically, the secret word has:\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n- One of position 2 or 3 is E (the second E).\n- The remaining two positions (the other of 2 or 3, and position 1) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\nAvailable letters (not absent): F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and E, R are already placed, but E can be used again? No, we have exactly two E\'s? We know there are at least two, but could there be more? The feedback doesn\'t indicate more, but we don\'t know for sure. However, since we have only two positions left to fill (one of which is E), and the other is a new letter, it\'s likely only two E\'s. But we must consider the possibility of a third E? However, in the pattern, we have positions 1,2,3: one is E, and the other two are non-E. So only two E\'s in total.\n\nSo, the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R, where either letter2 is E and letter3 is something else, or letter3 is E and letter2 is something else. And letter1 is a non-E.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to test whether E is at position 2 or 3, and also test possible letters for the other positions.\n\nWe have two cases:\n\nCase 1: E at position 2 -> pattern: _ E ? E R\nCase 2: E at position 3 -> pattern: _ ? E E R\n\nWe can design a guess that helps distinguish these and tests common letters.\n\nBut note: we have only two guesses left (guess 5 and 6). We need to be efficient.\n\nIdea: Guess a word that has E at position 2 and a different letter at position 3, and a common letter at position 1. Then, if E is at position 2, we get green for position 2. If not, then E must be at position 3, and we get yellow for E at position 2? But if we put E at position 2 and the actual word has E at position 3, then the E at position 2 would be marked as absent? Or as misplaced? \n\nWait: if the actual word has E only at positions 3 and 4, and we guess E at position 2, then since position 2 is not E, and there is no E at position 2 in the secret, but there is an E at position 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be marked as \'-\' (misplaced) because there is an E in the word but not at that position? But that would be confusing because we are trying to see if E is at 2 or 3.\n\nActually, the feedback for E at position 2 would be:\n- If the secret has E at position 2: then green.\n- If the secret has E at position 3 but not at 2: then the E at position 2 would be marked as \'-\' (yellow) because there is an E in the word (at position 3) but not at 2.\n\nBut in both cases, we get a yellow or green for E at position 2? We don\'t get an \'x\'. So it doesn\'t directly tell us if E is at 2 or 3? \n\nIf we get green at position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get yellow at position 2, then E is not at 2, so it must be at 3? Because we know one of 2 or 3 is E.\n\nSimilarly, if we put E at position 3, we can get similar feedback.\n\nBut we can choose to test E at position 2.\n\nSo, for guess 5, let\'s try a word with E at position 2 and a common letter at position 1 and 3.\n\nFor example, ""HEWER"": H E W E R? But we have E at position 2 and 4? And R at 5? But position 3 is W.\n\nPattern: H E W E R\n\nBut we are testing E at position 2? And we have E at position 4? So if we guess ""HEWER"", then:\n- Position 1: H\n- Position 2: E (test for E at 2)\n- Position 3: W\n- Position 4: E (green)\n- Position 5: R (green)\n\nNow, if the secret word has E at position 2, then position 2 E is green. If not, then position 2 E is yellow (because there is E at 3 or 4? But position 4 is already green, so if there is no E at 2, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow only if there is another E? But we know there is one at 4 and one at either 2 or 3. So if E is at 3, then the E at position 2 in the guess would be yellow (because of the E at 3). If E is at 2, then green.\n\nSo by the feedback for position 2, we can tell:\n- If green: E is at position 2.\n- If yellow: E is not at position 2, so must be at position 3.\n\nAdditionally, we test H at position 1 and W at position 3.\n\nBut ""HEWER"" has two E\'s? And we are using E at position 4? So it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must avoid absent letters. H and W are not in the absent list? Absent: C,A,N,I,D,S,B,T,L,V. So H and W are available.\n\n""HEWER"" is a word (one who hews wood, etc.).\n\nSo we can use ""HEWER"".\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L? But L is absent? No, L is absent, so cannot.\n\n""MEWER""? M E W E R? M is available? Yes. ""MEWER"" is a word? Meaning one who mews (a gull or a cage). But less common.\n\n""PEEWEE""? Too long.\n\nSo ""HEWER"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""HEWER"", and if the feedback for position 2 is green, then we know the word is ? E ? E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? Then we can adjust.\n\nIf position 2 is yellow, then E is at position 3, so the word is _ ? E E R, and we have H at 1 and W at 3? But if E is at 3, then position 3 in the secret is E, so W at position 3 in the guess would be wrong? And we get feedback for that.\n\nSo it\'s efficient.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""HEWER"" for guess 5.\n\nBut note: we are at guess 5, and we have one more if needed.\n\nSo guess: HEWER### Analysis of Feedback and Current Knowledge\n\n**Feedback Summary**:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \n  → R and E are present (but misplaced); C, A, N absent.\n- **Guess 2 (rides)**: R(-), I(x), D(x), E(✓), S(x)  \n  → E confirmed at position 4; R not at position 1; I, D, S absent.\n- **Guess 3 (beret)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), E(✓), T(x)  \n  → E at position 4 confirmed again; R not at position 3; B, T absent; E at position 2 is misplaced, confirming a **second E** exists in the word.\n- **Guess 4 (elver)**: E(-), L(x), V(x), E(✓), R(✓)  \n  → E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; E at position 1 is misplaced (so second E is not at position 1); L, V absent.\n\n**Deductions**:\n- **Absent Letters**: A, B, C, D, I, L, N, S, T, V (10 letters excluded).\n- **Present Letters**:\n  - **E**: At position 4 (fixed).

We have feedback for Guess 5: ""hewer"" -> H(x) E(-) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- H at position 1: 'x' → H is not in the word at all. So H is absent.
- E at position 2: '-' → E is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know there is a second E, this means the second E is not at position 2. Therefore, the second E must be at position 3 (since it can't be at 1 or 2, and 4 is already fixed).
- W at position 3: '✓' → W is correct at position 3. So position 3 is W.
- E at position 4: '✓' → as expected.
- R at position 5: '✓' → as expected.

Now, we know:
- Position 3: W (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- The second E must be at position 3? But position 3 is now W, so it cannot be E. Contradiction? 

Wait, let's reexamine:

From Guess 5 feedback:
- E at position 2 is '-', meaning E is present but not at position 2. Since we have E at position 4, and we know there is a second E, this '-' indicates that the second E is not at position 2. But we also have position 3 now fixed as W, so the second E cannot be at position 3 either. 

But we only have positions 1, 2, and 3 for the second E? Position 1 was tested in Guess 4 (""elver"") and E at position 1 was '-', meaning not at 1. Position 2 is now not E (from this feedback). Position 3 is now W, so not E. 

But we must have a second E somewhere. The only positions left are 1,2,3, but all are now excluded? 

Position 1: E was tested in ""elver"" and was misplaced, so not at 1.
Position 2: E tested in ""hewer"" and misplaced, so not at 2.
Position 3: Now we have W fixed, so not E.

Therefore, the second E must be at one of these positions? But we have a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has three E's? But we only know of two so far.

Let me recap the E feedback:

- In Guess 1: E at position 5 was misplaced, so E is in the word but not at 5.
- In Guess 2: E at position 4 is correct, so one E at 4.
- In Guess 3: E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning there is another E (at least two).
- In Guess 4: E at position 1 was misplaced, meaning the second E is not at 1.
- In Guess 5: E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning the second E is not at 2.

Now, the only positions left for the second E are 3 or possibly 5? But position 5 is R, fixed. So only position 3.

But in Guess 5, position 3 is W and it is correct, so it cannot be E.

Therefore, the secret word must have at least three E's? Because we have E at 4, and we need another E, but positions 1,2,3 are not E? But position 3 is W, so not E. So the second E must be at position 1 or 2? But we have feedback that they are not there.

This is a problem.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the deduction.

Let me list the positions:

Position 1: 
- In Guess 4 (""elver""): E at position 1 was '-', so E is in the word but not at 1. This could be because of the E at 4 or another E? But we know there is a second E, so it confirms that the second E is not at 1.

Position 2:
- In Guess 3 (""beret""): E at position 2 was '-', meaning E is in the word but not at 2. This must be due to the second E (since E at 4 is fixed).
- In Guess 5 (""hewer""): E at position 2 was again '-', which is consistent, but it doesn't add new information because we already knew it's not at 2.

Position 3:
- In Guess 5: W at position 3 is correct, so position 3 is W, not E.

Therefore, the second E cannot be at 1, 2, or 3. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So where is the second E? It must be at one of 1,2,3, but we have ruled out all.

Unless the feedback for Guess 3 and Guess 5 for position 2 E is not about the same E? But it is. The only possibility is that there is a third E? But we have no evidence of that.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback for Guess 3.

In Guess 3 (""beret""): 
- Position 2: E was '-', which means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 2. Since we have E at position 4, and if that is the only other E, then it should be sufficient to cause the '-' for position 2? But if there is only one other E (at 4), then the E at position 2 in the guess should be marked as 'x' if the secret word has no E at 2 and no other E besides position 4? But it was marked as '-', which means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 2, implying at least one more E besides the one at 4.

But now, with position 3 being W, and positions 1 and 2 not having E, the only way is if there is a third E? But where? Position 1,2,3 are taken by non-E letters? Position 1 is not E, position 2 is not E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So the secret word has only one E? But that contradicts the feedback from Guess 3.

This is a contradiction.

Perhaps the secret word has E at position 3 and position 4? But in Guess 5, position 3 is W and it is correct, so it cannot be E.

Unless the feedback is wrong? But we have to trust the feedback.

Another possibility: in Guess 5, the feedback for position 2 E is '-' which we already knew, but it doesn't provide new information. However, the key is that position 3 is W, which is fixed.

So let's ignore the E for a moment and look at what we have.

From Guess 5 feedback:
- H: absent (x)
- E at 2: misplaced (-) [but we already knew E is not at 2]
- W: correct at position 3 (✓)
- E at 4: correct (✓)
- R at 5: correct (✓)

So the secret word has W at position 3, E at 4, R at 5.

Also, from Guess 4, E at position 1 was misplaced, so there is an E not at 1, which we have at 4, but also must be another one because of Guess 3.

But with position 3 being W, the second E must be at position 2? But we have feedback that it is not at 2.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 3 position 2 E being '-' was because of the E at position 4, and there is no second E? But that would be incorrect because if there is only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x', not '-', because there is no other E to justify the '-'.

The rules of the game: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, it gets '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it gets 'x'.

In Guess 3, we guessed E at position 2, and it was '-', which means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 2. Since we have E at position 4, that is sufficient to give '-' for position 2, even if there is only one E? No, because the E at position 4 is already accounted for. In Wordle, if there is only one E in the secret word, and you guess two E's, one at the correct position and one at a wrong position, the one at the wrong position will be marked as '-' only if there is an additional E? No.

Let's clarify the rules with an example.

Suppose the secret word has only one E, at position 4.

If we guess a word with E at position 2 and E at position 4, then:
- Position 2: E is not in the secret at all? No, it is in the secret, but at position 4, not 2. So position 2 should be '-' (yellow) because the letter E is in the word but not at this position.
- Position 4: E is correct, green.

So even if there is only one E in the secret, if you guess an E at a wrong position, it will be yellow if there is an E somewhere else in the secret.

Therefore, in Guess 3 (""beret""), the E at position 2 was '-' not because there is a second E, but because there is an E at position 4. It does not necessarily imply a second E.

Similarly, in Guess 4 (""elver""), the E at position 1 was '-' because of the E at position 4.

In Guess 5 (""hewer""), the E at position 2 was '-' because of the E at position 4.

So there is only one E in the word, at position 4.

But then why in Guess 3, when we had E at position 2 and position 4, position 2 was '-' and position 4 was '✓', which is consistent with one E.

Similarly, in Guess 4, position 1 E was '-' and position 4 E was '✓'.

In Guess 5, position 2 E was '-' and position 4 E was '✓'.

So no need for a second E.

I think I made a mistake earlier. The feedback for E at position 2 in Guess 3 being '-' does not imply a second E; it only means that E is in the word but not at position 2, which is satisfied by the E at position 4.

Similarly for other guesses.

So there is only one E, at position 4.

Then, from Guess 5 feedback:
- H: absent
- E at 2: misplaced (due to E at 4)
- W: correct at position 3
- E at 4: correct
- R at 5: correct

So the secret word is: _ _ W E R

Positions 1 and 2 are unknown, and we have to find them.

Absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T, L, V, H (add H to absent)

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, Y, Z (and W,E,R are in, but we can use them if needed, but not in positions 1 and 2 since they are fixed elsewhere).

The word is: [letter1] [letter2] W E R

We need to find letter1 and letter2.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, Y, Z

Common words: POWER? But O and P? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions:1:P,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:R. But we have position 3 as W, so it matches.

But is P and O available? Yes, not in absent list.

Similarly, other words: MOWER, TOWER (T absent), LOWER (L absent), SOWER (S absent), etc.

So possible words: POWER, MOWER, etc.

But we have to guess.

Since we have only two positions, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters.

For example, ""POWER"": P O W E R

If we guess ""POWER"", then:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: W (green)
- Position 4: E (green)
- Position 5: R (green)

If P is in the word, we get feedback, but we don't know if P or O are in the word.

But if the secret is ""POWER"", we solve it.

Otherwise, we get feedback on P and O.

Similarly, ""MOWER"": M O W E R

But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 5, so this is guess 6? No, we are making guess 5 now? Let's see the history.

Guess 1,2,3,4,5 have been made. The last feedback is for guess 5, so we are to make guess 6? But the user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after providing feedback up to guess 5, so this is guess 6.

We have only one guess left.

We need to guess the word.

Possible words: 
- POWER
- MOWER
- ROWER? R is at position 5, but position 1 R? But R is already at 5, so if we put R at position 1, it might be duplicate? But the secret word might have only one R? Or two? We don't know.

From feedback, R was only at position 5, and in previous guesses, R was misplaced, but now fixed at 5. So if we put R at position 1, it might be absent or misplaced.

But let's list possible words ending with WER: _ _ W E R

Common: POWER, MOWER, TOWER (T absent), LOWER (L absent), SOWER (S absent), COWER (C absent), VOWER (not word), HOWER (H absent, from guess 5), JOWAR (not), etc.

So possible: POWER, MOWER, and less common: JEWER? But J and E? But E at position 2? ""JEWER"" not word.

Or ""NEWER""? N absent.

""POKER""? But K at position 3? Not W.

The word must have W at position 3, E at 4, R at 5.

So only the first two letters vary.

Possible combinations: 
- P O
- M O
- B O? B absent
- F O? F O W E R? Is ""FOWER"" a word? Not common.
- G O? G O W E R? ""GOWER"" is a proper name, but not common word.
- K O? ""KOWER"" not word.
- M O? ""MOWER"" is valid.
- P O? ""POWER"" is valid.
- R O? ""ROWER"" is valid (one who rows).
- S O? S absent.
- T O? T absent.
- U O? ""UOWER"" not word.
- Y O? ""YOWER"" not word.
- etc.

So the most common are POWER, MOWER, ROWER.

ROWER: R O W E R

But R is at position 1 and position 5. If the secret word has only one R, then position 1 R would be marked as 'x' or '-'? If only one R, and it is at position 5, then R at position 1 should be 'x' if no other R, or '-' if there is another R? But if only one R, then R at position 1 should be 'x' because the R is at 5 and already used.

In Wordle, if there is only one R in the secret, and you guess two R's, one at wrong position and one at correct, then the one at wrong position is marked as '-' only if there is a second R? But there isn't, so it should be 'x'? No.

Standard Wordle rules: if the secret has one R, and you guess a word with two R's, one at the correct position and one at a wrong position, then the one at correct position is green, and the one at wrong position is gray (x) because there is no extra R in the secret to justify the second R.

For example, secret: STORE (one R)
Guess: ROVER
- R at position 1: not in secret? But R is in secret at position 3, so R at 1 should be yellow? But there is only one R, so the first R is yellow, and the second R? But position 4 is R, which is not in secret (since only one R at 3), so position 4 R should be gray? But the feedback might mark the first R as yellow and the second as gray.

In this case, for ""ROVER"" vs ""STORE"":
- Position 1: R is in secret but not at 1 (since at 3), so yellow.
- Position 2: O is not in secret, gray.
- Position 3: V not in secret, gray.
- Position 4: E is in secret at position 4? ""STORE"" has E at 5, so position 4 is T? Not E, so E not in secret? Gray.
- Position 5: R is in secret at position 3? But position 5 is E, not R, so R at 5 is not in secret? But we have only one R, and it was already ""used"" for the yellow at position 1, so position 5 R should be gray.

So in this case, only one yellow for R at 1.

But in our case, for ""ROWER"" vs a secret with one R at 5:
- Position 1: R is not at 1, but R is in the word at 5, so it should be yellow.
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: W, correct
- Position 4: E, correct
- Position 5: R, correct

But if the secret has only one R, at position 5, then the R at position 1 should be yellow, but that would imply that R is in the word but not at 1, which is true, but there is only one R, so it should not be a problem? The feedback can still show yellow for position 1 and green for position 5.

But the issue is that the secret has only one R, so the yellow at position 1 indicates that there is an R elsewhere, which is true (at 5), so it's consistent.

However, in our case, we don't know if the secret has one or two R's.

But in previous feedback, when we guessed ""beret"" which has R at position 3, it was '-', and ""elver"" has no R except at 5, which was green, and ""hewer"" has no R except at 5, green. So we have no evidence of a second R.

Similarly, in ""crane"" and ""rides"", R was misplaced, but now fixed at 5.

So likely only one R.

But to be safe, we can consider.

Back to the guess.

We have to guess between POWER, MOWER, ROWER, etc.

Since we have only one guess left, we should choose the most common.

""POWER"" is very common.

""MOWER"" is also common.

""ROWER"" is less common.

Also, from available letters, P, O, M, R are available? R is present, but we can use it.

But to maximize chance, guess ""POWER"".

Or ""MOWER"".

But let's see if we can get a clue.

From Guess 5: we have H absent, so position 1 is not H.

In Guess 4: ""elver"" had E at 1 which was misplaced, but that was for E, not for other letters.

We have no information about position 1 and 2 except that they are not in the absent list.

So we have to guess.

Perhaps ""POWER"" is a good guess.

Or since we are at the last guess, and we have multiple possibilities, but we can only guess one.

Another word: ""FEWER""? But W is at position 3, so ""FEWER"" is F E W E R, so position 2 is E, but we know position 2 is not E? In this case, for the secret, position 2 is not E, so ""FEWER"" has E at position 2, which would be wrong.

So not.

I think ""POWER"" or ""MOWER"" are the main options.

Perhaps ""GOFER""? But G O F E R? Position 3 is F, not W.

No.

So I think between POWER and MOWER.

Let's choose ""POWER"" as it is more common.

So guess: POWER

But let's confirm the pattern: P O W E R

Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R

This matches the required pattern.

Similarly for MOWER: M O W E R

So we'll guess ""POWER"".

### Analysis of Feedback and Current Knowledge

**Feedback Summary**:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  → R and E present (misplaced); C, A, N absent.
- **Guess 2 (rides)**: R(-), I(x), D(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  → E fixed at position 4; R not at position 1; I, D, S absent.
- **Guess 3 (beret)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), E(✓), T(x)  
  → E at position 4 confirmed; R not at position 3; B, T absent; E at position 2 misplaced (due to E at position 4).
- **Guess 4 (elver)**: E(-), L(x), V(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  → E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; E at position 1 misplaced (due to E at position 4); L, V absent.
- **Guess 5 (hewer)**: H(x), E(-), W(✓), E(✓), R(✓)  
  → W fixed at position 3; E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; H absent; E at position 2 misplaced (due to E at position 4).

**Deductions**:
- **Absent Letters**: A, B, C, D, H, I, L, N, S, T, V (11 letters excluded).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: Fixed at position 4.
  - **R**: Fixed at position 5.
  - **W**: Fixed at position 3.
- **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ _ W E R` (positions 3, 4, 5 confirmed as W, E, R).
- **Unknown Positions**: Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.
- **Available Letters**: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, Y, Z (11 letters left).

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess)
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing the most probable letters for positions 1 and 2.
- **Chosen Word: ""POWER""**:
  - **P** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
  - **O** at position 2: Tests a common vowel.
  - **W, E, R** at positions 3, 4, 5: Fixed and expected to be ✓.
- **Why ""POWER""?**:
  - It is a common English word that fits the `_ _ W E R` pattern.
  - Uses high-frequency letters (P, O) for positions 1 and 2.
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on P and O will reveal their status (but as this is the final guess, we aim for the most likely solution).
- **Alternatives Considered**: ""MOWER"" was also plausible, but ""POWER"" is more common and thus prioritized.

<guess>power</guess>",power,"We have feedback for Guess 5: ""hewer"" -> H(x) E(-) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- H at position 1: 'x' → H is not in the word at all. So H is absent.
- E at position 2: '-' → E is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know there is a second E, this means the second E is not at position 2. Therefore, the second E must be at position 3 (since it can't be at 1 or 2, and 4 is already fixed).
- W at position 3: '✓' → W is correct at position 3. So position 3 is W.
- E at position 4: '✓' → as expected.
- R at position 5: '✓' → as expected.

Now, we know:
- Position 3: W (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- The second E must be at position 3? But position 3 is now W, so it cannot be E. Contradiction? 

Wait, let's reexamine:

From Guess 5 feedback:
- E at position 2 is '-', meaning E is present but not at position 2. Since we have E at position 4, and we know there is a second E, this '-' indicates that the second E is not at position 2. But we also have position 3 now fixed as W, so the second E cannot be at position 3 either. 

But we only have positions 1, 2, and 3 for the second E? Position 1 was tested in Guess 4 (""elver"") and E at position 1 was '-', meaning not at 1. Position 2 is now not E (from this feedback). Position 3 is now W, so not E. 

But we must have a second E somewhere. The only positions left are 1,2,3, but all are now excluded? 

Position 1: E was tested in ""elver"" and was misplaced, so not at 1.
Position 2: E tested in ""hewer"" and misplaced, so not at 2.
Position 3: Now we have W fixed, so not E.

Therefore, the second E must be at one of these positions? But we have a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has three E's? But we only know of two so far.

Let me recap the E feedback:

- In Guess 1: E at position 5 was misplaced, so E is in the word but not at 5.
- In Guess 2: E at position 4 is correct, so one E at 4.
- In Guess 3: E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning there is another E (at least two).
- In Guess 4: E at position 1 was misplaced, meaning the second E is not at 1.
- In Guess 5: E at position 2 was misplaced, meaning the second E is not at 2.

Now, the only positions left for the second E are 3 or possibly 5? But position 5 is R, fixed. So only position 3.

But in Guess 5, position 3 is W and it is correct, so it cannot be E.

Therefore, the secret word must have at least three E's? Because we have E at 4, and we need another E, but positions 1,2,3 are not E? But position 3 is W, so not E. So the second E must be at position 1 or 2? But we have feedback that they are not there.

This is a problem.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the deduction.

Let me list the positions:

Position 1: 
- In Guess 4 (""elver""): E at position 1 was '-', so E is in the word but not at 1. This could be because of the E at 4 or another E? But we know there is a second E, so it confirms that the second E is not at 1.

Position 2:
- In Guess 3 (""beret""): E at position 2 was '-', meaning E is in the word but not at 2. This must be due to the second E (since E at 4 is fixed).
- In Guess 5 (""hewer""): E at position 2 was again '-', which is consistent, but it doesn't add new information because we already knew it's not at 2.

Position 3:
- In Guess 5: W at position 3 is correct, so position 3 is W, not E.

Therefore, the second E cannot be at 1, 2, or 3. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So where is the second E? It must be at one of 1,2,3, but we have ruled out all.

Unless the feedback for Guess 3 and Guess 5 for position 2 E is not about the same E? But it is. The only possibility is that there is a third E? But we have no evidence of that.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback for Guess 3.

In Guess 3 (""beret""): 
- Position 2: E was '-', which means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 2. Since we have E at position 4, and if that is the only other E, then it should be sufficient to cause the '-' for position 2? But if there is only one other E (at 4), then the E at position 2 in the guess should be marked as 'x' if the secret word has no E at 2 and no other E besides position 4? But it was marked as '-', which means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 2, implying at least one more E besides the one at 4.

But now, with position 3 being W, and positions 1 and 2 not having E, the only way is if there is a third E? But where? Position 1,2,3 are taken by non-E letters? Position 1 is not E, position 2 is not E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So the secret word has only one E? But that contradicts the feedback from Guess 3.

This is a contradiction.

Perhaps the secret word has E at position 3 and position 4? But in Guess 5, position 3 is W and it is correct, so it cannot be E.

Unless the feedback is wrong? But we have to trust the feedback.

Another possibility: in Guess 5, the feedback for position 2 E is '-' which we already knew, but it doesn't provide new information. However, the key is that position 3 is W, which is fixed.

So let's ignore the E for a moment and look at what we have.

From Guess 5 feedback:
- H: absent (x)
- E at 2: misplaced (-) [but we already knew E is not at 2]
- W: correct at position 3 (✓)
- E at 4: correct (✓)
- R at 5: correct (✓)

So the secret word has W at position 3, E at 4, R at 5.

Also, from Guess 4, E at position 1 was misplaced, so there is an E not at 1, which we have at 4, but also must be another one because of Guess 3.

But with position 3 being W, the second E must be at position 2? But we have feedback that it is not at 2.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 3 position 2 E being '-' was because of the E at position 4, and there is no second E? But that would be incorrect because if there is only one E (at position 4), then guessing E at position 2 should be 'x', not '-', because there is no other E to justify the '-'.

The rules of the game: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, it gets '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it gets 'x'.

In Guess 3, we guessed E at position 2, and it was '-', which means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 2. Since we have E at position 4, that is sufficient to give '-' for position 2, even if there is only one E? No, because the E at position 4 is already accounted for. In Wordle, if there is only one E in the secret word, and you guess two E's, one at the correct position and one at a wrong position, the one at the wrong position will be marked as '-' only if there is an additional E? No.

Let's clarify the rules with an example.

Suppose the secret word has only one E, at position 4.

If we guess a word with E at position 2 and E at position 4, then:
- Position 2: E is not in the secret at all? No, it is in the secret, but at position 4, not 2. So position 2 should be '-' (yellow) because the letter E is in the word but not at this position.
- Position 4: E is correct, green.

So even if there is only one E in the secret, if you guess an E at a wrong position, it will be yellow if there is an E somewhere else in the secret.

Therefore, in Guess 3 (""beret""), the E at position 2 was '-' not because there is a second E, but because there is an E at position 4. It does not necessarily imply a second E.

Similarly, in Guess 4 (""elver""), the E at position 1 was '-' because of the E at position 4.

In Guess 5 (""hewer""), the E at position 2 was '-' because of the E at position 4.

So there is only one E in the word, at position 4.

But then why in Guess 3, when we had E at position 2 and position 4, position 2 was '-' and position 4 was '✓', which is consistent with one E.

Similarly, in Guess 4, position 1 E was '-' and position 4 E was '✓'.

In Guess 5, position 2 E was '-' and position 4 E was '✓'.

So no need for a second E.

I think I made a mistake earlier. The feedback for E at position 2 in Guess 3 being '-' does not imply a second E; it only means that E is in the word but not at position 2, which is satisfied by the E at position 4.

Similarly for other guesses.

So there is only one E, at position 4.

Then, from Guess 5 feedback:
- H: absent
- E at 2: misplaced (due to E at 4)
- W: correct at position 3
- E at 4: correct
- R at 5: correct

So the secret word is: _ _ W E R

Positions 1 and 2 are unknown, and we have to find them.

Absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, B, T, L, V, H (add H to absent)

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, Y, Z (and W,E,R are in, but we can use them if needed, but not in positions 1 and 2 since they are fixed elsewhere).

The word is: [letter1] [letter2] W E R

We need to find letter1 and letter2.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, Y, Z

Common words: POWER? But O and P? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions:1:P,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:R. But we have position 3 as W, so it matches.

But is P and O available? Yes, not in absent list.

Similarly, other words: MOWER, TOWER (T absent), LOWER (L absent), SOWER (S absent), etc.

So possible words: POWER, MOWER, etc.

But we have to guess.

Since we have only two positions, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters.

For example, ""POWER"": P O W E R

If we guess ""POWER"", then:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: W (green)
- Position 4: E (green)
- Position 5: R (green)

If P is in the word, we get feedback, but we don't know if P or O are in the word.

But if the secret is ""POWER"", we solve it.

Otherwise, we get feedback on P and O.

Similarly, ""MOWER"": M O W E R

But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 5, so this is guess 6? No, we are making guess 5 now? Let's see the history.

Guess 1,2,3,4,5 have been made. The last feedback is for guess 5, so we are to make guess 6? But the user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after providing feedback up to guess 5, so this is guess 6.

We have only one guess left.

We need to guess the word.

Possible words: 
- POWER
- MOWER
- ROWER? R is at position 5, but position 1 R? But R is already at 5, so if we put R at position 1, it might be duplicate? But the secret word might have only one R? Or two? We don't know.

From feedback, R was only at position 5, and in previous guesses, R was misplaced, but now fixed at 5. So if we put R at position 1, it might be absent or misplaced.

But let's list possible words ending with WER: _ _ W E R

Common: POWER, MOWER, TOWER (T absent), LOWER (L absent), SOWER (S absent), COWER (C absent), VOWER (not word), HOWER (H absent, from guess 5), JOWAR (not), etc.

So possible: POWER, MOWER, and less common: JEWER? But J and E? But E at position 2? ""JEWER"" not word.

Or ""NEWER""? N absent.

""POKER""? But K at position 3? Not W.

The word must have W at position 3, E at 4, R at 5.

So only the first two letters vary.

Possible combinations: 
- P O
- M O
- B O? B absent
- F O? F O W E R? Is ""FOWER"" a word? Not common.
- G O? G O W E R? ""GOWER"" is a proper name, but not common word.
- K O? ""KOWER"" not word.
- M O? ""MOWER"" is valid.
- P O? ""POWER"" is valid.
- R O? ""ROWER"" is valid (one who rows).
- S O? S absent.
- T O? T absent.
- U O? ""UOWER"" not word.
- Y O? ""YOWER"" not word.
- etc.

So the most common are POWER, MOWER, ROWER.

ROWER: R O W E R

But R is at position 1 and position 5. If the secret word has only one R, then position 1 R would be marked as 'x' or '-'? If only one R, and it is at position 5, then R at position 1 should be 'x' if no other R, or '-' if there is another R? But if only one R, then R at position 1 should be 'x' because the R is at 5 and already used.

In Wordle, if there is only one R in the secret, and you guess two R's, one at wrong position and one at correct, then the one at wrong position is marked as '-' only if there is a second R? But there isn't, so it should be 'x'? No.

Standard Wordle rules: if the secret has one R, and you guess a word with two R's, one at the correct position and one at a wrong position, then the one at correct position is green, and the one at wrong position is gray (x) because there is no extra R in the secret to justify the second R.

For example, secret: STORE (one R)
Guess: ROVER
- R at position 1: not in secret? But R is in secret at position 3, so R at 1 should be yellow? But there is only one R, so the first R is yellow, and the second R? But position 4 is R, which is not in secret (since only one R at 3), so position 4 R should be gray? But the feedback might mark the first R as yellow and the second as gray.

In this case, for ""ROVER"" vs ""STORE"":
- Position 1: R is in secret but not at 1 (since at 3), so yellow.
- Position 2: O is not in secret, gray.
- Position 3: V not in secret, gray.
- Position 4: E is in secret at position 4? ""STORE"" has E at 5, so position 4 is T? Not E, so E not in secret? Gray.
- Position 5: R is in secret at position 3? But position 5 is E, not R, so R at 5 is not in secret? But we have only one R, and it was already ""used"" for the yellow at position 1, so position 5 R should be gray.

So in this case, only one yellow for R at 1.

But in our case, for ""ROWER"" vs a secret with one R at 5:
- Position 1: R is not at 1, but R is in the word at 5, so it should be yellow.
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: W, correct
- Position 4: E, correct
- Position 5: R, correct

But if the secret has only one R, at position 5, then the R at position 1 should be yellow, but that would imply that R is in the word but not at 1, which is true, but there is only one R, so it should not be a problem? The feedback can still show yellow for position 1 and green for position 5.

But the issue is that the secret has only one R, so the yellow at position 1 indicates that there is an R elsewhere, which is true (at 5), so it's consistent.

However, in our case, we don't know if the secret has one or two R's.

But in previous feedback, when we guessed ""beret"" which has R at position 3, it was '-', and ""elver"" has no R except at 5, which was green, and ""hewer"" has no R except at 5, green. So we have no evidence of a second R.

Similarly, in ""crane"" and ""rides"", R was misplaced, but now fixed at 5.

So likely only one R.

But to be safe, we can consider.

Back to the guess.

We have to guess between POWER, MOWER, ROWER, etc.

Since we have only one guess left, we should choose the most common.

""POWER"" is very common.

""MOWER"" is also common.

""ROWER"" is less common.

Also, from available letters, P, O, M, R are available? R is present, but we can use it.

But to maximize chance, guess ""POWER"".

Or ""MOWER"".

But let's see if we can get a clue.

From Guess 5: we have H absent, so position 1 is not H.

In Guess 4: ""elver"" had E at 1 which was misplaced, but that was for E, not for other letters.

We have no information about position 1 and 2 except that they are not in the absent list.

So we have to guess.

Perhaps ""POWER"" is a good guess.

Or since we are at the last guess, and we have multiple possibilities, but we can only guess one.

Another word: ""FEWER""? But W is at position 3, so ""FEWER"" is F E W E R, so position 2 is E, but we know position 2 is not E? In this case, for the secret, position 2 is not E, so ""FEWER"" has E at position 2, which would be wrong.

So not.

I think ""POWER"" or ""MOWER"" are the main options.

Perhaps ""GOFER""? But G O F E R? Position 3 is F, not W.

No.

So I think between POWER and MOWER.

Let's choose ""POWER"" as it is more common.

So guess: POWER

But let's confirm the pattern: P O W E R

Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R

This matches the required pattern.

Similarly for MOWER: M O W E R

So we'll guess ""POWER"".### Analysis of Feedback and Current Knowledge

**Feedback Summary**:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  → R and E present (misplaced); C, A, N absent.
- **Guess 2 (rides)**: R(-), I(x), D(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  → E fixed at position 4; R not at position 1; I, D, S absent.
- **Guess 3 (beret)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), E(✓), T(x)  
  → E at position 4 confirmed; R not at position 3; B, T absent; E at position 2 misplaced (due to E at position 4).
- **Guess 4 (elver)**: E(-), L(x), V(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  → E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; E at position 1 misplaced (due to E at position 4); L, V absent.
- **Guess 5 (hewer)**: H(x), E(-), W(✓), E(✓), R(✓)  
  → W fixed at position 3; E at position 4 and R at position 5 confirmed; H absent; E at position 2 misplaced (due to E at position 4).

**Deductions**:
- **Absent Letters**: A, B, C, D, H, I, L, N, S, T, V (11 letters excluded).
- **Present Letters**:
  - **E**: Fixed at position 4.
  - **R**: Fixed at position 5.
  - **W**: Fixed at position 3.
- **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ _ W E R` (positions 3, 4, 5 confirmed as W, E, R).
- **Unknown Positions**: Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.
- **Available Letters**: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, Y, Z (11 letters left).

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess)
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing the most probable letters for positions 1 and 2.
- **Chosen Word: ""POWER""**:
  - **P** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
  - **O** at position 2: Tests a common vowel.
  - **W, E, R** at positions 3, 4, 5: Fixed and expected to be ✓.
- **Why ""POWER""?**:
  - It is a common English word that fits the `_ _ W E R` pattern.
  - Uses high-frequency letters (P, O) for positions 1 and 2.
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on P and O will reveal their status (but as this is the final guess, we aim for the most likely solution).
- **Alternatives Considered**: ""MOWER"" was also plausible, but ""POWER"" is more common and thus prioritized.",Guess 6: power -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
