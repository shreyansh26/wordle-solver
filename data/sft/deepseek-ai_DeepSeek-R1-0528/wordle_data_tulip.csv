We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.

 Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R and N.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""TOILS"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of words without the forbidden letters.

 We can try ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S. But we don't know if these are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SLUMP"" has S, L, U, M, P. But we want to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This covers common letters and avoids C,R,A,N,E.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can also try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, A, N, E.

 We have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has less common letters.

 Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""THUMP"" or ""DUMPY"", but let's try to get a word with more common letters.

 How about ""LOUSY""? L, O, U, S, Y. But Y is sometimes a vowel and less common.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"" has P, O, U, N, D -> but N is already eliminated? Wait, no: our feedback says N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""POUND"" is invalid because it has N.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word without these.

 Another candidate: ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P. This avoids the forbidden letters.

 But we can do better: we want to include a vowel. Since we have O and U left, and I.

 How about ""QUICK""? But Q is not very common and we have U and I, but also C is forbidden. So no.

 We can try ""LUCKY"" but C is forbidden.

 Let's think of ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. This avoids the forbidden letters.

 Or ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T.

 But we might want to use a word that has more than one vowel? We have only one vowel in ""MIGHT"" (I).

 How about ""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T. This has two vowels (O and I) and common consonants.

 ""HOIST"" is a valid word and uses H, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is similar: M, O, I, S, T.

 Since we have no information, either is fine. Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So, the next guess: ""moist""

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

 Let's check: M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in [C, R, A, N, E]. So it's safe.

 Therefore, we guess ""moist"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and uses new common letters to maximize information. 

I considered words like ""pious"" (uses P, I, O, U, S) but settled on **""moist""** because:
- It uses high-frequency consonants (M, S, T) and two vowels (O, I), covering new ground.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has no repeats.
- If this guess also returns all ""x"", it would eliminate M, O, I, S, T, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

We have feedback from two guesses.
First guess ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So these letters are not in the secret word at all.
Second guess ""moist"": 
  M -> x, O -> x, I -> -, S -> x, T -> -
This means:
  - I is in the word but not in the third position.
  - T is in the word but not in the fifth position.
  - M, O, S are absent (not in the word).

So, we now know the secret word DOES contain I and T, and does NOT contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S.

Letters eliminated (absent): C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S.
Letters that must be present: I and T.

Also, from the positions:
  In ""moist"", I was in position 3 (third letter) but it's not correct there. So in the secret word, I cannot be in position 3.
  T was in position 5 (last letter) but it's wrong position. So T is in the word but not at the end.

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not use any eliminated letters: [C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S]
  - Must include I and T (and three other new letters).
  - The I cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 5.

Let's think of common letters we haven't tried: 
We have tried: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. 
Available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and the letters we know are present (I and T).

We know the word has I and T. So our next guess must include I and T, but place them in positions that are allowed.

We also want to maximize information by using new letters.

Possible positions for I: It can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).
Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so T can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

Given that, let's try to form words:

Let's consider words that have I and T and three other new letters.

Some ideas:

- ""LIGHT"": but we know H is available? We haven't tried H. But ""LIGHT"" has L,I,G,H,T. 
  Positions: L(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
  However, T is in position 5, which is forbidden by feedback (T not in position 5). So invalid.

- ""FITLY"": F,I,T,L,Y. 
  Positions: F(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), Y(5)
  T is in position 3 (which is allowed), I in position 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in 3 but 2 is fine). 
  Letters: F,I,T,L,Y. None are eliminated. So this is a candidate.

- ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y. 
  Positions: P(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), Y(5)
  Same as above: I is in position 2, T in position 3 (both allowed).

- ""DITTY"": D,I,T,T,Y -> has duplicate T. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't forbid it. 
  However, we don't have any feedback indicating duplicates so far. But we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize letter coverage.

- ""BIGHT"": B,I,G,H,T. T would be in position 5 -> invalid.

- ""WIGHT"": W,I,G,H,T. T in position 5 -> invalid.

- ""TULIP"": T,U,L,I,P. 
  Positions: T(1), U(2), L(3), I(4), P(5)
  T is in position 1 (allowed), I is in position 4 (allowed, since not position 3).
  This uses T,U,L,I,P, all new letters.

Another possibility: ""GUILT"". But U is available? Yes. 
G,U,I,L,T: positions G(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),T(5). 
But I is in position 3 -> not allowed! Because we know I cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback). So invalid.

Similarly, ""QUILT"" would also put I in position 3.

""TIDAL"": but A is eliminated (from first guess).

""DAILY"": D,A,I,L,Y -> A is eliminated? Wait, A is in the eliminated list (from ""crane""). So invalid.

So let's stick with words that avoid position 3 for I and position 5 for T.

Consider ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y -> but S is eliminated (from ""moist""). So invalid.

""GUIDE"": G,U,I,D,E -> E is eliminated.

So back to ""TULIP"": T(1), U(2), L(3), I(4), P(5). 
This satisfies: T not in 5, I not in 3. And uses new letters T,U,L,I,P.

Another good one: ""PITIFUL"" is 7 letters, too long.

We need 5 letters.

""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D. But no T? We must include T because we know T is in the word. So every guess must include the known present letters until we find their positions.

So we must include I and T.

Therefore, ""TULIP"" looks good: 
  T is at position 1 (allowed)
  I (known present) is at position 4 (allowed because it's not position 3)
  Letters: T,U,L,I,P. None are in the eliminated list.

We can also consider ""DUPLY"" but that might not be a common word.

""TULIP"" is a valid English word (meaning a flower).

Another option: ""GLITZ"": G,L,I,T,Z. 
Positions: G(1), L(2), I(3), T(4), Z(5). 
But we cannot put I in position 3 -> invalid.

Alternatively, ""TWIXT"" has two T's and may not be common.

""BIFID"": might not be common.

So ""TULIP"" seems a strong candidate.

But note: in ""TULIP"", we have T at position 1 and I at position 4. We don't know if that's correct but it fits the constraints.

Another possibility: ""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T. But N is eliminated (from ""crane"") -> invalid.

""PUTTI"": duplicate T and I? Not ideal.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TULIP"".

Based on the feedback:

1. **Eliminated letters (absent):** C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1) and M, O, S (from Guess 2). 
2. **Confirmed present letters:** 
   - `I` is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2: `moist` → I(-)).
   - `T` is in the word but not in position 5 (from Guess 2: `moist` → T(-)).
3. **Constraints for next guess:**
   - Must include `I` and `T`.
   - `I` cannot be in position 3.
   - `T` cannot be in position 5.
   - Avoid eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

I considered words containing `I` and `T` with unused common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, Y). After evaluating options:
- **""TULIP""** was chosen because:
  - It places `T` in position 1 (allowed) and `I` in position 4 (allowed, as it avoids position 3).
  - Uses new letters (T, U, L, I, P) to maximize information.
  - Is a valid English word (referring to the flower).

If this feedback shows more letters, we can narrow down the secret word faster.

<guess>tulip</guess>",tulip,"We have feedback from two guesses.
First guess ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So these letters are not in the secret word at all.
Second guess ""moist"": 
  M -> x, O -> x, I -> -, S -> x, T -> -
This means:
  - I is in the word but not in the third position.
  - T is in the word but not in the fifth position.
  - M, O, S are absent (not in the word).

So, we now know the secret word DOES contain I and T, and does NOT contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S.

Letters eliminated (absent): C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S.
Letters that must be present: I and T.

Also, from the positions:
  In ""moist"", I was in position 3 (third letter) but it's not correct there. So in the secret word, I cannot be in position 3.
  T was in position 5 (last letter) but it's wrong position. So T is in the word but not at the end.

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not use any eliminated letters: [C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S]
  - Must include I and T (and three other new letters).
  - The I cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 5.

Let's think of common letters we haven't tried: 
We have tried: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. 
Available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and the letters we know are present (I and T).

We know the word has I and T. So our next guess must include I and T, but place them in positions that are allowed.

We also want to maximize information by using new letters.

Possible positions for I: It can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).
