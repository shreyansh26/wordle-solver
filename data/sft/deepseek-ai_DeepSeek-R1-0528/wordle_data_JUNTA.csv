We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was third position in the guess).
 - N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was fourth position).
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 (since in our guess they were at 3 and 4 and those are wrong).
 - The word does not contain C, R, or E.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
 Our guess: C R A N E
 Positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E.

 So A cannot be at position 3, and N cannot be at position 4.

 Also, note that the word has 5 letters.

 We need to choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Actually, for A: it is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

 We also note that A and N are present somewhere else.

 We want to try a word that has A and N, plus three other letters that are not C, R, E and that might be common.

 We should avoid using letters that we know are absent: C, R, E.

 Let's think of words that include A and N. We can try to put A and N in different positions to test.

 But note: the position of A and N in the new guess might help us figure out where they are.

 For example, we can put A in a different position (say 1, 2, or 5) and N in a different position (say 1, 2, 3, or 5).

 We also want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, etc.

 Considering: we know that the word has A and N, and we have 3 more letters to guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Contains A and N.
 - Uses three new common letters (excluding C, R, E).

 Possible words: ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", ""GIANT"", ""SNAKE"", ""MANGO"", etc.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? Not yet.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that places A and N in positions that are not the ones they were in (to avoid the same mistake) and also uses new letters.

 Example: 
 - ""STAND"": 
   - S, T, A, N, D. 
   This includes A at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A) and N at position 4 (which we know is wrong for N) — so that would not change the positions? 
   Actually, we don't know if the secret word has A at position 3? The previous feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would expect a '-' if it's wrong? But we already know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put A at 3 again if we want to find where it is.

 We need to place A not at position 3 and N not at position 4.

 So in the new guess, we should try A at a different position (1,2,4,5) and N at a different position (1,2,3,5). 

 Also, we want to avoid repeating the same letters that we haven't yet cleared? For example, we don't know about S, T, etc.

 Consider ""STAND"":
   A is at position 3 -> we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should not put A at 3. Therefore, ""STAND"" is not a good choice because it puts A at 3.

 How about ""SNAIL""? 
   S, N, A, I, L.
   A is at position 3? -> same problem.

 How about ""ADMIN""? 
   A at 1, D, M, I, N at 5? 
   But note: N is at position 5 -> which is not position 4? Yeah, so that's okay? 
   Also, A is at position 1 -> which is new.

 So ""ADMIN"": 
   - A at position 1: if the secret word has A at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get '-' or 'x'. 
   - N at position 5: similarly.

 But note: the previous feedback tells us that A is in the word (so we know it's somewhere) and N is in the word.

 Alternatively, what about ""PLAIN""? 
   P, L, A, I, N -> A at position 3 again -> avoid.

 How about ""DINKA""? 
   D, I, N, K, A -> N at 3 (which is new) and A at 5 (new) — so this is good? But not a common word? Actually, ""DINKA"" might be proper? We need valid English words.

 Another idea: ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T -> A at position 2, which is new; N at position 4 — we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4? Actually, no: the previous feedback said that N was at position 4 and that was incorrect. But that doesn't mean it can't be at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for N in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at the position we guessed (4). So we must avoid putting N at position 4 again? Actually, we can put it again? But if we know that position 4 is not N, then why test again? We want to test N at a different position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position 4 again because we already know that it isn't there. Similarly for A at position 3.

 So ""PAINT"":
   A at position 2 -> new
   N at position 4 -> but we know N is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback told us that the position for N is wrong, meaning that the N in our first guess was in position 4 and that position was incorrect. So in the secret word, the letter at position 4 is not N, therefore we shouldn't put N at position 4 again because it will again be wrong. We want to test N in a new position to see if we can find the right one.

 Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because it puts N in position 4.

 How about ""PANIC""?
   P, A, N, I, C -> but C is absent? We know C is not in the word -> so we cannot use C.

 How about ""MANIA""? 
   M, A, N, I, A -> that has duplicate A? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't tell us anything about duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback may mark each occurrence appropriately.

 But we need a word without C, R, E.

 ""MANIA"": 
   A: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5.

 But note: we know that A cannot be at position 3? So putting A at 2 and 5? That's okay, but we have two A's? 

 However, we don't know if the word has two A's? The feedback from the first guess had only one A and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word has only one A, then our two A's might be problematic? But it's allowed to guess words with duplicate letters even if the word doesn't have duplicates? The rules don't forbid it.

 But in this case, we are not sure. Also, we don't know if the word has M, I.

 However, let me pick a word without duplicate and without forbidden letters. 

 How about ""BALM""? But that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 Think of: ""PLAIN"" has A at position 3 -> avoid.

 ""CANAL"" has C and A at 3? -> C is absent and A at 3 is bad.

 ""SALAD""? -> duplicate A? Also, A is at position 2 and 4? We can test.

 But let's try to avoid duplicates for now? Because they complicate the feedback.

 Another word: ""DAUNT""?
   D at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
   But we know N is not at position 4? So why put N at position 4? It will definitely not be correct? And we already know that.

 We should avoid known incorrect position for a given letter? So placing N at 4 again would be a waste of a letter position? We want to use that position to test a new letter? So better to put N in a position we haven't tested? 

 Since the word has 5 positions and N is not at position 4, we should test it in positions 1,2,3,5.

 Similarly, A is not at position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 for A.

 Therefore, let me look for words that:
   Include A and N, 
   Do not include C, R, E,
   Place A in one of {1,2,4,5} and N in one of {1,2,3,5},
   And the word should be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"": has A at 4? No: P,L,A at 3? -> avoid A at 3.
   ""STAND"": S,T,A at 3? -> avoid.

   ""NASTY"": 
      N at position 1 -> we can test that.
      A at position 2 -> new.
      S,T,Y: new letters.
      So: N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Also, ""NASTY"" avoids the positions we know: 
      A is not at 3? Check: yes, it's at 2 -> good.
      N is not at 4? It's at 1 -> good.

   And it has new letters: S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BALSA"": B,A,L,S,A -> but duplicate A? 
   A at 2 and 5? And we don't want that.

 Another idea: ""TIDAL""? 
   T at 1, I at 2, D at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> that puts A at position 4 (new) and doesn't include N? But we need to include N.

 We must include both A and N? Because we know they are present.

 What words have both A and N? 

 Let's try: ""ADMIN"" -> we thought of earlier: 
   A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5 -> that's acceptable? Yes.

 But is ""ADMIN"" a valid word? Yes, meaning administration.

 However, note that we have used: A, D, M, I, N. None of these are the forbidden ones? And A at 1 and N at 5.

 Alternatively, ""SPAIN"": 
   S, P, A, I, N -> A at 3? -> avoid position 3.

 ""PAINS""? 
   P, A, I, N, S -> A at position 2 and N at position 4? But we know N is not at 4 -> so avoid.

 ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A at 2, N at 4? -> avoid N at 4.

 So ""NASTY"" seems good: N at 1, A at 2 -> both are in new positions.

 Therefore, let me go with ""NASTY"".

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"": 
   D, A, I, S, Y -> no N. But we must include N? Wait, we know from the first guess that A and N are present? Yes, because we got '-' for A and N.

 So we have to include both? Otherwise, if we make a guess without one of them, then we won't get information? But we already know they are present? Actually, we don't have to include them? But if we don't include them, we can't find their positions.

 However, the feedback will tell us: 
   If we don't include A and the secret word has A, then we get feedback for the letters we guess. But we already know A is present? Actually, that doesn't change. We don't need to always include the known letters? We can use a word without A to test other letters? But then we risk being inefficient? 

 But considering we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover the known present letters to pin down their positions? 

 Therefore, I think it's wise to include both A and N in the next guess.

 So ""NASTY"" is a good choice: 
   It places N at position 1 (which is a new position) and A at position 2 (new).
   It introduces S, T, Y.

 We hope that one of these positions is correct? Or at least we'll get new information.

 So I will guess ""NASTY"".

<guess>nasty</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)), we can derive the following:
1. The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
2. The letter A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
3. The letter N is in the secret word but not in position 4.

Therefore:
- The new guess must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- A must be placed in a position that isn't 3 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- N must be placed in a position that isn't 4 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The guess must avoid C, R, and E entirely.

We choose ""NASTY"" for the second guess because:
- It places N in position 1 (a new position to test) and A in position 2 (a new position).
- It introduces three new common letters (S, T, Y) to gather additional feedback.
- It adheres to all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing A and N in unprobed positions.

New attempt:<guess>nasty</guess>",nasty,"We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was third position in the guess).
 - N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was fourth position).
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 (since in our guess they were at 3 and 4 and those are wrong).
 - The word does not contain C, R, or E.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
 Our guess: C R A N E
 Positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E.

 So A cannot be at position 3, and N cannot be at position 4.

 Also, note that the word has 5 letters.

 We need to choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Actually, for A: it is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

 We also note that A and N are present somewhere else.

 We want to try a word that has A and N, plus three other letters that are not C, R, E and that might be common.

 We should avoid using letters that we know are absent: C, R, E.

 Let's think of words that include A and N. We can try to put A and N in different positions to test.

 But note: the position of A and N in the new guess might help us figure out where they are.

 For example, we can put A in a different position (say 1, 2, or 5) and N in a different position (say 1, 2, 3, or 5).

 We also want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, etc.

 Considering: we know that the word has A and N, and we have 3 more letters to guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Contains A and N.
 - Uses three new common letters (excluding C, R, E).

 Possible words: ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", ""GIANT"", ""SNAKE"", ""MANGO"", etc.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? Not yet.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that places A and N in positions that are not the ones they were in (to avoid the same mistake) and also uses new letters.

 Example: 
 - ""STAND"": 
   - S, T, A, N, D. 
   This includes A at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A) and N at position 4 (which we know is wrong for N) — so that would not change the positions? 
   Actually, we don't know if the secret word has A at position 3? The previous feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would expect a '-' if it's wrong? But we already know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put A at 3 again if we want to find where it is.

 We need to place A not at position 3 and N not at position 4.

 So in the new guess, we should try A at a different position (1,2,4,5) and N at a different position (1,2,3,5). 

 Also, we want to avoid repeating the same letters that we haven't yet cleared? For example, we don't know about S, T, etc.

 Consider ""STAND"":
   A is at position 3 -> we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should not put A at 3. Therefore, ""STAND"" is not a good choice because it puts A at 3.

 How about ""SNAIL""? 
   S, N, A, I, L.
   A is at position 3? -> same problem.

 How about ""ADMIN""? 
   A at 1, D, M, I, N at 5? 
   But note: N is at position 5 -> which is not position 4? Yeah, so that's okay? 
   Also, A is at position 1 -> which is new.

 So ""ADMIN"": 
   - A at position 1: if the secret word has A at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get '-' or 'x'. 
   - N at position 5: similarly.

 But note: the previous feedback tells us that A is in the word (so we know it's somewhere) and N is in the word.

But if we know that position 4 is not N, then why test again? We want to test N at a different position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position 4 again because we already know that it isn't there. Similarly for A at position 3.

 So ""PAINT"":
   A at position 2 -> new
   N at position 4 -> but we know N is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback told us that the position for N is wrong, meaning that the N in our first guess was in position 4 and that position was incorrect. So in the secret word, the letter at position 4 is not N, therefore we shouldn't put N at position 4 again because it will again be wrong. We want to test N in a new position to see if we can find the right one.

 Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because it puts N in position 4.

 How about ""PANIC""?

 How about ""MANIA""?

 We should avoid known incorrect position for a given letter? So placing N at 4 again would be a waste of a letter position? We want to use that position to test a new letter? So better to put N in a position we haven't tested? 

 Since the word has 5 positions and N is not at position 4, we should test it in positions 1,2,3,5.

 Similarly, A is not at position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 for A.

 Therefore, let me look for words that:
   Include A and N, 
   Do not include C, R, E,
   Place A in one of {1,2,4,5} and N in one of {1,2,3,5},
   And the word should be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"": has A at 4? No: P,L,A at 3? -> avoid A at 3.
   ""STAND"": S,T,A at 3? -> avoid.

   ""NASTY"": 
      N at position 1 -> we can test that.
      A at position 2 -> new.
      S,T,Y: new letters.
      So: N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Also, ""NASTY"" avoids the positions we know: 
      A is not at 3? Check: yes, it's at 2 -> good.
      N is not at 4? It's at 1 -> good.

   And it has new letters: S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BALSA"": B,A,L,S,A -> but duplicate A? 
   A at 2 and 5? And we don't want that.

 Another idea: ""TIDAL""? 
   T at 1, I at 2, D at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> that puts A at position 4 (new) and doesn't include N? But we need to include N.

 We must include both A and N? Because we know they are present.

 What words have both A and N? 

 Let's try: ""ADMIN"" -> we thought of earlier: 
   A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5 -> that's acceptable? Yes.

 But is ""ADMIN"" a valid word? Yes, meaning administration.

 However, note that we have used: A, D, M, I, N. None of these are the forbidden ones? And A at 1 and N at 5.

 Alternatively, ""SPAIN"": 
   S, P, A, I, N -> A at 3? -> avoid position 3.

 ""PAINS""? 
   P, A, I, N, S -> A at position 2 and N at position 4? But we know N is not at 4 -> so avoid.

 ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A at 2, N at 4? -> avoid N at 4.

 So ""NASTY"" seems good: N at 1, A at 2 -> both are in new positions.

 Therefore, let me go with ""NASTY"".

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"": 
   D, A, I, S, Y -> no N. But we must include N? Wait, we know from the first guess that A and N are present? Yes, because we got '-' for A and N.

 So we have to include both? Otherwise, if we make a guess without one of them, then we won't get information? But we already know they are present? Actually, we don't have to include them? But if we don't include them, we can't find their positions.

 However, the feedback will tell us: 
   If we don't include A and the secret word has A, then we get feedback for the letters we guess. But we already know A is present? Actually, that doesn't change. We don't need to always include the known letters? We can use a word without A to test other letters? But then we risk being inefficient? 

 But considering we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover the known present letters to pin down their positions? 

 Therefore, I think it's wise to include both A and N in the next guess.

 So ""NASTY"" is a good choice: 
   It places N at position 1 (which is a new position) and A at position 2 (new).
   It introduces S, T, Y.

 We hope that one of these positions is correct? Or at least we'll get new information.

 So I will guess ""NASTY"".

<guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)), we can derive the following:
1. The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
2. The letter A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
3. The letter N is in the secret word but not in position 4.

Therefore:
- The new guess must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- A must be placed in a position that isn't 3 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- N must be placed in a position that isn't 4 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The guess must avoid C, R, and E entirely.

We choose ""NASTY"" for the second guess because:
- It places N in position 1 (a new position to test) and A in position 2 (a new position).
- It introduces three new common letters (S, T, Y) to gather additional feedback.
- It adheres to all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing A and N in unprobed positions.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,JUNTA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was third position in the guess).
 - N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was fourth position).
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 (since in our guess they were at 3 and 4 and those are wrong).
 - The word does not contain C, R, or E.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
 Our guess: C R A N E
 Positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E.

 So A cannot be at position 3, and N cannot be at position 4.

 Also, note that the word has 5 letters.

 We need to choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Actually, for A: it is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

 We also note that A and N are present somewhere else.

 We want to try a word that has A and N, plus three other letters that are not C, R, E and that might be common.

 We should avoid using letters that we know are absent: C, R, E.

 Let's think of words that include A and N. We can try to put A and N in different positions to test.

 But note: the position of A and N in the new guess might help us figure out where they are.

 For example, we can put A in a different position (say 1, 2, or 5) and N in a different position (say 1, 2, 3, or 5).

 We also want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, etc.

 Considering: we know that the word has A and N, and we have 3 more letters to guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Contains A and N.
 - Uses three new common letters (excluding C, R, E).

 Possible words: ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", ""GIANT"", ""SNAKE"", ""MANGO"", etc.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? Not yet.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that places A and N in positions that are not the ones they were in (to avoid the same mistake) and also uses new letters.

 Example: 
 - ""STAND"": 
   - S, T, A, N, D. 
   This includes A at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A) and N at position 4 (which we know is wrong for N) — so that would not change the positions? 
   Actually, we don't know if the secret word has A at position 3? The previous feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would expect a '-' if it's wrong? But we already know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put A at 3 again if we want to find where it is.

 We need to place A not at position 3 and N not at position 4.

 So in the new guess, we should try A at a different position (1,2,4,5) and N at a different position (1,2,3,5). 

 Also, we want to avoid repeating the same letters that we haven't yet cleared? For example, we don't know about S, T, etc.

 Consider ""STAND"":
   A is at position 3 -> we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should not put A at 3. Therefore, ""STAND"" is not a good choice because it puts A at 3.

 How about ""SNAIL""? 
   S, N, A, I, L.
   A is at position 3? -> same problem.

 How about ""ADMIN""? 
   A at 1, D, M, I, N at 5? 
   But note: N is at position 5 -> which is not position 4? Yeah, so that's okay? 
   Also, A is at position 1 -> which is new.

 So ""ADMIN"": 
   - A at position 1: if the secret word has A at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get '-' or 'x'. 
   - N at position 5: similarly.

 But note: the previous feedback tells us that A is in the word (so we know it's somewhere) and N is in the word.

 Alternatively, what about ""PLAIN""? 
   P, L, A, I, N -> A at position 3 again -> avoid.

 How about ""DINKA""? 
   D, I, N, K, A -> N at 3 (which is new) and A at 5 (new) — so this is good? But not a common word? Actually, ""DINKA"" might be proper? We need valid English words.

 Another idea: ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T -> A at position 2, which is new; N at position 4 — we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4? Actually, no: the previous feedback said that N was at position 4 and that was incorrect. But that doesn't mean it can't be at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for N in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at the position we guessed (4). So we must avoid putting N at position 4 again? Actually, we can put it again? But if we know that position 4 is not N, then why test again? We want to test N at a different position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position 4 again because we already know that it isn't there. Similarly for A at position 3.

 So ""PAINT"":
   A at position 2 -> new
   N at position 4 -> but we know N is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback told us that the position for N is wrong, meaning that the N in our first guess was in position 4 and that position was incorrect. So in the secret word, the letter at position 4 is not N, therefore we shouldn't put N at position 4 again because it will again be wrong. We want to test N in a new position to see if we can find the right one.

 Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because it puts N in position 4.

 How about ""PANIC""?
   P, A, N, I, C -> but C is absent? We know C is not in the word -> so we cannot use C.

 How about ""MANIA""? 
   M, A, N, I, A -> that has duplicate A? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't tell us anything about duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback may mark each occurrence appropriately.

 But we need a word without C, R, E.

 ""MANIA"": 
   A: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5.

 But note: we know that A cannot be at position 3? So putting A at 2 and 5? That's okay, but we have two A's? 

 However, we don't know if the word has two A's? The feedback from the first guess had only one A and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word has only one A, then our two A's might be problematic? But it's allowed to guess words with duplicate letters even if the word doesn't have duplicates? The rules don't forbid it.

 But in this case, we are not sure. Also, we don't know if the word has M, I.

 However, let me pick a word without duplicate and without forbidden letters. 

 How about ""BALM""? But that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 Think of: ""PLAIN"" has A at position 3 -> avoid.

 ""CANAL"" has C and A at 3? -> C is absent and A at 3 is bad.

 ""SALAD""? -> duplicate A? Also, A is at position 2 and 4? We can test.

 But let's try to avoid duplicates for now? Because they complicate the feedback.

 Another word: ""DAUNT""?
   D at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
   But we know N is not at position 4? So why put N at position 4? It will definitely not be correct? And we already know that.

 We should avoid known incorrect position for a given letter? So placing N at 4 again would be a waste of a letter position? We want to use that position to test a new letter? So better to put N in a position we haven't tested? 

 Since the word has 5 positions and N is not at position 4, we should test it in positions 1,2,3,5.

 Similarly, A is not at position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 for A.

 Therefore, let me look for words that:
   Include A and N, 
   Do not include C, R, E,
   Place A in one of {1,2,4,5} and N in one of {1,2,3,5},
   And the word should be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"": has A at 4? No: P,L,A at 3? -> avoid A at 3.
   ""STAND"": S,T,A at 3? -> avoid.

   ""NASTY"": 
      N at position 1 -> we can test that.
      A at position 2 -> new.
      S,T,Y: new letters.
      So: N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Also, ""NASTY"" avoids the positions we know: 
      A is not at 3? Check: yes, it's at 2 -> good.
      N is not at 4? It's at 1 -> good.

   And it has new letters: S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BALSA"": B,A,L,S,A -> but duplicate A? 
   A at 2 and 5? And we don't want that.

 Another idea: ""TIDAL""? 
   T at 1, I at 2, D at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> that puts A at position 4 (new) and doesn't include N? But we need to include N.

 We must include both A and N? Because we know they are present.

 What words have both A and N? 

 Let's try: ""ADMIN"" -> we thought of earlier: 
   A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5 -> that's acceptable? Yes.

 But is ""ADMIN"" a valid word? Yes, meaning administration.

 However, note that we have used: A, D, M, I, N. None of these are the forbidden ones? And A at 1 and N at 5.

 Alternatively, ""SPAIN"": 
   S, P, A, I, N -> A at 3? -> avoid position 3.

 ""PAINS""? 
   P, A, I, N, S -> A at position 2 and N at position 4? But we know N is not at 4 -> so avoid.

 ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A at 2, N at 4? -> avoid N at 4.

 So ""NASTY"" seems good: N at 1, A at 2 -> both are in new positions.

 Therefore, let me go with ""NASTY"".

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"": 
   D, A, I, S, Y -> no N. But we must include N? Wait, we know from the first guess that A and N are present? Yes, because we got '-' for A and N.

 So we have to include both? Otherwise, if we make a guess without one of them, then we won't get information? But we already know they are present? Actually, we don't have to include them? But if we don't include them, we can't find their positions.

 However, the feedback will tell us:

We don't need to always include the known letters? We can use a word without A to test other letters? But then we risk being inefficient? 

 But considering we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover the known present letters to pin down their positions? 

 Therefore, I think it's wise to include both A and N in the next guess.

 So ""NASTY"" is a good choice: 
   It places N at position 1 (which is a new position) and A at position 2 (new).
   It introduces S, T, Y.

 We hope that one of these positions is correct? Or at least we'll get new information.

 So I will guess ""NASTY"".

<guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)), we can derive the following:
1. The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word.

3. The letter N is in the secret word but not in position 4.

Therefore:
- The new guess must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- A must be placed in a position that isn't 3 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- N must be placed in a position that isn't 4 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The guess must avoid C, R, and E entirely.

Actually, the feedback told us that the position for N is wrong, meaning that the N in our first guess was in position 4 and that position was incorrect. So in the secret word, the letter at position 4 is not N, therefore we shouldn\'t put N at position 4 again because it will again be wrong. We want to test N in a new position to see if we can find the right one.\n\n Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because it puts N in position 4.\n\n How about ""PANIC""?\n   P, A, N, I, C -> but C is absent? We know C is not in the word -> so we cannot use C.\n\n How about ""MANIA""? \n   M, A, N, I, A -> that has duplicate A? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us anything about duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback may mark each occurrence appropriately.\n\n But we need a word without C, R, E.\n\n ""MANIA"": \n   A: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5.\n\n But note: we know that A cannot be at position 3? So putting A at 2 and 5? That\'s okay, but we have two A\'s? \n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? The feedback from the first guess had only one A and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word has only one A, then our two A\'s might be problematic? But it\'s allowed to guess words with duplicate letters even if the word doesn\'t have duplicates? The rules don\'t forbid it.\n\n But in this case, we are not sure. Also, we don\'t know if the word has M, I.\n\n However, let me pick a word without duplicate and without forbidden letters. \n\n How about ""BALM""? But that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n Think of: ""PLAIN"" has A at position 3 -> avoid.\n\n ""CANAL"" has C and A at 3? -> C is absent and A at 3 is bad.\n\n ""SALAD""? -> duplicate A? Also, A is at position 2 and 4? We can test.\n\n But let\'s try to avoid duplicates for now? Because they complicate the feedback.\n\n Another word: ""DAUNT""?\n   D at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n   But we know N is not at position 4? So why put N at position 4? It will definitely not be correct? And we already know that.\n\n We should avoid known incorrect position for a given letter? So placing N at 4 again would be a waste of a letter position? We want to use that position to test a new letter? So better to put N in a position we haven\'t tested? \n\n Since the word has 5 positions and N is not at position 4, we should test it in positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n Similarly, A is not at position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 for A.\n\n Therefore, let me look for words that:\n   Include A and N, \n   Do not include C, R, E,\n   Place A in one of {1,2,4,5} and N in one of {1,2,3,5},\n   And the word should be valid.\n\n Common words: \n   ""PLANT"": has A at 4? No: P,L,A at 3? -> avoid A at 3.\n   ""STAND"": S,T,A at 3? -> avoid.\n\n   ""NASTY"": \n      N at position 1 -> we can test that.\n      A at position 2 -> new.\n      S,T,Y: new letters.\n      So: N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\n   Also, ""NASTY"" avoids the positions we know: \n      A is not at 3? Check: yes, it\'s at 2 -> good.\n      N is not at 4? It\'s at 1 -> good.\n\n   And it has new letters: S, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""BALSA"": B,A,L,S,A -> but duplicate A? \n   A at 2 and 5? And we don\'t want that.\n\n Another idea: ""TIDAL""? \n   T at 1, I at 2, D at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> that puts A at position 4 (new) and doesn\'t include N? But we need to include N.\n\n We must include both A and N? Because we know they are present.\n\n What words have both A and N? \n\n Let\'s try: ""ADMIN"" -> we thought of earlier: \n   A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5 -> that\'s acceptable? Yes.\n\n But is ""ADMIN"" a valid word? Yes, meaning administration.\n\n However, note that we have used: A, D, M, I, N. None of these are the forbidden ones? And A at 1 and N at 5.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPAIN"": \n   S, P, A, I, N -> A at 3? -> avoid position 3.\n\n ""PAINS""? \n   P, A, I, N, S -> A at position 2 and N at position 4? But we know N is not at 4 -> so avoid.\n\n ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A at 2, N at 4? -> avoid N at 4.\n\n So ""NASTY"" seems good: N at 1, A at 2 -> both are in new positions.\n\n Therefore, let me go with ""NASTY"".\n\n Alternatively, ""DAISY"": \n   D, A, I, S, Y -> no N. But we must include N? Wait, we know from the first guess that A and N are present? Yes, because we got \'-\' for A and N.\n\n So we have to include both? Otherwise, if we make a guess without one of them, then we won\'t get information? But we already know they are present? Actually, we don\'t have to include them? But if we don\'t include them, we can\'t find their positions.\n\n However, the feedback will tell us: \n   If we don\'t include A and the secret word has A, then we get feedback for the letters we guess. But we already know A is present? Actually, that doesn\'t change. We don\'t need to always include the known letters? We can use a word without A to test other letters? But then we risk being inefficient? \n\n But considering we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover the known present letters to pin down their positions? \n\n Therefore, I think it\'s wise to include both A and N in the next guess.\n\n So ""NASTY"" is a good choice: \n   It places N at position 1 (which is a new position) and A at position 2 (new).\n   It introduces S, T, Y.\n\n We hope that one of these positions is correct? Or at least we\'ll get new information.\n\n So I will guess ""NASTY"".\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)), we can derive the following:\n1. The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word.\n2. The letter A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n3. The letter N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n\nTherefore:\n- The new guess must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).\n- A must be placed in a position that isn\'t 3 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- N must be placed in a position that isn\'t 4 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The guess must avoid C, R, and E entirely.\n\nWe choose ""NASTY"" for the second guess because:\n- It places N in position 1 (a new position to test) and A in position 2 (a new position).\n- It introduces three new common letters (S, T, Y) to gather additional feedback.\n- It adheres to all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing A and N in unprobed positions.\n\nNew attempt:\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:
First guess (""crane""):
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Second guess (""nasty""):
  N(-), A(-), S(x), T(✓), Y(x)

Interpretation:
1. From the first guess, we know:
   - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
   - C, R, E are not in the word.

2. From the second guess (""nasty""):
   - N(-): N is in the word but not at position 1.
   - A(-): A is in the word but not at position 2.
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - T(✓): T is in the word and at position 4. (Because in ""nasty"", T is the fourth letter.)
   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absolute truths:
  - T is at position 4. (So the secret word has T as its fourth letter.)
  - The word contains A and N (from first guess, confirmed again by presence but wrong position in second guess).
  - S and Y are absent, so we can eliminate them.
  - C, R, E are absent (previously known).

- Positions we know are incorrect for A: position 3 (from first guess) and position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A can only be in positions 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by T? Actually, note: positions are independent. Position 4 is taken by T, so A cannot be at position 4? Actually, we don't know if T is the only letter? But the secret word is 5 letters. We know:
    Position 1: not N (from second guess: N(-) at pos1)
    Position 2: not A (from second guess: A(-) at pos2)
    Position 3: not A (from first guess) -> but we haven't tested A at position 3 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 3 from the first guess? Yes.
    Position 4: confirmed T (from T(✓) at pos4)
    Position 5: we don't know.

So for A: it must be either in position 1 or position 5? Why?
Because positions:
  - Position 3: from first guess, we know A is not there.
  - Position 2: from second guess, we know A is not there.
  - Position 4: now we know it is T, so A cannot be at position 4 either? Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, for N:
  We know:
    - From first guess: N is not at position 4? Actually, that was the position we guessed (in CRANE, N was in position 4). But note: now position 4 is T, so it's definitely not N? So N cannot be at position 4? But we already knew that? 
    - From second guess: N is not at position 1 (because we guessed N at pos1 and got '-')
    - What about other positions?
        Position 2: we don't know? We haven't tested N at position 2? But in the second guess, we had A at position 2? So that spot was taken by A? We haven't tested N at 2? 
        Similarly, position 3: we haven't tested? 
        Position 5: we haven't tested?

Therefore, N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions and we know:
  - Position 4 is T (fixed).
  - N is in one of the other positions? 
  - We know it's not at pos1 (from second guess) and not at pos4? So positions 2, 3, or 5.

But note: we also have A that is either at position 1 or 5? So position 1 might be A? Or position 5? And N must be in 2,3,or5? But if A is at position 5, then N can be at 2 or 3? And if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or5? 

Also, we have two additional letters? Actually, the word must be made of:
   Letters: A, N, T, and two more letters that we don't know? Because we don't have full information? 

But we know the word has 5 letters? And we know:
   - Contains A, N, T (and T is at position 4).
   - We know that from first and second guesses, we only have these three letters? But there must be two more.

We also know that the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, Y.

So what letters are possible? We've only used: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and N, A, S, T, Y (second guess). So absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y.

Therefore, available letters: all English letters except C, R, E, S, Y? Also, we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? But we can use any that make a valid word.

Now, let's form a possible word that:
   - Has T at position 4.
   - Contains A and N.
   - Places A at either position 1 or 5? Because we know it's not in 2,3,4? And we know 4 is T.
   - Places N in position 2, 3, or 5? But note: if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5? So if A is at position 5, N must be at 2 or 3? Similarly, if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or 5? (but not always because we have 5 positions? And we have two other letters.)

We also need two more letters. So we'll choose common letters? Or letters that we haven't tested to get more information.

But we already have T at 4, so we know that letter? So let's focus on the other positions.

Possible structures:
Option 1: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A? 
   Then the word: A ? ? T ? 
   With N in 2,3, or5? And the two other letters?

Option 2: A at position 5? Then the word: ? ? ? T A
   With N in 2,3? (because if in 5, then conflict? Actually, but then N cannot be at 5 if A is there? And we cannot have two letters?) So if A at 5, N must be in 2 or 3.

Now, let's try to think of words that fit:

Case A at pos1? 
   Words: A _ _ T _
   With N in the word either at position 2, 3, or the last (5th)? 
   Also, remember we have two other letters? 

   Examples: 
     ANTIC? But contains I and C? C is forbidden? So not.
     ANKLE? But E is forbidden? 
     ANVIL? V and I? 
     ALPHA? But P and H? And doesn't have N? Wait, we have N in the word? But if N is at 3? 
     Actually: 
        If N at position 2: A N _ T ... words: ANTED (E forbidden), ANTSY (S and Y forbidden) -> invalid.
        If N at position 3: A _ N T ... words: COUNT? But O, U, N? But N is at 3? But also: COUNT has C? forbidden? 
        How about ""AUNT"": but 4 letters? 
        How about ""ADAPT""? 
          A D A P T? But duplicate A? And P and D? And we don't know if allowed? Also, A at 1 and N at? There is no N? So we need N? 
        But we know the word has N? So ""ADAPT"" doesn't contain N? Then invalid? 

   Alternatively? 
     ""ANKHS""? not common.

   What about ""MANTA"": 
     M A N T A? But M is possible? And A at 1? No: we start with A? 
     Actually: if A at pos1, then words starting with A? 

   How about ""ABOUT"": 
      A B O U T? But O,U,B? And no N? So not.

   How about ""AGENT"": 
      A G E N T? But E is forbidden? 

   How about ""ALIGN"": 
      A L I G N? 
          Position1: A
          Position4: T? Actually no: we need position4 to be T? So our word structure must have T at position4? 
          But ""ALIGN"" has no letter at position4? It has G? So position4 is G? We need T? 

   So we must have T at position4? 

   Word: A B C T D? 

   Let me try: ""ADAPT"" doesn't have N? 
              ""ADMIT"": A D M I T? 
                  But T is at position5? Not at position4? So we need to shift:
                  For a word ADMIT: 
                    Pos1: A, Pos2: D, Pos3: M, Pos4: I, Pos5: T? Doesn't have N? 

   How about ""ADULT"": 
        A D U L T? T at 5? not 4? And no N? 

   Another word: ""ACTIN"": 
        A C T I N? But C and T: T is at 3? Not at 4? And C forbidden? 

   So maybe words starting with A and having T at position4? And containing N? 

   Example: ""ADMIN"" -> 
        A D M I N? -> Positions: 
          Pos1: A
          Pos2: D
          Pos3: M
          Pos4: I? But we need T? 

   So we need T at position4? 

   How about ""AORTA""? 
        A O R T A? Doesn't have N? And R forbidden? 

   How about ""ANITA""? 
        A N I T A? 
          Then: 
             Pos1: A? 
             Pos2: N? 
             Pos4: T? So that works? 
          Checking: A, N, I, T, A? 
          Positions: 
            1: A
            2: N
            3: I
            4: T
            5: A? 

        But we need to check: 
          A: we expect at 1? But we also have A at 5? So if A is at 1, that could be correct? And if the secret word has two A's? 

        Also, we have N at position2? 

        Now, is ""ANITA"" a word? It's a name? An English word? Sometimes accepted? But we need valid English word? 

   Alternatively, consider: ""ADAPT"" fails? 
   What about ""ADNEX"": not common? 

So it seems hard? We need word: A ? ? T ? and must contain N? 

Option 2: A at position 5?
   Then structure: ? ? ? T A
   With N in position2 or3? 
      If N at position2: then _ N _ T A
      If N at position3: then ? ? N T A

   Examples:
     For N at position2: 
        ""ON T A"": ???
        ""IN T A"": 
        Words: UNITS -> U N I T S? But S forbidden? 
               MINTY? Y forbidden? 
               PINTS? S forbidden? 

        How about ""MANTA""? 
          M A N T A? 
          Positions: 
            Pos1: M
            Pos2: A? -> but we need A at pos5? And we have A at pos2? 
          Actually: if A is at pos5? Then structure: ? ? ? T A? 
          ""MANTA"": M A N T A -> so 
            Pos1: M
            Pos2: A -> but we also have A at pos5? 
          Now, we get A at two positions? 

        But note: we require A to be at position5? So the second occurrence must be ignored? Actually, in Wordle feedback? 
        But in our previous guess? ... 

        Alternatively, a word without duplicates: 
          How about ""BUNTA""? Not common? 

        How about ""DENTA""? But E is forbidden? 

     For N at position3: 
        Structure: ? ? N T A
        Examples: 
           ""HANT A"" -> H as first? 
           ""FONT A"" -> F O N T A? 
           ""COUNT A""? Not letters? 
           ""BONTA""? 
           ""LONTA""? Not common? 
        Actually: ""DINTA"" -> not common? 
        ""PINTA"" -> P I N T A? That is a known word? (a unit of volume)? So ""PINTA"": 
          P I N T A
          Pos1: P, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: T, Pos5: A.

        Now, this fits: 
          A at position5? Yes? 
          N at position3? Yes? 
          T at position4? Yes? 
          And letters: P, I? We haven't tried? And no forbidden letters? 
          Also, note: we have not eliminated P or I? 

        Also, in the structure: 
          There may be other words? 

        But check: Is there A at position5? And N at position3? 

        Also, we need to see if it violates any feedback? 
          First guess: CRANE -> A was at position3? We had '-' meaning A is present? So in ""PINTA"", A is at position5? So the A is present? 
          Also, N at position3? Previously in first guess, N was at position4? Here at position3? 

        How about the feedback we had: 
          In second guess, we had N at pos1: got '-' (so N present but not at1)? That doesn't conflict? 
          And A at pos2: got '-'? Now in ""PINTA"", A is at pos5? 

        So ""PINTA"" seems a possible candidate? 

        But note: we have two positions unknown? Position1 and 2? We put P and I? 

        Also we don't know if they are present? 

        Alternatively, we can think of other words? 
          ""TAWTA""? Not? 
          ""ANT? with A at5? No? 
        Other possibilities: ""PINT A"" (separate?) not? 

        Now, but we don't know the word? So we need to guess? 

        However, note: we don't have to get the exact word? We can use a guess that includes more information? For example? 

If we are not sure, we can try a word that tests both possibilities? Probably we need to test A at possible positions? But we are forced to choose one? 

But note: we can make a guess that helps us determine the position of A? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A at the ends? Wait? Actually, we deduced A must be at 1 or 5? 

So let's think: 
   Option: try a word that has A at position1? 
   Then we can know? 

But we haven't tested many letters? 

Another idea: use a word that contains some common letters? 

But we have constraints: 
   - Position4 must be T? 
   - The word must contain A and N? 
   - A must be either at position1 or position5? 

We can choose a word that has A at position1? But we don't know? 

We can also try a word that tests A at position1? If we guess a word starting with A, then:
   If we get A: ✓, then we know A at1? 
   If we get A: -, then we know A is in the word but not at1? Then it must be at position5? 

Similarly, we can test A at position5 separately? 

But we have only limited tries? 

So guess a word that puts A at position1? For example: 
   Words: A ? ? T ?   and must have N? 

We had problems finding words? But let's try again: 
   How about ""APATH"": not a word? 
   ""AVA T"": 
   ""ABOUT"": not? 

But we need N? 

How about ""AUNTY"": 
   A U N T Y? But Y is forbidden? 

How about ""APNEA"": 
   A P N E A? But E forbidden? 

How about ""ADAPT"": without E? 

But if we can't find one? Then maybe A at position5 is more likely? 

Since we can try to guess words? 

How about ""PAINT""? 
   But in the beginning? 
   P A I N T -> 
      Positions: 
        1: P
        2: A -> but we know A is not at position2? Because in second guess? 
        3: I
        4: N -> but position4 must be T? So not? 

   So invalid? 

Therefore, let me try to guess ""PINTA""? 
   But note: we don't know the word? But it fits? 

Alternatively? 
   Another word: ""MAN TO""? 

   Actually, let's search for a word: 
      Pattern: 
        Option: A at pos5? Then: [Letter][Letter][N?][T][A]
        Or A at pos5? And N at pos2? [Letter][N][letter][T][A]

   Words: 
      For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": 
        Possible: PINTA, MINTA? But MINTA? not common? 
        Also: HINTA? Not 
        Actually: words ending ""NT A""? 
        But check: ""QUOTA"" -> no N? 
        ""CON TA"": not? 
        But ""PINTA"" is a word? It is accepted? 

   For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": we have PINTA? 

   Or ""_ N _ T A"": 
        Candidates: IN T A? 
        Words: ON T A? INTAA? Not? 
        Actually: ""UN T A"" -> 
        Words: MENTA? -> M E N T A? But E forbidden? 
        HENTA? E? 
        BENTA? E? 
        LENTA? E? 

        But we avoid E? 

        How about ""JNTA""? Not? 
        ""KINTA""? not common? 
        ""DINT A"" -> D I N T A? Actually, ""DINTA"" is not standard? 

   So ""PINTA"" seems the best candidate? 

But note: In the feedback, we got T at position4? So we have to keep that? 

So our guess will be ""PINTA""? 

But what if we are wrong? 

Alternatively, we can test more letters? 

For example, we might choose a word that has T at position4? and A at position5? So we are testing A at position5? And what about N? We don't know its position? 

But we are also testing P, I? 

If we guess ""PINTA"", then we get:
   - P? It may be absent? Or present? 
   - I? same? 
   And if A is at5? And we get it correct? Then A at5 is ✓? 
   And if N is at3? ✓? 

But if the word is not ""PINTA"", then we get feedback? 

But since we have only 6 tries? And this is the third? 

Another word: what about ""POINT""? 
   P O I N T -> 
       Pos4: N? But we need T at position4? 
   So not? 

How about ""PAWNT""? 
   P A W N T -> 
       But A at2? But we know A is not at position2? So we will get '-' for A? 
       But structure: 
          Pos1: P
          Pos2: A (which we know belongs elsewhere? but we already know A is in the word? So it's redundant? 
       Also, T at5? 

   So not? 

So after reconsider? 
   We have two main cases? 

We can try a word that doesn't commit to A at1? and still tests other letters? 

But we have to include A? 

Let me think: since we have T at4? and positions: 
   Let's denote the positions: P1, P2, P3, P4(T), P5? 

We know:
   - P1: cannot be N? 
   - P2: cannot be A? 
   - P3: cannot be A? 
   - P4: T? 
   - P5: ? 

And A must be at P1 or P5? 

So if we choose a word starting with a letter that we haven't tested? And include A at P5? Then we get:

   Structure: [new letter] [new letter] [new letter] T A? 
   But we also require N? So one of the new letters must be N? Or two? 

Also, note: we cannot put N at P1? We know? But we already know P1 is not N? So we can put N at P2 or P3? 

So:
   Pattern: 
        Option: P1: ? , P2: ? , P3: N, P4: T, P5: A? 
        Or: P1: ? , P2: N, P3: ? , P4: T, P5: A?

   Example for first: ? ? N T A -> ""PAINTA"" is too long? Words: like PRINT? but too long? 
        Examples: ""PIT NA"" -> not? 
        Actually: 5 letters:  [Letter1][Letter2][N][T][A] 

   Words: 
        PRINT -> 5 letters? P R I N T? But R is forbidden? Doesn't fit? 
        MINTA? as above? 
        Other words: 
          ""TAINTS"" -> 6? 
          ""POINT"" has T at end? 

        Actually: ""PINTA"" is a known word? 

        So let's go with ""PINTA"".

   Alternatively, for the other pattern: [ ? , N, ? , T, A]? 
        Words: ""UN T A"" format? 
        ""IN T A""? 
        ""ON T A""? 
        But with letters: E forbidden? 
        ""ONCET""? Not? 
        ""UNITA"": U N I T A? 
          Then: 
            Pos1: U, Pos2: N, Pos3: I, Pos4: T, Pos5: A? 
          So: U N I T A? 
          But note: we have T at position4? Here T is at position4? 
          And A at position5? 
          And N at position2? 
          And doesn't use forbidden letters? 
          Also, ""UNITA"" is the plural of 'unita'? Italian? May not be accepted? 

   But valid English words? Are required? So PINTA is more common? 

Thus, I'll guess ""PINTA"".

Note: if we are right? Then we win? If not? Then feedback will help.

Alternatively, to be safe and test more letters? 

But let's do it.

<guess>pinta</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A and N are present but in wrong positions (not position 3 for A, not position 4 for N). C, R, E are absent.
2. **Guess 2 (NASTY)**: 
   - T is present and correctly placed at position 4.
   - N is present but not at position 1.
   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S and Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
- T is fixed at position 4.
- A must be at position 1 or 5 (excluded positions 2, 3, and 4 via feedback).
- N cannot be at positions 1 or 4 (excluded positions), so it must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, Y.
- The word contains A, N, T, and two unknown letters.

For this guess, I prioritized:
- Testing A at position 5 (supported by the pattern `___TA`).
- Testing N at position 3 (to avoid conflicting positions if A is at 5).
- Introducing new, common letters (P and I) to gather more feedback.
- Ensuring no absent letters are used.

This approach led to the word **PINTA**:
- P (position 1, untested)
- I (position 2, untested)
- N (position 3, previously tested but not at this position)
- T (position 4, confirmed correct placement)
- A (position 5, a possible location per insights)

<guess>pinta</guess>",pinta,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
First guess (""crane""):
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Second guess (""nasty""):
  N(-), A(-), S(x), T(✓), Y(x)

Interpretation:
1. From the first guess, we know:
   - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
   - C, R, E are not in the word.

2. From the second guess (""nasty""):
   - N(-): N is in the word but not at position 1.
   - A(-): A is in the word but not at position 2.
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - T(✓): T is in the word and at position 4. (Because in ""nasty"", T is the fourth letter.)
   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absolute truths:
  - T is at position 4. (So the secret word has T as its fourth letter.)
  - The word contains A and N (from first guess, confirmed again by presence but wrong position in second guess).
  - S and Y are absent, so we can eliminate them.
  - C, R, E are absent (previously known).

- Positions we know are incorrect for A: position 3 (from first guess) and position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A can only be in positions 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by T? Actually, note: positions are independent. Position 4 is taken by T, so A cannot be at position 4? Actually, we don't know if T is the only letter? But the secret word is 5 letters. We know:
    Position 1: not N (from second guess: N(-) at pos1)
    Position 2: not A (from second guess: A(-) at pos2)
    Position 3: not A (from first guess) -> but we haven't tested A at position 3 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 3 from the first guess? Yes.
    Position 4: confirmed T (from T(✓) at pos4)
    Position 5: we don't know.

So for A: it must be either in position 1 or position 5? Why?
Because positions:
  - Position 3: from first guess, we know A is not there.
  - Position 2: from second guess, we know A is not there.
  - Position 4: now we know it is T, so A cannot be at position 4 either? Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, for N:
  We know:
    - From first guess: N is not at position 4? Actually, that was the position we guessed (in CRANE, N was in position 4). But note: now position 4 is T, so it's definitely not N? So N cannot be at position 4? But we already knew that? 
    - From second guess: N is not at position 1 (because we guessed N at pos1 and got '-')
    - What about other positions?
        Position 2: we don't know? We haven't tested N at position 2? But in the second guess, we had A at position 2? So that spot was taken by A? We haven't tested N at 2? 
        Similarly, position 3: we haven't tested? 
        Position 5: we haven't tested?

Therefore, N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions and we know:
  - Position 4 is T (fixed).
  - N is in one of the other positions? 
  - We know it's not at pos1 (from second guess) and not at pos4? So positions 2, 3, or 5.

But note: we also have A that is either at position 1 or 5? So position 1 might be A? Or position 5? And N must be in 2,3,or5? But if A is at position 5, then N can be at 2 or 3? And if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or5? 

Also, we have two additional letters? Actually, the word must be made of:
   Letters: A, N, T, and two more letters that we don't know? Because we don't have full information? 

But we know the word has 5 letters? And we know:
   - Contains A, N, T (and T is at position 4).
   - We know that from first and second guesses, we only have these three letters? But there must be two more.

We also know that the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, Y.

So what letters are possible? We've only used: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and N, A, S, T, Y (second guess). So absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y.

Therefore, available letters: all English letters except C, R, E, S, Y? Also, we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? But we can use any that make a valid word.

Now, let's form a possible word that:
   - Has T at position 4.
   - Contains A and N.
   - Places A at either position 1 or 5? Because we know it's not in 2,3,4? And we know 4 is T.
   - Places N in position 2, 3, or 5? But note: if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5? So if A is at position 5, N must be at 2 or 3? Similarly, if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or 5? (but not always because we have 5 positions? And we have two other letters.)

We also need two more letters. So we'll choose common letters? Or letters that we haven't tested to get more information.

But we already have T at 4, so we know that letter? So let's focus on the other positions.

Possible structures:
Option 1: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A? 
   Then the word: A ? ? T ? 
   With N in 2,3, or5? And the two other letters?

Option 2: A at position 5? Then the word: ? ? ? T A
   With N in 2,3? (because if in 5, then conflict? Actually, but then N cannot be at 5 if A is there? And we cannot have two letters?) So if A at 5, N must be in 2 or 3.

Now, let's try to think of words that fit:

Case A at pos1? 
   Words: A _ _ T _
   With N in the word either at position 2, 3, or the last (5th)? 
   Also, remember we have two other letters? 

   Examples: 
     ANTIC? But contains I and C? C is forbidden? So not.
     ANKLE? But E is forbidden? 
     ANVIL? V and I? 
     ALPHA? But P and H? And doesn't have N? Wait, we have N in the word? But if N is at 3? 
     Actually: 
        If N at position 2: A N _ T ... words: ANTED (E forbidden), ANTSY (S and Y forbidden) -> invalid.
        If N at position 3: A _ N T ... words: COUNT? But O, U, N? But N is at 3? But also: COUNT has C? forbidden? 
        How about ""AUNT"": but 4 letters? 
        How about ""ADAPT""? 
          A D A P T? But duplicate A? And P and D? And we don't know if allowed? Also, A at 1 and N at? There is no N? So we need N? 
        But we know the word has N? So ""ADAPT"" doesn't contain N? Then invalid? 

   Alternatively? 
     ""ANKHS""? not common.

   What about ""MANTA"": 
     M A N T A? But M is possible? And A at 1? No: we start with A? 
     Actually: if A at pos1, then words starting with A? 

   How about ""ABOUT"": 
      A B O U T? But O,U,B? And no N? So not.

   How about ""AGENT"": 
      A G E N T? But E is forbidden? 

   How about ""ALIGN"": 
      A L I G N? 
          Position1: A
          Position4: T? Actually no: we need position4 to be T? So our word structure must have T at position4? 
          But ""ALIGN"" has no letter at position4? It has G? So position4 is G? We need T? 

   So we must have T at position4? 

   Word: A B C T D? 

   Let me try: ""ADAPT"" doesn't have N? 
              ""ADMIT"": A D M I T? 
                  But T is at position5? Not at position4? So we need to shift:
                  For a word ADMIT: 
                    Pos1: A, Pos2: D, Pos3: M, Pos4: I, Pos5: T? Doesn't have N? 

   How about ""ADULT"": 
        A D U L T? T at 5? not 4? And no N? 

   Another word: ""ACTIN"": 
        A C T I N? But C and T: T is at 3? Not at 4? And C forbidden? 

   So maybe words starting with A and having T at position4? And containing N? 

   Example: ""ADMIN"" -> 
        A D M I N? -> Positions: 
          Pos1: A
          Pos2: D
          Pos3: M
          Pos4: I? But we need T? 

   So we need T at position4? 

   How about ""AORTA""? 
        A O R T A? Doesn't have N? And R forbidden? 

   How about ""ANITA""? 
        A N I T A? 
          Then: 
             Pos1: A? 
             Pos2: N? 
             Pos4: T? So that works? 
          Checking: A, N, I, T, A? 
          Positions: 
            1: A
            2: N
            3: I
            4: T
            5: A? 

        But we need to check: 
          A: we expect at 1? But we also have A at 5? So if A is at 1, that could be correct? And if the secret word has two A's? 

        Also, we have N at position2? 

        Now, is ""ANITA"" a word? It's a name? An English word? Sometimes accepted? But we need valid English word? 

   Alternatively, consider: ""ADAPT"" fails? 
   What about ""ADNEX"": not common? 

So it seems hard? We need word: A ? ? T ? and must contain N? 

Option 2: A at position 5?
   Then structure: ? ? ? T A
   With N in position2 or3? 
      If N at position2: then _ N _ T A
      If N at position3: then ? ? N T A

   Examples:
     For N at position2: 
        ""ON T A"": ???
        ""IN T A"": 
        Words: UNITS -> U N I T S? But S forbidden? 
               MINTY? Y forbidden? 
               PINTS? S forbidden? 

        How about ""MANTA""? 
          M A N T A? 
          Positions: 
            Pos1: M
            Pos2: A? -> but we need A at pos5? And we have A at pos2? 
          Actually: if A is at pos5? Then structure: ? ? ? T A? 
          ""MANTA"": M A N T A -> so 
            Pos1: M
            Pos2: A -> but we also have A at pos5? 
          Now, we get A at two positions? 

        But note: we require A to be at position5? So the second occurrence must be ignored? Actually, in Wordle feedback? 
        But in our previous guess? ... 

        Alternatively, a word without duplicates: 
          How about ""BUNTA""? Not common? 

        How about ""DENTA""? But E is forbidden? 

     For N at position3: 
        Structure: ? ? N T A
        Examples: 
           ""HANT A"" -> H as first? 
           ""FONT A"" -> F O N T A? 
           ""COUNT A""? Not letters? 
           ""BONTA""? 
           ""LONTA""? Not common? 
        Actually: ""DINTA"" -> not common? 
        ""PINTA"" -> P I N T A? That is a known word? (a unit of volume)? So ""PINTA"": 
          P I N T A
          Pos1: P, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: T, Pos5: A.

        Now, this fits: 
          A at position5? Yes? 
          N at position3? Yes? 
          T at position4? Yes? 
          And letters: P, I? We haven't tried? And no forbidden letters? 
          Also, note: we have not eliminated P or I? 

        Also, in the structure: 
          There may be other words? 

        But check: Is there A at position5? And N at position3? 

        Also, we need to see if it violates any feedback? 
          First guess: CRANE -> A was at position3? We had '-' meaning A is present? So in ""PINTA"", A is at position5? So the A is present? 
          Also, N at position3? Previously in first guess, N was at position4? Here at position3? 

        How about the feedback we had: 
          In second guess, we had N at pos1: got '-' (so N present but not at1)? That doesn't conflict? 
          And A at pos2: got '-'? Now in ""PINTA"", A is at pos5? 

        So ""PINTA"" seems a possible candidate? 

        But note: we have two positions unknown? Position1 and 2? We put P and I? 

        Also we don't know if they are present? 

        Alternatively, we can think of other words? 
          ""TAWTA""? Not? 
          ""ANT? with A at5? No? 
        Other possibilities: ""PINT A"" (separate?) not? 

        Now, but we don't know the word? So we need to guess? 

        However, note: we don't have to get the exact word? We can use a guess that includes more information? For example? 

If we are not sure, we can try a word that tests both possibilities? Probably we need to test A at possible positions? But we are forced to choose one? 

But note: we can make a guess that helps us determine the position of A? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A at the ends? Wait? Actually, we deduced A must be at 1 or 5? 

So let's think: 
   Option: try a word that has A at position1? 
   Then we can know? 

But we haven't tested many letters? 

Another idea: use a word that contains some common letters? 

But we have constraints: 
   - Position4 must be T? 
   - The word must contain A and N? 
   - A must be either at position1 or position5? 

We can choose a word that has A at position1? But we don't know? 

We can also try a word that tests A at position1? If we guess a word starting with A, then:
   If we get A: ✓, then we know A at1? 
   If we get A: -, then we know A is in the word but not at1? Then it must be at position5? 

Similarly, we can test A at position5 separately? 

But we have only limited tries? 

So guess a word that puts A at position1? For example: 
   Words: A ? ? T ?   and must have N? 

We had problems finding words? But let's try again: 
   How about ""APATH"": not a word? 
   ""AVA T"": 
   ""ABOUT"": not? 

But we need N? 

How about ""AUNTY"": 
   A U N T Y? But Y is forbidden? 

How about ""APNEA"": 
   A P N E A? But E forbidden? 

How about ""ADAPT"": without E? 

But if we can't find one? Then maybe A at position5 is more likely? 

Since we can try to guess words? 

How about ""PAINT""? 
   But in the beginning? 
   P A I N T -> 
      Positions: 
        1: P
        2: A -> but we know A is not at position2? Because in second guess? 
        3: I
        4: N -> but position4 must be T? So not? 

   So invalid? 

Therefore, let me try to guess ""PINTA""? 
   But note: we don't know the word? But it fits? 

Alternatively? 
   Another word: ""MAN TO""? 

   Actually, let's search for a word: 
      Pattern: 
        Option: A at pos5? Then: [Letter][Letter][N?][T][A]
        Or A at pos5? And N at pos2? [Letter][N][letter][T][A]

   Words: 
      For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": 
        Possible: PINTA, MINTA? But MINTA? not common? 
        Also: HINTA? Not 
        Actually: words ending ""NT A""? 
        But check: ""QUOTA"" -> no N? 
        ""CON TA"": not? 
        But ""PINTA"" is a word? It is accepted? 

   For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": we have PINTA? 

   Or ""_ N _ T A"": 
        Candidates: IN T A? 
        Words: ON T A? INTAA? Not? 
        Actually: ""UN T A"" -> 
        Words: MENTA? -> M E N T A? But E forbidden? 
        HENTA? E? 
        BENTA? E? 
        LENTA? E? 

        But we avoid E? 

        How about ""JNTA""? Not? 
        ""KINTA""? not common? 
        ""DINT A"" -> D I N T A? Actually, ""DINTA"" is not standard? 

   So ""PINTA"" seems the best candidate? 

But note: In the feedback, we got T at position4? So we have to keep that? 

So our guess will be ""PINTA""? 

But what if we are wrong? 

Alternatively, we can test more letters? 

For example, we might choose a word that has T at position4? and A at position5? So we are testing A at position5? And what about N? We don't know its position? 

But we are also testing P, I? 

If we guess ""PINTA"", then we get:
   - P? It may be absent? Or present? 
   - I? same? 
   And if A is at5? And we get it correct? Then A at5 is ✓? 
   And if N is at3? ✓? 

But if the word is not ""PINTA"", then we get feedback? 

But since we have only 6 tries? And this is the third? 

Another word: what about ""POINT""? 
   P O I N T -> 
       Pos4: N? But we need T at position4? 
   So not? 

How about ""PAWNT""? 
   P A W N T -> 
       But A at2? But we know A is not at position2? So we will get '-' for A? 
       But structure: 
          Pos1: P
          Pos2: A (which we know belongs elsewhere? but we already know A is in the word? So it's redundant? 
       Also, T at5? 

   So not? 

So after reconsider? 
   We have two main cases? 

We can try a word that doesn't commit to A at1? and still tests other letters? 

But we have to include A? 

Let me think: since we have T at4? and positions: 
   Let's denote the positions: P1, P2, P3, P4(T), P5? 

We know:
   - P1: cannot be N? 
   - P2: cannot be A? 
   - P3: cannot be A? 
   - P4: T? 
   - P5: ? 

And A must be at P1 or P5? 

So if we choose a word starting with a letter that we haven't tested? And include A at P5? Then we get:

   Structure: [new letter] [new letter] [new letter] T A? 
   But we also require N? So one of the new letters must be N? Or two? 

Also, note: we cannot put N at P1? We know? But we already know P1 is not N? So we can put N at P2 or P3? 

So:
   Pattern: 
        Option: P1: ? , P2: ? , P3: N, P4: T, P5: A? 
        Or: P1: ? , P2: N, P3: ? , P4: T, P5: A?

   Example for first: ? ? N T A -> ""PAINTA"" is too long? Words: like PRINT? but too long? 
        Examples: ""PIT NA"" -> not? 
        Actually: 5 letters:  [Letter1][Letter2][N][T][A] 

   Words: 
        PRINT -> 5 letters? P R I N T? But R is forbidden? Doesn't fit? 
        MINTA? as above? 
        Other words: 
          ""TAINTS"" -> 6? 
          ""POINT"" has T at end? 

        Actually: ""PINTA"" is a known word? 

        So let's go with ""PINTA"".

   Alternatively, for the other pattern: [ ? , N, ? , T, A]? 
        Words: ""UN T A"" format? 
        ""IN T A""? 
        ""ON T A""? 
        But with letters: E forbidden? 
        ""ONCET""? Not? 
        ""UNITA"": U N I T A? 
          Then: 
            Pos1: U, Pos2: N, Pos3: I, Pos4: T, Pos5: A? 
          So: U N I T A? 
          But note: we have T at position4? Here T is at position4? 
          And A at position5? 
          And N at position2? 
          And doesn't use forbidden letters? 
          Also, ""UNITA"" is the plural of 'unita'? Italian? May not be accepted? 

   But valid English words? Are required? So PINTA is more common? 

Thus, I'll guess ""PINTA"".

Note: if we are right? Then we win? If not? Then feedback will help.

Alternatively, to be safe and test more letters? 

But let's do it.

<guess>pinta</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A and N are present but in wrong positions (not position 3 for A, not position 4 for N). C, R, E are absent.
2. **Guess 2 (NASTY)**: 
   - T is present and correctly placed at position 4.
   - N is present but not at position 1.
   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S and Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
- T is fixed at position 4.
- A must be at position 1 or 5 (excluded positions 2, 3, and 4 via feedback).
- N cannot be at positions 1 or 4 (excluded positions), so it must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, Y.
- The word contains A, N, T, and two unknown letters.

For this guess, I prioritized:
- Testing A at position 5 (supported by the pattern `___TA`).
- Testing N at position 3 (to avoid conflicting positions if A is at 5).
- Introducing new, common letters (P and I) to gather more feedback.
- Ensuring no absent letters are used.

This approach led to the word **PINTA**:
- P (position 1, untested)
- I (position 2, untested)
- N (position 3, previously tested but not at this position)
- T (position 4, confirmed correct placement)
- A (position 5, a possible location per insights)",Guess 3: pinta -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) N(✓) T(✓) A(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,JUNTA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was third position in the guess).
 - N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was fourth position).
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 (since in our guess they were at 3 and 4 and those are wrong).
 - The word does not contain C, R, or E.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
 Our guess: C R A N E
 Positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E.

 So A cannot be at position 3, and N cannot be at position 4.

 Also, note that the word has 5 letters.

 We need to choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Actually, for A: it is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

 We also note that A and N are present somewhere else.

 We want to try a word that has A and N, plus three other letters that are not C, R, E and that might be common.

 We should avoid using letters that we know are absent: C, R, E.

 Let's think of words that include A and N. We can try to put A and N in different positions to test.

 But note: the position of A and N in the new guess might help us figure out where they are.

 For example, we can put A in a different position (say 1, 2, or 5) and N in a different position (say 1, 2, 3, or 5).

 We also want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, etc.

 Considering: we know that the word has A and N, and we have 3 more letters to guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Contains A and N.
 - Uses three new common letters (excluding C, R, E).

 Possible words: ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", ""GIANT"", ""SNAKE"", ""MANGO"", etc.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? Not yet.

 However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that places A and N in positions that are not the ones they were in (to avoid the same mistake) and also uses new letters.

 Example: 
 - ""STAND"": 
   - S, T, A, N, D. 
   This includes A at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A) and N at position 4 (which we know is wrong for N) — so that would not change the positions? 
   Actually, we don't know if the secret word has A at position 3? The previous feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would expect a '-' if it's wrong? But we already know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put A at 3 again if we want to find where it is.

 We need to place A not at position 3 and N not at position 4.

 So in the new guess, we should try A at a different position (1,2,4,5) and N at a different position (1,2,3,5). 

 Also, we want to avoid repeating the same letters that we haven't yet cleared? For example, we don't know about S, T, etc.

 Consider ""STAND"":
   A is at position 3 -> we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should not put A at 3. Therefore, ""STAND"" is not a good choice because it puts A at 3.

 How about ""SNAIL""? 
   S, N, A, I, L.
   A is at position 3? -> same problem.

 How about ""ADMIN""? 
   A at 1, D, M, I, N at 5? 
   But note: N is at position 5 -> which is not position 4? Yeah, so that's okay? 
   Also, A is at position 1 -> which is new.

 So ""ADMIN"": 
   - A at position 1: if the secret word has A at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get '-' or 'x'. 
   - N at position 5: similarly.

 But note: the previous feedback tells us that A is in the word (so we know it's somewhere) and N is in the word.

 Alternatively, what about ""PLAIN""? 
   P, L, A, I, N -> A at position 3 again -> avoid.

 How about ""DINKA""? 
   D, I, N, K, A -> N at 3 (which is new) and A at 5 (new) — so this is good? But not a common word? Actually, ""DINKA"" might be proper? We need valid English words.

 Another idea: ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T -> A at position 2, which is new; N at position 4 — we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4? Actually, no: the previous feedback said that N was at position 4 and that was incorrect. But that doesn't mean it can't be at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for N in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at the position we guessed (4). So we must avoid putting N at position 4 again? Actually, we can put it again? But if we know that position 4 is not N, then why test again? We want to test N at a different position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position 4 again because we already know that it isn't there. Similarly for A at position 3.

 So ""PAINT"":
   A at position 2 -> new
   N at position 4 -> but we know N is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback told us that the position for N is wrong, meaning that the N in our first guess was in position 4 and that position was incorrect. So in the secret word, the letter at position 4 is not N, therefore we shouldn't put N at position 4 again because it will again be wrong. We want to test N in a new position to see if we can find the right one.

 Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because it puts N in position 4.

 How about ""PANIC""?
   P, A, N, I, C -> but C is absent? We know C is not in the word -> so we cannot use C.

 How about ""MANIA""? 
   M, A, N, I, A -> that has duplicate A? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't tell us anything about duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback may mark each occurrence appropriately.

 But we need a word without C, R, E.

 ""MANIA"": 
   A: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5.

 But note: we know that A cannot be at position 3? So putting A at 2 and 5? That's okay, but we have two A's? 

 However, we don't know if the word has two A's? The feedback from the first guess had only one A and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word has only one A, then our two A's might be problematic? But it's allowed to guess words with duplicate letters even if the word doesn't have duplicates? The rules don't forbid it.

 But in this case, we are not sure. Also, we don't know if the word has M, I.

 However, let me pick a word without duplicate and without forbidden letters. 

 How about ""BALM""? But that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 Think of: ""PLAIN"" has A at position 3 -> avoid.

 ""CANAL"" has C and A at 3? -> C is absent and A at 3 is bad.

 ""SALAD""? -> duplicate A? Also, A is at position 2 and 4? We can test.

 But let's try to avoid duplicates for now? Because they complicate the feedback.

 Another word: ""DAUNT""?
   D at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
   But we know N is not at position 4? So why put N at position 4? It will definitely not be correct? And we already know that.

 We should avoid known incorrect position for a given letter? So placing N at 4 again would be a waste of a letter position? We want to use that position to test a new letter? So better to put N in a position we haven't tested? 

 Since the word has 5 positions and N is not at position 4, we should test it in positions 1,2,3,5.

 Similarly, A is not at position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 for A.

 Therefore, let me look for words that:
   Include A and N, 
   Do not include C, R, E,
   Place A in one of {1,2,4,5} and N in one of {1,2,3,5},
   And the word should be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"": has A at 4? No: P,L,A at 3? -> avoid A at 3.
   ""STAND"": S,T,A at 3? -> avoid.

   ""NASTY"": 
      N at position 1 -> we can test that.
      A at position 2 -> new.
      S,T,Y: new letters.
      So: N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Also, ""NASTY"" avoids the positions we know: 
      A is not at 3? Check: yes, it's at 2 -> good.
      N is not at 4? It's at 1 -> good.

   And it has new letters: S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BALSA"": B,A,L,S,A -> but duplicate A? 
   A at 2 and 5? And we don't want that.

 Another idea: ""TIDAL""? 
   T at 1, I at 2, D at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> that puts A at position 4 (new) and doesn't include N? But we need to include N.

 We must include both A and N? Because we know they are present.

 What words have both A and N? 

 Let's try: ""ADMIN"" -> we thought of earlier: 
   A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5 -> that's acceptable? Yes.

 But is ""ADMIN"" a valid word? Yes, meaning administration.

 However, note that we have used: A, D, M, I, N. None of these are the forbidden ones? And A at 1 and N at 5.

 Alternatively, ""SPAIN"": 
   S, P, A, I, N -> A at 3? -> avoid position 3.

 ""PAINS""? 
   P, A, I, N, S -> A at position 2 and N at position 4? But we know N is not at 4 -> so avoid.

 ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A at 2, N at 4? -> avoid N at 4.

 So ""NASTY"" seems good: N at 1, A at 2 -> both are in new positions.

 Therefore, let me go with ""NASTY"".

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"": 
   D, A, I, S, Y -> no N. But we must include N? Wait, we know from the first guess that A and N are present? Yes, because we got '-' for A and N.

 So we have to include both? Otherwise, if we make a guess without one of them, then we won't get information? But we already know they are present? Actually, we don't have to include them? But if we don't include them, we can't find their positions.

 However, the feedback will tell us: 
   If we don't include A and the secret word has A, then we get feedback for the letters we guess. But we already know A is present? Actually, that doesn't change. We don't need to always include the known letters? We can use a word without A to test other letters? But then we risk being inefficient? 

 But considering we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover the known present letters to pin down their positions? 

 Therefore, I think it's wise to include both A and N in the next guess.

 So ""NASTY"" is a good choice: 
   It places N at position 1 (which is a new position) and A at position 2 (new).
   It introduces S, T, Y.

 We hope that one of these positions is correct? Or at least we'll get new information.

 So I will guess ""NASTY"".

<guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)), we can derive the following:
1. The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
2. The letter A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
3. The letter N is in the secret word but not in position 4.

Therefore:
- The new guess must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- A must be placed in a position that isn't 3 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- N must be placed in a position that isn't 4 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The guess must avoid C, R, and E entirely.

We choose ""NASTY"" for the second guess because:
- It places N in position 1 (a new position to test) and A in position 2 (a new position).
- It introduces three new common letters (S, T, Y) to gather additional feedback.
- It adheres to all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing A and N in unprobed positions.

New attempt:

<guess>nasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(✓) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:
First guess (""crane""):
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Second guess (""nasty""):
  N(-), A(-), S(x), T(✓), Y(x)

Interpretation:
1. From the first guess, we know:
   - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
   - C, R, E are not in the word.

2. From the second guess (""nasty""):
   - N(-): N is in the word but not at position 1.
   - A(-): A is in the word but not at position 2.
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - T(✓): T is in the word and at position 4. (Because in ""nasty"", T is the fourth letter.)
   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Absolute truths:
  - T is at position 4. (So the secret word has T as its fourth letter.)
  - The word contains A and N (from first guess, confirmed again by presence but wrong position in second guess).
  - S and Y are absent, so we can eliminate them.
  - C, R, E are absent (previously known).

- Positions we know are incorrect for A: position 3 (from first guess) and position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A can only be in positions 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by T? Actually, note: positions are independent. Position 4 is taken by T, so A cannot be at position 4? Actually, we don't know if T is the only letter? But the secret word is 5 letters. We know:
    Position 1: not N (from second guess: N(-) at pos1)
    Position 2: not A (from second guess: A(-) at pos2)
    Position 3: not A (from first guess) -> but we haven't tested A at position 3 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 3 from the first guess? Yes.
    Position 4: confirmed T (from T(✓) at pos4)
    Position 5: we don't know.

So for A: it must be either in position 1 or position 5? Why?
Because positions:
  - Position 3: from first guess, we know A is not there.
  - Position 2: from second guess, we know A is not there.
  - Position 4: now we know it is T, so A cannot be at position 4 either? Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, for N:
  We know:
    - From first guess: N is not at position 4? Actually, that was the position we guessed (in CRANE, N was in position 4). But note: now position 4 is T, so it's definitely not N? So N cannot be at position 4? But we already knew that? 
    - From second guess: N is not at position 1 (because we guessed N at pos1 and got '-')
    - What about other positions?
        Position 2: we don't know? We haven't tested N at position 2? But in the second guess, we had A at position 2? So that spot was taken by A? We haven't tested N at 2? 
        Similarly, position 3: we haven't tested? 
        Position 5: we haven't tested?

Therefore, N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions and we know:
  - Position 4 is T (fixed).
  - N is in one of the other positions? 
  - We know it's not at pos1 (from second guess) and not at pos4? So positions 2, 3, or 5.

But note: we also have A that is either at position 1 or 5? So position 1 might be A? Or position 5? And N must be in 2,3,or5? But if A is at position 5, then N can be at 2 or 3? And if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or5? 

Also, we have two additional letters? Actually, the word must be made of:
   Letters: A, N, T, and two more letters that we don't know? Because we don't have full information? 

But we know the word has 5 letters? And we know:
   - Contains A, N, T (and T is at position 4).
   - We know that from first and second guesses, we only have these three letters? But there must be two more.

We also know that the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, Y.

So what letters are possible? We've only used: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and N, A, S, T, Y (second guess). So absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y.

Therefore, available letters: all English letters except C, R, E, S, Y? Also, we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? But we can use any that make a valid word.

Now, let's form a possible word that:
   - Has T at position 4.
   - Contains A and N.
   - Places A at either position 1 or 5? Because we know it's not in 2,3,4? And we know 4 is T.
   - Places N in position 2, 3, or 5? But note: if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5? So if A is at position 5, N must be at 2 or 3? Similarly, if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or 5? (but not always because we have 5 positions? And we have two other letters.)

We also need two more letters. So we'll choose common letters? Or letters that we haven't tested to get more information.

But we already have T at 4, so we know that letter? So let's focus on the other positions.

Possible structures:
Option 1: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A? 
   Then the word: A ? ? T ? 
   With N in 2,3, or5? And the two other letters?

Option 2: A at position 5? Then the word: ? ? ? T A
   With N in 2,3? (because if in 5, then conflict? Actually, but then N cannot be at 5 if A is there? And we cannot have two letters?) So if A at 5, N must be in 2 or 3.

Now, let's try to think of words that fit:

Case A at pos1? 
   Words: A _ _ T _
   With N in the word either at position 2, 3, or the last (5th)? 
   Also, remember we have two other letters? 

   Examples: 
     ANTIC? But contains I and C? C is forbidden? So not.
     ANKLE? But E is forbidden? 
     ANVIL? V and I? 
     ALPHA? But P and H? And doesn't have N? Wait, we have N in the word? But if N is at 3? 
     Actually: 
        If N at position 2: A N _ T ... words: ANTED (E forbidden), ANTSY (S and Y forbidden) -> invalid.
        If N at position 3: A _ N T ... words: COUNT? But O, U, N? But N is at 3? But also: COUNT has C? forbidden? 
        How about ""AUNT"": but 4 letters? 
        How about ""ADAPT""? 
          A D A P T? But duplicate A? And P and D? And we don't know if allowed? Also, A at 1 and N at? There is no N? So we need N? 
        But we know the word has N? So ""ADAPT"" doesn't contain N? Then invalid? 

   Alternatively? 
     ""ANKHS""? not common.

   What about ""MANTA"": 
     M A N T A? But M is possible? And A at 1? No: we start with A? 
     Actually: if A at pos1, then words starting with A? 

   How about ""ABOUT"": 
      A B O U T? But O,U,B? And no N? So not.

   How about ""AGENT"": 
      A G E N T? But E is forbidden? 

   How about ""ALIGN"": 
      A L I G N? 
          Position1: A
          Position4: T? Actually no: we need position4 to be T? So our word structure must have T at position4? 
          But ""ALIGN"" has no letter at position4? It has G? So position4 is G? We need T? 

   So we must have T at position4? 

   Word: A B C T D? 

   Let me try: ""ADAPT"" doesn't have N? 
              ""ADMIT"": A D M I T? 
                  But T is at position5? Not at position4? So we need to shift:
                  For a word ADMIT: 
                    Pos1: A, Pos2: D, Pos3: M, Pos4: I, Pos5: T? Doesn't have N? 

   How about ""ADULT"": 
        A D U L T? T at 5? not 4? And no N? 

   Another word: ""ACTIN"": 
        A C T I N? But C and T: T is at 3? Not at 4? And C forbidden? 

   So maybe words starting with A and having T at position4? And containing N? 

   Example: ""ADMIN"" -> 
        A D M I N? -> Positions: 
          Pos1: A
          Pos2: D
          Pos3: M
          Pos4: I? But we need T? 

   So we need T at position4? 

   How about ""AORTA""? 
        A O R T A? Doesn't have N? And R forbidden? 

   How about ""ANITA""? 
        A N I T A? 
          Then: 
             Pos1: A? 
             Pos2: N? 
             Pos4: T? So that works? 
          Checking: A, N, I, T, A? 
          Positions: 
            1: A
            2: N
            3: I
            4: T
            5: A? 

        But we need to check: 
          A: we expect at 1? But we also have A at 5? So if A is at 1, that could be correct? And if the secret word has two A's? 

        Also, we have N at position2? 

        Now, is ""ANITA"" a word? It's a name? An English word? Sometimes accepted? But we need valid English word? 

   Alternatively, consider: ""ADAPT"" fails? 
   What about ""ADNEX"": not common? 

So it seems hard? We need word: A ? ? T ? and must contain N? 

Option 2: A at position 5?
   Then structure: ? ? ? T A
   With N in position2 or3? 
      If N at position2: then _ N _ T A
      If N at position3: then ? ? N T A

   Examples:
     For N at position2: 
        ""ON T A"": ???
        ""IN T A"": 
        Words: UNITS -> U N I T S? But S forbidden? 
               MINTY? Y forbidden? 
               PINTS? S forbidden? 

        How about ""MANTA""? 
          M A N T A? 
          Positions: 
            Pos1: M
            Pos2: A? -> but we need A at pos5? And we have A at pos2? 
          Actually: if A is at pos5? Then structure: ? ? ? T A? 
          ""MANTA"": M A N T A -> so 
            Pos1: M
            Pos2: A -> but we also have A at pos5? 
          Now, we get A at two positions? 

        But note: we require A to be at position5? So the second occurrence must be ignored? Actually, in Wordle feedback? 
        But in our previous guess? ... 

        Alternatively, a word without duplicates: 
          How about ""BUNTA""? Not common? 

        How about ""DENTA""? But E is forbidden? 

     For N at position3: 
        Structure: ? ? N T A
        Examples: 
           ""HANT A"" -> H as first? 
           ""FONT A"" -> F O N T A? 
           ""COUNT A""? Not letters? 
           ""BONTA""? 
           ""LONTA""? Not common? 
        Actually: ""DINTA"" -> not common? 
        ""PINTA"" -> P I N T A? That is a known word? (a unit of volume)? So ""PINTA"": 
          P I N T A
          Pos1: P, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: T, Pos5: A.

        Now, this fits: 
          A at position5? Yes? 
          N at position3? Yes? 
          T at position4? Yes? 
          And letters: P, I? We haven't tried? And no forbidden letters? 
          Also, note: we have not eliminated P or I? 

        Also, in the structure: 
          There may be other words? 

        But check: Is there A at position5? And N at position3? 

        Also, we need to see if it violates any feedback? 
          First guess: CRANE -> A was at position3? We had '-' meaning A is present? So in ""PINTA"", A is at position5? So the A is present? 
          Also, N at position3? Previously in first guess, N was at position4? Here at position3? 

        How about the feedback we had: 
          In second guess, we had N at pos1: got '-' (so N present but not at1)? That doesn't conflict? 
          And A at pos2: got '-'? Now in ""PINTA"", A is at pos5? 

        So ""PINTA"" seems a possible candidate? 

        But note: we have two positions unknown? Position1 and 2? We put P and I? 

        Also we don't know if they are present? 

        Alternatively, we can think of other words? 
          ""TAWTA""? Not? 
          ""ANT? with A at5? No? 
        Other possibilities: ""PINT A"" (separate?) not? 

        Now, but we don't know the word? So we need to guess? 

        However, note: we don't have to get the exact word? We can use a guess that includes more information? For example? 

If we are not sure, we can try a word that tests both possibilities? Probably we need to test A at possible positions? But we are forced to choose one? 

But note: we can make a guess that helps us determine the position of A? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A at the ends? Wait? Actually, we deduced A must be at 1 or 5? 

So let's think: 
   Option: try a word that has A at position1? 
   Then we can know? 

But we haven't tested many letters? 

Another idea: use a word that contains some common letters? 

But we have constraints: 
   - Position4 must be T? 
   - The word must contain A and N? 
   - A must be either at position1 or position5? 

We can choose a word that has A at position1? But we don't know? 

We can also try a word that tests A at position1? If we guess a word starting with A, then:
   If we get A: ✓, then we know A at1? 
   If we get A: -, then we know A is in the word but not at1? Then it must be at position5? 

Similarly, we can test A at position5 separately? 

But we have only limited tries? 

So guess a word that puts A at position1? For example: 
   Words: A ? ? T ?   and must have N? 

We had problems finding words? But let's try again: 
   How about ""APATH"": not a word? 
   ""AVA T"": 
   ""ABOUT"": not? 

But we need N? 

How about ""AUNTY"": 
   A U N T Y? But Y is forbidden? 

How about ""APNEA"": 
   A P N E A? But E forbidden? 

How about ""ADAPT"": without E? 

But if we can't find one? Then maybe A at position5 is more likely? 

Since we can try to guess words? 

How about ""PAINT""? 
   But in the beginning? 
   P A I N T -> 
      Positions: 
        1: P
        2: A -> but we know A is not at position2? Because in second guess? 
        3: I
        4: N -> but position4 must be T? So not? 

   So invalid? 

Therefore, let me try to guess ""PINTA""? 
   But note: we don't know the word? But it fits? 

Alternatively? 
   Another word: ""MAN TO""? 

   Actually, let's search for a word: 
      Pattern: 
        Option: A at pos5? Then: [Letter][Letter][N?][T][A]
        Or A at pos5? And N at pos2? [Letter][N][letter][T][A]

   Words: 
      For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": 
        Possible: PINTA, MINTA? But MINTA? not common? 
        Also: HINTA? Not 
        Actually: words ending ""NT A""? 
        But check: ""QUOTA"" -> no N? 
        ""CON TA"": not? 
        But ""PINTA"" is a word? It is accepted? 

   For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": we have PINTA? 

   Or ""_ N _ T A"": 
        Candidates: IN T A? 
        Words: ON T A? INTAA? Not? 
        Actually: ""UN T A"" -> 
        Words: MENTA? -> M E N T A? But E forbidden? 
        HENTA? E? 
        BENTA? E? 
        LENTA? E? 

        But we avoid E? 

        How about ""JNTA""? Not? 
        ""KINTA""? not common? 
        ""DINT A"" -> D I N T A? Actually, ""DINTA"" is not standard? 

   So ""PINTA"" seems the best candidate? 

But note: In the feedback, we got T at position4? So we have to keep that? 

So our guess will be ""PINTA""? 

But what if we are wrong? 

Alternatively, we can test more letters? 

For example, we might choose a word that has T at position4? and A at position5? So we are testing A at position5? And what about N? We don't know its position? 

But we are also testing P, I? 

If we guess ""PINTA"", then we get:
   - P? It may be absent? Or present? 
   - I? same? 
   And if A is at5? And we get it correct? Then A at5 is ✓? 
   And if N is at3? ✓? 

But if the word is not ""PINTA"", then we get feedback? 

But since we have only 6 tries? And this is the third? 

Another word: what about ""POINT""? 
   P O I N T -> 
       Pos4: N? But we need T at position4? 
   So not? 

How about ""PAWNT""? 
   P A W N T -> 
       But A at2? But we know A is not at position2? So we will get '-' for A? 
       But structure: 
          Pos1: P
          Pos2: A (which we know belongs elsewhere? but we already know A is in the word? So it's redundant? 
       Also, T at5? 

   So not? 

So after reconsider? 
   We have two main cases? 

We can try a word that doesn't commit to A at1? and still tests other letters? 

But we have to include A? 

Let me think: since we have T at4? and positions: 
   Let's denote the positions: P1, P2, P3, P4(T), P5? 

We know:
   - P1: cannot be N? 
   - P2: cannot be A? 
   - P3: cannot be A? 
   - P4: T? 
   - P5: ? 

And A must be at P1 or P5? 

So if we choose a word starting with a letter that we haven't tested? And include A at P5? Then we get:

   Structure: [new letter] [new letter] [new letter] T A? 
   But we also require N? So one of the new letters must be N? Or two? 

Also, note: we cannot put N at P1? We know? But we already know P1 is not N? So we can put N at P2 or P3? 

So:
   Pattern: 
        Option: P1: ? , P2: ? , P3: N, P4: T, P5: A? 
        Or: P1: ? , P2: N, P3: ? , P4: T, P5: A?

   Example for first: ? ? N T A -> ""PAINTA"" is too long? Words: like PRINT? but too long? 
        Examples: ""PIT NA"" -> not? 
        Actually: 5 letters:  [Letter1][Letter2][N][T][A] 

   Words: 
        PRINT -> 5 letters? P R I N T? But R is forbidden? Doesn't fit? 
        MINTA? as above? 
        Other words: 
          ""TAINTS"" -> 6? 
          ""POINT"" has T at end? 

        Actually: ""PINTA"" is a known word? 

        So let's go with ""PINTA"".

   Alternatively, for the other pattern: [ ? , N, ? , T, A]? 
        Words: ""UN T A"" format? 
        ""IN T A""? 
        ""ON T A""? 
        But with letters: E forbidden? 
        ""ONCET""? Not? 
        ""UNITA"": U N I T A? 
          Then: 
            Pos1: U, Pos2: N, Pos3: I, Pos4: T, Pos5: A? 
          So: U N I T A? 
          But note: we have T at position4? Here T is at position4? 
          And A at position5? 
          And N at position2? 
          And doesn't use forbidden letters? 
          Also, ""UNITA"" is the plural of 'unita'? Italian? May not be accepted? 

   But valid English words? Are required? So PINTA is more common? 

Thus, I'll guess ""PINTA"".

Note: if we are right? Then we win? If not? Then feedback will help.

Alternatively, to be safe and test more letters? 

But let's do it.

<guess>pinta</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A and N are present but in wrong positions (not position 3 for A, not position 4 for N). C, R, E are absent.
2. **Guess 2 (NASTY)**: 
   - T is present and correctly placed at position 4.
   - N is present but not at position 1.
   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S and Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
- T is fixed at position 4.
- A must be at position 1 or 5 (excluded positions 2, 3, and 4 via feedback).
- N cannot be at positions 1 or 4 (excluded positions), so it must be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, Y.
- The word contains A, N, T, and two unknown letters.

For this guess, I prioritized:
- Testing A at position 5 (supported by the pattern `___TA`).
- Testing N at position 3 (to avoid conflicting positions if A is at 5).
- Introducing new, common letters (P and I) to gather more feedback.
- Ensuring no absent letters are used.

This approach led to the word **PINTA**:
- P (position 1, untested)
- I (position 2, untested)
- N (position 3, previously tested but not at this position)
- T (position 4, confirmed correct placement)
- A (position 5, a possible location per insights)

We can try to put A and N in different positions to test.\n\n But note: the position of A and N in the new guess might help us figure out where they are.\n\n For example, we can put A in a different position (say 1, 2, or 5) and N in a different position (say 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n\n We also want to include other common letters to get more information.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, etc.\n\n Considering: we know that the word has A and N, and we have 3 more letters to guess.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that:\n - Contains A and N.\n - Uses three new common letters (excluding C, R, E).\n\n Possible words: ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", ""GIANT"", ""SNAKE"", ""MANGO"", etc.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? Not yet.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, E.\n\n Let me try to come up with a word that places A and N in positions that are not the ones they were in (to avoid the same mistake) and also uses new letters.\n\n Example: \n - ""STAND"": \n   - S, T, A, N, D. \n   This includes A at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A) and N at position 4 (which we know is wrong for N) — so that would not change the positions? \n   Actually, we don\'t know if the secret word has A at position 3? The previous feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would expect a \'-\' if it\'s wrong? But we already know it\'s not at 3, so we shouldn\'t put A at 3 again if we want to find where it is.\n\n We need to place A not at position 3 and N not at position 4.\n\n So in the new guess, we should try A at a different position (1,2,4,5) and N at a different position (1,2,3,5). \n\n Also, we want to avoid repeating the same letters that we haven\'t yet cleared? For example, we don\'t know about S, T, etc.\n\n Consider ""STAND"":\n   A is at position 3 -> we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should not put A at 3. Therefore, ""STAND"" is not a good choice because it puts A at 3.\n\n How about ""SNAIL""? \n   S, N, A, I, L.\n   A is at position 3? -> same problem.\n\n How about ""ADMIN""? \n   A at 1, D, M, I, N at 5? \n   But note: N is at position 5 -> which is not position 4? Yeah, so that\'s okay? \n   Also, A is at position 1 -> which is new.\n\n So ""ADMIN"": \n   - A at position 1: if the secret word has A at 1, we get ✓. If not, we might get \'-\' or \'x\'. \n   - N at position 5: similarly.\n\n But note: the previous feedback tells us that A is in the word (so we know it\'s somewhere) and N is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, what about ""PLAIN""? \n   P, L, A, I, N -> A at position 3 again -> avoid.\n\n How about ""DINKA""? \n   D, I, N, K, A -> N at 3 (which is new) and A at 5 (new) — so this is good? But not a common word? Actually, ""DINKA"" might be proper? We need valid English words.\n\n Another idea: ""PAINT""? \n   P, A, I, N, T -> A at position 2, which is new; N at position 4 — we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4? Actually, no: the previous feedback said that N was at position 4 and that was incorrect. But that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, no: the feedback for N in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at the position we guessed (4). So we must avoid putting N at position 4 again? Actually, we can put it again? But if we know that position 4 is not N, then why test again? We want to test N at a different position.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position 4 again because we already know that it isn\'t there. Similarly for A at position 3.\n\n So ""PAINT"":\n   A at position 2 -> new\n   N at position 4 -> but we know N is not in position 4? Actually, the feedback told us that the position for N is wrong, meaning that the N in our first guess was in position 4 and that position was incorrect. So in the secret word, the letter at position 4 is not N, therefore we shouldn\'t put N at position 4 again because it will again be wrong. We want to test N in a new position to see if we can find the right one.\n\n Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because it puts N in position 4.\n\n How about ""PANIC""?\n   P, A, N, I, C -> but C is absent? We know C is not in the word -> so we cannot use C.\n\n How about ""MANIA""? \n   M, A, N, I, A -> that has duplicate A? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us anything about duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback may mark each occurrence appropriately.\n\n But we need a word without C, R, E.\n\n ""MANIA"": \n   A: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5.\n\n But note: we know that A cannot be at position 3? So putting A at 2 and 5? That\'s okay, but we have two A\'s? \n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? The feedback from the first guess had only one A and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word has only one A, then our two A\'s might be problematic? But it\'s allowed to guess words with duplicate letters even if the word doesn\'t have duplicates? The rules don\'t forbid it.\n\n But in this case, we are not sure. Also, we don\'t know if the word has M, I.\n\n However, let me pick a word without duplicate and without forbidden letters. \n\n How about ""BALM""? But that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n Think of: ""PLAIN"" has A at position 3 -> avoid.\n\n ""CANAL"" has C and A at 3? -> C is absent and A at 3 is bad.\n\n ""SALAD""? -> duplicate A? Also, A is at position 2 and 4? We can test.\n\n But let\'s try to avoid duplicates for now? Because they complicate the feedback.\n\n Another word: ""DAUNT""?\n   D at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n   But we know N is not at position 4? So why put N at position 4? It will definitely not be correct? And we already know that.\n\n We should avoid known incorrect position for a given letter? So placing N at 4 again would be a waste of a letter position? We want to use that position to test a new letter? So better to put N in a position we haven\'t tested? \n\n Since the word has 5 positions and N is not at position 4, we should test it in positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n Similarly, A is not at position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 for A.\n\n Therefore, let me look for words that:\n   Include A and N, \n   Do not include C, R, E,\n   Place A in one of {1,2,4,5} and N in one of {1,2,3,5},\n   And the word should be valid.\n\n Common words: \n   ""PLANT"": has A at 4? No: P,L,A at 3? -> avoid A at 3.\n   ""STAND"": S,T,A at 3? -> avoid.\n\n   ""NASTY"": \n      N at position 1 -> we can test that.\n      A at position 2 -> new.\n      S,T,Y: new letters.\n      So: N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\n   Also, ""NASTY"" avoids the positions we know: \n      A is not at 3? Check: yes, it\'s at 2 -> good.\n      N is not at 4? It\'s at 1 -> good.\n\n   And it has new letters: S, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""BALSA"": B,A,L,S,A -> but duplicate A? \n   A at 2 and 5? And we don\'t want that.\n\n Another idea: ""TIDAL""? \n   T at 1, I at 2, D at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> that puts A at position 4 (new) and doesn\'t include N? But we need to include N.\n\n We must include both A and N? Because we know they are present.\n\n What words have both A and N? \n\n Let\'s try: ""ADMIN"" -> we thought of earlier: \n   A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5 -> that\'s acceptable? Yes.\n\n But is ""ADMIN"" a valid word? Yes, meaning administration.\n\n However, note that we have used: A, D, M, I, N. None of these are the forbidden ones? And A at 1 and N at 5.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPAIN"": \n   S, P, A, I, N -> A at 3? -> avoid position 3.\n\n ""PAINS""? \n   P, A, I, N, S -> A at position 2 and N at position 4? But we know N is not at 4 -> so avoid.\n\n ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A at 2, N at 4? -> avoid N at 4.\n\n So ""NASTY"" seems good: N at 1, A at 2 -> both are in new positions.\n\n Therefore, let me go with ""NASTY"".\n\n Alternatively, ""DAISY"": \n   D, A, I, S, Y -> no N. But we must include N? Wait, we know from the first guess that A and N are present? Yes, because we got \'-\' for A and N.\n\n So we have to include both? Otherwise, if we make a guess without one of them, then we won\'t get information? But we already know they are present? Actually, we don\'t have to include them? But if we don\'t include them, we can\'t find their positions.\n\n However, the feedback will tell us: \n   If we don\'t include A and the secret word has A, then we get feedback for the letters we guess. But we already know A is present? Actually, that doesn\'t change. We don\'t need to always include the known letters? We can use a word without A to test other letters? But then we risk being inefficient? \n\n But considering we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover the known present letters to pin down their positions? \n\n Therefore, I think it\'s wise to include both A and N in the next guess.\n\n So ""NASTY"" is a good choice: \n   It places N at position 1 (which is a new position) and A at position 2 (new).\n   It introduces S, T, Y.\n\n We hope that one of these positions is correct? Or at least we\'ll get new information.\n\n So I will guess ""NASTY"".\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)), we can derive the following:\n1. The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word.\n2. The letter A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n3. The letter N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n\nTherefore:\n- The new guess must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).\n- A must be placed in a position that isn\'t 3 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- N must be placed in a position that isn\'t 4 (i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The guess must avoid C, R, and E entirely.\n\nWe choose ""NASTY"" for the second guess because:\n- It places N in position 1 (a new position to test) and A in position 2 (a new position).\n- It introduces three new common letters (S, T, Y) to gather additional feedback.\n- It adheres to all constraints and maximizes information gain by testing A and N in unprobed positions.\n\nNew attempt:\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\nFirst guess (""crane""):\n  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\nSecond guess (""nasty""):\n  N(-), A(-), S(x), T(✓), Y(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n1. From the first guess, we know:\n   - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.\n   - C, R, E are not in the word.\n\n2. From the second guess (""nasty""):\n   - N(-): N is in the word but not at position 1.\n   - A(-): A is in the word but not at position 2.\n   - S(x): S is not in the word.\n   - T(✓): T is in the word and at position 4. (Because in ""nasty"", T is the fourth letter.)\n   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Absolute truths:\n  - T is at position 4. (So the secret word has T as its fourth letter.)\n  - The word contains A and N (from first guess, confirmed again by presence but wrong position in second guess).\n  - S and Y are absent, so we can eliminate them.\n  - C, R, E are absent (previously known).\n\n- Positions we know are incorrect for A: position 3 (from first guess) and position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A can only be in positions 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by T? Actually, note: positions are independent. Position 4 is taken by T, so A cannot be at position 4? Actually, we don\'t know if T is the only letter? But the secret word is 5 letters. We know:\n    Position 1: not N (from second guess: N(-) at pos1)\n    Position 2: not A (from second guess: A(-) at pos2)\n    Position 3: not A (from first guess) -> but we haven\'t tested A at position 3 again? Actually, we already know it\'s not at 3 from the first guess? Yes.\n    Position 4: confirmed T (from T(✓) at pos4)\n    Position 5: we don\'t know.\n\nSo for A: it must be either in position 1 or position 5? Why?\nBecause positions:\n  - Position 3: from first guess, we know A is not there.\n  - Position 2: from second guess, we know A is not there.\n  - Position 4: now we know it is T, so A cannot be at position 4 either? Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for N:\n  We know:\n    - From first guess: N is not at position 4? Actually, that was the position we guessed (in CRANE, N was in position 4). But note: now position 4 is T, so it\'s definitely not N? So N cannot be at position 4? But we already knew that? \n    - From second guess: N is not at position 1 (because we guessed N at pos1 and got \'-\')\n    - What about other positions?\n        Position 2: we don\'t know? We haven\'t tested N at position 2? But in the second guess, we had A at position 2? So that spot was taken by A? We haven\'t tested N at 2? \n        Similarly, position 3: we haven\'t tested? \n        Position 5: we haven\'t tested?\n\nTherefore, N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions and we know:\n  - Position 4 is T (fixed).\n  - N is in one of the other positions? \n  - We know it\'s not at pos1 (from second guess) and not at pos4? So positions 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: we also have A that is either at position 1 or 5? So position 1 might be A? Or position 5? And N must be in 2,3,or5? But if A is at position 5, then N can be at 2 or 3? And if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or5? \n\nAlso, we have two additional letters? Actually, the word must be made of:\n   Letters: A, N, T, and two more letters that we don\'t know? Because we don\'t have full information? \n\nBut we know the word has 5 letters? And we know:\n   - Contains A, N, T (and T is at position 4).\n   - We know that from first and second guesses, we only have these three letters? But there must be two more.\n\nWe also know that the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, Y.\n\nSo what letters are possible? We\'ve only used: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and N, A, S, T, Y (second guess). So absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y.\n\nTherefore, available letters: all English letters except C, R, E, S, Y? Also, we haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? But we can use any that make a valid word.\n\nNow, let\'s form a possible word that:\n   - Has T at position 4.\n   - Contains A and N.\n   - Places A at either position 1 or 5? Because we know it\'s not in 2,3,4? And we know 4 is T.\n   - Places N in position 2, 3, or 5? But note: if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5? So if A is at position 5, N must be at 2 or 3? Similarly, if A is at position 1, then N can be at 2,3, or 5? (but not always because we have 5 positions? And we have two other letters.)\n\nWe also need two more letters. So we\'ll choose common letters? Or letters that we haven\'t tested to get more information.\n\nBut we already have T at 4, so we know that letter? So let\'s focus on the other positions.\n\nPossible structures:\nOption 1: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A? \n   Then the word: A ? ? T ? \n   With N in 2,3, or5? And the two other letters?\n\nOption 2: A at position 5? Then the word: ? ? ? T A\n   With N in 2,3? (because if in 5, then conflict? Actually, but then N cannot be at 5 if A is there? And we cannot have two letters?) So if A at 5, N must be in 2 or 3.\n\nNow, let\'s try to think of words that fit:\n\nCase A at pos1? \n   Words: A _ _ T _\n   With N in the word either at position 2, 3, or the last (5th)? \n   Also, remember we have two other letters? \n\n   Examples: \n     ANTIC? But contains I and C? C is forbidden? So not.\n     ANKLE? But E is forbidden? \n     ANVIL? V and I? \n     ALPHA? But P and H? And doesn\'t have N? Wait, we have N in the word? But if N is at 3? \n     Actually: \n        If N at position 2: A N _ T ... words: ANTED (E forbidden), ANTSY (S and Y forbidden) -> invalid.\n        If N at position 3: A _ N T ... words: COUNT? But O, U, N? But N is at 3? But also: COUNT has C? forbidden? \n        How about ""AUNT"": but 4 letters? \n        How about ""ADAPT""? \n          A D A P T? But duplicate A? And P and D? And we don\'t know if allowed? Also, A at 1 and N at? There is no N? So we need N? \n        But we know the word has N? So ""ADAPT"" doesn\'t contain N? Then invalid? \n\n   Alternatively? \n     ""ANKHS""? not common.\n\n   What about ""MANTA"": \n     M A N T A? But M is possible? And A at 1? No: we start with A? \n     Actually: if A at pos1, then words starting with A? \n\n   How about ""ABOUT"": \n      A B O U T? But O,U,B? And no N? So not.\n\n   How about ""AGENT"": \n      A G E N T? But E is forbidden? \n\n   How about ""ALIGN"": \n      A L I G N? \n          Position1: A\n          Position4: T? Actually no: we need position4 to be T? So our word structure must have T at position4? \n          But ""ALIGN"" has no letter at position4? It has G? So position4 is G? We need T? \n\n   So we must have T at position4? \n\n   Word: A B C T D? \n\n   Let me try: ""ADAPT"" doesn\'t have N? \n              ""ADMIT"": A D M I T? \n                  But T is at position5? Not at position4? So we need to shift:\n                  For a word ADMIT: \n                    Pos1: A, Pos2: D, Pos3: M, Pos4: I, Pos5: T? Doesn\'t have N? \n\n   How about ""ADULT"": \n        A D U L T? T at 5? not 4? And no N? \n\n   Another word: ""ACTIN"": \n        A C T I N? But C and T: T is at 3? Not at 4? And C forbidden? \n\n   So maybe words starting with A and having T at position4? And containing N? \n\n   Example: ""ADMIN"" -> \n        A D M I N? -> Positions: \n          Pos1: A\n          Pos2: D\n          Pos3: M\n          Pos4: I? But we need T? \n\n   So we need T at position4? \n\n   How about ""AORTA""? \n        A O R T A? Doesn\'t have N? And R forbidden? \n\n   How about ""ANITA""? \n        A N I T A? \n          Then: \n             Pos1: A? \n             Pos2: N? \n             Pos4: T? So that works? \n          Checking: A, N, I, T, A? \n          Positions: \n            1: A\n            2: N\n            3: I\n            4: T\n            5: A? \n\n        But we need to check: \n          A: we expect at 1? But we also have A at 5? So if A is at 1, that could be correct? And if the secret word has two A\'s? \n\n        Also, we have N at position2? \n\n        Now, is ""ANITA"" a word? It\'s a name? An English word? Sometimes accepted? But we need valid English word? \n\n   Alternatively, consider: ""ADAPT"" fails? \n   What about ""ADNEX"": not common? \n\nSo it seems hard? We need word: A ? ? T ? and must contain N? \n\nOption 2: A at position 5?\n   Then structure: ? ? ? T A\n   With N in position2 or3? \n      If N at position2: then _ N _ T A\n      If N at position3: then ? ? N T A\n\n   Examples:\n     For N at position2: \n        ""ON T A"": ???\n        ""IN T A"": \n        Words: UNITS -> U N I T S? But S forbidden? \n               MINTY? Y forbidden? \n               PINTS? S forbidden? \n\n        How about ""MANTA""? \n          M A N T A? \n          Positions: \n            Pos1: M\n            Pos2: A? -> but we need A at pos5? And we have A at pos2? \n          Actually: if A is at pos5? Then structure: ? ? ? T A? \n          ""MANTA"": M A N T A -> so \n            Pos1: M\n            Pos2: A -> but we also have A at pos5? \n          Now, we get A at two positions? \n\n        But note: we require A to be at position5? So the second occurrence must be ignored? Actually, in Wordle feedback? \n        But in our previous guess? ... \n\n        Alternatively, a word without duplicates: \n          How about ""BUNTA""? Not common? \n\n        How about ""DENTA""? But E is forbidden? \n\n     For N at position3: \n        Structure: ? ? N T A\n        Examples: \n           ""HANT A"" -> H as first? \n           ""FONT A"" -> F O N T A? \n           ""COUNT A""? Not letters? \n           ""BONTA""? \n           ""LONTA""? Not common? \n        Actually: ""DINTA"" -> not common? \n        ""PINTA"" -> P I N T A? That is a known word? (a unit of volume)? So ""PINTA"": \n          P I N T A\n          Pos1: P, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: T, Pos5: A.\n\n        Now, this fits: \n          A at position5? Yes? \n          N at position3? Yes? \n          T at position4? Yes? \n          And letters: P, I? We haven\'t tried? And no forbidden letters? \n          Also, note: we have not eliminated P or I? \n\n        Also, in the structure: \n          There may be other words? \n\n        But check: Is there A at position5? And N at position3? \n\n        Also, we need to see if it violates any feedback? \n          First guess: CRANE -> A was at position3? We had \'-\' meaning A is present? So in ""PINTA"", A is at position5? So the A is present? \n          Also, N at position3? Previously in first guess, N was at position4? Here at position3? \n\n        How about the feedback we had: \n          In second guess, we had N at pos1: got \'-\' (so N present but not at1)? That doesn\'t conflict? \n          And A at pos2: got \'-\'? Now in ""PINTA"", A is at pos5? \n\n        So ""PINTA"" seems a possible candidate? \n\n        But note: we have two positions unknown? Position1 and 2? We put P and I? \n\n        Also we don\'t know if they are present? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think of other words? \n          ""TAWTA""? Not? \n          ""ANT? with A at5? No? \n        Other possibilities: ""PINT A"" (separate?) not? \n\n        Now, but we don\'t know the word? So we need to guess? \n\n        However, note: we don\'t have to get the exact word? We can use a guess that includes more information? For example? \n\nIf we are not sure, we can try a word that tests both possibilities? Probably we need to test A at possible positions? But we are forced to choose one? \n\nBut note: we can make a guess that helps us determine the position of A? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have A at the ends? Wait? Actually, we deduced A must be at 1 or 5? \n\nSo let\'s think: \n   Option: try a word that has A at position1? \n   Then we can know? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested many letters? \n\nAnother idea: use a word that contains some common letters? \n\nBut we have constraints: \n   - Position4 must be T? \n   - The word must contain A and N? \n   - A must be either at position1 or position5? \n\nWe can choose a word that has A at position1? But we don\'t know? \n\nWe can also try a word that tests A at position1? If we guess a word starting with A, then:\n   If we get A: ✓, then we know A at1? \n   If we get A: -, then we know A is in the word but not at1? Then it must be at position5? \n\nSimilarly, we can test A at position5 separately? \n\nBut we have only limited tries? \n\nSo guess a word that puts A at position1? For example: \n   Words: A ? ? T ?   and must have N? \n\nWe had problems finding words? But let\'s try again: \n   How about ""APATH"": not a word? \n   ""AVA T"": \n   ""ABOUT"": not? \n\nBut we need N? \n\nHow about ""AUNTY"": \n   A U N T Y? But Y is forbidden? \n\nHow about ""APNEA"": \n   A P N E A? But E forbidden? \n\nHow about ""ADAPT"": without E? \n\nBut if we can\'t find one? Then maybe A at position5 is more likely? \n\nSince we can try to guess words? \n\nHow about ""PAINT""? \n   But in the beginning? \n   P A I N T -> \n      Positions: \n        1: P\n        2: A -> but we know A is not at position2? Because in second guess? \n        3: I\n        4: N -> but position4 must be T? So not? \n\n   So invalid? \n\nTherefore, let me try to guess ""PINTA""? \n   But note: we don\'t know the word? But it fits? \n\nAlternatively? \n   Another word: ""MAN TO""? \n\n   Actually, let\'s search for a word: \n      Pattern: \n        Option: A at pos5? Then: [Letter][Letter][N?][T][A]\n        Or A at pos5? And N at pos2? [Letter][N][letter][T][A]\n\n   Words: \n      For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": \n        Possible: PINTA, MINTA? But MINTA? not common? \n        Also: HINTA? Not \n        Actually: words ending ""NT A""? \n        But check: ""QUOTA"" -> no N? \n        ""CON TA"": not? \n        But ""PINTA"" is a word? It is accepted? \n\n   For pattern ""_ _ N T A"": we have PINTA? \n\n   Or ""_ N _ T A"": \n        Candidates: IN T A? \n        Words: ON T A? INTAA? Not? \n        Actually: ""UN T A"" -> \n        Words: MENTA? -> M E N T A? But E forbidden? \n        HENTA? E? \n        BENTA? E? \n        LENTA? E? \n\n        But we avoid E? \n\n        How about ""JNTA""? Not? \n        ""KINTA""? not common? \n        ""DINT A"" -> D I N T A? Actually, ""DINTA"" is not standard? \n\n   So ""PINTA"" seems the best candidate? \n\nBut note: In the feedback, we got T at position4? So we have to keep that? \n\nSo our guess will be ""PINTA""? \n\nBut what if we are wrong? \n\nAlternatively, we can test more letters? \n\nFor example, we might choose a word that has T at position4? and A at position5? So we are testing A at position5? And what about N? We don\'t know its position? \n\nBut we are also testing P, I? \n\nIf we guess ""PINTA"", then we get:\n   - P? It may be absent? Or present? \n   - I? same? \n   And if A is at5? And we get it correct? Then A at5 is ✓? \n   And if N is at3? ✓? \n\nBut if the word is not ""PINTA"", then we get feedback? \n\nBut since we have only 6 tries? And this is the third? \n\nAnother word: what about ""POINT""? \n   P O I N T -> \n       Pos4: N? But we need T at position4? \n   So not? \n\nHow about ""PAWNT""? \n   P A W N T -> \n       But A at2? But we know A is not at position2? So we will get \'-\' for A? \n       But structure: \n          Pos1: P\n          Pos2: A (which we know belongs elsewhere? but we already know A is in the word? So it\'s redundant? \n       Also, T at5? \n\n   So not? \n\nSo after reconsider? \n   We have two main cases? \n\nWe can try a word that doesn\'t commit to A at1? and still tests other letters? \n\nBut we have to include A? \n\nLet me think: since we have T at4? and positions: \n   Let\'s denote the positions: P1, P2, P3, P4(T), P5? \n\nWe know:\n   - P1: cannot be N? \n   - P2: cannot be A? \n   - P3: cannot be A? \n   - P4: T? \n   - P5: ? \n\nAnd A must be at P1 or P5? \n\nSo if we choose a word starting with a letter that we haven\'t tested? And include A at P5? Then we get:\n\n   Structure: [new letter] [new letter] [new letter] T A? \n   But we also require N? So one of the new letters must be N? Or two? \n\nAlso, note: we cannot put N at P1? We know? But we already know P1 is not N? So we can put N at P2 or P3? \n\nSo:\n   Pattern: \n        Option: P1: ? , P2: ? , P3: N, P4: T, P5: A? \n        Or: P1: ? , P2: N, P3: ? , P4: T, P5: A?\n\n   Example for first: ? ? N T A -> ""PAINTA"" is too long? Words: like PRINT? but too long? \n        Examples: ""PIT NA"" -> not? \n        Actually: 5 letters:  [Letter1][Letter2][N][T][A] \n\n   Words: \n        PRINT -> 5 letters? P R I N T? But R is forbidden? Doesn\'t fit? \n        MINTA? as above? \n        Other words: \n          ""TAINTS"" -> 6? \n          ""POINT"" has T at end? \n\n        Actually: ""PINTA"" is a known word? \n\n        So let\'s go with ""PINTA"".\n\n   Alternatively, for the other pattern: [ ? , N, ? , T, A]? \n        Words: ""UN T A"" format? \n        ""IN T A""? \n        ""ON T A""? \n        But with letters: E forbidden? \n        ""ONCET""? Not? \n        ""UNITA"": U N I T A? \n          Then: \n            Pos1: U, Pos2: N, Pos3: I, Pos4: T, Pos5: A? \n          So: U N I T A? \n          But note: we have T at position4? Here T is at position4? \n          And A at position5? \n          And N at position2? \n          And doesn\'t use forbidden letters? \n          Also, ""UNITA"" is the plural of \'unita\'? Italian? May not be accepted? \n\n   But valid English words? Are required? So PINTA is more common? \n\nThus, I\'ll guess ""PINTA"".\n\nNote: if we are right? Then we win? If not? Then feedback will help.\n\nAlternatively, to be safe and test more letters? \n\nBut let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>pinta</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A and N are present but in wrong positions (not position 3 for A, not position 4 for N).

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: absent (x)
  R: absent (x)
  A: present, wrong position (-)
  N: present, wrong position (-)
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""nasty""
  N: present, wrong position (-)  [so not position 1]
  A: present, wrong position (-)  [so not position 2]
  S: absent (x)
  T: correct position (✓) at position 4
  Y: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""pinta""
  P: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  N: correct position (✓) at position 3
  T: correct position (✓) at position 4
  A: correct position (✓) at position 5

So now we know:
- The secret word has T at position 4, N at position 3, and A at position 5. 
  Therefore, the word ends with ""NTA"" (positions 3,4,5: N, T, A).

- From guess 3, we also know that P and I are absent.

- From previous guesses, we know that C, R, E, S, Y are absent.

- The word must have two more letters: one at position 1 and one at position 2.

- We know the letters at position 1 and 2 are not any of the absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y, P, I.

- Also, from guess 1, we know that A was present but not at position 3 (which we now know is N) and not at position 4 (T) or 5 (A) in that guess? Actually, in guess 1, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. Now we know A is at position 5. Similarly, N was at position 4 in guess 1 and got '-', but now we know it's at position 3.

- The word has exactly 5 letters: [letter1] [letter2] N T A

- We need to find the first two letters.

- The absent letters so far: C, R, E, S, Y, P, I.

- We have used: A, N, T (which are in the word) and the absent ones.

- The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

- We need to form a word that has the pattern: _ _ N T A

- And the first two letters must be from the remaining letters.

Common words ending with ""NTA"":
  Examples: 
    ""SANTA"" -> but S is absent? (from guess 2: S(x)) -> invalid.
    ""MANTA"": M A N T A -> positions: M at1, A at2, N at3, T at4, A at5? 
        But we have A at position 5? And in this word, A is also at position 2? 
        However, we know from guess 2: we had A at position 2 and got a '-' meaning that A is not at position 2? 
        Therefore, ""MANTA"" would have A at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not A? So invalid.

    ""BANTA"": not a common word? 
    ""CANTA"": C is absent? 
    ""DANTA"": D A N T A -> again, A at position 2? which we know is not allowed? 

    ""FANTA"": F A N T A -> A at position 2? invalid.

    ""HANTA"": H A N T A -> A at position 2? invalid.

    ""JANTA"": J A N T A -> A at position 2? invalid.

    ""KANTA"": K A N T A -> A at position 2? invalid.

    ""LANTA"": L A N T A -> A at position 2? invalid.

    ""MANTA"" and others with A at position 2 are invalid.

    What about without A at position 2? 

    We need a word that has no A at position 2? 

    How about ""MINTA""? M I N T A -> but I is absent? (from guess 3: I(x)) -> invalid.

    ""PINTA"": we already tried? and got N(✓) T(✓) A(✓) but P and I absent? 

    So what words are left? 

    Consider: 
        ""BONTA"": B O N T A -> 
            Position1: B
            Position2: O
            Then: B O N T A? 
            Is that a word? Not common? 

        ""CONTA"": C is absent? 

        ""DONTA"": D O N T A? Not common? 

        ""FONTA"": F O N T A? Not common? 

        ""GONTA"": G O N T A? Not common? 

        ""HONTA"": H O N T A? Not common? 

        ""MONTA"": M O N T A? 
            This is a word? As in ""Monta"" (a name or place)? But we need a valid English word? 
            Alternatively, ""MONTA"" is not in the dictionary? 

        ""PONTA"": P is absent? 

        ""RONTA"": R is absent? 

        ""TONTA"": T O N T A? 
            But we have T at position1? But we don't know if T is duplicated? 
            However, we have T at position4? So if the word has two T's? 
            But in the feedback from guess 2: we had T at position4 and it was correct? 
            And in guess 3: T at position4? 
            But we haven't tested T at position1? 
            However, the feedback for T in guess 2 and 3 only showed at position4? 
            But if we have T at position1? Then it would be a duplicate? 
            The feedback for ""TONTA"": 
                Position1: T? 
                We don't know if T is duplicated? 

            But note: in the first guess, we had no T? 
            In the second guess, we had T at position4 and it was correct? 
            In the third guess, we had T at position4 and correct? 
            So we don't know if there is another T? 

            However, ""TONTA"" has T at position1? 

            But is ""TONTA"" a word? Not common? 

        ""WONTA"": W O N T A? 
            This is an archaic word meaning ""accustomed""? 

        ""ZONTA"": not common? 

    Another possibility: words with U? 
        ""DUNTA"": not common? 
        ""FUNTA"": not? 
        ""GUNTA"": not? 
        ""HUNTA"": not? 
        ""JUNTA"": J U N T A? 
            This is a common word: a political group? 
            Pattern: J at1, U at2, N at3, T at4, A at5? 
            Check: 
                Position2: U? 
                We haven't tested U? 
                And J is also new? 
                And no forbidden letters? 
                Also, no A at position2? 

            So ""JUNTA"" is a valid candidate? 

        ""LUNTA"": not? 
        ""MUNTA"": not? 
        ""PUNTA"": P is absent? 
        ""RUNTA"": R absent? 
        ""SUNTA"": S absent? 
        ""TUNTA"": T at1? and T at4? duplicate? 
        ""WUNTA"": not? 

    So ""JUNTA"" is a strong candidate? 

    Also, ""VOTAN""? Not? 

    Another word: ""BUNTA""? Not? 

    But note: we have the word ""JUNTA"". 

    Let me verify with feedback:

        In guess 1: 
            We had A and N present? 
            In ""JUNTA"": 
                A is at position5? -> present? 
                N is at position3? -> present? 
            So that matches? 

        In guess 2: 
            We had T at position4? correct? 
            And A at position2? but in ""JUNTA"", position2 is U? so A is not at position2? which matches the '-' for A? 
            And N at position1? but in ""JUNTA"", N is at position3? so not at position1? matches? 

        In guess 3: 
            We had N at3? correct? 
            T at4? correct? 
            A at5? correct? 
            And P and I absent? which matches? 

        Also, the absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y, P, I are all absent in ""JUNTA""? 

    Therefore, the secret word is likely ""JUNTA"".

    But note: we have to make a guess? 

    Alternatively, we can guess ""JUNTA"".

    However, we have only two more letters to find? And we have a candidate? 

    But we have to make sure? 

    Another candidate? ""WONTA""? 
        W O N T A? 
        Check: 
            Position2: O? 
            We haven't tested O? 
            But is it a valid word? It is archaic? 

        But ""JUNTA"" is more common? 

    So I'll go with ""JUNTA"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:
   - `C(x)`, `R(x)`, `A(-)`, `N(-)`, `E(x)`  
   → **A** and **N** are present (but not in positions 3 or 4).  
   → **C, R, E** are absent.

2. **Guess 2 (NASTY)**:
   - `N(-)`, `A(-)`, `S(x)`, `T(✓)`, `Y(x)`  
   → **T** is correct at position 4.  
   → **N** and **A** are present (but not in positions 1 or 2).  
   → **S, Y** are absent.

3. **Guess 3 (PINTA)**:
   - `P(x)`, `I(x)`, `N(✓)`, `T(✓)`, `A(✓)`  
   → **N** is correct at position 3, **T** at 4, **A** at 5.  
   → **P, I** are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **N**  
  - Position 4: **T**  
  - Position 5: **A**  
  → The word ends with **`NTA`**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, Y, P, I (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 2 require two new letters (not in the absent list).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Deduction:
- The word structure is `_ _ N T A`.
- **Position 2 cannot be A** (from Guess 2: `A(-)` at position 2).
- Common words fitting `_ _ N T A`:
  - `JUNTA` (valid English word: a political group).  
    - `J` and `U` are untested and not absent.  
    - Fits all constraints: `J` (position 1), `U` (position 2), `N` (3), `T` (4), `A` (5).  
  - Other candidates like `MANTA`/`BANTA` are invalid (A at position 2) or use absent letters (e.g., `MINTA` has `I`).  
  - Archaic words (e.g., `WONTA`) are less likely.

### Conclusion:
**JUNTA** is the strongest candidate. It:
- Uses new letters (`J`, `U`).
- Avoids absent letters.
- Matches all feedback (e.g., A not at position 2, N/T/A in correct positions).

    Another word: ""BUNTA""? Not? 

    But note: we have the word ""JUNTA"". 

    Let me verify with feedback:

        In guess 1: 
            We had A and N present? 
            In ""JUNTA"": 
                A is at position5? -> present? 
                N is at position3? -> present? 
            So that matches? 

        In guess 2: 
            We had T at position4? correct? 
            And A at position2? but in ""JUNTA"", position2 is U? so A is not at position2? which matches the '-' for A? 
            And N at position1? but in ""JUNTA"", N is at position3? so not at position1? matches? 

        In guess 3: 
            We had N at3? correct? 
            T at4? correct? 
            A at5? correct? 
            And P and I absent? which matches? 

        Also, the absent letters: C, R, E, S, Y, P, I are all absent in ""JUNTA""? 

    Therefore, the secret word is likely ""JUNTA"".

    But note: we have to make a guess? 

    Alternatively, we can guess ""JUNTA"".

    However, we have only two more letters to find? And we have a candidate? 

    But we have to make sure? 

    Another candidate? ""WONTA""? 
        W O N T A? 
        Check: 
            Position2: O? 
            We haven't tested O? 
            But is it a valid word? It is archaic? 

        But ""JUNTA"" is more common? 

    So I'll go with ""JUNTA"".

<guess>junta</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:
   - `C(x)`, `R(x)`, `A(-)`, `N(-)`, `E(x)`  
   → **A** and **N** are present (but not in positions 3 or 4).  
   → **C, R, E** are absent.

2. **Guess 2 (NASTY)**:
   - `N(-)`, `A(-)`, `S(x)`, `T(✓)`, `Y(x)`  
   → **T** is correct at position 4.  
   → **N** and **A** are present (but not in positions 1 or 2).  
   → **S, Y** are absent.

3. **Guess 3 (PINTA)**:
   - `P(x)`, `I(x)`, `N(✓)`, `T(✓)`, `A(✓)`  
   → **N** is correct at position 3, **T** at 4, **A** at 5.  
   → **P, I** are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **N**  
  - Position 4: **T**  
  - Position 5: **A**  
  → The word ends with **`NTA`**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, Y, P, I (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 2 require two new letters (not in the absent list).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Deduction:
- The word structure is `_ _ N T A`.
- **Position 2 cannot be A** (from Guess 2: `A(-)` at position 2).
- Common words fitting `_ _ N T A`:
  - `JUNTA` (valid English word: a political group).  
    - `J` and `U` are untested and not absent.  
    - Fits all constraints: `J` (position 1), `U` (position 2), `N` (3), `T` (4), `A` (5).  
  - Other candidates like `MANTA`/`BANTA` are invalid (A at position 2) or use absent letters (e.g., `MINTA` has `I`).  
  - Archaic words (e.g., `WONTA`) are less likely.

### Conclusion:
**JUNTA** is the strongest candidate. It:
- Uses new letters (`J`, `U`).
- Avoids absent letters.
- Matches all feedback (e.g., A not at position 2, N/T/A in correct positions).",Guess 4: junta -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) U(✓) N(✓) T(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
