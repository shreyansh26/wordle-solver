We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 We want a word that can give us good information about the secret word. Ideally, we choose a word that has common letters and covers different positions.

 One common strategy is to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SPARE"", etc. are often used.

 Let me choose ""ROATE"". This word includes common letters: R, O, A, T, E. It has vowels (O, A, E) and common consonants (R, T). 

 However, note that the response format requires the word to be valid. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (meaning: the cumulative return on investment over accounting periods).

 Alternatively, I can pick a more common starting word like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters and is a common starter.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

I am making my first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Good starting words typically include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E are all frequently used in English words
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five unique letters
- ""CRANE"" is a valid English word under game rules

This guess should provide strong feedback on letter presence/positions.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter in the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

We know that the third letter is A and the fifth letter is E.

Also, the letters C, R, N are definitely not in the word. So we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, for our second guess, we want to:
1. Test other letters in the remaining positions (first, second, fourth) to gather more information.
2. Avoid using the excluded letters C, R, N.

We know the word must be of the form _ _ A _ E.

Let's think of possible words that fit this pattern and exclude C, R, N.

We also want to test common vowels and consonants for the first, second, and fourth positions.

Note that in the fourth position, it must be a letter that can come before E and after A.

Potential words: 
- B_ A _ E: e.g., ""BLASE"", ""BAISE""? But note we can't have S because we don't know if S is in the word yet? Actually, we haven't tested S.
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common consonants for the beginning: S, T, L, etc.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A _ E and don't contain C, R, N.

Examples:
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)
- ""SNAKE"": but N is excluded, so no.
- ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> G is not tested yet.
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> P and D not tested.
- ""ABATE"": A is already used? But the first letter is A? Pattern is _ _ A _ E so first letter cannot be A? Because third is A. First and second letters are unknown.

But note: the word must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but N is excluded, so invalid.

We must avoid N, so ""PLANE"" is out.

""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but T is not excluded? However, we have A and E in place. So positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). Also, no C, R, N.

But we know that A and E are correct and in position, so in ""SLATE"", the A and E positions are exactly as required.

However, the feedback for the first guess told us that only A and E are in the word and correctly placed? We don't know if there are other letters.

Wait, the feedback: 
- C and x: not present
- R and x: not present
- A ✓: present and correct position
- N and x: not present
- E ✓: present and correct position

So the secret word contains A and E at positions 3 and 5, and does not contain C, R, N.

Without knowing more, ""SLATE"" could be a candidate? But we also need to test other letters.

But note: in ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T, and we know A and E are fixed.

Another candidate: ""QUAKE"", but Q might be less common.

We should choose a word that tests letters we don't know anything about.

Since we have A and E fixed, we can focus on testing letters for positions 1, 2, and 4.

We want to use a word that has:
- New letters: so not C, R, N, and also we know A and E are already present, so we don't need to test them again? Actually, in the guess we must put A and E in positions 3 and 5 because that's fixed? Yes, because we know they are correct.

For the second guess, we should build on the known information. So the guess must have A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Then we can test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So the pattern for our next guess must be:  _  _  A  _  E

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, N.

Now, common letters to test: S, T, L, D, P, etc.

I'd like to test a word that uses many frequent letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": uses S, L, T -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 4:T
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> but R is excluded? Since R came back as not present in the first guess? Yes, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word. We cannot use R. So ""STARE"" is invalid because it has R.
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> letters: S, H, D
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> S, P, D
- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F, L, M

But note: the fourth position must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but typically in English, words ending with E often have a consonant before it? But position 4 can be any letter that forms a word.

Actually, let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: 
- ""SHAKE"" (S,H,A,K,E) -> K is another consonant? but we haven't tested K.
- ""STAGE"" (S,T,A,G,E) -> G is not tested.

But we must avoid R and N? Also avoid C.

Another one: ""PLANE"" has N, excluded.

""SPADE"" is a valid word: meaning a playing card suit or a digging tool.

""SPADE"": S (1), P (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)

This uses S, P, D: all new letters that we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""SHADE"" uses S, H, D.

Which one is better? Both are good.

I could choose ""SPADE"". But we have another constraint: we might want to test letters that have higher frequency in English.

Frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, ... but knowing R and N are excluded, and A and E are included, we can focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

T, O, I, S, L are very common.

In positions 1, 2, and 4, we can try to cover several common letters.

For example:
- ""STOLE"": but pattern must be _ _ A _ E, so ""STOLE"" is S T O L E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),L(4),E(5) -> but the third letter is O, not A? So that doesn't fit.

We must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""SOARE"" is it valid? I think ""SOARE"" might not be common; better use a common word.

""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern is _ _ A _ E, meaning third letter must be A? ""TABLE"" has T at 1, A at 2? So positions: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B? Not A? So no.

We must ensure the third letter is A and fifth is E.

""ABATE"": A at first? Pattern requires third letter A, so ""ABATE"" has A at 1 and 3? Let's see: A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> yes, first letter A, which we don't know if A can appear elsewhere? But we only know position 3 has A. But the word does have position 3 A and position 5 E? Yes. However, in ""ABATE"", the first letter is A, and we don't know if A is allowed at other positions? But the feedback didn't say that A is only once? Actually, we don't know, A might be duplicated? So ""ABATE"" could be possible? But then we get A at position 1 and 3? But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.

In ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?

However, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a '-' feedback? But we can get useful info.

Still, we want to test new letters. So maybe it's better to not reuse A if possible? We don't have to, since we don't know the other letters.

But using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.

Similarly for E.

For maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven't tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don't know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.

In our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.

So avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.

Therefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.

Let me choose ""SPADE"":

Letters: S, P, A, D, E

A and E are known and in correct positions. So we'll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.

If S is correct at position 1, we'll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.

If any is not in the word, we'll see x, if misplaced, we'll see -.

That should give us good information.

Alternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.

But T is very common. Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPADE"".

So guess: SPADE
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C (x) not in the word
- R (x) not in the word
- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3
- N (x) not in the word
- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5

Key information:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
2. C, R, and N are not in the word.
3. A and E are confirmed in the word at positions 3 and 5 respectively.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E.
- Must not include C, R, N (as they are absent in the secret word).
- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.
- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.

Possible words: SPADE, SHADE, GLADE, SLATE, etc. After evaluating:
- ""SPADE"" (S,P,A,D,E) uses new high-frequency letters (S, P, D), which are common and can test positions 1, 2, and 4 effectively.
- Avoids reused known letters like A and E in untested positions.
- Provides maximum information potential for the remaining letters.

Therefore, guessing ""SPADE"" is a strategic choice to narrow down possibilities.

But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.

In ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?

However, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a '-' feedback? But we can get useful info.

Still, we want to test new letters. So maybe it's better to not reuse A if possible? We don't have to, since we don't know the other letters.

But using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.

Similarly for E.

For maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven't tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don't know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.

In our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.

So avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.

Therefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.

Let me choose ""SPADE"":

Letters: S, P, A, D, E

A and E are known and in correct positions. So we'll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.

If S is correct at position 1, we'll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.

If any is not in the word, we'll see x, if misplaced, we'll see -.

That should give us good information.

Alternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.

But T is very common. Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPADE"".

So guess: SPADE<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C (x) not in the word
- R (x) not in the word
- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3
- N (x) not in the word
- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5

Key information:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
2. C, R, and N are not in the word.
3. A and E are confirmed in the word at positions 3 and 5 respectively.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E.
- Must not include C, R, N (as they are absent in the secret word).
- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.
- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.

Possible words: SPADE, SHADE, GLADE, SLATE, etc. After evaluating:
- ""SPADE"" (S,P,A,D,E) uses new high-frequency letters (S, P, D), which are common and can test positions 1, 2, and 4 effectively.
- Avoids reused known letters like A and E in untested positions.
- Provides maximum information potential for the remaining letters.

Therefore, guessing ""SPADE"" is a strategic choice to narrow down possibilities.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FLAME,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 We want a word that can give us good information about the secret word. Ideally, we choose a word that has common letters and covers different positions.

 One common strategy is to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SPARE"", etc. are often used.

 Let me choose ""ROATE"". This word includes common letters: R, O, A, T, E. It has vowels (O, A, E) and common consonants (R, T). 

 However, note that the response format requires the word to be valid. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (meaning: the cumulative return on investment over accounting periods).

 Alternatively, I can pick a more common starting word like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters and is a common starter.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
I am making my first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Good starting words typically include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E are all frequently used in English words
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five unique letters
- ""CRANE"" is a valid English word under game rules

This guess should provide strong feedback on letter presence/positions.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter in the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

We know that the third letter is A and the fifth letter is E.

Also, the letters C, R, N are definitely not in the word. So we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, for our second guess, we want to:
1. Test other letters in the remaining positions (first, second, fourth) to gather more information.
2. Avoid using the excluded letters C, R, N.

We know the word must be of the form _ _ A _ E.

Let's think of possible words that fit this pattern and exclude C, R, N.

We also want to test common vowels and consonants for the first, second, and fourth positions.

Note that in the fourth position, it must be a letter that can come before E and after A.

Potential words: 
- B_ A _ E: e.g., ""BLASE"", ""BAISE""? But note we can't have S because we don't know if S is in the word yet? Actually, we haven't tested S.
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common consonants for the beginning: S, T, L, etc.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A _ E and don't contain C, R, N.

Examples:
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)
- ""SNAKE"": but N is excluded, so no.
- ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> G is not tested yet.
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> P and D not tested.
- ""ABATE"": A is already used? But the first letter is A? Pattern is _ _ A _ E so first letter cannot be A? Because third is A. First and second letters are unknown.

But note: the word must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but N is excluded, so invalid.

We must avoid N, so ""PLANE"" is out.

""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but T is not excluded? However, we have A and E in place. So positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). Also, no C, R, N.

But we know that A and E are correct and in position, so in ""SLATE"", the A and E positions are exactly as required.

However, the feedback for the first guess told us that only A and E are in the word and correctly placed? We don't know if there are other letters.

Wait, the feedback: 
- C and x: not present
- R and x: not present
- A ✓: present and correct position
- N and x: not present
- E ✓: present and correct position

So the secret word contains A and E at positions 3 and 5, and does not contain C, R, N.

Without knowing more, ""SLATE"" could be a candidate? But we also need to test other letters.

But note: in ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T, and we know A and E are fixed.

Another candidate: ""QUAKE"", but Q might be less common.

We should choose a word that tests letters we don't know anything about.

Since we have A and E fixed, we can focus on testing letters for positions 1, 2, and 4.

We want to use a word that has:
- New letters: so not C, R, N, and also we know A and E are already present, so we don't need to test them again? Actually, in the guess we must put A and E in positions 3 and 5 because that's fixed? Yes, because we know they are correct.

For the second guess, we should build on the known information. So the guess must have A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Then we can test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So the pattern for our next guess must be:  _  _  A  _  E

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, N.

Now, common letters to test: S, T, L, D, P, etc.

I'd like to test a word that uses many frequent letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": uses S, L, T -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 4:T
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> but R is excluded? Since R came back as not present in the first guess? Yes, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word. We cannot use R. So ""STARE"" is invalid because it has R.
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> letters: S, H, D
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> S, P, D
- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F, L, M

But note: the fourth position must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but typically in English, words ending with E often have a consonant before it? But position 4 can be any letter that forms a word.

Actually, let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: 
- ""SHAKE"" (S,H,A,K,E) -> K is another consonant? but we haven't tested K.
- ""STAGE"" (S,T,A,G,E) -> G is not tested.

But we must avoid R and N? Also avoid C.

Another one: ""PLANE"" has N, excluded.

""SPADE"" is a valid word: meaning a playing card suit or a digging tool.

""SPADE"": S (1), P (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)

This uses S, P, D: all new letters that we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""SHADE"" uses S, H, D.

Which one is better? Both are good.

I could choose ""SPADE"". But we have another constraint: we might want to test letters that have higher frequency in English.

Frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, ... but knowing R and N are excluded, and A and E are included, we can focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

T, O, I, S, L are very common.

In positions 1, 2, and 4, we can try to cover several common letters.

For example:
- ""STOLE"": but pattern must be _ _ A _ E, so ""STOLE"" is S T O L E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),L(4),E(5) -> but the third letter is O, not A? So that doesn't fit.

We must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""SOARE"" is it valid? I think ""SOARE"" might not be common; better use a common word.

""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern is _ _ A _ E, meaning third letter must be A? ""TABLE"" has T at 1, A at 2? So positions: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B? Not A? So no.

We must ensure the third letter is A and fifth is E.

""ABATE"": A at first? Pattern requires third letter A, so ""ABATE"" has A at 1 and 3? Let's see: A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> yes, first letter A, which we don't know if A can appear elsewhere? But we only know position 3 has A. But the word does have position 3 A and position 5 E? Yes. However, in ""ABATE"", the first letter is A, and we don't know if A is allowed at other positions? But the feedback didn't say that A is only once? Actually, we don't know, A might be duplicated? So ""ABATE"" could be possible? But then we get A at position 1 and 3? But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.

In ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?

However, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a '-' feedback? But we can get useful info.

Still, we want to test new letters. So maybe it's better to not reuse A if possible? We don't have to, since we don't know the other letters.

But using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.

Similarly for E.

For maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven't tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don't know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.

In our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.

So avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.

If S is correct at position 1, we'll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.

If any is not in the word, we'll see x, if misplaced, we'll see -.

That should give us good information.

Alternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.

But T is very common. Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPADE"".

So guess: SPADE<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C (x) not in the word

- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.
- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.

But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.\n\nSo avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.\n\nTherefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.\n\nLet me choose ""SPADE"":\n\nLetters: S, P, A, D, E\n\nA and E are known and in correct positions. So we\'ll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nIf S is correct at position 1, we\'ll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.\n\nIf any is not in the word, we\'ll see x, if misplaced, we\'ll see -.\n\nThat should give us good information.\n\nAlternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.\n\nBut T is very common. Both are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPADE"".\n\nSo guess: SPADE<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C (x) not in the word\n- R (x) not in the word\n- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3\n- N (x) not in the word\n- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5\n\nKey information:\n1.

We are given feedback on the second guess ""SPADE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still the third letter)
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is still the fifth letter)

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Additionally, we have excluded the following letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and does not contain any of the excluded letters.

We must avoid: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that A and E are in the word and in the correct positions.

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not excluded and not A or E (since we don't want to reuse known letters unnecessarily, but note: we can use other letters that might be duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates, so it's safer to avoid A and E in new positions to test new letters).

So, we are looking for words of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

Where letter1, letter2, letter4 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, N, S, P, D, and also excluding A and E? Not necessarily, but we can choose to avoid them to test new letters.

But we don't have to avoid A and E, but since we already know they are present, putting them in other positions might tell us if there are duplicates? However, we are limited by the pattern: we have to put A at position 3 and E at position 5. So in positions 1,2,4 we can only put one letter each, and we want to test new letters.

So, we should choose letters that we haven't tested yet and that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D.

A and E are in the word, the others are out.

Now, what letters are available? The rest of the alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ A _ E.

Possible words:

- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern requires third letter A? ""TABLE"" has T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B, not A. So no.

- ""BAYLE"": not a word.

- ""MAKER"": but R is excluded and pattern doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E.

So, let's think of words ending with E and having A as the third letter.

Examples:

- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> but we have M at position 4? And B and L at 1 and 2. But we haven't excluded B, L, M. However, in ""BLAME"", the pattern is B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This fits.

But we have to check if B, L, M are allowed? They are not excluded.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> same pattern.

""GLADE"": but D is excluded? D is excluded from the second guess, so no.

""SHADE"": S and D are excluded? S and D are excluded, so no.

""ABATE"": A B A T E -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We don't know if A can be duplicated? But it's possible. However, we are using A at position 1, which we haven't tested. But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 and it's not present there, we get a '-' or 'x'? But we are testing.

But we want to test new letters? So using A again might not be efficient? But we can.

However, in ""ABATE"", we are testing B and T? And we get information about A at position 1.

But we have limited guesses, so we should avoid reusing known letters? Not necessarily, but it might be better to test new ones.

Another word: ""THANE"": T H A N E -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first guess, so no.

""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> Q, U, K are new. But Q is less common.

""WAIVE"": W A I V E -> but pattern: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> third letter is F? No.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> N excluded.

""LATKE"": L A T K E -> third letter T? No.

""BASTE"": B A S T E -> S excluded.

""PASTE"": P and S excluded.

""HASTE"": S excluded.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""GLAZE"": Z is not excluded? But pattern: G L A Z E -> G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This fits. And Z is not excluded? But Z is less common.

""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> same.

But let's look for more common words.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This is a valid word.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). Also valid.

""FRAME"": F R A M E -> but R is excluded? R is excluded, so no.

""GAMME"": not a word.

""JAMBE"": J A M B E -> third letter M? No.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> A(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We can use this? But we are testing L and T.

But we are reusing A at position 1.

Similarly, ""AGAPE"": A G A P E -> P excluded.

""AVAKE"": not a word.

""OAKEN"": N excluded.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> third letter U? No.

""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> third letter I? No.

""LEMKE"": not a word.

So, common words that fit: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLAME"" (not common), ""SHAME"" but S excluded.

Another one: ""THAWE"" not a word.

""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). This fits. And W, H, L are not excluded.

Similarly, ""SHALE"": S excluded.

""CHALE"" not a word.

So, possible words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""BLAME"": tests B, L, M
""FLAME"": tests F, L, M
""WHALE"": tests W, H, L

All test three new letters.

But note that L is common to all? So if we choose one, we test L in position 2 or 4? In ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"", L is at position 2, and in ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.

We don't have a preference? But we can choose based on letter frequency.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc. T is very common and we haven't tested it.

Is there a word that includes T?

For example, ""ABATE"": A B A T E -> but we have A at position 1? And B and T. But we are reusing A.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> same.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""WASTE"": S excluded.

""PASTE"": S and P excluded.

""GATE"": too short.

""LATHE"": L A T H E -> pattern: L(1), A(2), T(3), H(4), E(5) -> third letter is T, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""QUATE"" not a word.

""OVATE"": O V A T E -> O(1), V(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This is a word (meaning: having an oval shape). And O, V, T are new.

Similarly, ""OVATE"" tests O, V, T.

T is a common letter.

Another word: ""INANE"" but N excluded.

""IRATE"": I R A T E -> R excluded.

""URATE"": U R A T E -> R excluded.

""AGATE"": A G A T E -> G and T, but A at position 1 and 3? And we are reusing A.

But ""AGATE"" is a word: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5).

But we are testing G and T, and reusing A.

Similarly, ""AVATE"" not a word.

So, we have:

- ""BLAME"": B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F, L, M
- ""WHALE"": W, H, L
- ""OVATE"": O, V, T
- ""AGATE"": A, G, T (but reuses A at position 1)

We should avoid reusing A if possible? Because we already know A is present, so putting it at position 1 might not give new information? But if it is present at position 1, we get a '-' or if not, we get 'x'. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A? So it could be useful.

But to maximize new information, we can avoid reusing A and E.

So, ""OVATE"" is good: O, V, T are all new.

""BLAME"" is also good: B, L, M new.

But T is more common than B, L, M? Let's see frequency.

In English, T is the second most common consonant after R (which is excluded), so T is very common.

O is a vowel, also common.

V is less common.

But ""OVATE"" has O and T, which are common.

""BLAME"" has L and M, which are common.

But T is more common than L and M? Actually, T is more common than L and M.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (N and R excluded, S and D excluded).

So after A and E, the next are T, O, I, etc.

So T and O are high frequency.

Therefore, ""OVATE"" might be a good choice because it tests T and O.

Also, V is less common, but we have to use it to form the word.

Another word: ""OLATE"" not a word.

""URAEI"" not matching.

""KNAVE"" N excluded.

So, I think ""OVATE"" is a valid choice.

But let me confirm if ""OVATE"" is accepted. Yes, it's a word.

Alternatively, ""TAKER"" R excluded.

""MAKER"" R excluded.

""BAKER"" R excluded.

""LAKEE"" not a word.

So, I'll go with ""OVATE"".

But in ""OVATE"", we have O at position 1, V at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This fits the pattern.

We are testing O, V, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"" but third letter I? No.

""ABIDE"" third letter I? No.

So, ""OVATE"" seems good.

But we have ""WHALE"" which has H and W? H is common, W less so.

But T is more common than H? T is more common than H? Actually, T is more common: T is 2nd, H is 8th in frequency.

So ""OVATE"" tests T and O, which are high frequency.

Therefore, I choose ""OVATE"".

But let's see if there is a word with T and O without V? For example, ""TOGAE"" not matching pattern.

""ATOLL"" not ending with E.

So, ""OVATE"" is acceptable.

We'll guess ""OVATE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This indicates that the secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, and excludes C, R, and N.

- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
  This confirms 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, and excludes S, P, and D.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, S, P, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Goal for the next guess: Test new high-frequency letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to maximize information, while avoiding excluded letters and reusing A and E only in their known positions.

**Reasoning for the next guess:**
- We need a word matching `_ _ A _ E` with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- High-frequency letters like T, O, L, and I are prioritized for testing, as they are common in English words.
- After evaluating options:
  - Words like ""BLAME"" (tests B, L, M) or ""FLAME"" (tests F, L, M) are possible but focus on less common consonants.
  - ""WHALE"" (tests W, H, L) is valid but includes less common letters like W.
  - ""OVATE"" (tests O, V, T) is a strong choice because:
    - It uses O (high-frequency vowel) and T (high-frequency consonant), which are statistically likely to appear.
    - V is less common but necessary to form a valid word.
    - It avoids reused letters in untested positions (A and E are only in their known spots).
    - ""OVATE"" is a valid English word (meaning: egg-shaped or relating to ovum).
- This guess will provide feedback on O, V, and T, helping to narrow down possibilities significantly.

<guess>OVATE</guess>",OVATE,"We are given feedback on the second guess ""SPADE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still the third letter)

- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is still the fifth letter)

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Additionally, we have excluded the following letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

""GLADE"": but D is excluded? D is excluded from the second guess, so no.

""SHADE"": S and D are excluded? S and D are excluded, so no.

""ABATE"": A B A T E -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We don't know if A can be duplicated? But it's possible. However, we are using A at position 1, which we haven't tested. But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 and it's not present there, we get a '-' or 'x'? But we are testing.

Another word: ""THANE"": T H A N E -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first guess, so no.

""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> Q, U, K are new. But Q is less common.

""WAIVE"": W A I V E -> but pattern: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> third letter is F? No.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> N excluded.

""LATKE"": L A T K E -> third letter T? No.

""BASTE"": B A S T E -> S excluded.

""GLAZE"": Z is not excluded? But pattern: G L A Z E -> G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This fits. And Z is not excluded? But Z is less common.

""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> same.

But let's look for more common words.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This is a valid word.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). Also valid.

""FRAME"": F R A M E -> but R is excluded? R is excluded, so no.

""GAMME"": not a word.

""JAMBE"": J A M B E -> third letter M? No.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> A(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We can use this? But we are testing L and T.

But we are reusing A at position 1.

Similarly, ""AGAPE"": A G A P E -> P excluded.

""AVAKE"": not a word.

""OAKEN"": N excluded.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> third letter U? No.

""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> third letter I? No.

""LEMKE"": not a word.

So, common words that fit: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLAME"" (not common), ""SHAME"" but S excluded.

Another one: ""THAWE"" not a word.

""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). This fits. And W, H, L are not excluded.

Similarly, ""SHALE"": S excluded.

""CHALE"" not a word.

So, possible words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""BLAME"": tests B, L, M
""FLAME"": tests F, L, M
""WHALE"": tests W, H, L

All test three new letters.

But note that L is common to all? So if we choose one, we test L in position 2 or 4? In ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"", L is at position 2, and in ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.

We don't have a preference? But we can choose based on letter frequency.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc. T is very common and we haven't tested it.

Is there a word that includes T?

For example, ""ABATE"": A B A T E -> but we have A at position 1? And B and T. But we are reusing A.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> same.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""WASTE"": S excluded.

""PASTE"": S and P excluded.

""GATE"": too short.

""LATHE"": L A T H E -> pattern: L(1), A(2), T(3), H(4), E(5) -> third letter is T, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""QUATE"" not a word.

""OVATE"": O V A T E -> O(1), V(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This is a word (meaning: having an oval shape). And O, V, T are new.

Similarly, ""OVATE"" tests O, V, T.

T is a common letter.

Another word: ""INANE"" but N excluded.

""IRATE"": I R A T E -> R excluded.

""URATE"": U R A T E -> R excluded.

""AGATE"": A G A T E -> G and T, but A at position 1 and 3? And we are reusing A.

But ""AGATE"" is a word: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5).

But we are testing G and T, and reusing A.

Similarly, ""AVATE"" not a word.

So, we have:

- ""BLAME"": B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F, L, M
- ""WHALE"": W, H, L
- ""OVATE"": O, V, T
- ""AGATE"": A, G, T (but reuses A at position 1)

We should avoid reusing A if possible? Because we already know A is present, so putting it at position 1 might not give new information? But if it is present at position 1, we get a '-' or if not, we get 'x'. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A? So it could be useful.

But to maximize new information, we can avoid reusing A and E.

So, ""OVATE"" is good: O, V, T are all new.

""BLAME"" is also good: B, L, M new.

But T is more common than B, L, M? Let's see frequency.

In English, T is the second most common consonant after R (which is excluded), so T is very common.

O is a vowel, also common.

V is less common.

But ""OVATE"" has O and T, which are common.

""BLAME"" has L and M, which are common.

But T is more common than L and M? Actually, T is more common than L and M.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (N and R excluded, S and D excluded).

So after A and E, the next are T, O, I, etc.

So T and O are high frequency.

Therefore, ""OVATE"" might be a good choice because it tests T and O.

Also, V is less common, but we have to use it to form the word.

Another word: ""OLATE"" not a word.

""URAEI"" not matching.

""KNAVE"" N excluded.

So, I think ""OVATE"" is a valid choice.

But let me confirm if ""OVATE"" is accepted. Yes, it's a word.

Alternatively, ""TAKER"" R excluded.

""MAKER"" R excluded.

""BAKER"" R excluded.

""LAKEE"" not a word.

So, I'll go with ""OVATE"".

But in ""OVATE"", we have O at position 1, V at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This fits the pattern.

We are testing O, V, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"" but third letter I? No.

""ABIDE"" third letter I? No.

So, ""OVATE"" seems good.

But we have ""WHALE"" which has H and W? H is common, W less so.

But T is more common than H? T is more common than H? Actually, T is more common: T is 2nd, H is 8th in frequency.

So ""OVATE"" tests T and O, which are high frequency.

Therefore, I choose ""OVATE"".

But let's see if there is a word with T and O without V? For example, ""TOGAE"" not matching pattern.

""ATOLL"" not ending with E.

So, ""OVATE"" is acceptable.

We'll guess ""OVATE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

  - Words like ""BLAME"" (tests B, L, M) or ""FLAME"" (tests F, L, M) are possible but focus on less common consonants.
  - ""WHALE"" (tests W, H, L) is valid but includes less common letters like W.
  - ""OVATE"" (tests O, V, T) is a strong choice because:
    - It uses O (high-frequency vowel) and T (high-frequency consonant), which are statistically likely to appear.
    - V is less common but necessary to form a valid word.
    - It avoids reused letters in untested positions (A and E are only in their known spots).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 We want a word that can give us good information about the secret word. Ideally, we choose a word that has common letters and covers different positions.

 One common strategy is to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SPARE"", etc. are often used.

 Let me choose ""ROATE"". This word includes common letters: R, O, A, T, E. It has vowels (O, A, E) and common consonants (R, T). 

 However, note that the response format requires the word to be valid. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (meaning: the cumulative return on investment over accounting periods).

 Alternatively, I can pick a more common starting word like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters and is a common starter.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
I am making my first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Good starting words typically include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E are all frequently used in English words
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five unique letters
- ""CRANE"" is a valid English word under game rules

This guess should provide strong feedback on letter presence/positions.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter in the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

We know that the third letter is A and the fifth letter is E.

Also, the letters C, R, N are definitely not in the word. So we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, for our second guess, we want to:
1. Test other letters in the remaining positions (first, second, fourth) to gather more information.
2. Avoid using the excluded letters C, R, N.

We know the word must be of the form _ _ A _ E.

Let's think of possible words that fit this pattern and exclude C, R, N.

We also want to test common vowels and consonants for the first, second, and fourth positions.

Note that in the fourth position, it must be a letter that can come before E and after A.

Potential words: 
- B_ A _ E: e.g., ""BLASE"", ""BAISE""? But note we can't have S because we don't know if S is in the word yet? Actually, we haven't tested S.
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common consonants for the beginning: S, T, L, etc.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A _ E and don't contain C, R, N.

Examples:
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)
- ""SNAKE"": but N is excluded, so no.
- ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> G is not tested yet.
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> P and D not tested.
- ""ABATE"": A is already used? But the first letter is A? Pattern is _ _ A _ E so first letter cannot be A? Because third is A. First and second letters are unknown.

But note: the word must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but N is excluded, so invalid.

We must avoid N, so ""PLANE"" is out.

""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but T is not excluded? However, we have A and E in place. So positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). Also, no C, R, N.

But we know that A and E are correct and in position, so in ""SLATE"", the A and E positions are exactly as required.

However, the feedback for the first guess told us that only A and E are in the word and correctly placed? We don't know if there are other letters.

Wait, the feedback: 
- C and x: not present
- R and x: not present
- A ✓: present and correct position
- N and x: not present
- E ✓: present and correct position

So the secret word contains A and E at positions 3 and 5, and does not contain C, R, N.

Without knowing more, ""SLATE"" could be a candidate? But we also need to test other letters.

But note: in ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T, and we know A and E are fixed.

Another candidate: ""QUAKE"", but Q might be less common.

We should choose a word that tests letters we don't know anything about.

Since we have A and E fixed, we can focus on testing letters for positions 1, 2, and 4.

We want to use a word that has:
- New letters: so not C, R, N, and also we know A and E are already present, so we don't need to test them again? Actually, in the guess we must put A and E in positions 3 and 5 because that's fixed? Yes, because we know they are correct.

For the second guess, we should build on the known information. So the guess must have A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Then we can test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So the pattern for our next guess must be:  _  _  A  _  E

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, N.

Now, common letters to test: S, T, L, D, P, etc.

I'd like to test a word that uses many frequent letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": uses S, L, T -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 4:T
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> but R is excluded? Since R came back as not present in the first guess? Yes, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word. We cannot use R. So ""STARE"" is invalid because it has R.
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> letters: S, H, D
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> S, P, D
- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F, L, M

But note: the fourth position must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but typically in English, words ending with E often have a consonant before it? But position 4 can be any letter that forms a word.

Actually, let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: 
- ""SHAKE"" (S,H,A,K,E) -> K is another consonant? but we haven't tested K.
- ""STAGE"" (S,T,A,G,E) -> G is not tested.

But we must avoid R and N? Also avoid C.

Another one: ""PLANE"" has N, excluded.

""SPADE"" is a valid word: meaning a playing card suit or a digging tool.

""SPADE"": S (1), P (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)

This uses S, P, D: all new letters that we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""SHADE"" uses S, H, D.

Which one is better? Both are good.

I could choose ""SPADE"". But we have another constraint: we might want to test letters that have higher frequency in English.

Frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, ... but knowing R and N are excluded, and A and E are included, we can focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

T, O, I, S, L are very common.

In positions 1, 2, and 4, we can try to cover several common letters.

For example:
- ""STOLE"": but pattern must be _ _ A _ E, so ""STOLE"" is S T O L E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),L(4),E(5) -> but the third letter is O, not A? So that doesn't fit.

We must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""SOARE"" is it valid? I think ""SOARE"" might not be common; better use a common word.

""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern is _ _ A _ E, meaning third letter must be A? ""TABLE"" has T at 1, A at 2? So positions: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B? Not A? So no.

We must ensure the third letter is A and fifth is E.

""ABATE"": A at first? Pattern requires third letter A, so ""ABATE"" has A at 1 and 3? Let's see: A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> yes, first letter A, which we don't know if A can appear elsewhere? But we only know position 3 has A. But the word does have position 3 A and position 5 E? Yes. However, in ""ABATE"", the first letter is A, and we don't know if A is allowed at other positions? But the feedback didn't say that A is only once? Actually, we don't know, A might be duplicated? So ""ABATE"" could be possible? But then we get A at position 1 and 3? But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.

In ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?

However, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a '-' feedback? But we can get useful info.

Still, we want to test new letters. So maybe it's better to not reuse A if possible? We don't have to, since we don't know the other letters.

But using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.

Similarly for E.

For maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven't tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don't know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.

In our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.

So avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.

Therefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.

Let me choose ""SPADE"":

Letters: S, P, A, D, E

A and E are known and in correct positions. So we'll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.

If S is correct at position 1, we'll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.

If any is not in the word, we'll see x, if misplaced, we'll see -.

That should give us good information.

Alternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.

But T is very common. Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPADE"".

So guess: SPADE<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C (x) not in the word
- R (x) not in the word
- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3
- N (x) not in the word
- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5

Key information:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
2. C, R, and N are not in the word.
3. A and E are confirmed in the word at positions 3 and 5 respectively.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E.
- Must not include C, R, N (as they are absent in the secret word).
- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.
- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.

Possible words: SPADE, SHADE, GLADE, SLATE, etc. After evaluating:
- ""SPADE"" (S,P,A,D,E) uses new high-frequency letters (S, P, D), which are common and can test positions 1, 2, and 4 effectively.
- Avoids reused known letters like A and E in untested positions.
- Provides maximum information potential for the remaining letters.

Therefore, guessing ""SPADE"" is a strategic choice to narrow down possibilities.
</thinking>

<guess>SPADE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SPADE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the second guess ""SPADE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still the third letter)
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is still the fifth letter)

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Additionally, we have excluded the following letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and does not contain any of the excluded letters.

We must avoid: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that A and E are in the word and in the correct positions.

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not excluded and not A or E (since we don't want to reuse known letters unnecessarily, but note: we can use other letters that might be duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates, so it's safer to avoid A and E in new positions to test new letters).

So, we are looking for words of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

Where letter1, letter2, letter4 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, N, S, P, D, and also excluding A and E? Not necessarily, but we can choose to avoid them to test new letters.

But we don't have to avoid A and E, but since we already know they are present, putting them in other positions might tell us if there are duplicates? However, we are limited by the pattern: we have to put A at position 3 and E at position 5. So in positions 1,2,4 we can only put one letter each, and we want to test new letters.

So, we should choose letters that we haven't tested yet and that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D.

A and E are in the word, the others are out.

Now, what letters are available? The rest of the alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ A _ E.

Possible words:

- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern requires third letter A? ""TABLE"" has T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B, not A. So no.

- ""BAYLE"": not a word.

- ""MAKER"": but R is excluded and pattern doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E.

So, let's think of words ending with E and having A as the third letter.

Examples:

- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> but we have M at position 4? And B and L at 1 and 2. But we haven't excluded B, L, M. However, in ""BLAME"", the pattern is B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This fits.

But we have to check if B, L, M are allowed? They are not excluded.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> same pattern.

""GLADE"": but D is excluded? D is excluded from the second guess, so no.

""SHADE"": S and D are excluded? S and D are excluded, so no.

""ABATE"": A B A T E -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We don't know if A can be duplicated? But it's possible. However, we are using A at position 1, which we haven't tested. But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 and it's not present there, we get a '-' or 'x'? But we are testing.

But we want to test new letters? So using A again might not be efficient? But we can.

However, in ""ABATE"", we are testing B and T? And we get information about A at position 1.

But we have limited guesses, so we should avoid reusing known letters? Not necessarily, but it might be better to test new ones.

Another word: ""THANE"": T H A N E -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first guess, so no.

""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> Q, U, K are new. But Q is less common.

""WAIVE"": W A I V E -> but pattern: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> third letter is F? No.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> N excluded.

""LATKE"": L A T K E -> third letter T? No.

""BASTE"": B A S T E -> S excluded.

""PASTE"": P and S excluded.

""HASTE"": S excluded.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""GLAZE"": Z is not excluded? But pattern: G L A Z E -> G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This fits. And Z is not excluded? But Z is less common.

""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> same.

But let's look for more common words.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This is a valid word.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). Also valid.

""FRAME"": F R A M E -> but R is excluded? R is excluded, so no.

""GAMME"": not a word.

""JAMBE"": J A M B E -> third letter M? No.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> A(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We can use this? But we are testing L and T.

But we are reusing A at position 1.

Similarly, ""AGAPE"": A G A P E -> P excluded.

""AVAKE"": not a word.

""OAKEN"": N excluded.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> third letter U? No.

""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> third letter I? No.

""LEMKE"": not a word.

So, common words that fit: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLAME"" (not common), ""SHAME"" but S excluded.

Another one: ""THAWE"" not a word.

""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). This fits. And W, H, L are not excluded.

Similarly, ""SHALE"": S excluded.

""CHALE"" not a word.

So, possible words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""BLAME"": tests B, L, M
""FLAME"": tests F, L, M
""WHALE"": tests W, H, L

All test three new letters.

But note that L is common to all? So if we choose one, we test L in position 2 or 4? In ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"", L is at position 2, and in ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.

We don't have a preference? But we can choose based on letter frequency.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc. T is very common and we haven't tested it.

Is there a word that includes T?

For example, ""ABATE"": A B A T E -> but we have A at position 1? And B and T. But we are reusing A.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> same.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""WASTE"": S excluded.

""PASTE"": S and P excluded.

""GATE"": too short.

""LATHE"": L A T H E -> pattern: L(1), A(2), T(3), H(4), E(5) -> third letter is T, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""QUATE"" not a word.

""OVATE"": O V A T E -> O(1), V(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This is a word (meaning: having an oval shape). And O, V, T are new.

Similarly, ""OVATE"" tests O, V, T.

T is a common letter.

Another word: ""INANE"" but N excluded.

""IRATE"": I R A T E -> R excluded.

""URATE"": U R A T E -> R excluded.

""AGATE"": A G A T E -> G and T, but A at position 1 and 3? And we are reusing A.

But ""AGATE"" is a word: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5).

But we are testing G and T, and reusing A.

Similarly, ""AVATE"" not a word.

So, we have:

- ""BLAME"": B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F, L, M
- ""WHALE"": W, H, L
- ""OVATE"": O, V, T
- ""AGATE"": A, G, T (but reuses A at position 1)

We should avoid reusing A if possible? Because we already know A is present, so putting it at position 1 might not give new information? But if it is present at position 1, we get a '-' or if not, we get 'x'. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A? So it could be useful.

But to maximize new information, we can avoid reusing A and E.

So, ""OVATE"" is good: O, V, T are all new.

""BLAME"" is also good: B, L, M new.

But T is more common than B, L, M? Let's see frequency.

In English, T is the second most common consonant after R (which is excluded), so T is very common.

O is a vowel, also common.

V is less common.

But ""OVATE"" has O and T, which are common.

""BLAME"" has L and M, which are common.

But T is more common than L and M? Actually, T is more common than L and M.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (N and R excluded, S and D excluded).

So after A and E, the next are T, O, I, etc.

So T and O are high frequency.

Therefore, ""OVATE"" might be a good choice because it tests T and O.

Also, V is less common, but we have to use it to form the word.

Another word: ""OLATE"" not a word.

""URAEI"" not matching.

""KNAVE"" N excluded.

So, I think ""OVATE"" is a valid choice.

But let me confirm if ""OVATE"" is accepted. Yes, it's a word.

Alternatively, ""TAKER"" R excluded.

""MAKER"" R excluded.

""BAKER"" R excluded.

""LAKEE"" not a word.

So, I'll go with ""OVATE"".

But in ""OVATE"", we have O at position 1, V at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This fits the pattern.

We are testing O, V, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"" but third letter I? No.

""ABIDE"" third letter I? No.

So, ""OVATE"" seems good.

But we have ""WHALE"" which has H and W? H is common, W less so.

But T is more common than H? T is more common than H? Actually, T is more common: T is 2nd, H is 8th in frequency.

So ""OVATE"" tests T and O, which are high frequency.

Therefore, I choose ""OVATE"".

But let's see if there is a word with T and O without V? For example, ""TOGAE"" not matching pattern.

""ATOLL"" not ending with E.

So, ""OVATE"" is acceptable.

We'll guess ""OVATE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This indicates that the secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, and excludes C, R, and N.

- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
  This confirms 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, and excludes S, P, and D.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, S, P, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Goal for the next guess: Test new high-frequency letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to maximize information, while avoiding excluded letters and reusing A and E only in their known positions.

**Reasoning for the next guess:**
- We need a word matching `_ _ A _ E` with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- High-frequency letters like T, O, L, and I are prioritized for testing, as they are common in English words.
- After evaluating options:
  - Words like ""BLAME"" (tests B, L, M) or ""FLAME"" (tests F, L, M) are possible but focus on less common consonants.
  - ""WHALE"" (tests W, H, L) is valid but includes less common letters like W.
  - ""OVATE"" (tests O, V, T) is a strong choice because:
    - It uses O (high-frequency vowel) and T (high-frequency consonant), which are statistically likely to appear.
    - V is less common but necessary to form a valid word.
    - It avoids reused letters in untested positions (A and E are only in their known spots).
    - ""OVATE"" is a valid English word (meaning: egg-shaped or relating to ovum).
- This guess will provide feedback on O, V, and T, helping to narrow down possibilities significantly.

Since this is the first guess, we don\'t have any feedback yet.\n We want a word that can give us good information about the secret word. Ideally, we choose a word that has common letters and covers different positions.\n\n One common strategy is to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SPARE"", etc. are often used.\n\n Let me choose ""ROATE"". This word includes common letters: R, O, A, T, E. It has vowels (O, A, E) and common consonants (R, T). \n\n However, note that the response format requires the word to be valid. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (meaning: the cumulative return on investment over accounting periods).\n\n Alternatively, I can pick a more common starting word like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters and is a common starter.\n\n So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>\nI am making my first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Good starting words typically include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. \n\nI\'ll choose ""CRANE"" because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)\n- The letters C, R, A, N, E are all frequently used in English words\n- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five unique letters\n- ""CRANE"" is a valid English word under game rules\n\nThis guess should provide strong feedback on letter presence/positions.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter in the secret word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nWe know that the third letter is A and the fifth letter is E.\n\nAlso, the letters C, R, N are definitely not in the word. So we must avoid using them in future guesses.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we want to:\n1. Test other letters in the remaining positions (first, second, fourth) to gather more information.\n2. Avoid using the excluded letters C, R, N.\n\nWe know the word must be of the form _ _ A _ E.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words that fit this pattern and exclude C, R, N.\n\nWe also want to test common vowels and consonants for the first, second, and fourth positions.\n\nNote that in the fourth position, it must be a letter that can come before E and after A.\n\nPotential words: \n- B_ A _ E: e.g., ""BLASE"", ""BAISE""? But note we can\'t have S because we don\'t know if S is in the word yet? Actually, we haven\'t tested S.\n- We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nCommon consonants for the beginning: S, T, L, etc.\n\nLet me list some words that fit _ _ A _ E and don\'t contain C, R, N.\n\nExamples:\n- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)\n- ""SNAKE"": but N is excluded, so no.\n- ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> G is not tested yet.\n- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> P and D not tested.\n- ""ABATE"": A is already used? But the first letter is A? Pattern is _ _ A _ E so first letter cannot be A? Because third is A. First and second letters are unknown.\n\nBut note: the word must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANE"" but N is excluded, so invalid.\n\nWe must avoid N, so ""PLANE"" is out.\n\n""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but T is not excluded? However, we have A and E in place. So positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). Also, no C, R, N.\n\nBut we know that A and E are correct and in position, so in ""SLATE"", the A and E positions are exactly as required.\n\nHowever, the feedback for the first guess told us that only A and E are in the word and correctly placed? We don\'t know if there are other letters.\n\nWait, the feedback: \n- C and x: not present\n- R and x: not present\n- A ✓: present and correct position\n- N and x: not present\n- E ✓: present and correct position\n\nSo the secret word contains A and E at positions 3 and 5, and does not contain C, R, N.\n\nWithout knowing more, ""SLATE"" could be a candidate? But we also need to test other letters.\n\nBut note: in ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T, and we know A and E are fixed.\n\nAnother candidate: ""QUAKE"", but Q might be less common.\n\nWe should choose a word that tests letters we don\'t know anything about.\n\nSince we have A and E fixed, we can focus on testing letters for positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nWe want to use a word that has:\n- New letters: so not C, R, N, and also we know A and E are already present, so we don\'t need to test them again? Actually, in the guess we must put A and E in positions 3 and 5 because that\'s fixed? Yes, because we know they are correct.\n\nFor the second guess, we should build on the known information. So the guess must have A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Then we can test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSo the pattern for our next guess must be:  _  _  A  _  E\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, N.\n\nNow, common letters to test: S, T, L, D, P, etc.\n\nI\'d like to test a word that uses many frequent letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SLATE"": uses S, L, T -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 4:T\n- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> but R is excluded? Since R came back as not present in the first guess? Yes, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word. We cannot use R. So ""STARE"" is invalid because it has R.\n- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> letters: S, H, D\n- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> S, P, D\n- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M\n- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F, L, M\n\nBut note: the fourth position must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but typically in English, words ending with E often have a consonant before it? But position 4 can be any letter that forms a word.\n\nActually, let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ A _ E.\n\nCommon ones: \n- ""SHAKE"" (S,H,A,K,E) -> K is another consonant? but we haven\'t tested K.\n- ""STAGE"" (S,T,A,G,E) -> G is not tested.\n\nBut we must avoid R and N? Also avoid C.\n\nAnother one: ""PLANE"" has N, excluded.\n\n""SPADE"" is a valid word: meaning a playing card suit or a digging tool.\n\n""SPADE"": S (1), P (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)\n\nThis uses S, P, D: all new letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHADE"" uses S, H, D.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are good.\n\nI could choose ""SPADE"". But we have another constraint: we might want to test letters that have higher frequency in English.\n\nFrequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, ... but knowing R and N are excluded, and A and E are included, we can focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\nT, O, I, S, L are very common.\n\nIn positions 1, 2, and 4, we can try to cover several common letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""STOLE"": but pattern must be _ _ A _ E, so ""STOLE"" is S T O L E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),L(4),E(5) -> but the third letter is O, not A? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""SOARE"" is it valid? I think ""SOARE"" might not be common; better use a common word.\n\n""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern is _ _ A _ E, meaning third letter must be A? ""TABLE"" has T at 1, A at 2? So positions: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B? Not A? So no.\n\nWe must ensure the third letter is A and fifth is E.\n\n""ABATE"": A at first? Pattern requires third letter A, so ""ABATE"" has A at 1 and 3? Let\'s see: A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> yes, first letter A, which we don\'t know if A can appear elsewhere? But we only know position 3 has A. But the word does have position 3 A and position 5 E? Yes. However, in ""ABATE"", the first letter is A, and we don\'t know if A is allowed at other positions? But the feedback didn\'t say that A is only once? Actually, we don\'t know, A might be duplicated? So ""ABATE"" could be possible? But then we get A at position 1 and 3? But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.\n\nIn ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?\n\nHowever, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a \'-\' feedback? But we can get useful info.\n\nStill, we want to test new letters. So maybe it\'s better to not reuse A if possible? We don\'t have to, since we don\'t know the other letters.\n\nBut using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nFor maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven\'t tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don\'t know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.\n\nIn our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.\n\nSo avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.\n\nTherefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.\n\nLet me choose ""SPADE"":\n\nLetters: S, P, A, D, E\n\nA and E are known and in correct positions. So we\'ll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nIf S is correct at position 1, we\'ll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.\n\nIf any is not in the word, we\'ll see x, if misplaced, we\'ll see -.\n\nThat should give us good information.\n\nAlternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.\n\nBut T is very common. Both are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPADE"".\n\nSo guess: SPADE<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C (x) not in the word\n- R (x) not in the word\n- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3\n- N (x) not in the word\n- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5\n\nKey information:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n2. C, R, and N are not in the word.\n3. A and E are confirmed in the word at positions 3 and 5 respectively.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E.\n- Must not include C, R, N (as they are absent in the secret word).\n- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.\n- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.\n\nPossible words: SPADE, SHADE, GLADE, SLATE, etc. After evaluating:\n- ""SPADE"" (S,P,A,D,E) uses new high-frequency letters (S, P, D), which are common and can test positions 1, 2, and 4 effectively.\n- Avoids reused known letters like A and E in untested positions.\n- Provides maximum information potential for the remaining letters.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""SPADE"" is a strategic choice to narrow down possibilities.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SPADE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SPADE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the second guess ""SPADE"":\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still the third letter)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is still the fifth letter)\n\nTherefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nAdditionally, we have excluded the following letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nWe also know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and does not contain any of the excluded letters.\n\nWe must avoid: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nWe also know that A and E are in the word and in the correct positions.\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not excluded and not A or E (since we don\'t want to reuse known letters unnecessarily, but note: we can use other letters that might be duplicates? But we don\'t know about duplicates, so it\'s safer to avoid A and E in new positions to test new letters).\n\nSo, we are looking for words of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E\n\nWhere letter1, letter2, letter4 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, N, S, P, D, and also excluding A and E? Not necessarily, but we can choose to avoid them to test new letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have to avoid A and E, but since we already know they are present, putting them in other positions might tell us if there are duplicates? However, we are limited by the pattern: we have to put A at position 3 and E at position 5. So in positions 1,2,4 we can only put one letter each, and we want to test new letters.\n\nSo, we should choose letters that we haven\'t tested yet and that are not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nWe have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D.\n\nA and E are in the word, the others are out.\n\nNow, what letters are available? The rest of the alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word that fits _ _ A _ E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern requires third letter A? ""TABLE"" has T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B, not A. So no.\n\n- ""BAYLE"": not a word.\n\n- ""MAKER"": but R is excluded and pattern doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words ending with E and having A as the third letter.\n\nExamples:\n\n- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> but we have M at position 4? And B and L at 1 and 2. But we haven\'t excluded B, L, M. However, in ""BLAME"", the pattern is B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This fits.\n\nBut we have to check if B, L, M are allowed? They are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> same pattern.\n\n""GLADE"": but D is excluded? D is excluded from the second guess, so no.\n\n""SHADE"": S and D are excluded? S and D are excluded, so no.\n\n""ABATE"": A B A T E -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We don\'t know if A can be duplicated? But it\'s possible. However, we are using A at position 1, which we haven\'t tested. But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 and it\'s not present there, we get a \'-\' or \'x\'? But we are testing.\n\nBut we want to test new letters? So using A again might not be efficient? But we can.\n\nHowever, in ""ABATE"", we are testing B and T? And we get information about A at position 1.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we should avoid reusing known letters? Not necessarily, but it might be better to test new ones.\n\nAnother word: ""THANE"": T H A N E -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first guess, so no.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> Q, U, K are new. But Q is less common.\n\n""WAIVE"": W A I V E -> but pattern: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\n""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> third letter is F? No.\n\n""MANGE"": M A N G E -> N excluded.\n\n""LATKE"": L A T K E -> third letter T? No.\n\n""BASTE"": B A S T E -> S excluded.\n\n""PASTE"": P and S excluded.\n\n""HASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""TASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""GLAZE"": Z is not excluded? But pattern: G L A Z E -> G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This fits. And Z is not excluded? But Z is less common.\n\n""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> same.\n\nBut let\'s look for more common words.\n\n""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This is a valid word.\n\n""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). Also valid.\n\n""FRAME"": F R A M E -> but R is excluded? R is excluded, so no.\n\n""GAMME"": not a word.\n\n""JAMBE"": J A M B E -> third letter M? No.\n\n""ALATE"": A L A T E -> A(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We can use this? But we are testing L and T.\n\nBut we are reusing A at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""AGAPE"": A G A P E -> P excluded.\n\n""AVAKE"": not a word.\n\n""OAKEN"": N excluded.\n\n""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> third letter U? No.\n\n""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> third letter I? No.\n\n""LEMKE"": not a word.\n\nSo, common words that fit: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLAME"" (not common), ""SHAME"" but S excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""THAWE"" not a word.\n\n""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). This fits. And W, H, L are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHALE"": S excluded.\n\n""CHALE"" not a word.\n\nSo, possible words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"".\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n""BLAME"": tests B, L, M\n""FLAME"": tests F, L, M\n""WHALE"": tests W, H, L\n\nAll test three new letters.\n\nBut note that L is common to all? So if we choose one, we test L in position 2 or 4? In ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"", L is at position 2, and in ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.\n\nWe don\'t have a preference? But we can choose based on letter frequency.\n\nCommon letters: T, L, O, I, etc. T is very common and we haven\'t tested it.\n\nIs there a word that includes T?\n\nFor example, ""ABATE"": A B A T E -> but we have A at position 1? And B and T. But we are reusing A.\n\n""ALATE"": A L A T E -> same.\n\n""TASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""WASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""PASTE"": S and P excluded.\n\n""GATE"": too short.\n\n""LATHE"": L A T H E -> pattern: L(1), A(2), T(3), H(4), E(5) -> third letter is T, not A? So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\n""QUATE"" not a word.\n\n""OVATE"": O V A T E -> O(1), V(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This is a word (meaning: having an oval shape). And O, V, T are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""OVATE"" tests O, V, T.\n\nT is a common letter.\n\nAnother word: ""INANE"" but N excluded.\n\n""IRATE"": I R A T E -> R excluded.\n\n""URATE"": U R A T E -> R excluded.\n\n""AGATE"": A G A T E -> G and T, but A at position 1 and 3? And we are reusing A.\n\nBut ""AGATE"" is a word: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5).\n\nBut we are testing G and T, and reusing A.\n\nSimilarly, ""AVATE"" not a word.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- ""BLAME"": B, L, M\n- ""FLAME"": F, L, M\n- ""WHALE"": W, H, L\n- ""OVATE"": O, V, T\n- ""AGATE"": A, G, T (but reuses A at position 1)\n\nWe should avoid reusing A if possible? Because we already know A is present, so putting it at position 1 might not give new information? But if it is present at position 1, we get a \'-\' or if not, we get \'x\'. But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate A? So it could be useful.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we can avoid reusing A and E.\n\nSo, ""OVATE"" is good: O, V, T are all new.\n\n""BLAME"" is also good: B, L, M new.\n\nBut T is more common than B, L, M? Let\'s see frequency.\n\nIn English, T is the second most common consonant after R (which is excluded), so T is very common.\n\nO is a vowel, also common.\n\nV is less common.\n\nBut ""OVATE"" has O and T, which are common.\n\n""BLAME"" has L and M, which are common.\n\nBut T is more common than L and M? Actually, T is more common than L and M.\n\nLetter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (N and R excluded, S and D excluded).\n\nSo after A and E, the next are T, O, I, etc.\n\nSo T and O are high frequency.\n\nTherefore, ""OVATE"" might be a good choice because it tests T and O.\n\nAlso, V is less common, but we have to use it to form the word.\n\nAnother word: ""OLATE"" not a word.\n\n""URAEI"" not matching.\n\n""KNAVE"" N excluded.\n\nSo, I think ""OVATE"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut let me confirm if ""OVATE"" is accepted. Yes, it\'s a word.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAKER"" R excluded.\n\n""MAKER"" R excluded.\n\n""BAKER"" R excluded.\n\n""LAKEE"" not a word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""OVATE"".\n\nBut in ""OVATE"", we have O at position 1, V at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nThis fits the pattern.\n\nWe are testing O, V, T.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALIKE"" but third letter I?

We are given feedback on the third guess ""OVATE"":
- O: x (not in the word)
- V: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So, we have excluded additional letters: O, V, T.

Now, the total excluded letters are: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T.

We also know the pattern must be _ _ A _ E.

The secret word does not contain any of these excluded letters.

We need to find a word that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We have to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with letters from this set.

We also note that we have used A and E in their positions, so in positions 1,2,4 we should use new letters to gain information.

Possible words:

- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This word uses B, L, M, which are still available? Yes, since not excluded.

But we haven't tested B, L, M yet.

""BLAME"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) -> F, L, M also available.

Another one: ""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> W, H, L available.

But ""WHALE"" has L at position 4? Yes.

""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but Z is available? Yes, but the pattern matches: G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). Valid word.

But Z is less common.

Other possibilities: ""ABATE"" but we have to use the pattern? ""ABATE"" is A B A T E, but T is excluded? T is excluded, from the third guess feedback. T is x, so no.

Similarly, any word with T cannot be used.

How about ""ULNAE"" not matching.

""BAIZE"": B A I Z E -> but pattern third letter must be A? This would be B(1), A(2), I(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> third letter I? No.

""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> but pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This fits? But Q and U? Q is rare.

""JAIME"" not a common word? ""JAIME"" can be a name, but let's stick to common words.

""KAZOO"" not ending with E.

""BAYLE"" not a word.

Common words that fit:

- ""BLAME"" (B, L, A, M, E) -> B, L, M
- ""FLAME"" (F, L, A, M, E) -> F, L, M
- ""WHALE"" (W, H, A, L, E) -> W, H, L
- ""SHAKE"" but S excluded.
- ""STAKE"" S and T excluded.
- ""GLAKE"" not a word.
- ""BRAKE"" B R A K E -> R excluded? R is excluded, so no.
- ""FLAKE"" F L A K E -> F, L, K? Pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This fits? But K is available. And ""FLAKE"" is a word.

""FLAKE"": uses F, L, K.

Similarly, ""BLAKE"" proper noun? Or a word? Not typically played in word games? ""BLAKE"" is a name, but might be accepted? Avoid.

""GLACE"" but that ends with E? ""GLACE"" is 6 letters? No, G L A C E -> but C is excluded? C is excluded. And pattern: G L A C E -> positions: G(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5). But C is excluded? Yes, from first guess.

So, possible common words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"", ""FLAKE"".

Now, which one to choose? All test three new letters.

But note: ""BLAME"" tests B, L, M; ""FLAME"" tests F, L, M; ""WHALE"" tests W, H, L; ""FLAKE"" tests F, L, K.

L appears in all? So if L is not in the word, we eliminate it with one of these.

But since we have to choose one, we can pick based on frequency? But L is tested in all? Position 2 in most, except ""WHALE"" has L at position 4.

In ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.

We might also consider ""MAIZE"" but third letter not A.

Another word: ""ABHOR"" not matching pattern.

""ALIKE"" third letter I.

""AMAZE"": A M A Z E -> A(1), M(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3? So we are reusing A? But we know A is present, so it might be duplicated? But let's see: if we put A at position 1, and if it is incorrect position, we get '-'.

But ""AMAZE"": uses letters A, M, Z. M and Z are new, but A is reused. Pattern matches A _ A _ E? Positions: A(1), M(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). Yes.

But we are using A in position 1, which is not known, so we test if A is also at position 1 or not? Possibly, but we can avoid reusing.

Similarly, ""AGAPE"" P excluded.

""ABUZZ"" not ending with E.

So, perhaps stick to ""BLAME"" or ""FLAME"" or ""FLAKE"".

Let's see if we can test a word without L? For example, ""BAKIE"" not a word.

""GUANO"" not matching.

""IMMIX"" not.

""KUDZU"" not.

It's limited.

Another word: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Uses Q, U, K? Q and U are rare.

But ""QUAKE"" is a valid common word? Yes.

However, compared to ""FLAME"", ""QUAKE"" is less likely? But we have to try.

But since Q and U are uncommon, we might avoid? But we have no choice? Not necessarily.

""BLAME"" is a good candidate.

But in terms of frequency, F is more common than Q.

Similarly, ""FLAKE"" tests K, which might be better than Q.

But let's list the letters we are testing.

Perhaps choose ""FLAKE"" to test K? Or ""BLAME"" to test B.

Since we have only a few options, we can choose one arbitrarily? But strategically.

Note: after this guess, we will have more exclusions or positions.

We can also consider that if we guess ""BLAME"" and get all wrong except A and E, we know that B, L, M are not in the word, etc.

But similarly for others.

Since L is in multiple, we might test it.

Another idea: perhaps ""BIOME"" but third letter O? No, O is excluded.

""ALGAE"": A L G A E -> A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), E(5) -> third letter G, not A? So no.

We must have A at third position.

So, I think I'll go with ""BLAME"".

But let me check: ""BLAME"" letter by letter.

B: position 1
L: position 2
A: position 3
M: position 4
E: position 5

All letters B,L,M are not excluded.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F,L,M.

But in ""FLAME"", we test F instead of B.

F is more common than B? F is less common? Letter frequency: F is 13th, B is 20th? Actually, F is more common than B.

Frequency order: E T A O I N S H R D L U C M F Y W G P B V K X Q J Z

So F is 15th, B is 22nd? After excluding: S (8th) and D (10th), R (9th), N (6th), etc., then F is mid-level.

But L (11th) and M (13th) are common.

Similarly, H is 8th? Previously excluded: R(9), S(8), N(6), C(12), D(10), P(18), T(2 is excluded, very significant), O(4 is excluded), V(21).

Remaining common letters: L (11), U (14? but not in pattern), M (13), F (15), H (7), etc.

H is 7th most common? After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H is 8th? Standard frequency: E (12.7%), T (9.06%), A (8.17%), O (7.51%), I (6.97%), N (6.75%), S (6.33%), H (6.09%), R (5.99%), D (4.25%), L (4.03%), C (2.78%), U (2.76%), M (2.41%), W (2.36%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), Y (1.97%), P (1.93%), B (1.49%), V (1.28%), K (0.77%), J (0.15%), X (0.15%), Q (0.10%), Z (0.07%)

So, among remaining consonants, H (6.09%) is most common, then L (4.03%), then M (2.41%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), etc.

But H is highly common.

Therefore, ""WHALE"" might be better because it tests H and W, but H is common.

""WHALE"" has W which is less common, but H is common.

Similarly, ""SHALE"" S excluded.

""CHALE"" not a word.

How about ""HAYER"" not matching pattern? Pattern must have third letter A.

""HYMNS"" no E.

""HELLO"" no.

Another word: ""HASTE"" S excluded.

""GHAZE"" not word? ""GHAZI"" not.

""JABOT"" no.

So, ""WHALE"" is a valid word: W H A L E

Positions: W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5)

Tests W, H, L.

H is very common, so we should test it? Yes.

In ""BLAME"", we test B, L, M. L is common, B and M less common.

In ""FLAME"", F, L, M: M common, F less common.

But H is more common than L? H: 6.09%, L: 4.03%, so H is slightly more common.

In ""WHALE"", we test H and L? Also W.

But W is less common? W: 2.36%

Similarly, ""FLAKE"" tests F, L, K: F(2.23%), L(4.03%), K(0.77%)

So, ""WHALE"" tests H (6.09%) and L (4.03%), which are both high frequency? And W (2.36%).

Whereas ""BLAME"" tests L (4.03%), M (2.41%), B (1.49%)? Or ""FLAME"" tests L, M, F.

But H is the top among remaining.

Therefore, I think ""WHALE"" is a good choice to test H.

Also, position: H is at position 2, L at position 4.

If we get - or ✓ for H, it would be informative.

Similarly, we could test ""HABLE"" not a word.

""HAVOC"" not.

So, ""WHALE"" is a common word.

We'll go with ""WHALE"".

But we have to make a guess.

So, <thinking>
After Guess 3 (OVATE) feedback: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T
- Pattern: _ _ A _ E remains unchanged
- Goal: Guess a word fitting _ _ A _ E using only letters not excluded and not reused unnecessarily

Options considered:
- ""WHALE"" (W,H,A,L,E): Tests W, H, L (H is high-frequency, L medium, W low)
- ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E): Tests B, L, M
- ""FLAME"" (F,L,A,M,E): Tests F, L, M
- ""FLAKE"" (F,L,A,K,E): Tests F, L, K

Decision:
- ""WHALE"" is chosen because it includes the highest-frequency untested letter (H ≈6.1%) and L, which balances information potential.
- Word validity: ""WHALE"" is valid and fixes A and E in positions 3 and 5.
- If H is present, feedback will reveal its position (even if misplaced, we know it exists).

Thus, guessing ""WHALE"".
</thinking>
<guess>WHALE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  Revealed: The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5. Excluded letters: C, R, N.
- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
  Confirmed positions 3 and 5, and excluded S, P, D.
- **Guess 3: OVATE** → Feedback: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  Confirmed positions 3 and 5, and excluded O, V, T.

**Key insights:**
- Fixed pattern: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are A and E).
- Total excluded letters: **C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T**.
- Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 are from: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Strategy: Test high-frequency unsused letters (e.g., H, L) and avoid repeating known letters in untested positions.

**Reasoning for next guess:**
- Possible words fitting `_ _ A _ E` with allowed letters include ""WHALE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", and ""FLAKE"".
- ""WHALE"" (W,H,A,L,E) is selected because:
  - Tests **H** (high-frequency ≈6.09%) and **L** (medium-frequency ≈4.03%), optimizing information gain.
  - **W** is less common but necessary for a valid word.
  - Avoids reused letters in positions 1, 2, and 4, and respects all exclusions.
- If H or L is present, feedback will reveal their positions/absence, significantly narrowing possibilities.

<guess>WHALE</guess>",WHALE,"We are given feedback on the third guess ""OVATE"":
- O: x (not in the word)
- V: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So, we have excluded additional letters: O, V, T.

Now, the total excluded letters are: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T.

The secret word does not contain any of these excluded letters.

H is 7th most common? After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H is 8th? Standard frequency: E (12.7%), T (9.06%), A (8.17%), O (7.51%), I (6.97%), N (6.75%), S (6.33%), H (6.09%), R (5.99%), D (4.25%), L (4.03%), C (2.78%), U (2.76%), M (2.41%), W (2.36%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), Y (1.97%), P (1.93%), B (1.49%), V (1.28%), K (0.77%), J (0.15%), X (0.15%), Q (0.10%), Z (0.07%)

- ""WHALE"" is chosen because it includes the highest-frequency untested letter (H ≈6.1%) and L, which balances information potential.
- Word validity: ""WHALE"" is valid and fixes A and E in positions 3 and 5.
- If H is present, feedback will reveal its position (even if misplaced, we know it exists).

Thus, guessing ""WHALE"".
</thinking>
<guess>WHALE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  Revealed: The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5. Excluded letters: C, R, N.
- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
  Confirmed positions 3 and 5, and excluded S, P, D.
- **Guess 3: OVATE** → Feedback: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  Confirmed positions 3 and 5, and excluded O, V, T.

**Key insights:**
- Fixed pattern: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are A and E).
- Total excluded letters: **C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T**.
- Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 are from: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Strategy: Test high-frequency unsused letters (e.g., H, L) and avoid repeating known letters in untested positions.

**Reasoning for next guess:**
- Possible words fitting `_ _ A _ E` with allowed letters include ""WHALE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", and ""FLAKE"".
- ""WHALE"" (W,H,A,L,E) is selected because:
  - Tests **H** (high-frequency ≈6.09%) and **L** (medium-frequency ≈4.03%), optimizing information gain.
  - **W** is less common but necessary for a valid word.
  - Avoids reused letters in positions 1, 2, and 4, and respects all exclusions.
- If H or L is present, feedback will reveal their positions/absence, significantly narrowing possibilities.",Guess 4: WHALE -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) A(✓) L(-) E(✓),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 We want a word that can give us good information about the secret word. Ideally, we choose a word that has common letters and covers different positions.

 One common strategy is to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""SPARE"", etc. are often used.

 Let me choose ""ROATE"". This word includes common letters: R, O, A, T, E. It has vowels (O, A, E) and common consonants (R, T). 

 However, note that the response format requires the word to be valid. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (meaning: the cumulative return on investment over accounting periods).

 Alternatively, I can pick a more common starting word like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it uses five distinct letters and is a common starter.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
I am making my first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Good starting words typically include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E are all frequently used in English words
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five unique letters
- ""CRANE"" is a valid English word under game rules

This guess should provide strong feedback on letter presence/positions.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter in the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

We know that the third letter is A and the fifth letter is E.

Also, the letters C, R, N are definitely not in the word. So we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, for our second guess, we want to:
1. Test other letters in the remaining positions (first, second, fourth) to gather more information.
2. Avoid using the excluded letters C, R, N.

We know the word must be of the form _ _ A _ E.

Let's think of possible words that fit this pattern and exclude C, R, N.

We also want to test common vowels and consonants for the first, second, and fourth positions.

Note that in the fourth position, it must be a letter that can come before E and after A.

Potential words: 
- B_ A _ E: e.g., ""BLASE"", ""BAISE""? But note we can't have S because we don't know if S is in the word yet? Actually, we haven't tested S.
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common consonants for the beginning: S, T, L, etc.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A _ E and don't contain C, R, N.

Examples:
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)
- ""SNAKE"": but N is excluded, so no.
- ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> G is not tested yet.
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> P and D not tested.
- ""ABATE"": A is already used? But the first letter is A? Pattern is _ _ A _ E so first letter cannot be A? Because third is A. First and second letters are unknown.

But note: the word must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but N is excluded, so invalid.

We must avoid N, so ""PLANE"" is out.

""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but T is not excluded? However, we have A and E in place. So positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). Also, no C, R, N.

But we know that A and E are correct and in position, so in ""SLATE"", the A and E positions are exactly as required.

However, the feedback for the first guess told us that only A and E are in the word and correctly placed? We don't know if there are other letters.

Wait, the feedback: 
- C and x: not present
- R and x: not present
- A ✓: present and correct position
- N and x: not present
- E ✓: present and correct position

So the secret word contains A and E at positions 3 and 5, and does not contain C, R, N.

Without knowing more, ""SLATE"" could be a candidate? But we also need to test other letters.

But note: in ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T, and we know A and E are fixed.

Another candidate: ""QUAKE"", but Q might be less common.

We should choose a word that tests letters we don't know anything about.

Since we have A and E fixed, we can focus on testing letters for positions 1, 2, and 4.

We want to use a word that has:
- New letters: so not C, R, N, and also we know A and E are already present, so we don't need to test them again? Actually, in the guess we must put A and E in positions 3 and 5 because that's fixed? Yes, because we know they are correct.

For the second guess, we should build on the known information. So the guess must have A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Then we can test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So the pattern for our next guess must be:  _  _  A  _  E

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, N.

Now, common letters to test: S, T, L, D, P, etc.

I'd like to test a word that uses many frequent letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": uses S, L, T -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 4:T
- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> but R is excluded? Since R came back as not present in the first guess? Yes, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word. We cannot use R. So ""STARE"" is invalid because it has R.
- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> letters: S, H, D
- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> S, P, D
- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F, L, M

But note: the fourth position must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but typically in English, words ending with E often have a consonant before it? But position 4 can be any letter that forms a word.

Actually, let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: 
- ""SHAKE"" (S,H,A,K,E) -> K is another consonant? but we haven't tested K.
- ""STAGE"" (S,T,A,G,E) -> G is not tested.

But we must avoid R and N? Also avoid C.

Another one: ""PLANE"" has N, excluded.

""SPADE"" is a valid word: meaning a playing card suit or a digging tool.

""SPADE"": S (1), P (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)

This uses S, P, D: all new letters that we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""SHADE"" uses S, H, D.

Which one is better? Both are good.

I could choose ""SPADE"". But we have another constraint: we might want to test letters that have higher frequency in English.

Frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, ... but knowing R and N are excluded, and A and E are included, we can focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

T, O, I, S, L are very common.

In positions 1, 2, and 4, we can try to cover several common letters.

For example:
- ""STOLE"": but pattern must be _ _ A _ E, so ""STOLE"" is S T O L E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),L(4),E(5) -> but the third letter is O, not A? So that doesn't fit.

We must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Another word: ""SOARE"" is it valid? I think ""SOARE"" might not be common; better use a common word.

""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern is _ _ A _ E, meaning third letter must be A? ""TABLE"" has T at 1, A at 2? So positions: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B? Not A? So no.

We must ensure the third letter is A and fifth is E.

""ABATE"": A at first? Pattern requires third letter A, so ""ABATE"" has A at 1 and 3? Let's see: A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> yes, first letter A, which we don't know if A can appear elsewhere? But we only know position 3 has A. But the word does have position 3 A and position 5 E? Yes. However, in ""ABATE"", the first letter is A, and we don't know if A is allowed at other positions? But the feedback didn't say that A is only once? Actually, we don't know, A might be duplicated? So ""ABATE"" could be possible? But then we get A at position 1 and 3? But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.

In ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?

However, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a '-' feedback? But we can get useful info.

Still, we want to test new letters. So maybe it's better to not reuse A if possible? We don't have to, since we don't know the other letters.

But using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.

Similarly for E.

For maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven't tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don't know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.

In our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.

So avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.

Therefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.

Let me choose ""SPADE"":

Letters: S, P, A, D, E

A and E are known and in correct positions. So we'll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.

If S is correct at position 1, we'll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.

If any is not in the word, we'll see x, if misplaced, we'll see -.

That should give us good information.

Alternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.

But T is very common. Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPADE"".

So guess: SPADE<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C (x) not in the word
- R (x) not in the word
- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3
- N (x) not in the word
- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5

Key information:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
2. C, R, and N are not in the word.
3. A and E are confirmed in the word at positions 3 and 5 respectively.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E.
- Must not include C, R, N (as they are absent in the secret word).
- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.
- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.

Possible words: SPADE, SHADE, GLADE, SLATE, etc. After evaluating:
- ""SPADE"" (S,P,A,D,E) uses new high-frequency letters (S, P, D), which are common and can test positions 1, 2, and 4 effectively.
- Avoids reused known letters like A and E in untested positions.
- Provides maximum information potential for the remaining letters.

Therefore, guessing ""SPADE"" is a strategic choice to narrow down possibilities.
</thinking>

<guess>SPADE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SPADE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the second guess ""SPADE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still the third letter)
- D: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is still the fifth letter)

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Additionally, we have excluded the following letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and does not contain any of the excluded letters.

We must avoid: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We also know that A and E are in the word and in the correct positions.

We need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not excluded and not A or E (since we don't want to reuse known letters unnecessarily, but note: we can use other letters that might be duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates, so it's safer to avoid A and E in new positions to test new letters).

So, we are looking for words of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

Where letter1, letter2, letter4 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, N, S, P, D, and also excluding A and E? Not necessarily, but we can choose to avoid them to test new letters.

But we don't have to avoid A and E, but since we already know they are present, putting them in other positions might tell us if there are duplicates? However, we are limited by the pattern: we have to put A at position 3 and E at position 5. So in positions 1,2,4 we can only put one letter each, and we want to test new letters.

So, we should choose letters that we haven't tested yet and that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D.

A and E are in the word, the others are out.

Now, what letters are available? The rest of the alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ A _ E.

Possible words:

- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern requires third letter A? ""TABLE"" has T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B, not A. So no.

- ""BAYLE"": not a word.

- ""MAKER"": but R is excluded and pattern doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E.

So, let's think of words ending with E and having A as the third letter.

Examples:

- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> but we have M at position 4? And B and L at 1 and 2. But we haven't excluded B, L, M. However, in ""BLAME"", the pattern is B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This fits.

But we have to check if B, L, M are allowed? They are not excluded.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> same pattern.

""GLADE"": but D is excluded? D is excluded from the second guess, so no.

""SHADE"": S and D are excluded? S and D are excluded, so no.

""ABATE"": A B A T E -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We don't know if A can be duplicated? But it's possible. However, we are using A at position 1, which we haven't tested. But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 and it's not present there, we get a '-' or 'x'? But we are testing.

But we want to test new letters? So using A again might not be efficient? But we can.

However, in ""ABATE"", we are testing B and T? And we get information about A at position 1.

But we have limited guesses, so we should avoid reusing known letters? Not necessarily, but it might be better to test new ones.

Another word: ""THANE"": T H A N E -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first guess, so no.

""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> Q, U, K are new. But Q is less common.

""WAIVE"": W A I V E -> but pattern: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> third letter is F? No.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> N excluded.

""LATKE"": L A T K E -> third letter T? No.

""BASTE"": B A S T E -> S excluded.

""PASTE"": P and S excluded.

""HASTE"": S excluded.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""GLAZE"": Z is not excluded? But pattern: G L A Z E -> G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This fits. And Z is not excluded? But Z is less common.

""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> same.

But let's look for more common words.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This is a valid word.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). Also valid.

""FRAME"": F R A M E -> but R is excluded? R is excluded, so no.

""GAMME"": not a word.

""JAMBE"": J A M B E -> third letter M? No.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> A(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We can use this? But we are testing L and T.

But we are reusing A at position 1.

Similarly, ""AGAPE"": A G A P E -> P excluded.

""AVAKE"": not a word.

""OAKEN"": N excluded.

""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> third letter U? No.

""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> third letter I? No.

""LEMKE"": not a word.

So, common words that fit: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLAME"" (not common), ""SHAME"" but S excluded.

Another one: ""THAWE"" not a word.

""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). This fits. And W, H, L are not excluded.

Similarly, ""SHALE"": S excluded.

""CHALE"" not a word.

So, possible words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""BLAME"": tests B, L, M
""FLAME"": tests F, L, M
""WHALE"": tests W, H, L

All test three new letters.

But note that L is common to all? So if we choose one, we test L in position 2 or 4? In ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"", L is at position 2, and in ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.

We don't have a preference? But we can choose based on letter frequency.

Common letters: T, L, O, I, etc. T is very common and we haven't tested it.

Is there a word that includes T?

For example, ""ABATE"": A B A T E -> but we have A at position 1? And B and T. But we are reusing A.

""ALATE"": A L A T E -> same.

""TASTE"": S excluded.

""WASTE"": S excluded.

""PASTE"": S and P excluded.

""GATE"": too short.

""LATHE"": L A T H E -> pattern: L(1), A(2), T(3), H(4), E(5) -> third letter is T, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

""QUATE"" not a word.

""OVATE"": O V A T E -> O(1), V(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This is a word (meaning: having an oval shape). And O, V, T are new.

Similarly, ""OVATE"" tests O, V, T.

T is a common letter.

Another word: ""INANE"" but N excluded.

""IRATE"": I R A T E -> R excluded.

""URATE"": U R A T E -> R excluded.

""AGATE"": A G A T E -> G and T, but A at position 1 and 3? And we are reusing A.

But ""AGATE"" is a word: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5).

But we are testing G and T, and reusing A.

Similarly, ""AVATE"" not a word.

So, we have:

- ""BLAME"": B, L, M
- ""FLAME"": F, L, M
- ""WHALE"": W, H, L
- ""OVATE"": O, V, T
- ""AGATE"": A, G, T (but reuses A at position 1)

We should avoid reusing A if possible? Because we already know A is present, so putting it at position 1 might not give new information? But if it is present at position 1, we get a '-' or if not, we get 'x'. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A? So it could be useful.

But to maximize new information, we can avoid reusing A and E.

So, ""OVATE"" is good: O, V, T are all new.

""BLAME"" is also good: B, L, M new.

But T is more common than B, L, M? Let's see frequency.

In English, T is the second most common consonant after R (which is excluded), so T is very common.

O is a vowel, also common.

V is less common.

But ""OVATE"" has O and T, which are common.

""BLAME"" has L and M, which are common.

But T is more common than L and M? Actually, T is more common than L and M.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (N and R excluded, S and D excluded).

So after A and E, the next are T, O, I, etc.

So T and O are high frequency.

Therefore, ""OVATE"" might be a good choice because it tests T and O.

Also, V is less common, but we have to use it to form the word.

Another word: ""OLATE"" not a word.

""URAEI"" not matching.

""KNAVE"" N excluded.

So, I think ""OVATE"" is a valid choice.

But let me confirm if ""OVATE"" is accepted. Yes, it's a word.

Alternatively, ""TAKER"" R excluded.

""MAKER"" R excluded.

""BAKER"" R excluded.

""LAKEE"" not a word.

So, I'll go with ""OVATE"".

But in ""OVATE"", we have O at position 1, V at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This fits the pattern.

We are testing O, V, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"" but third letter I? No.

""ABIDE"" third letter I? No.

So, ""OVATE"" seems good.

But we have ""WHALE"" which has H and W? H is common, W less so.

But T is more common than H? T is more common than H? Actually, T is more common: T is 2nd, H is 8th in frequency.

So ""OVATE"" tests T and O, which are high frequency.

Therefore, I choose ""OVATE"".

But let's see if there is a word with T and O without V? For example, ""TOGAE"" not matching pattern.

""ATOLL"" not ending with E.

So, ""OVATE"" is acceptable.

We'll guess ""OVATE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This indicates that the secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, and excludes C, R, and N.

- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
  This confirms 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, and excludes S, P, and D.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, S, P, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Goal for the next guess: Test new high-frequency letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to maximize information, while avoiding excluded letters and reusing A and E only in their known positions.

**Reasoning for the next guess:**
- We need a word matching `_ _ A _ E` with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- High-frequency letters like T, O, L, and I are prioritized for testing, as they are common in English words.
- After evaluating options:
  - Words like ""BLAME"" (tests B, L, M) or ""FLAME"" (tests F, L, M) are possible but focus on less common consonants.
  - ""WHALE"" (tests W, H, L) is valid but includes less common letters like W.
  - ""OVATE"" (tests O, V, T) is a strong choice because:
    - It uses O (high-frequency vowel) and T (high-frequency consonant), which are statistically likely to appear.
    - V is less common but necessary to form a valid word.
    - It avoids reused letters in untested positions (A and E are only in their known spots).
    - ""OVATE"" is a valid English word (meaning: egg-shaped or relating to ovum).
- This guess will provide feedback on O, V, and T, helping to narrow down possibilities significantly.

<guess>OVATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SPADE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: OVATE -> FEEDBACK: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the third guess ""OVATE"":
- O: x (not in the word)
- V: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So, we have excluded additional letters: O, V, T.

Now, the total excluded letters are: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T.

We also know the pattern must be _ _ A _ E.

The secret word does not contain any of these excluded letters.

We need to find a word that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We have to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with letters from this set.

We also note that we have used A and E in their positions, so in positions 1,2,4 we should use new letters to gain information.

Possible words:

- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This word uses B, L, M, which are still available? Yes, since not excluded.

But we haven't tested B, L, M yet.

""BLAME"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) -> F, L, M also available.

Another one: ""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> W, H, L available.

But ""WHALE"" has L at position 4? Yes.

""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but Z is available? Yes, but the pattern matches: G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). Valid word.

But Z is less common.

Other possibilities: ""ABATE"" but we have to use the pattern? ""ABATE"" is A B A T E, but T is excluded? T is excluded, from the third guess feedback. T is x, so no.

Similarly, any word with T cannot be used.

How about ""ULNAE"" not matching.

""BAIZE"": B A I Z E -> but pattern third letter must be A? This would be B(1), A(2), I(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> third letter I? No.

""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> but pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This fits? But Q and U? Q is rare.

""JAIME"" not a common word? ""JAIME"" can be a name, but let's stick to common words.

""KAZOO"" not ending with E.

""BAYLE"" not a word.

Common words that fit:

- ""BLAME"" (B, L, A, M, E) -> B, L, M
- ""FLAME"" (F, L, A, M, E) -> F, L, M
- ""WHALE"" (W, H, A, L, E) -> W, H, L
- ""SHAKE"" but S excluded.
- ""STAKE"" S and T excluded.
- ""GLAKE"" not a word.
- ""BRAKE"" B R A K E -> R excluded? R is excluded, so no.
- ""FLAKE"" F L A K E -> F, L, K? Pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This fits? But K is available. And ""FLAKE"" is a word.

""FLAKE"": uses F, L, K.

Similarly, ""BLAKE"" proper noun? Or a word? Not typically played in word games? ""BLAKE"" is a name, but might be accepted? Avoid.

""GLACE"" but that ends with E? ""GLACE"" is 6 letters? No, G L A C E -> but C is excluded? C is excluded. And pattern: G L A C E -> positions: G(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5). But C is excluded? Yes, from first guess.

So, possible common words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"", ""FLAKE"".

Now, which one to choose? All test three new letters.

But note: ""BLAME"" tests B, L, M; ""FLAME"" tests F, L, M; ""WHALE"" tests W, H, L; ""FLAKE"" tests F, L, K.

L appears in all? So if L is not in the word, we eliminate it with one of these.

But since we have to choose one, we can pick based on frequency? But L is tested in all? Position 2 in most, except ""WHALE"" has L at position 4.

In ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.

We might also consider ""MAIZE"" but third letter not A.

Another word: ""ABHOR"" not matching pattern.

""ALIKE"" third letter I.

""AMAZE"": A M A Z E -> A(1), M(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3? So we are reusing A? But we know A is present, so it might be duplicated? But let's see: if we put A at position 1, and if it is incorrect position, we get '-'.

But ""AMAZE"": uses letters A, M, Z. M and Z are new, but A is reused. Pattern matches A _ A _ E? Positions: A(1), M(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). Yes.

But we are using A in position 1, which is not known, so we test if A is also at position 1 or not? Possibly, but we can avoid reusing.

Similarly, ""AGAPE"" P excluded.

""ABUZZ"" not ending with E.

So, perhaps stick to ""BLAME"" or ""FLAME"" or ""FLAKE"".

Let's see if we can test a word without L? For example, ""BAKIE"" not a word.

""GUANO"" not matching.

""IMMIX"" not.

""KUDZU"" not.

It's limited.

Another word: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Uses Q, U, K? Q and U are rare.

But ""QUAKE"" is a valid common word? Yes.

However, compared to ""FLAME"", ""QUAKE"" is less likely? But we have to try.

But since Q and U are uncommon, we might avoid? But we have no choice? Not necessarily.

""BLAME"" is a good candidate.

But in terms of frequency, F is more common than Q.

Similarly, ""FLAKE"" tests K, which might be better than Q.

But let's list the letters we are testing.

Perhaps choose ""FLAKE"" to test K? Or ""BLAME"" to test B.

Since we have only a few options, we can choose one arbitrarily? But strategically.

Note: after this guess, we will have more exclusions or positions.

We can also consider that if we guess ""BLAME"" and get all wrong except A and E, we know that B, L, M are not in the word, etc.

But similarly for others.

Since L is in multiple, we might test it.

Another idea: perhaps ""BIOME"" but third letter O? No, O is excluded.

""ALGAE"": A L G A E -> A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), E(5) -> third letter G, not A? So no.

We must have A at third position.

So, I think I'll go with ""BLAME"".

But let me check: ""BLAME"" letter by letter.

B: position 1
L: position 2
A: position 3
M: position 4
E: position 5

All letters B,L,M are not excluded.

Similarly, ""FLAME"": F,L,M.

But in ""FLAME"", we test F instead of B.

F is more common than B? F is less common? Letter frequency: F is 13th, B is 20th? Actually, F is more common than B.

Frequency order: E T A O I N S H R D L U C M F Y W G P B V K X Q J Z

So F is 15th, B is 22nd? After excluding: S (8th) and D (10th), R (9th), N (6th), etc., then F is mid-level.

But L (11th) and M (13th) are common.

Similarly, H is 8th? Previously excluded: R(9), S(8), N(6), C(12), D(10), P(18), T(2 is excluded, very significant), O(4 is excluded), V(21).

Remaining common letters: L (11), U (14? but not in pattern), M (13), F (15), H (7), etc.

H is 7th most common? After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H is 8th? Standard frequency: E (12.7%), T (9.06%), A (8.17%), O (7.51%), I (6.97%), N (6.75%), S (6.33%), H (6.09%), R (5.99%), D (4.25%), L (4.03%), C (2.78%), U (2.76%), M (2.41%), W (2.36%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), Y (1.97%), P (1.93%), B (1.49%), V (1.28%), K (0.77%), J (0.15%), X (0.15%), Q (0.10%), Z (0.07%)

So, among remaining consonants, H (6.09%) is most common, then L (4.03%), then M (2.41%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), etc.

But H is highly common.

Therefore, ""WHALE"" might be better because it tests H and W, but H is common.

""WHALE"" has W which is less common, but H is common.

Similarly, ""SHALE"" S excluded.

""CHALE"" not a word.

How about ""HAYER"" not matching pattern? Pattern must have third letter A.

""HYMNS"" no E.

""HELLO"" no.

Another word: ""HASTE"" S excluded.

""GHAZE"" not word? ""GHAZI"" not.

""JABOT"" no.

So, ""WHALE"" is a valid word: W H A L E

Positions: W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5)

Tests W, H, L.

H is very common, so we should test it? Yes.

In ""BLAME"", we test B, L, M. L is common, B and M less common.

In ""FLAME"", F, L, M: M common, F less common.

But H is more common than L? H: 6.09%, L: 4.03%, so H is slightly more common.

In ""WHALE"", we test H and L? Also W.

But W is less common? W: 2.36%

Similarly, ""FLAKE"" tests F, L, K: F(2.23%), L(4.03%), K(0.77%)

So, ""WHALE"" tests H (6.09%) and L (4.03%), which are both high frequency? And W (2.36%).

Whereas ""BLAME"" tests L (4.03%), M (2.41%), B (1.49%)? Or ""FLAME"" tests L, M, F.

But H is the top among remaining.

Therefore, I think ""WHALE"" is a good choice to test H.

Also, position: H is at position 2, L at position 4.

If we get - or ✓ for H, it would be informative.

Similarly, we could test ""HABLE"" not a word.

""HAVOC"" not.

So, ""WHALE"" is a common word.

We'll go with ""WHALE"".

But we have to make a guess.

So, <thinking>
After Guess 3 (OVATE) feedback: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T
- Pattern: _ _ A _ E remains unchanged
- Goal: Guess a word fitting _ _ A _ E using only letters not excluded and not reused unnecessarily

Options considered:
- ""WHALE"" (W,H,A,L,E): Tests W, H, L (H is high-frequency, L medium, W low)
- ""BLAME"" (B,L,A,M,E): Tests B, L, M
- ""FLAME"" (F,L,A,M,E): Tests F, L, M
- ""FLAKE"" (F,L,A,K,E): Tests F, L, K

Decision:
- ""WHALE"" is chosen because it includes the highest-frequency untested letter (H ≈6.1%) and L, which balances information potential.
- Word validity: ""WHALE"" is valid and fixes A and E in positions 3 and 5.
- If H is present, feedback will reveal its position (even if misplaced, we know it exists).

Thus, guessing ""WHALE"".
</thinking>
<guess>WHALE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  Revealed: The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5. Excluded letters: C, R, N.
- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
  Confirmed positions 3 and 5, and excluded S, P, D.
- **Guess 3: OVATE** → Feedback: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  Confirmed positions 3 and 5, and excluded O, V, T.

**Key insights:**
- Fixed pattern: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are A and E).
- Total excluded letters: **C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T**.
- Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 are from: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Strategy: Test high-frequency unsused letters (e.g., H, L) and avoid repeating known letters in untested positions.

**Reasoning for next guess:**
- Possible words fitting `_ _ A _ E` with allowed letters include ""WHALE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", and ""FLAKE"".
- ""WHALE"" (W,H,A,L,E) is selected because:
  - Tests **H** (high-frequency ≈6.09%) and **L** (medium-frequency ≈4.03%), optimizing information gain.
  - **W** is less common but necessary for a valid word.
  - Avoids reused letters in positions 1, 2, and 4, and respects all exclusions.
- If H or L is present, feedback will reveal their positions/absence, significantly narrowing possibilities.

So we must avoid using them in future guesses.\n\nNow, for our second guess, we want to:\n1. Test other letters in the remaining positions (first, second, fourth) to gather more information.\n2. Avoid using the excluded letters C, R, N.\n\nWe know the word must be of the form _ _ A _ E.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words that fit this pattern and exclude C, R, N.\n\nWe also want to test common vowels and consonants for the first, second, and fourth positions.\n\nNote that in the fourth position, it must be a letter that can come before E and after A.\n\nPotential words: \n- B_ A _ E: e.g., ""BLASE"", ""BAISE""? But note we can\'t have S because we don\'t know if S is in the word yet? Actually, we haven\'t tested S.\n- We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nCommon consonants for the beginning: S, T, L, etc.\n\nLet me list some words that fit _ _ A _ E and don\'t contain C, R, N.\n\nExamples:\n- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> positions: S (1), H (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)\n- ""SNAKE"": but N is excluded, so no.\n- ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> G is not tested yet.\n- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> P and D not tested.\n- ""ABATE"": A is already used? But the first letter is A? Pattern is _ _ A _ E so first letter cannot be A? Because third is A. First and second letters are unknown.\n\nBut note: the word must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANE"" but N is excluded, so invalid.\n\nWe must avoid N, so ""PLANE"" is out.\n\n""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but T is not excluded? However, we have A and E in place. So positions: S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). Also, no C, R, N.\n\nBut we know that A and E are correct and in position, so in ""SLATE"", the A and E positions are exactly as required.\n\nHowever, the feedback for the first guess told us that only A and E are in the word and correctly placed? We don\'t know if there are other letters.\n\nWait, the feedback: \n- C and x: not present\n- R and x: not present\n- A ✓: present and correct position\n- N and x: not present\n- E ✓: present and correct position\n\nSo the secret word contains A and E at positions 3 and 5, and does not contain C, R, N.\n\nWithout knowing more, ""SLATE"" could be a candidate? But we also need to test other letters.\n\nBut note: in ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T, and we know A and E are fixed.\n\nAnother candidate: ""QUAKE"", but Q might be less common.\n\nWe should choose a word that tests letters we don\'t know anything about.\n\nSince we have A and E fixed, we can focus on testing letters for positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nWe want to use a word that has:\n- New letters: so not C, R, N, and also we know A and E are already present, so we don\'t need to test them again? Actually, in the guess we must put A and E in positions 3 and 5 because that\'s fixed? Yes, because we know they are correct.\n\nFor the second guess, we should build on the known information. So the guess must have A in the third position and E in the fifth position. Then we can test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSo the pattern for our next guess must be:  _  _  A  _  E\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, N.\n\nNow, common letters to test: S, T, L, D, P, etc.\n\nI\'d like to test a word that uses many frequent letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SLATE"": uses S, L, T -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 4:T\n- ""STARE"": S T A R E -> but R is excluded? Since R came back as not present in the first guess? Yes, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word. We cannot use R. So ""STARE"" is invalid because it has R.\n- ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> letters: S, H, D\n- ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> S, P, D\n- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M\n- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F, L, M\n\nBut note: the fourth position must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but typically in English, words ending with E often have a consonant before it? But position 4 can be any letter that forms a word.\n\nActually, let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ A _ E.\n\nCommon ones: \n- ""SHAKE"" (S,H,A,K,E) -> K is another consonant? but we haven\'t tested K.\n- ""STAGE"" (S,T,A,G,E) -> G is not tested.\n\nBut we must avoid R and N? Also avoid C.\n\nAnother one: ""PLANE"" has N, excluded.\n\n""SPADE"" is a valid word: meaning a playing card suit or a digging tool.\n\n""SPADE"": S (1), P (2), A (3), D (4), E (5)\n\nThis uses S, P, D: all new letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHADE"" uses S, H, D.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are good.\n\nI could choose ""SPADE"". But we have another constraint: we might want to test letters that have higher frequency in English.\n\nFrequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, ... but knowing R and N are excluded, and A and E are included, we can focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\nT, O, I, S, L are very common.\n\nIn positions 1, 2, and 4, we can try to cover several common letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""STOLE"": but pattern must be _ _ A _ E, so ""STOLE"" is S T O L E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),L(4),E(5) -> but the third letter is O, not A? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""SOARE"" is it valid? I think ""SOARE"" might not be common; better use a common word.\n\n""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern is _ _ A _ E, meaning third letter must be A? ""TABLE"" has T at 1, A at 2? So positions: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B? Not A? So no.\n\nWe must ensure the third letter is A and fifth is E.\n\n""ABATE"": A at first? Pattern requires third letter A, so ""ABATE"" has A at 1 and 3? Let\'s see: A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> yes, first letter A, which we don\'t know if A can appear elsewhere? But we only know position 3 has A. But the word does have position 3 A and position 5 E? Yes. However, in ""ABATE"", the first letter is A, and we don\'t know if A is allowed at other positions? But the feedback didn\'t say that A is only once? Actually, we don\'t know, A might be duplicated? So ""ABATE"" could be possible? But then we get A at position 1 and 3? But let me recall the feedback: for ""CRANE"", the A was at position 3 and was correct. But the secret word could have A in other positions? Not necessarily.\n\nIn ""ABATE"", we have A at position 1 and 3. Position 3 A matches, position 5 E matches. But we also test B and T? But position 1 is A, which might be correct?\n\nHowever, we are guessing anyway, so testing A at position 1 is okay? But we already know A is in the word, but if we put A at a wrong position, we might get a \'-\' feedback? But we can get useful info.\n\nStill, we want to test new letters. So maybe it\'s better to not reuse A if possible? We don\'t have to, since we don\'t know the other letters.\n\nBut using A again might not be optimal for information? Because we already know A is present.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nFor maximum information, we should fill the blanks with letters we haven\'t tested, so no A and no E? Because A and E are known to be present? But we don\'t know about duplicates? Still, testing new letters is better.\n\nIn our pattern, we have A at 3 and E at 5, so we must put them. But the other positions: 1, 2, 4 should be new letters.\n\nSo avoid using A or E in positions 1, 2, or 4? Yes, so that we can test new letters.\n\nTherefore, words like ""SPADE"", ""SHADE"", ""BLAME"", etc., are good because they use distinct new letters.\n\nLet me choose ""SPADE"":\n\nLetters: S, P, A, D, E\n\nA and E are known and in correct positions. So we\'ll be testing S, P, D in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nIf S is correct at position 1, we\'ll see ✓ for S. Similarly for P and D.\n\nIf any is not in the word, we\'ll see x, if misplaced, we\'ll see -.\n\nThat should give us good information.\n\nAlternative: ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> L and T.\n\nBut T is very common. Both are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPADE"".\n\nSo guess: SPADE<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C (x) not in the word\n- R (x) not in the word\n- A (✓) correctly placed at position 3\n- N (x) not in the word\n- E (✓) correctly placed at position 5\n\nKey information:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n2. C, R, and N are not in the word.\n3. A and E are confirmed in the word at positions 3 and 5 respectively.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E.\n- Must not include C, R, N (as they are absent in the secret word).\n- Should test new common letters to gain more information about positions 1, 2, and 4.\n- A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, so the guess should reuse them to maintain the pattern.\n\nPossible words: SPADE, SHADE, GLADE, SLATE, etc. After evaluating:\n- ""SPADE"" (S,P,A,D,E) uses new high-frequency letters (S, P, D), which are common and can test positions 1, 2, and 4 effectively.\n- Avoids reused known letters like A and E in untested positions.\n- Provides maximum information potential for the remaining letters.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""SPADE"" is a strategic choice to narrow down possibilities.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SPADE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SPADE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the second guess ""SPADE"":\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still the third letter)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is still the fifth letter)\n\nTherefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nAdditionally, we have excluded the following letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nWe also know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and does not contain any of the excluded letters.\n\nWe must avoid: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nWe also know that A and E are in the word and in the correct positions.\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not excluded and not A or E (since we don\'t want to reuse known letters unnecessarily, but note: we can use other letters that might be duplicates? But we don\'t know about duplicates, so it\'s safer to avoid A and E in new positions to test new letters).\n\nSo, we are looking for words of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E\n\nWhere letter1, letter2, letter4 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, N, S, P, D, and also excluding A and E? Not necessarily, but we can choose to avoid them to test new letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have to avoid A and E, but since we already know they are present, putting them in other positions might tell us if there are duplicates? However, we are limited by the pattern: we have to put A at position 3 and E at position 5. So in positions 1,2,4 we can only put one letter each, and we want to test new letters.\n\nSo, we should choose letters that we haven\'t tested yet and that are not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D.\n\nWe have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D.\n\nA and E are in the word, the others are out.\n\nNow, what letters are available? The rest of the alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word that fits _ _ A _ E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but pattern requires third letter A? ""TABLE"" has T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> third letter is B, not A. So no.\n\n- ""BAYLE"": not a word.\n\n- ""MAKER"": but R is excluded and pattern doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words ending with E and having A as the third letter.\n\nExamples:\n\n- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> but we have M at position 4? And B and L at 1 and 2. But we haven\'t excluded B, L, M. However, in ""BLAME"", the pattern is B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This fits.\n\nBut we have to check if B, L, M are allowed? They are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> same pattern.\n\n""GLADE"": but D is excluded? D is excluded from the second guess, so no.\n\n""SHADE"": S and D are excluded? S and D are excluded, so no.\n\n""ABATE"": A B A T E -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We don\'t know if A can be duplicated? But it\'s possible. However, we are using A at position 1, which we haven\'t tested. But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 and it\'s not present there, we get a \'-\' or \'x\'? But we are testing.\n\nBut we want to test new letters? So using A again might not be efficient? But we can.\n\nHowever, in ""ABATE"", we are testing B and T? And we get information about A at position 1.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we should avoid reusing known letters? Not necessarily, but it might be better to test new ones.\n\nAnother word: ""THANE"": T H A N E -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first guess, so no.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> Q, U, K are new. But Q is less common.\n\n""WAIVE"": W A I V E -> but pattern: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\n""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> third letter is F? No.\n\n""MANGE"": M A N G E -> N excluded.\n\n""LATKE"": L A T K E -> third letter T? No.\n\n""BASTE"": B A S T E -> S excluded.\n\n""PASTE"": P and S excluded.\n\n""HASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""TASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""GLAZE"": Z is not excluded? But pattern: G L A Z E -> G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This fits. And Z is not excluded? But Z is less common.\n\n""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> same.\n\nBut let\'s look for more common words.\n\n""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This is a valid word.\n\n""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). Also valid.\n\n""FRAME"": F R A M E -> but R is excluded? R is excluded, so no.\n\n""GAMME"": not a word.\n\n""JAMBE"": J A M B E -> third letter M? No.\n\n""ALATE"": A L A T E -> A(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3. We can use this? But we are testing L and T.\n\nBut we are reusing A at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""AGAPE"": A G A P E -> P excluded.\n\n""AVAKE"": not a word.\n\n""OAKEN"": N excluded.\n\n""MAUVE"": M A U V E -> third letter U? No.\n\n""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> third letter I? No.\n\n""LEMKE"": not a word.\n\nSo, common words that fit: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLAME"" (not common), ""SHAME"" but S excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""THAWE"" not a word.\n\n""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). This fits. And W, H, L are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHALE"": S excluded.\n\n""CHALE"" not a word.\n\nSo, possible words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"".\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n""BLAME"": tests B, L, M\n""FLAME"": tests F, L, M\n""WHALE"": tests W, H, L\n\nAll test three new letters.\n\nBut note that L is common to all? So if we choose one, we test L in position 2 or 4? In ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"", L is at position 2, and in ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.\n\nWe don\'t have a preference? But we can choose based on letter frequency.\n\nCommon letters: T, L, O, I, etc. T is very common and we haven\'t tested it.\n\nIs there a word that includes T?\n\nFor example, ""ABATE"": A B A T E -> but we have A at position 1? And B and T. But we are reusing A.\n\n""ALATE"": A L A T E -> same.\n\n""TASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""WASTE"": S excluded.\n\n""PASTE"": S and P excluded.\n\n""GATE"": too short.\n\n""LATHE"": L A T H E -> pattern: L(1), A(2), T(3), H(4), E(5) -> third letter is T, not A? So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\n""QUATE"" not a word.\n\n""OVATE"": O V A T E -> O(1), V(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). This is a word (meaning: having an oval shape). And O, V, T are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""OVATE"" tests O, V, T.\n\nT is a common letter.\n\nAnother word: ""INANE"" but N excluded.\n\n""IRATE"": I R A T E -> R excluded.\n\n""URATE"": U R A T E -> R excluded.\n\n""AGATE"": A G A T E -> G and T, but A at position 1 and 3? And we are reusing A.\n\nBut ""AGATE"" is a word: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5).\n\nBut we are testing G and T, and reusing A.\n\nSimilarly, ""AVATE"" not a word.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- ""BLAME"": B, L, M\n- ""FLAME"": F, L, M\n- ""WHALE"": W, H, L\n- ""OVATE"": O, V, T\n- ""AGATE"": A, G, T (but reuses A at position 1)\n\nWe should avoid reusing A if possible? Because we already know A is present, so putting it at position 1 might not give new information? But if it is present at position 1, we get a \'-\' or if not, we get \'x\'. But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate A? So it could be useful.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we can avoid reusing A and E.\n\nSo, ""OVATE"" is good: O, V, T are all new.\n\n""BLAME"" is also good: B, L, M new.\n\nBut T is more common than B, L, M? Let\'s see frequency.\n\nIn English, T is the second most common consonant after R (which is excluded), so T is very common.\n\nO is a vowel, also common.\n\nV is less common.\n\nBut ""OVATE"" has O and T, which are common.\n\n""BLAME"" has L and M, which are common.\n\nBut T is more common than L and M? Actually, T is more common than L and M.\n\nLetter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... (N and R excluded, S and D excluded).\n\nSo after A and E, the next are T, O, I, etc.\n\nSo T and O are high frequency.\n\nTherefore, ""OVATE"" might be a good choice because it tests T and O.\n\nAlso, V is less common, but we have to use it to form the word.\n\nAnother word: ""OLATE"" not a word.\n\n""URAEI"" not matching.\n\n""KNAVE"" N excluded.\n\nSo, I think ""OVATE"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut let me confirm if ""OVATE"" is accepted. Yes, it\'s a word.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAKER"" R excluded.\n\n""MAKER"" R excluded.\n\n""BAKER"" R excluded.\n\n""LAKEE"" not a word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""OVATE"".\n\nBut in ""OVATE"", we have O at position 1, V at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nThis fits the pattern.\n\nWe are testing O, V, T.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALIKE"" but third letter I? No.\n\n""ABIDE"" third letter I? No.\n\nSo, ""OVATE"" seems good.\n\nBut we have ""WHALE"" which has H and W? H is common, W less so.\n\nBut T is more common than H? T is more common than H? Actually, T is more common: T is 2nd, H is 8th in frequency.\n\nSo ""OVATE"" tests T and O, which are high frequency.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""OVATE"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with T and O without V? For example, ""TOGAE"" not matching pattern.\n\n""ATOLL"" not ending with E.\n\nSo, ""OVATE"" is acceptable.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""OVATE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  \n  This indicates that the secret word has \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5, and excludes C, R, and N.\n\n- **Guess 2: SPADE** → Feedback: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)  \n  This confirms \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5, and excludes S, P, and D.\n\n**Key insights:**\n- The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E).\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, S, P, D.\n- Remaining letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Goal for the next guess: Test new high-frequency letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to maximize information, while avoiding excluded letters and reusing A and E only in their known positions.\n\n**Reasoning for the next guess:**\n- We need a word matching `_ _ A _ E` with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n- High-frequency letters like T, O, L, and I are prioritized for testing, as they are common in English words.\n- After evaluating options:\n  - Words like ""BLAME"" (tests B, L, M) or ""FLAME"" (tests F, L, M) are possible but focus on less common consonants.\n  - ""WHALE"" (tests W, H, L) is valid but includes less common letters like W.\n  - ""OVATE"" (tests O, V, T) is a strong choice because:\n    - It uses O (high-frequency vowel) and T (high-frequency consonant), which are statistically likely to appear.\n    - V is less common but necessary to form a valid word.\n    - It avoids reused letters in untested positions (A and E are only in their known spots).\n    - ""OVATE"" is a valid English word (meaning: egg-shaped or relating to ovum).\n- This guess will provide feedback on O, V, and T, helping to narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>OVATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SPADE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: OVATE -> FEEDBACK: O(x) V(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the third guess ""OVATE"":\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- V: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)\n\nSo, we have excluded additional letters: O, V, T.\n\nNow, the total excluded letters are: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T.\n\nWe also know the pattern must be _ _ A _ E.\n\nThe secret word does not contain any of these excluded letters.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet.\n\nRemaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe have to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with letters from this set.\n\nWe also note that we have used A and E in their positions, so in positions 1,2,4 we should use new letters to gain information.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). This word uses B, L, M, which are still available? Yes, since not excluded.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested B, L, M yet.\n\n""BLAME"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) -> F, L, M also available.\n\nAnother one: ""WHALE"": W H A L E -> W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> W, H, L available.\n\nBut ""WHALE"" has L at position 4? Yes.\n\n""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but Z is available? Yes, but the pattern matches: G(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). Valid word.\n\nBut Z is less common.\n\nOther possibilities: ""ABATE"" but we have to use the pattern? ""ABATE"" is A B A T E, but T is excluded? T is excluded, from the third guess feedback. T is x, so no.\n\nSimilarly, any word with T cannot be used.\n\nHow about ""ULNAE"" not matching.\n\n""BAIZE"": B A I Z E -> but pattern third letter must be A? This would be B(1), A(2), I(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter is I, not A? So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nAnother word: ""MAIZE"": M A I Z E -> third letter I? No.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q U A K E -> but pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This fits? But Q and U? Q is rare.\n\n""JAIME"" not a common word? ""JAIME"" can be a name, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\n""KAZOO"" not ending with E.\n\n""BAYLE"" not a word.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n\n- ""BLAME"" (B, L, A, M, E) -> B, L, M\n- ""FLAME"" (F, L, A, M, E) -> F, L, M\n- ""WHALE"" (W, H, A, L, E) -> W, H, L\n- ""SHAKE"" but S excluded.\n- ""STAKE"" S and T excluded.\n- ""GLAKE"" not a word.\n- ""BRAKE"" B R A K E -> R excluded? R is excluded, so no.\n- ""FLAKE"" F L A K E -> F, L, K? Pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This fits? But K is available. And ""FLAKE"" is a word.\n\n""FLAKE"": uses F, L, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLAKE"" proper noun? Or a word? Not typically played in word games? ""BLAKE"" is a name, but might be accepted? Avoid.\n\n""GLACE"" but that ends with E? ""GLACE"" is 6 letters? No, G L A C E -> but C is excluded? C is excluded. And pattern: G L A C E -> positions: G(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5). But C is excluded? Yes, from first guess.\n\nSo, possible common words: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""WHALE"", ""FLAKE"".\n\nNow, which one to choose? All test three new letters.\n\nBut note: ""BLAME"" tests B, L, M; ""FLAME"" tests F, L, M; ""WHALE"" tests W, H, L; ""FLAKE"" tests F, L, K.\n\nL appears in all? So if L is not in the word, we eliminate it with one of these.\n\nBut since we have to choose one, we can pick based on frequency? But L is tested in all? Position 2 in most, except ""WHALE"" has L at position 4.\n\nIn ""WHALE"", L is at position 4.\n\nWe might also consider ""MAIZE"" but third letter not A.\n\nAnother word: ""ABHOR"" not matching pattern.\n\n""ALIKE"" third letter I.\n\n""AMAZE"": A M A Z E -> A(1), M(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). This has A at position 1 and 3? So we are reusing A? But we know A is present, so it might be duplicated? But let\'s see: if we put A at position 1, and if it is incorrect position, we get \'-\'.\n\nBut ""AMAZE"": uses letters A, M, Z. M and Z are new, but A is reused. Pattern matches A _ A _ E? Positions: A(1), M(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5). Yes.\n\nBut we are using A in position 1, which is not known, so we test if A is also at position 1 or not? Possibly, but we can avoid reusing.\n\nSimilarly, ""AGAPE"" P excluded.\n\n""ABUZZ"" not ending with E.\n\nSo, perhaps stick to ""BLAME"" or ""FLAME"" or ""FLAKE"".\n\nLet\'s see if we can test a word without L? For example, ""BAKIE"" not a word.\n\n""GUANO"" not matching.\n\n""IMMIX"" not.\n\n""KUDZU"" not.\n\nIt\'s limited.\n\nAnother word: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Uses Q, U, K? Q and U are rare.\n\nBut ""QUAKE"" is a valid common word? Yes.\n\nHowever, compared to ""FLAME"", ""QUAKE"" is less likely? But we have to try.\n\nBut since Q and U are uncommon, we might avoid? But we have no choice? Not necessarily.\n\n""BLAME"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut in terms of frequency, F is more common than Q.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAKE"" tests K, which might be better than Q.\n\nBut let\'s list the letters we are testing.\n\nPerhaps choose ""FLAKE"" to test K? Or ""BLAME"" to test B.\n\nSince we have only a few options, we can choose one arbitrarily? But strategically.\n\nNote: after this guess, we will have more exclusions or positions.\n\nWe can also consider that if we guess ""BLAME"" and get all wrong except A and E, we know that B, L, M are not in the word, etc.\n\nBut similarly for others.\n\nSince L is in multiple, we might test it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps ""BIOME"" but third letter O? No, O is excluded.\n\n""ALGAE"": A L G A E -> A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), E(5) -> third letter G, not A? So no.\n\nWe must have A at third position.\n\nSo, I think I\'ll go with ""BLAME"".\n\nBut let me check: ""BLAME"" letter by letter.\n\nB: position 1\nL: position 2\nA: position 3\nM: position 4\nE: position 5\n\nAll letters B,L,M are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAME"": F,L,M.\n\nBut in ""FLAME"", we test F instead of B.\n\nF is more common than B? F is less common? Letter frequency: F is 13th, B is 20th? Actually, F is more common than B.\n\nFrequency order: E T A O I N S H R D L U C M F Y W G P B V K X Q J Z\n\nSo F is 15th, B is 22nd? After excluding: S (8th) and D (10th), R (9th), N (6th), etc., then F is mid-level.\n\nBut L (11th) and M (13th) are common.\n\nSimilarly, H is 8th? Previously excluded: R(9), S(8), N(6), C(12), D(10), P(18), T(2 is excluded, very significant), O(4 is excluded), V(21).\n\nRemaining common letters: L (11), U (14? but not in pattern), M (13), F (15), H (7), etc.\n\nH is 7th most common? After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H is 8th? Standard frequency: E (12.7%), T (9.06%), A (8.17%), O (7.51%), I (6.97%), N (6.75%), S (6.33%), H (6.09%), R (5.99%), D (4.25%), L (4.03%), C (2.78%), U (2.76%), M (2.41%), W (2.36%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), Y (1.97%), P (1.93%), B (1.49%), V (1.28%), K (0.77%), J (0.15%), X (0.15%), Q (0.10%), Z (0.07%)\n\nSo, among remaining consonants, H (6.09%) is most common, then L (4.03%), then M (2.41%), F (2.23%), G (2.02%), etc.\n\nBut H is highly common.\n\nTherefore, ""WHALE"" might be better because it tests H and W, but H is common.\n\n""WHALE"" has W which is less common, but H is common.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHALE"" S excluded.\n\n""CHALE"" not a word.\n\nHow about ""HAYER"" not matching pattern? Pattern must have third letter A.\n\n""HYMNS"" no E.\n\n""HELLO"" no.\n\nAnother word: ""HASTE"" S excluded.\n\n""GHAZE"" not word? ""GHAZI"" not.\n\n""JABOT"" no.\n\nSo, ""WHALE"" is a valid word: W H A L E\n\nPositions: W(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), E(5)\n\nTests W, H, L.\n\nH is very common, so we should test it? Yes.\n\nIn ""BLAME"", we test B, L, M. L is common, B and M less common.\n\nIn ""FLAME"", F, L, M: M common, F less common.\n\nBut H is more common than L? H: 6.09%, L: 4.03%, so H is slightly more common.\n\nIn ""WHALE"", we test H and L? Also W.\n\nBut W is less common?

We have feedback from Guess 4: WHALE -> W(x) H(x) A(✓) L(-) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - W: not in the word (x)
 - H: not in the word (x)
 - A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
 - L: in the word but wrong position (-) → since L is in position 4 in ""WHALE"", it means there is an L in the secret word, but not at position 4.
 - E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

 So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
 Additionally, we know:
 - Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T, W, H (all marked x in previous guesses)
 - The word contains L, but not at position 4 (since L appears at position 4 in WHALE and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not there).
 - We have A (pos3) and E (pos5) fixed.

 The secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E
 We must include L, but not at position 4.

 Possible positions for L: position 1 or position 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are fixed).

 We need a word that:
 1. Fits _ _ A _ E
 2. Contains the letter L (but not at position 4)
 3. Uses letters only from the remaining set: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, X, Y, Z (and L, which we know is in the word)
 4. And avoids previously excluded letters: C,R,N,S,P,D,O,V,T,W,H

 We have used L in WHALE at position 4 and were told it is in the word but wrong position. Therefore, L must be at position 1 or 2.

 Let's consider possibilities:

 If L is at position 1: L _ A _ E
 Then the word is L X A Y E, where X and Y are letters from the allowed set.

 If L is at position 2: _ L A _ E
 Then the word is X L A Y E.

 We need to test both possibilities? But we have only 2 guesses left? We started with 6, we used 4, so 2 left.

 We can make a guess that tests both possibilities? But how? We have to choose one pattern.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests other letters and the position of L.

 Since L must be at position 1 or 2, we can test position 1 with L? Let me see.

 Examples:

 Option 1: L at position 1
 - Words: ""LAMME"" not common? 
   Valid words: ""LABEL""? But pattern: L A B E L → but E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So positions: L(1), A(2), B(3)? No, we need A at 3. So pattern L _ A _ E: 
   So position 2 is arbitrary, position 4 is arbitrary.

 Examples: 
   ""LAGER""? But R excluded? And G is allowed? But pattern: L A G E R → positions: L(1), A(2), G(3)? But A must be position 3? So no.

 We need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is:
   L ? A ? E  → positions: L at 1, letter at 2 must be not A (because if A were at position 2, then in CRANE it would be marked? Actually, in CRANE we guessed CRANE, which had A at position 2? No, we had A at position 3? Actually, CRANE: C R A N E → position 2 is R? Not A.

 So for L at position 1: L followed by any letter at 2? But position 3 is A, so position 2 cannot be A? Or can? We don't know.

 Actually, we don't have information about A duplicates? We know only one A? Or not? We haven't tested duplication.

 But in the pattern, position 3 is A. So any letter at position 2? Then at position 4, any letter.

 Valid words with L at start: 
   ""LAZBE"" not word.
   ""LAXES""? But S excluded? And pattern: L(1) A(2) X(3) E(4) S(5) → but we need A at position 3? Here A is at position 2 and position 3 is X? So must have position 3 A: not matched.

 How about: 
   ""LABRE"" not word.
   ""LAGNE"" not word.
   ""LARGE"": L A R G E → but R excluded? And pattern: L(1) A(2) R(3) → but we need A at position 3? Actually, for L at 1: 
        position 1: L, position 2: ?, position 3: must be A, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

 So words: 
   ""LXAXE"" not.
   ""LUNGE"" pattern: L U N G E → but N excluded? And position 3 must be A? Not applicable.

 ""LAUGE"" not word.
 ""LUMPE"" not.

 Actually, it's hard. Let me search for words starting with L, having A at position 3, E at position 5.

 For example: 
   ""LEAVE"": L E A V E → but V excluded? And pattern: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) → but we have E at position 2? And V excluded? Also, this would have E at position 2 and 5? But we know E must be only at 5? Or could be duplicated? In CRANE, we had E at position 5 and correctly placed? It didn't say anything about duplicates.

 But in WHALE, we had E at position 5 and got ✓? So E is present and correctly placed? Doesn't prevent duplication? But let's see the feedback: we never got two E? We don't know.

 However, in our pattern, if we guess ""LEAVE"", we would have E at position 2? Then we might get information? But V excluded.

 Similarly, ""LEGUE"" not word.

 ""LEMNE"" not.

 More common: ""LANDE"" but N excluded? N is excluded? And D excluded.

 ""LANCE"" C and N excluded.

 ""LEAKY"" not ending with E.

 Perhaps ""LAREE"": L A R E E → pattern: L(1) A(2) R(3) → not A at position 3? R excluded.

 I'm struggling?

 Another: ""LATE""? too short.

 How about ""LABEL""? Pattern: L A B E L → positions: L(1) A(2) B(3) E(4) L(5) → this has position 3 B, position 4 E? And we need position 5 E? So not matching.

 Instead, we need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E? So for L at position 1: 
   position 1: L
   position 2: some letter, call it X
   position 3: A
   position 4: some letter, call it Y
   position 5: E

 So we need a word L? A ? E → and valid.

 Common words: 
   ""LUMAS""? Not ending with E.
   ""LICKS"" no E.

 ""LIMED"" D excluded? And E? not at end.

 ""LIEGE""? L I E G E → pattern: L(1) I(2) E(3) G(4) E(5)? But we need position 3 to be A, so no.

 This set is limited.

 Option 2: L at position 2: _ L A _ E → pattern: X L A Y E

 Words: 
   ""ALLEY""? A L L E Y → pattern: A(1) L(2) L(3) E(4) Y(5) → but position 3 must be A? Here position 3 is L? So no.

   ""BLESS"": B L E S S → pattern B(1) L(2) E(3) → not A at position 3.

   We need A at position 3: 
        position 1: X
        position 2: L
        position 3: A
        position 4: Y
        position 5: E

 Common words: 
   ""BLAZE"" → but Z? Pattern: B L A Z E → valid? And B and Z? But we have B available? And Z available? But S is excluded? Not S? Yes.
   ""BLAZE"" is a word. Using B, Z? Position 4 is Z? And L at position 2? Which is okay since L must be at position 1 or 2? Here it is at position 2.

   ""FLAIR"" no E? Not.
   ""FLAME"" → F L A M E → we have M? And F? Valid? But not ending? Position 5 E. Yes, ""FLAME"": F(1) L(2) A(3) M(4) E(5) → pattern matches.
   But M is available? Yes. And F available? Yes.

   ""GLADE"" → G L A D E → D excluded? No, D was excluded earlier? From SPADE? D: x, so excluded? So we cannot use D? Correction: D is excluded? Yes.

   ""GRADE"" R excluded.

   ""QUALE"" → Q U A L E → pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) L(??) → position 2 is U? Then L at position 4? Pattern would be: Q U A L E → positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) → which would work? But L here is at position 4? However, from feedback, L is not at position 4? Because in WHALE, L at position 4 was marked as ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 4? Therefore, we cannot have L at position 4.

   So for ""QUALE"", if we put L at position 4, it would be invalid because the feedback said L is not at position 4? So we must find a word where L is at position 1 or 2? And in the pattern _ _ A _ E, if we want L at position 2, then position 1 is X, position 2 is L, position 3 A, position 4 Y, position 5 E? So L is fixed at position 2? Similarly, we can consider L at position 1.

   Therefore, for L at position 2: 
        X L A Y E
        and L cannot be at position 4? Actually, the word can only have L at position 2? Or duplicated? But we don't know? We should avoid?

   Similarly, L at position 1: L X A Y E

   But in both cases, we avoid L at position 4.

   Now, possible words for L at position 1: 
        ""LABLE"" not word? 
        ""LACET"" C,T excluded?
        ""LAGEN"" N excluded?
        ""LAKEV"" not? 
        ""LAMER"" M could be? L A M E R → but R excluded?
        ""LAMES"" S excluded?

   For L at position 1: L ? A ? E → valid word: ""LAIVE"" not common? ""LASKE"" S,K? But S excluded? ""LABI"" no.

   There is ""laree"" not common? Or ""large"" R excluded.

   I think it's harder? We might need to concede that L at position 1 might not be common? Let's list:

   ""LAMME"": not common.
   ""LAMKE"": not.

   Or ""LANEY"" N excluded.

   Perhaps ""LAPSE"" P,S excluded.

   I think we can skip L at position 1 for now? Perhaps focus on L at position 2.

   For L at position 2: X L A Y E
        Common words: 
          ""BLAME"": B L A M E → pattern matches? But B and M available? Yes.
          ""FLAME"": F L A M E → same
          ""GLAMY"" not common? 
          ""Y L A? No.

   But we have to avoid letters from excluded? So ""BLAME"": B, L, M? All valid? Not excluded.

   Also, there is ""FLUKE"" but L at position 2? F L U K E → pattern: F(1) L(2) U(3) → not A at position 3? We need position 3 A? U at position 3? So no.

   So ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"" are candidates.

   Also, ""QUAKE"" pattern: Q U A K E → L not present? But our guess must include L? How? The word must contain L? Because we know L is in the word? So for the guess, we must include L somewhere? Yes, because we know L is in the secret word? So we cannot guess a word without L? That would be invalid because L was indicated to be present? Correct? Therefore, all guesses must include L? Until we find its position.

   Because from WHALE feedback: L(-) at position 4 means L is present? So yes, we must include L in every guess? No, we can guess without? But if we guess a word without L, and L is indeed present, we get feedback for the guess? But it's suboptimal? We know L is present? So we should use it to locate the position? So actually, we can guess without, but it wastes the chance to test? So we should always include L.

   Therefore, for our guess, we must include L.

   So in ""BLAME"": it has B, L, M → includes L? Position 2: L? So L is at position 2? Which is one of the allowed positions (1 or 2).

   Similarly, in ""FLAME"": F, L, M → L at position 2.

   Also, what about ""GLABE"" not word.

   Or ""ILIAD"" no E? Not.

   So, possible: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"".

   Another: ""SLAKE"" S excluded.

   ""PLANE"" P,N excluded.

   So only B and F?

   Also, note that the position 4 must not have L? Which we avoid.

   Now, let's choose between ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME""?
        ""BLAME"": B, L, M → frequencies: B:1.49%, L:4.03%, M:2.41%
        ""FLAME"": F, L, M → F:2.23%, L:4.03%, M:2.41%

   Both include L, M? F is slightly more common? Perhaps? But we only have one guess? No, we have 2 guesses? We used 4, so 5th guess and 6th? But we have two left.

   But this is our 5th guess? We can guess either?

   Alternatively, could we test a word that has L at position 1? For example, ""LAMED"" D excluded? No.

   We have ""LUMEN"" pattern: L U M E N → but N excluded and position 3 must be A.

   I think we have to go with ""BLAME"" or ""FLAME"".

   Since F is more common than B? F 2.23%, B 1.49%? So ""FLAME"" is better? But in ""FLAME"", we have F, L, M.

   Also, we might consider the use of M? We haven't tested M? So testing M could be beneficial.

   Let's guess ""FLAME"".

   Or should we use ""KLUTZ"" no A.

   We'll go with ""FLAME"".

   But wait, we also have to account for the possibility that L is at position 1? We are not testing that? If we guess ""FLAME"", we assume L is at position 2? But if the secret word has L at position 1, then ""FLAME"" might get some marks? For example, if the word is ""L?A?E"", then we wouldn't have L in position 2? And we have L at position 2? So it would be marked as ""-"" for L? Because L is present but at different position? So we get information.

   Actually, we can guess ""FLAME"" regardless.

   Let's map the pattern: 
        If secret has L at position 1: then for ""FLAME"" guess:
            F: new? If F is letter of the secret? We don't know.
            L: at position 2? But secret L at position 1? So L will be marked as misplaced (-) because present but not position 2.
            A: correct? Position 3.
            M: letter at position 4? If M is present? We get feedback?
            E: correct.

        Similarly, if secret has L at position 2: then L would be marked ✓? Or not? Position: secret: position 1 ? L is not at position 1? If secret has L at position 2, then in FLAME: L at position 2 would be ✓? But only if the secret has L at position 2? And also if ...? Let's see:

            Secret: ? L A ? E → pattern.
            Guess FLAME: F L A M E
            If secret is: ? L A ? E → then at position 2: L matches? So ✓ for L? And position 3: A matches? ✓, etc.

        But if secret has L at position 1, say L X A Y E, and we guess F L A M E, then:
            F: not L, and if F is not in the word? x
            L: at position 2? But secret has L at position 1? So L will be marked as '-', meaning present but not at position 2.
            Then A and E ✓, M will be marked based on whether M is in the word? etc.

        So we get information.

   Therefore, ""FLAME"" is a good guess? It might answer which position L is in? Or not exactly? If we get ✓ for L at position 2, then L is at position 2? If we get '-' for L at position 2, then L could be at position 1? (since we know L is in the word but not at position 4, and we haven't used position 5? But position 5 is E? So for L, only positions 1 or 2 are possible).

   So the feedback for L in ""FLAME"" will indicate:
        - If L at position 2 is ✓, then L is at position 2.
        - If L at position 2 is '-', then L must be at position 1.

   Therefore, we can determine the position of L from this guess.

   In addition, we get feedback on F and M? So overall good.

   So I will guess ""FLAME"".

   Alternatively, if we use ""BLAME"", the same logic would apply? But using B? Less common? So ""FLAME"" is better because F is more common? Therefore, ""FLAME"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be `_ _ A _ E` (A at position 3, E at position 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T, W, H (all marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed letters**:
  - **A** (position 3) and **E** (position 5) are fixed.
  - **L** is in the word but **not at position 4** (from Guess 4's ""-"" feedback). It must be at position 1 or 2.
- **Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, and 4**: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, X, Y, Z (and L must be included).

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of L (must be at position 1 or 2) while maximizing information about other untested letters.
- **L positioning**: If L is placed at position 2 (as in ""FLAME""), feedback will confirm if L belongs there (✓) or if it must be at position 1 (if marked ""-"").
- **Word choice**: ""FLAME"" (F,L,A,M,E) is optimal:
  - Tests **F** and **M** (moderate-frequency letters) in positions 1 and 4.
  - L is placed at position 2 to directly test its position.
  - Fits the pattern `F L A M E`.
- **Why not alternatives?**
  - Words like ""BLAME"" test B instead of F, but F (≈2.23%) is slightly more common than B (≈1.49%).
  - ""WHALE"" is invalid due to W and H exclusion.
- If ""FLAME"" gets L feedback as ✓, L is at position 2; if ""-"", L is at position 1 (only remaining possibility).

<guess>FLAME</guess>",FLAME,"We have feedback from Guess 4: WHALE -> W(x) H(x) A(✓) L(-) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - W: not in the word (x)
 - H: not in the word (x)
 - A: correct and in position 3 (✓)
 - L: in the word but wrong position (-) → since L is in position 4 in ""WHALE"", it means there is an L in the secret word, but not at position 4.
 - E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

 So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
 Additionally, we know:
 - Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T, W, H (all marked x in previous guesses)
 - The word contains L, but not at position 4 (since L appears at position 4 in WHALE and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not there).
 - We have A (pos3) and E (pos5) fixed.

 The secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E
 We must include L, but not at position 4.

 Possible positions for L: position 1 or position 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are fixed).

 We need a word that:
 1. Fits _ _ A _ E
 2. Contains the letter L (but not at position 4)
 3. Uses letters only from the remaining set: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, X, Y, Z (and L, which we know is in the word)
 4. And avoids previously excluded letters: C,R,N,S,P,D,O,V,T,W,H

 We have used L in WHALE at position 4 and were told it is in the word but wrong position. Therefore, L must be at position 1 or 2.

 Let's consider possibilities:

 If L is at position 1: L _ A _ E
 Then the word is L X A Y E, where X and Y are letters from the allowed set.

 If L is at position 2: _ L A _ E
 Then the word is X L A Y E.

 We need to test both possibilities? But we have only 2 guesses left? We started with 6, we used 4, so 2 left.

 We can make a guess that tests both possibilities? But how? We have to choose one pattern.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests other letters and the position of L.

 Since L must be at position 1 or 2, we can test position 1 with L? Let me see.

 Examples:

 Option 1: L at position 1
 - Words: ""LAMME"" not common? 
   Valid words: ""LABEL""? But pattern: L A B E L → but E at position 4? We need E at position 5. So positions: L(1), A(2), B(3)? No, we need A at 3. So pattern L _ A _ E: 
   So position 2 is arbitrary, position 4 is arbitrary.

 Examples: 
   ""LAGER""? But R excluded? And G is allowed? But pattern: L A G E R → positions: L(1), A(2), G(3)? But A must be position 3? So no.

 We need the third letter to be A, so the pattern is:
   L ? A ? E  → positions: L at 1, letter at 2 must be not A (because if A were at position 2, then in CRANE it would be marked? Actually, in CRANE we guessed CRANE, which had A at position 2? No, we had A at position 3? Actually, CRANE: C R A N E → position 2 is R? Not A.

 So for L at position 1: L followed by any letter at 2? But position 3 is A, so position 2 cannot be A? Or can? We don't know.

 Actually, we don't have information about A duplicates? We know only one A? Or not? We haven't tested duplication.

 But in the pattern, position 3 is A. So any letter at position 2? Then at position 4, any letter.

 Valid words with L at start: 
   ""LAZBE"" not word.
   ""LAXES""? But S excluded? And pattern: L(1) A(2) X(3) E(4) S(5) → but we need A at position 3? Here A is at position 2 and position 3 is X? So must have position 3 A: not matched.

 How about: 
   ""LABRE"" not word.
   ""LAGNE"" not word.
   ""LARGE"": L A R G E → but R excluded? And pattern: L(1) A(2) R(3) → but we need A at position 3? Actually, for L at 1: 
        position 1: L, position 2: ?, position 3: must be A, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

 So words: 
   ""LXAXE"" not.
   ""LUNGE"" pattern: L U N G E → but N excluded? And position 3 must be A? Not applicable.

 ""LAUGE"" not word.
 ""LUMPE"" not.

 Actually, it's hard. Let me search for words starting with L, having A at position 3, E at position 5.

 For example: 
   ""LEAVE"": L E A V E → but V excluded? And pattern: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) → but we have E at position 2? And V excluded? Also, this would have E at position 2 and 5? But we know E must be only at 5? Or could be duplicated? In CRANE, we had E at position 5 and correctly placed? It didn't say anything about duplicates.

 But in WHALE, we had E at position 5 and got ✓? So E is present and correctly placed? Doesn't prevent duplication? But let's see the feedback: we never got two E? We don't know.

 However, in our pattern, if we guess ""LEAVE"", we would have E at position 2? Then we might get information? But V excluded.

 Similarly, ""LEGUE"" not word.

 ""LEMNE"" not.

 More common: ""LANDE"" but N excluded? N is excluded? And D excluded.

 ""LANCE"" C and N excluded.

 ""LEAKY"" not ending with E.

 Perhaps ""LAREE"": L A R E E → pattern: L(1) A(2) R(3) → not A at position 3? R excluded.

 I'm struggling?

 Another: ""LATE""? too short.

 How about ""LABEL""? Pattern: L A B E L → positions: L(1) A(2) B(3) E(4) L(5) → this has position 3 B, position 4 E? And we need position 5 E? So not matching.

 Instead, we need the third letter to be A and fifth to be E? So for L at position 1: 
   position 1: L
   position 2: some letter, call it X
   position 3: A
   position 4: some letter, call it Y
   position 5: E

 So we need a word L? A ? E → and valid.

 Common words: 
   ""LUMAS""? Not ending with E.
   ""LICKS"" no E.

 ""LIMED"" D excluded? And E? not at end.

 ""LIEGE""? L I E G E → pattern: L(1) I(2) E(3) G(4) E(5)? But we need position 3 to be A, so no.

 This set is limited.

 Option 2: L at position 2: _ L A _ E → pattern: X L A Y E

 Words: 
   ""ALLEY""? A L L E Y → pattern: A(1) L(2) L(3) E(4) Y(5) → but position 3 must be A? Here position 3 is L? So no.

   ""BLESS"": B L E S S → pattern B(1) L(2) E(3) → not A at position 3.

   We need A at position 3: 
        position 1: X
        position 2: L
        position 3: A
        position 4: Y
        position 5: E

 Common words: 
   ""BLAZE"" → but Z? Pattern: B L A Z E → valid? And B and Z? But we have B available? And Z available? But S is excluded? Not S? Yes.
   ""BLAZE"" is a word. Using B, Z? Position 4 is Z? And L at position 2? Which is okay since L must be at position 1 or 2? Here it is at position 2.

   ""FLAIR"" no E? Not.
   ""FLAME"" → F L A M E → we have M? And F? Valid? But not ending? Position 5 E. Yes, ""FLAME"": F(1) L(2) A(3) M(4) E(5) → pattern matches.
   But M is available? Yes. And F available? Yes.

   ""GLADE"" → G L A D E → D excluded? No, D was excluded earlier? From SPADE? D: x, so excluded? So we cannot use D? Correction: D is excluded? Yes.

   ""GRADE"" R excluded.

   ""QUALE"" → Q U A L E → pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) L(??) → position 2 is U? Then L at position 4? Pattern would be: Q U A L E → positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) → which would work? But L here is at position 4? However, from feedback, L is not at position 4? Because in WHALE, L at position 4 was marked as ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 4? Therefore, we cannot have L at position 4.

   So for ""QUALE"", if we put L at position 4, it would be invalid because the feedback said L is not at position 4? So we must find a word where L is at position 1 or 2? And in the pattern _ _ A _ E, if we want L at position 2, then position 1 is X, position 2 is L, position 3 A, position 4 Y, position 5 E? So L is fixed at position 2? Similarly, we can consider L at position 1.

   Therefore, for L at position 2: 
        X L A Y E
        and L cannot be at position 4? Actually, the word can only have L at position 2? Or duplicated? But we don't know? We should avoid?

   Similarly, L at position 1: L X A Y E

   But in both cases, we avoid L at position 4.

   Now, possible words for L at position 1: 
        ""LABLE"" not word? 
        ""LACET"" C,T excluded?
        ""LAGEN"" N excluded?
        ""LAKEV"" not? 
        ""LAMER"" M could be? L A M E R → but R excluded?
        ""LAMES"" S excluded?

   For L at position 1: L ? A ? E → valid word: ""LAIVE"" not common? ""LASKE"" S,K? But S excluded? ""LABI"" no.

   There is ""laree"" not common? Or ""large"" R excluded.

   I think it's harder? We might need to concede that L at position 1 might not be common? Let's list:

   ""LAMME"": not common.
   ""LAMKE"": not.

   Or ""LANEY"" N excluded.

   Perhaps ""LAPSE"" P,S excluded.

   I think we can skip L at position 1 for now? Perhaps focus on L at position 2.

   For L at position 2: X L A Y E
        Common words: 
          ""BLAME"": B L A M E → pattern matches? But B and M available? Yes.
          ""FLAME"": F L A M E → same
          ""GLAMY"" not common? 
          ""Y L A? No.

   But we have to avoid letters from excluded? So ""BLAME"": B, L, M? All valid? Not excluded.

   Also, there is ""FLUKE"" but L at position 2? F L U K E → pattern: F(1) L(2) U(3) → not A at position 3? We need position 3 A? U at position 3? So no.

   So ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME"" are candidates.

   Also, ""QUAKE"" pattern: Q U A K E → L not present? But our guess must include L? How? The word must contain L? Because we know L is in the word? So for the guess, we must include L somewhere? Yes, because we know L is in the secret word? So we cannot guess a word without L? That would be invalid because L was indicated to be present? Correct? Therefore, all guesses must include L? Until we find its position.

   Because from WHALE feedback: L(-) at position 4 means L is present? So yes, we must include L in every guess? No, we can guess without? But if we guess a word without L, and L is indeed present, we get feedback for the guess? But it's suboptimal? We know L is present? So we should use it to locate the position? So actually, we can guess without, but it wastes the chance to test? So we should always include L.

   Therefore, for our guess, we must include L.

   So in ""BLAME"": it has B, L, M → includes L? Position 2: L? So L is at position 2? Which is one of the allowed positions (1 or 2).

   Similarly, in ""FLAME"": F, L, M → L at position 2.

   Also, what about ""GLABE"" not word.

   Or ""ILIAD"" no E? Not.

   So, possible: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"".

   Another: ""SLAKE"" S excluded.

   ""PLANE"" P,N excluded.

   So only B and F?

   Also, note that the position 4 must not have L? Which we avoid.

   Now, let's choose between ""BLAME"" and ""FLAME""?
        ""BLAME"": B, L, M → frequencies: B:1.49%, L:4.03%, M:2.41%
        ""FLAME"": F, L, M → F:2.23%, L:4.03%, M:2.41%

   Both include L, M? F is slightly more common? Perhaps? But we only have one guess? No, we have 2 guesses? We used 4, so 5th guess and 6th? But we have two left.

   But this is our 5th guess? We can guess either?

   Alternatively, could we test a word that has L at position 1? For example, ""LAMED"" D excluded? No.

   We have ""LUMEN"" pattern: L U M E N → but N excluded and position 3 must be A.

   I think we have to go with ""BLAME"" or ""FLAME"".

   Since F is more common than B? F 2.23%, B 1.49%? So ""FLAME"" is better? But in ""FLAME"", we have F, L, M.

   Also, we might consider the use of M? We haven't tested M? So testing M could be beneficial.

   Let's guess ""FLAME"".

   Or should we use ""KLUTZ"" no A.

   We'll go with ""FLAME"".

   But wait, we also have to account for the possibility that L is at position 1? We are not testing that? If we guess ""FLAME"", we assume L is at position 2? But if the secret word has L at position 1, then ""FLAME"" might get some marks? For example, if the word is ""L?A?E"", then we wouldn't have L in position 2? And we have L at position 2? So it would be marked as ""-"" for L? Because L is present but at different position? So we get information.

   Actually, we can guess ""FLAME"" regardless.

   Let's map the pattern: 
        If secret has L at position 1: then for ""FLAME"" guess:
            F: new? If F is letter of the secret? We don't know.
            L: at position 2? But secret L at position 1? So L will be marked as misplaced (-) because present but not position 2.
            A: correct? Position 3.
            M: letter at position 4? If M is present? We get feedback?
            E: correct.

        Similarly, if secret has L at position 2: then L would be marked ✓? Or not? Position: secret: position 1 ? L is not at position 1? If secret has L at position 2, then in FLAME: L at position 2 would be ✓? But only if the secret has L at position 2? And also if ...? Let's see:

            Secret: ? L A ? E → pattern.
            Guess FLAME: F L A M E
            If secret is: ? L A ? E → then at position 2: L matches? So ✓ for L? And position 3: A matches? ✓, etc.

        But if secret has L at position 1, say L X A Y E, and we guess F L A M E, then:
            F: not L, and if F is not in the word? x
            L: at position 2? But secret has L at position 1? So L will be marked as '-', meaning present but not at position 2.
            Then A and E ✓, M will be marked based on whether M is in the word? etc.

        So we get information.

   Therefore, ""FLAME"" is a good guess? It might answer which position L is in? Or not exactly? If we get ✓ for L at position 2, then L is at position 2? If we get '-' for L at position 2, then L could be at position 1? (since we know L is in the word but not at position 4, and we haven't used position 5? But position 5 is E? So for L, only positions 1 or 2 are possible).

   So the feedback for L in ""FLAME"" will indicate:
        - If L at position 2 is ✓, then L is at position 2.
        - If L at position 2 is '-', then L must be at position 1.

   Therefore, we can determine the position of L from this guess.

   In addition, we get feedback on F and M? So overall good.

   So I will guess ""FLAME"".

   Alternatively, if we use ""BLAME"", the same logic would apply? But using B? Less common? So ""FLAME"" is better because F is more common? Therefore, ""FLAME"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be `_ _ A _ E` (A at position 3, E at position 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, S, P, D, O, V, T, W, H (all marked ""x"").
- **Confirmed letters**:
  - **A** (position 3) and **E** (position 5) are fixed.
  - **L** is in the word but **not at position 4** (from Guess 4's ""-"" feedback). It must be at position 1 or 2.
- **Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, and 4**: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, X, Y, Z (and L must be included).

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of L (must be at position 1 or 2) while maximizing information about other untested letters.
- **L positioning**: If L is placed at position 2 (as in ""FLAME""), feedback will confirm if L belongs there (✓) or if it must be at position 1 (if marked ""-"").
- **Word choice**: ""FLAME"" (F,L,A,M,E) is optimal:
  - Tests **F** and **M** (moderate-frequency letters) in positions 1 and 4.
  - L is placed at position 2 to directly test its position.
  - Fits the pattern `F L A M E`.
- **Why not alternatives?**
  - Words like ""BLAME"" test B instead of F, but F (≈2.23%) is slightly more common than B (≈1.49%).
  - ""WHALE"" is invalid due to W and H exclusion.
- If ""FLAME"" gets L feedback as ✓, L is at position 2; if ""-"", L is at position 1 (only remaining possibility).",Guess 5: FLAME -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
