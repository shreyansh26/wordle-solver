We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 However, I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative return on an investment over time) that is also used by some because it has common letters and is high scoring in terms of letter frequency.

 But let's stick with a more common one: ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess's third position and marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (as per our guess). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word must have an A. Let's try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters. Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and avoids C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has L and D which we haven't tested.
 - But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

 However, we have only one known letter (A) so far, so we can try to use as many new common letters as possible.

 Let's consider the word ""SLATE"": but it has E (which we know is not in the word) and also T and L are common. But E is excluded.

 We need to avoid E. So let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but it has two A's? And also P, S, T. But let's check the letters: P, A, S, T. We haven't tested these. However, note that we have to avoid E, and this word doesn't have E. But it has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's, but that's acceptable.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (and we don't know if there are more). But in ""crane"", we had one A and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the word has at least one A.

 But note: if the word had two A's, then in the feedback we would have seen only one mark? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence that is in the word. However, if the word has two A's and we only have one A in our guess, then we only get one mark. So we don't know if there are more.

 However, to be safe, we can try a word with only one A and then see.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and four other new letters.

 Let's try to find a word that has A and common consonants: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Example: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) - but it has Y which is less common. Also, we don't know if Y is in the word.

 Another: ""TAPAS"" - but that has two A's and S. Also, it's 5 letters? TAPAS is 5 letters. But we might get less information because of duplicate A.

 Alternatively, let's try ""OUIJA"" - but that has O, U, I, J, A. J is uncommon.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 Let me think of a word that has A and four other common letters that we haven't tried (and avoiding C, R, N, E).

 How about ""PLAIT""? 
 - P, L, A, I, T. 
 - A is in position 3? But we know that in the secret word, A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A was in the wrong position. The secret word might have A in position 3? Wait, no: because we put A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in the third position. So we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put A in any position except 3? Actually, we can put it in position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't prevent the same letter from being in the same position again, but we know that position 3 is not A. So we should try A in a new position.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3 again. So that's not good.

 Let's try ""PILOT"": but no A.

 We need to include A.

 How about ""ALPHA""? 
 - A in position 1, then L, P, H, A. 
 - But it has two A's and H is not the most common. Also, we are repeating A in position 5? But we don't know if the word has two A's.

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": 
 - S, T, A, M, P. 
 - A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste of a position. We should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 In ""STAMP"", A is in position 3. So that's the same as before. We should avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": 
 - P, A, S, T, A -> A in position 2 and 5. 
 - This way we test A in two new positions (2 and 5). 
 - Also, we test P, S, T.

 But note: we are using two A's. If the secret word has only one A, then one of these A's might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each A that is in the word. If the word has one A, then only one of the two A's in ""PASTA"" will be marked (and it will be the one that is in the correct position, or if both are wrong then the one that is in the word? Actually, the game marks each occurrence that is in the word, but if the word has only one A, then only one A in the guess will be marked as present (and if neither is in the correct position, then one will be marked with '-' and the other with 'x').

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using two A's might not be efficient because we are using two slots for the same letter when we could test two different letters.

 Therefore, I think it's better to use a word with distinct letters.

 Let me try to find a word that has A and four new distinct letters, and put A in a new position (not position 3).

 Example: 
 - Position 1: A? -> words like ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. 
 - Avoid E: so ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. But we don't know about U, D, I, O. 
   However, note that we have to avoid R, C, N, E? Yes, and also we haven't tested U, D, I, O.

 But ""AUDIO"" is a valid word. It has A in position 1, which is a new position.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. Also valid.

 But which one is better? ""AUDIO"" has more vowels, which might be less common? Actually, vowels are common, but we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). Consonants might be more informative.

 Another word: ""SPLAT"": 
 - S, P, L, A, T. 
 - A is in position 4 (which is new). 
 - Letters: S, P, L, A, T. All distinct and common.

 This seems good.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, N, E. ""SPLAT"" doesn't have any of these.

 So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".

 However, note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more guesses? Actually, 6 tries total, so this is the second.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""PALMS"": 
 - P, A, L, M, S. 
 - A in position 2.

 But ""SPLAT"" seems fine.

 Let me confirm: S in position 1, P in 2, L in 3, A in 4, T in 5.

 We are testing S, P, L, A, T. And A is in a new position (4).

 So, I choose ""SPLAT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, L, or T. We are testing them.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPLAT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, N, E not in the word; A present but not in position 3), I need a new guess that:
- Includes A in a position other than 3 (to test new locations)
- Avoids C, R, N, E entirely
- Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P)
- Prefers distinct letters to cover more possibilities

The word ""**SPLAT**"" fits well:
- A is in position 4 (new location to test)
- Tests new common letters: S, P, L, T
- No repeated letters or excluded characters

 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess's third position and marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (as per our guess). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word must have an A. Let's try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters. Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and avoids C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has L and D which we haven't tested.
 - But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

 However, we have only one known letter (A) so far, so we can try to use as many new common letters as possible.

 Let's consider the word ""SLATE"": but it has E (which we know is not in the word) and also T and L are common. But E is excluded.

 We need to avoid E. So let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but it has two A's? And also P, S, T. But let's check the letters: P, A, S, T. We haven't tested these. However, note that we have to avoid E, and this word doesn't have E. But it has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's, but that's acceptable.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (and we don't know if there are more). But in ""crane"", we had one A and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the word has at least one A.

 But note: if the word had two A's, then in the feedback we would have seen only one mark? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence that is in the word. However, if the word has two A's and we only have one A in our guess, then we only get one mark. So we don't know if there are more.

 However, to be safe, we can try a word with only one A and then see.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and four other new letters.

 Let's try to find a word that has A and common consonants: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Example: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) - but it has Y which is less common. Also, we don't know if Y is in the word.

 Another: ""TAPAS"" - but that has two A's and S. Also, it's 5 letters? TAPAS is 5 letters. But we might get less information because of duplicate A.

 Alternatively, let's try ""OUIJA"" - but that has O, U, I, J, A. J is uncommon.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 Let me think of a word that has A and four other common letters that we haven't tried (and avoiding C, R, N, E).

 How about ""PLAIT""? 
 - P, L, A, I, T. 
 - A is in position 3? But we know that in the secret word, A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A was in the wrong position. The secret word might have A in position 3? Wait, no: because we put A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in the third position. So we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put A in any position except 3? Actually, we can put it in position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't prevent the same letter from being in the same position again, but we know that position 3 is not A. So we should try A in a new position.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3 again. So that's not good.

 Let's try ""PILOT"": but no A.

 We need to include A.

 How about ""ALPHA""? 
 - A in position 1, then L, P, H, A. 
 - But it has two A's and H is not the most common. Also, we are repeating A in position 5? But we don't know if the word has two A's.

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": 
 - S, T, A, M, P. 
 - A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste of a position. We should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 In ""STAMP"", A is in position 3. So that's the same as before. We should avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": 
 - P, A, S, T, A -> A in position 2 and 5. 
 - This way we test A in two new positions (2 and 5). 
 - Also, we test P, S, T.

 But note: we are using two A's. If the secret word has only one A, then one of these A's might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each A that is in the word. If the word has one A, then only one of the two A's in ""PASTA"" will be marked (and it will be the one that is in the correct position, or if both are wrong then the one that is in the word? Actually, the game marks each occurrence that is in the word, but if the word has only one A, then only one A in the guess will be marked as present (and if neither is in the correct position, then one will be marked with '-' and the other with 'x').

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using two A's might not be efficient because we are using two slots for the same letter when we could test two different letters.

 Therefore, I think it's better to use a word with distinct letters.

 Let me try to find a word that has A and four new distinct letters, and put A in a new position (not position 3).

 Example: 
 - Position 1: A? -> words like ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. 
 - Avoid E: so ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. But we don't know about U, D, I, O. 
   However, note that we have to avoid R, C, N, E? Yes, and also we haven't tested U, D, I, O.

 But ""AUDIO"" is a valid word. It has A in position 1, which is a new position.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. Also valid.

 But which one is better? ""AUDIO"" has more vowels, which might be less common? Actually, vowels are common, but we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). Consonants might be more informative.

 Another word: ""SPLAT"": 
 - S, P, L, A, T. 
 - A is in position 4 (which is new). 
 - Letters: S, P, L, A, T. All distinct and common.

 This seems good.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, N, E. ""SPLAT"" doesn't have any of these.

 So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".

 However, note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more guesses? Actually, 6 tries total, so this is the second.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""PALMS"": 
 - P, A, L, M, S. 
 - A in position 2.

 But ""SPLAT"" seems fine.

 Let me confirm: S in position 1, P in 2, L in 3, A in 4, T in 5.

 We are testing S, P, L, A, T. And A is in a new position (4).

 So, I choose ""SPLAT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, L, or T. We are testing them.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPLAT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, N, E not in the word; A present but not in position 3), I need a new guess that:
- Includes A in a position other than 3 (to test new locations)
- Avoids C, R, N, E entirely
- Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P)
- Prefers distinct letters to cover more possibilities

The word ""**SPLAT**"" fits well:
- A is in position 4 (new location to test)
- Tests new common letters: S, P, L, T
- No repeated letters or excluded characters

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  C: not in word
  R: not in word
  A: in word but wrong position (not in position 3)
  N: not in word
  E: not in word

So we know the secret word contains A (but not in position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

Guess 2: ""splat"" -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)
Meaning:
  S: not in word
  P: not in word
  L: in word but wrong position (not in position 3 of ""splat"", which is the third letter)
  A: in word and in the correct position (position 4 of ""splat"", which is the fourth letter of the secret word)
  T: in word but wrong position (not in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in the fourth position (because A is marked correct in position 4 of ""splat"").
- The secret word contains L and T, but not in the positions we guessed (L not in position 3, T not in position 5).
- The secret word does not contain S or P.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 4.

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Now, we know the secret word:
- Must have A in the 4th position: so the pattern is _ _ _ A _
- Contains L and T (each at least once) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively (from the second guess).
- Also, L is not in position 3 (from ""splat"") and T is not in position 5 (from ""splat"").

Moreover, we know the word has at least three distinct letters: A, L, T.

We need to make a third guess. We should:
1. Include L and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, P.
3. Try to find the positions for L and T, and also find the remaining letters.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters to discover.

Let's list possible positions for L and T:
- L cannot be in position 3 (from ""splat"" feedback: L was in position 3 and marked as wrong position, so L is in the word but not there).
- T cannot be in position 5 (from ""splat"" feedback: T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so T is in the word but not there).

Also, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we know A is in position 4.

We can try to form a word that:
- Has A in the 4th position.
- Includes L and T in positions that we haven't ruled out.
- Uses two new letters (that we haven't tested) that are common and not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note L and T are already in the word, so we can reuse them? Actually, we don't know if they appear more than once, but to be safe, we can assume one occurrence unless feedback suggests otherwise.

We need to test new letters to find the remaining ones.

The positions we have:
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown (but we know it's not A, and not L? Actually, we only know L is not in position 3 from the second guess, but it could be in position 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is A, so L can be in 1,2, or 5. Similarly, T can be in 1,2,3,4? But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know T is not in position 5, so T can be in 1,2, or 3.

But note: we have to avoid putting L in position 3 and T in position 5 because we know they are not there.

So for our next guess, we can try:
- Put L in position 1 or 2 (to test a new position) and T in position 1,2, or 3.

But we also want to test two new letters for the remaining positions.

The word pattern: _ _ _ A _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

We know:
- Position 4: A
- The word contains L and T (so they must be in positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints: L not in 3, T not in 5).

So possible assignments for L and T:
- L can be in 1,2,5
- T can be in 1,2,3

But note: we have two more letters to find? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have A, L, T, and two more.

We can try to form a word that has A in 4, and then L and T in the allowed positions, and two new letters.

Example: 
Let me try putting L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

But we don't know what they are. We can choose common letters.

But note: we must avoid the excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can put T in position 3 and L in position 5? 
- T in position 3: allowed because T can be in 3 (we only know it's not in 5).
- L in position 5: allowed because L can be in 5 (we only know it's not in 3).

But then we need letters for position 1 and 2.

Let me think of words that fit: _ _ T A L? 
But we have to check if that's a word. For example, ""CITAL"" is not a word. 

Alternatively, _ _ L A T? But T cannot be in position 5? We know T is not in position 5 from the second guess. So we cannot put T in position 5.

So T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Similarly, L cannot be in 3, so L must be in 1,2, or 5.

But if we put L in 5, then T must be in 1,2, or 3.

So a word like: 
- Position 1: T, position 2: new letter, position 3: new letter, position 4: A, position 5: L -> T _ _ A L
  Example: ""TIGAL"" is not a word.

Another: 
- Position 1: new, position 2: T, position 3: new, position 4: A, position 5: L -> _ T _ A L
  Example: ""ITAL"" is 4 letters, so we need 5: ""VITAL"" - but ""VITAL"" has V, I, T, A, L. 
  But note: we haven't tested V and I. Also, ""VITAL"" is a word.

But in ""VITAL"", T is in position 3? Let's count: 
  V-I-T-A-L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L.

But we know T cannot be in position 5? That's fine, here T is in 3. And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3, but 5 is okay).

Also, we are testing V and I.

But note: we have to avoid S, P, etc. V and I are not excluded.

So ""VITAL"" is a candidate.

But we also have to consider: in the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 3, which is consistent because now A is in 4.

In the second guess, we had L in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we are putting L in 5, which is a different position. Similarly, T was in 5 (wrong) and now we are putting it in 3.

But we don't know if the secret word has T in 3 and L in 5? It might.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put both L and T in positions we haven't tested? But we have to test them.

Another candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need two new letters for 3 and 5.

Word: L _ _ A _ 
But with T in position 2: L T _ A _ 
Then we need a letter for 3 and 5.

Example: ""L T ? A ?"" 
Words: ""LTA"" is not a word. How about ""LOTAS""? But S is excluded. 
""LITAS""? S excluded. 
""LUTEA""? But E is excluded.

Avoiding excluded letters: no E, S, P, etc.

Possible: ""LITHA""? But H is allowed. ""LITHA"" is not a common word? I'm not sure. 

Another: ""LATHA""? But A is already in 4, and we are putting T in 2? ""LATHA"" would be L-A-T-H-A, but then position 4 is T? We need position 4 to be A. So that doesn't fit.

We need the fourth letter to be A.

So back to ""L T ? A ?"". We need a word like ""LT?A?"".

I can't think of a common word. 

Another idea: put T in position 1 and L in position 2: T L _ A _ 
Example: ""TALAK""? Not a word. ""TALMA""? Not common. 

Put T in position 1, and L in position 5: T _ _ A L 
Example: ""TIGAL"" not a word. ""TONAL"" but O is allowed, but N is excluded. N is in the excluded list.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, P. So N is out.

""TOFAL""? Not a word.

""TIDAL"" -> T-I-D-A-L. This is a word. 
But in ""TIDAL"": 
  T in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, A in 4, L in 5.

But we know from the second guess that T cannot be in position 5? That's fine, here T is in 1. 
And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3). 

Also, we are testing I and D.

So ""TIDAL"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""VITAL"" as above.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

But note: in ""VITAL"", we are putting T in position 3. We don't have any feedback about position 3 for T yet. Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are putting T in 1 and L in 5.

We want to maximize information. We know the word has T and L, but we don't know their positions. 

In ""VITAL"", we are testing T in position 3 and L in position 5. 
In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in position 1 and L in position 5.

We also know that T cannot be in 5 (from the second guess) and L cannot be in 3 (from the second guess). 

So in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in a new position (3) and L in a position that is allowed (5). 
In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in a new position (1) and L in 5.

Both are testing two new letters: V and I for ""VITAL"", and T and I and D for ""TIDAL""? Actually, ""TIDAL"" has I and D.

But note: we are also testing the positions.

We might also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence of that so far.

I think both are good. Let me see which one uses more common letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put L in 5? Because if we put L in 5 and it's not correct, then we still don't know about other positions.

But we have to start somewhere.

Another candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 3? But L cannot be in position 1? Wait, no: L can be in 1. And T can be in 3? Yes.

So word: L _ T A _ 
Example: ""LITAY""? Not a word. ""LUTAY""? Not a word. ""LATAK""? Not a word. 

""LOTAH""? Not common. 

I think ""VITAL"" and ""TIDAL"" are better.

I'll go with ""VITAL"" because it has V and I, which are less common than D and I? Actually, D is more common than V. But we are testing two vowels in ""VITAL""? V is a consonant, I is a vowel.

But let's look at frequency. In English, D is more common than V. So testing D might be better? 

But we are also testing positions. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests only one new letter? But we have two positions to fill (besides the known A and the two known letters L and T that we are placing). Actually, we are testing two new letters in either case.

But note: we have to fill all positions. 

Another idea: we know the word has L and T, and A in 4. We can try to use a word that has L and T in positions we haven't eliminated and that also uses common letters for the rest.

How about ""DELTA""? But D, E, L, T, A -> but E is excluded. 

""BALTY""? Not a word.

""GALT""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""TIDAL"" and ""VITAL"" are both good. 

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""VITAL"" because it tests T in position 3 (which we haven't tested for T) and L in position 5 (which we haven't tested for L). In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 and L in 5. We already know T is not in 5, but we don't know about T in 1 or 3. Similarly for L, we know not in 3, but we don't know about 1,2,5.

So both are testing new positions.

But in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in 3 and L in 5. In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in 1 and L in 5. 

We have more information about T: we know T is not in 5, but we don't know about 1,2,3. Similarly for L: not in 3, but we don't know about 1,2,5.

So testing T in 3 (as in ""VITAL"") is a new position, and testing L in 5 is a new position.

In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 (new) and L in 5 (new).

But we have two unknown positions: 1 and 2 in the pattern. In ""VITAL"", we are using V for 1 and I for 2. In ""TIDAL"", we are using T for 1 and I for 2 and D for 3? No, in ""TIDAL"": 
  Position 1: T (so we are testing T in 1, which is new)
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: D
  Position 4: A (known)
  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)

So in ""TIDAL"", we are testing two new letters: I and D, and also testing T in 1 and L in 5.

In ""VITAL"":
  Position 1: V
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: T (testing T in 3)
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)

So both test two new letters and the positions for T and L.

But note: in ""TIDAL"", we are using position 3 for D, which we haven't tested for any known letter. In ""VITAL"", we are using position 3 for T, which is a known letter.

So ""VITAL"" might be better because we are using a known letter (T) in a new position (3) that we are unsure of, and we are testing two new letters (V and I) in positions 1 and 2.

Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are testing a known letter (T) in position 1 and another known letter (L) in position 5, and new letters in 2 and 3.

But we don't know if T is in position 1 or 3? So both are valid tests.

I think I'll go with ""VITAL"" because it uses the known T in a position (3) that we haven't tested for T (and we know T is in the word, so we need to find its position).

So let's choose ""VITAL"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use excluded letters. V and I are not excluded.

So guess: VITAL

But let me double-check the feedback we have to ensure consistency.

First guess: crane -> A was present but not in 3. In VITAL, A is in 4, which is correct.

Second guess: splat -> A was correct in 4, L was present but not in 3 (in VITAL, L is in 5, not 3, so that's okay), T was present but not in 5 (in VITAL, T is in 3, not 5, so that's okay).

Also, we are not using any excluded letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""VITAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SPLAT)**: A is correct in position 4. L is present but not in position 3. T is present but not in position 5. S and P are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ A _`.
2. **Confirmed letters**: A (position 4), L, and T are in the word.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P.
4. **Position constraints**:
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from SPLAT feedback).
   - T cannot be in position 5 (from SPLAT feedback).
5. **Goal for next guess**: Test possible positions for L and T while introducing new common letters to uncover the remaining characters.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include L and T**: Place them in positions not yet ruled out:
  - L allowed in positions 1, 2, or 5.
  - T allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- **Test new positions**: Prioritize placing T in position 3 (untested) and L in position 5 (untested) to maximize positional information.
- **New letters**: Use high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet tested (e.g., V, I, D) and avoid excluded letters.
- **Word choice**: ""VITAL"" fits perfectly:
  - `V` (new), `I` (new), `T` (in position 3), `A` (fixed in position 4), `L` (in position 5).
  - Tests T in position 3 and L in position 5, while checking V and I for positions 1 and 2.

<guess>vital</guess>",vital,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  C: not in word
  R: not in word
  A: in word but wrong position (not in position 3)
  N: not in word
  E: not in word

So we know the secret word contains A (but not in position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

Guess 2: ""splat"" -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)
Meaning:
  S: not in word
  P: not in word
  L: in word but wrong position (not in position 3 of ""splat"", which is the third letter)
  A: in word and in the correct position (position 4 of ""splat"", which is the fourth letter of the secret word)
  T: in word but wrong position (not in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in the fourth position (because A is marked correct in position 4 of ""splat"").
- The secret word contains L and T, but not in the positions we guessed (L not in position 3, T not in position 5).
- The secret word does not contain S or P.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 4.

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Now, we know the secret word:
- Must have A in the 4th position: so the pattern is _ _ _ A _
- Contains L and T (each at least once) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively (from the second guess).
- Also, L is not in position 3 (from ""splat"") and T is not in position 5 (from ""splat"").

Moreover, we know the word has at least three distinct letters: A, L, T.

We need to make a third guess. We should:
1. Include L and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, P.
3. Try to find the positions for L and T, and also find the remaining letters.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters to discover.

Let's list possible positions for L and T:
- L cannot be in position 3 (from ""splat"" feedback: L was in position 3 and marked as wrong position, so L is in the word but not there).
- T cannot be in position 5 (from ""splat"" feedback: T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so T is in the word but not there).

Also, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we know A is in position 4.

We can try to form a word that:
- Has A in the 4th position.
- Includes L and T in positions that we haven't ruled out.
- Uses two new letters (that we haven't tested) that are common and not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note L and T are already in the word, so we can reuse them? Actually, we don't know if they appear more than once, but to be safe, we can assume one occurrence unless feedback suggests otherwise.

We need to test new letters to find the remaining ones.

The positions we have:
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown (but we know it's not A, and not L? Actually, we only know L is not in position 3 from the second guess, but it could be in position 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is A, so L can be in 1,2, or 5. Similarly, T can be in 1,2,3,4? But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know T is not in position 5, so T can be in 1,2, or 3.

But note: we have to avoid putting L in position 3 and T in position 5 because we know they are not there.

So for our next guess, we can try:
- Put L in position 1 or 2 (to test a new position) and T in position 1,2, or 3.

But we also want to test two new letters for the remaining positions.

The word pattern: _ _ _ A _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

We know:
- Position 4: A
- The word contains L and T (so they must be in positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints: L not in 3, T not in 5).

So possible assignments for L and T:
- L can be in 1,2,5
- T can be in 1,2,3

But note: we have two more letters to find? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have A, L, T, and two more.

We can try to form a word that has A in 4, and then L and T in the allowed positions, and two new letters.

Example: 
Let me try putting L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

But we don't know what they are. We can choose common letters.

But note: we must avoid the excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can put T in position 3 and L in position 5? 
- T in position 3: allowed because T can be in 3 (we only know it's not in 5).
- L in position 5: allowed because L can be in 5 (we only know it's not in 3).

But then we need letters for position 1 and 2.

Let me think of words that fit: _ _ T A L? 
But we have to check if that's a word. For example, ""CITAL"" is not a word. 

Alternatively, _ _ L A T? But T cannot be in position 5? We know T is not in position 5 from the second guess. So we cannot put T in position 5.

So T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Similarly, L cannot be in 3, so L must be in 1,2, or 5.

But if we put L in 5, then T must be in 1,2, or 3.

So a word like: 
- Position 1: T, position 2: new letter, position 3: new letter, position 4: A, position 5: L -> T _ _ A L
  Example: ""TIGAL"" is not a word.

Another: 
- Position 1: new, position 2: T, position 3: new, position 4: A, position 5: L -> _ T _ A L
  Example: ""ITAL"" is 4 letters, so we need 5: ""VITAL"" - but ""VITAL"" has V, I, T, A, L. 
  But note: we haven't tested V and I. Also, ""VITAL"" is a word.

But in ""VITAL"", T is in position 3? Let's count: 
  V-I-T-A-L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L.

But we know T cannot be in position 5? That's fine, here T is in 3. And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3, but 5 is okay).

Also, we are testing V and I.

But note: we have to avoid S, P, etc. V and I are not excluded.

So ""VITAL"" is a candidate.

But we also have to consider: in the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 3, which is consistent because now A is in 4.

In the second guess, we had L in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we are putting L in 5, which is a different position. Similarly, T was in 5 (wrong) and now we are putting it in 3.

But we don't know if the secret word has T in 3 and L in 5? It might.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put both L and T in positions we haven't tested? But we have to test them.

Another candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need two new letters for 3 and 5.

Word: L _ _ A _ 
But with T in position 2: L T _ A _ 
Then we need a letter for 3 and 5.

Example: ""L T ? A ?"" 
Words: ""LTA"" is not a word. How about ""LOTAS""? But S is excluded. 
""LITAS""? S excluded. 
""LUTEA""? But E is excluded.

Avoiding excluded letters: no E, S, P, etc.

Possible: ""LITHA""? But H is allowed. ""LITHA"" is not a common word? I'm not sure. 

Another: ""LATHA""? But A is already in 4, and we are putting T in 2? ""LATHA"" would be L-A-T-H-A, but then position 4 is T? We need position 4 to be A. So that doesn't fit.

We need the fourth letter to be A.

So back to ""L T ? A ?"". We need a word like ""LT?A?"".

I can't think of a common word. 

Another idea: put T in position 1 and L in position 2: T L _ A _ 
Example: ""TALAK""? Not a word. ""TALMA""? Not common. 

Put T in position 1, and L in position 5: T _ _ A L 
Example: ""TIGAL"" not a word. ""TONAL"" but O is allowed, but N is excluded. N is in the excluded list.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, P. So N is out.

""TOFAL""? Not a word.

""TIDAL"" -> T-I-D-A-L. This is a word. 
But in ""TIDAL"": 
  T in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, A in 4, L in 5.

But we know from the second guess that T cannot be in position 5? That's fine, here T is in 1. 
And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3). 

Also, we are testing I and D.

So ""TIDAL"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""VITAL"" as above.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

But note: in ""VITAL"", we are putting T in position 3. We don't have any feedback about position 3 for T yet. Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are putting T in 1 and L in 5.

We want to maximize information. We know the word has T and L, but we don't know their positions. 

In ""VITAL"", we are testing T in position 3 and L in position 5. 
In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in position 1 and L in position 5.

We also know that T cannot be in 5 (from the second guess) and L cannot be in 3 (from the second guess). 

So in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in a new position (3) and L in a position that is allowed (5). 
In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in a new position (1) and L in 5.

Both are testing two new letters: V and I for ""VITAL"", and T and I and D for ""TIDAL""? Actually, ""TIDAL"" has I and D.

But note: we are also testing the positions.

We might also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence of that so far.

I think both are good. Let me see which one uses more common letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put L in 5? Because if we put L in 5 and it's not correct, then we still don't know about other positions.

But we have to start somewhere.

Another candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 3? But L cannot be in position 1? Wait, no: L can be in 1. And T can be in 3? Yes.

So word: L _ T A _ 
Example: ""LITAY""? Not a word. ""LUTAY""? Not a word. ""LATAK""? Not a word. 

""LOTAH""? Not common. 

I think ""VITAL"" and ""TIDAL"" are better.

I'll go with ""VITAL"" because it has V and I, which are less common than D and I? Actually, D is more common than V. But we are testing two vowels in ""VITAL""? V is a consonant, I is a vowel.

But let's look at frequency. In English, D is more common than V. So testing D might be better? 

But we are also testing positions. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests only one new letter? But we have two positions to fill (besides the known A and the two known letters L and T that we are placing). Actually, we are testing two new letters in either case.

But note: we have to fill all positions. 

Another idea: we know the word has L and T, and A in 4. We can try to use a word that has L and T in positions we haven't eliminated and that also uses common letters for the rest.

How about ""DELTA""? But D, E, L, T, A -> but E is excluded. 

""BALTY""? Not a word.

""GALT""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""TIDAL"" and ""VITAL"" are both good. 

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""VITAL"" because it tests T in position 3 (which we haven't tested for T) and L in position 5 (which we haven't tested for L). In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 and L in 5. We already know T is not in 5, but we don't know about T in 1 or 3. Similarly for L, we know not in 3, but we don't know about 1,2,5.

So both are testing new positions.

But in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in 3 and L in 5. In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in 1 and L in 5. 

We have more information about T: we know T is not in 5, but we don't know about 1,2,3. Similarly for L: not in 3, but we don't know about 1,2,5.

So testing T in 3 (as in ""VITAL"") is a new position, and testing L in 5 is a new position.

In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 (new) and L in 5 (new).

But we have two unknown positions: 1 and 2 in the pattern. In ""VITAL"", we are using V for 1 and I for 2. In ""TIDAL"", we are using T for 1 and I for 2 and D for 3? No, in ""TIDAL"": 
  Position 1: T (so we are testing T in 1, which is new)
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: D
  Position 4: A (known)
  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)

So in ""TIDAL"", we are testing two new letters: I and D, and also testing T in 1 and L in 5.

In ""VITAL"":
  Position 1: V
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: T (testing T in 3)
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)

So both test two new letters and the positions for T and L.

But note: in ""TIDAL"", we are using position 3 for D, which we haven't tested for any known letter. In ""VITAL"", we are using position 3 for T, which is a known letter.

So ""VITAL"" might be better because we are using a known letter (T) in a new position (3) that we are unsure of, and we are testing two new letters (V and I) in positions 1 and 2.

Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are testing a known letter (T) in position 1 and another known letter (L) in position 5, and new letters in 2 and 3.

But we don't know if T is in position 1 or 3? So both are valid tests.

I think I'll go with ""VITAL"" because it uses the known T in a position (3) that we haven't tested for T (and we know T is in the word, so we need to find its position).

So let's choose ""VITAL"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use excluded letters. V and I are not excluded.

So guess: VITAL

But let me double-check the feedback we have to ensure consistency.

First guess: crane -> A was present but not in 3. In VITAL, A is in 4, which is correct.

Second guess: splat -> A was correct in 4, L was present but not in 3 (in VITAL, L is in 5, not 3, so that's okay), T was present but not in 5 (in VITAL, T is in 3, not 5, so that's okay).

Also, we are not using any excluded letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""VITAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SPLAT)**: A is correct in position 4. L is present but not in position 3. T is present but not in position 5. S and P are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ A _`.
2. **Confirmed letters**: A (position 4), L, and T are in the word.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P.
4. **Position constraints**:
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from SPLAT feedback).
   - T cannot be in position 5 (from SPLAT feedback).
5. **Goal for next guess**: Test possible positions for L and T while introducing new common letters to uncover the remaining characters.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include L and T**: Place them in positions not yet ruled out:
  - L allowed in positions 1, 2, or 5.
  - T allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- **Test new positions**: Prioritize placing T in position 3 (untested) and L in position 5 (untested) to maximize positional information.
- **New letters**: Use high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet tested (e.g., V, I, D) and avoid excluded letters.
- **Word choice**: ""VITAL"" fits perfectly:
  - `V` (new), `I` (new), `T` (in position 3), `A` (fixed in position 4), `L` (in position 5).
  - Tests T in position 3 and L in position 5, while checking V and I for positions 1 and 2.",Guess 3: vital -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(x) T(-) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 However, I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative return on an investment over time) that is also used by some because it has common letters and is high scoring in terms of letter frequency.

 But let's stick with a more common one: ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess's third position and marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (as per our guess). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word must have an A. Let's try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters. Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and avoids C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, it has L and D which we haven't tested.
 - But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

 However, we have only one known letter (A) so far, so we can try to use as many new common letters as possible.

 Let's consider the word ""SLATE"": but it has E (which we know is not in the word) and also T and L are common. But E is excluded.

 We need to avoid E. So let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but it has two A's? And also P, S, T. But let's check the letters: P, A, S, T. We haven't tested these. However, note that we have to avoid E, and this word doesn't have E. But it has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's, but that's acceptable.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (and we don't know if there are more). But in ""crane"", we had one A and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the word has at least one A.

 But note: if the word had two A's, then in the feedback we would have seen only one mark? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence that is in the word. However, if the word has two A's and we only have one A in our guess, then we only get one mark. So we don't know if there are more.

 However, to be safe, we can try a word with only one A and then see.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and four other new letters.

 Let's try to find a word that has A and common consonants: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Example: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) - but it has Y which is less common. Also, we don't know if Y is in the word.

 Another: ""TAPAS"" - but that has two A's and S. Also, it's 5 letters? TAPAS is 5 letters. But we might get less information because of duplicate A.

 Alternatively, let's try ""OUIJA"" - but that has O, U, I, J, A. J is uncommon.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 Let me think of a word that has A and four other common letters that we haven't tried (and avoiding C, R, N, E).

 How about ""PLAIT""? 
 - P, L, A, I, T. 
 - A is in position 3? But we know that in the secret word, A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A was in the wrong position. The secret word might have A in position 3? Wait, no: because we put A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in the third position. So we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put A in any position except 3? Actually, we can put it in position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't prevent the same letter from being in the same position again, but we know that position 3 is not A. So we should try A in a new position.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3 again. So that's not good.

 Let's try ""PILOT"": but no A.

 We need to include A.

 How about ""ALPHA""? 
 - A in position 1, then L, P, H, A. 
 - But it has two A's and H is not the most common. Also, we are repeating A in position 5? But we don't know if the word has two A's.

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": 
 - S, T, A, M, P. 
 - A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste of a position. We should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 In ""STAMP"", A is in position 3. So that's the same as before. We should avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": 
 - P, A, S, T, A -> A in position 2 and 5. 
 - This way we test A in two new positions (2 and 5). 
 - Also, we test P, S, T.

 But note: we are using two A's. If the secret word has only one A, then one of these A's might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each A that is in the word. If the word has one A, then only one of the two A's in ""PASTA"" will be marked (and it will be the one that is in the correct position, or if both are wrong then the one that is in the word? Actually, the game marks each occurrence that is in the word, but if the word has only one A, then only one A in the guess will be marked as present (and if neither is in the correct position, then one will be marked with '-' and the other with 'x').

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using two A's might not be efficient because we are using two slots for the same letter when we could test two different letters.

 Therefore, I think it's better to use a word with distinct letters.

 Let me try to find a word that has A and four new distinct letters, and put A in a new position (not position 3).

 Example: 
 - Position 1: A? -> words like ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. 
 - Avoid E: so ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. But we don't know about U, D, I, O. 
   However, note that we have to avoid R, C, N, E? Yes, and also we haven't tested U, D, I, O.

 But ""AUDIO"" is a valid word. It has A in position 1, which is a new position.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. Also valid.

 But which one is better? ""AUDIO"" has more vowels, which might be less common? Actually, vowels are common, but we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). Consonants might be more informative.

 Another word: ""SPLAT"": 
 - S, P, L, A, T. 
 - A is in position 4 (which is new). 
 - Letters: S, P, L, A, T. All distinct and common.

 This seems good.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, N, E. ""SPLAT"" doesn't have any of these.

 So, I'll go with ""SPLAT"".

 However, note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more guesses? Actually, 6 tries total, so this is the second.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""PALMS"": 
 - P, A, L, M, S. 
 - A in position 2.

 But ""SPLAT"" seems fine.

 Let me confirm: S in position 1, P in 2, L in 3, A in 4, T in 5.

 We are testing S, P, L, A, T. And A is in a new position (4).

 So, I choose ""SPLAT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, L, or T. We are testing them.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPLAT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, N, E not in the word; A present but not in position 3), I need a new guess that:
- Includes A in a position other than 3 (to test new locations)
- Avoids C, R, N, E entirely
- Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P)
- Prefers distinct letters to cover more possibilities

The word ""**SPLAT**"" fits well:
- A is in position 4 (new location to test)
- Tests new common letters: S, P, L, T
- No repeated letters or excluded characters

<guess>splat</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: splat -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  C: not in word
  R: not in word
  A: in word but wrong position (not in position 3)
  N: not in word
  E: not in word

So we know the secret word contains A (but not in position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

Guess 2: ""splat"" -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)
Meaning:
  S: not in word
  P: not in word
  L: in word but wrong position (not in position 3 of ""splat"", which is the third letter)
  A: in word and in the correct position (position 4 of ""splat"", which is the fourth letter of the secret word)
  T: in word but wrong position (not in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in the fourth position (because A is marked correct in position 4 of ""splat"").
- The secret word contains L and T, but not in the positions we guessed (L not in position 3, T not in position 5).
- The secret word does not contain S or P.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 4.

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Now, we know the secret word:
- Must have A in the 4th position: so the pattern is _ _ _ A _
- Contains L and T (each at least once) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively (from the second guess).
- Also, L is not in position 3 (from ""splat"") and T is not in position 5 (from ""splat"").

Moreover, we know the word has at least three distinct letters: A, L, T.

We need to make a third guess. We should:
1. Include L and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, P.
3. Try to find the positions for L and T, and also find the remaining letters.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters to discover.

Let's list possible positions for L and T:
- L cannot be in position 3 (from ""splat"" feedback: L was in position 3 and marked as wrong position, so L is in the word but not there).
- T cannot be in position 5 (from ""splat"" feedback: T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so T is in the word but not there).

Also, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we know A is in position 4.

We can try to form a word that:
- Has A in the 4th position.
- Includes L and T in positions that we haven't ruled out.
- Uses two new letters (that we haven't tested) that are common and not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note L and T are already in the word, so we can reuse them? Actually, we don't know if they appear more than once, but to be safe, we can assume one occurrence unless feedback suggests otherwise.

We need to test new letters to find the remaining ones.

The positions we have:
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown (but we know it's not A, and not L? Actually, we only know L is not in position 3 from the second guess, but it could be in position 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is A, so L can be in 1,2, or 5. Similarly, T can be in 1,2,3,4? But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know T is not in position 5, so T can be in 1,2, or 3.

But note: we have to avoid putting L in position 3 and T in position 5 because we know they are not there.

So for our next guess, we can try:
- Put L in position 1 or 2 (to test a new position) and T in position 1,2, or 3.

But we also want to test two new letters for the remaining positions.

The word pattern: _ _ _ A _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

We know:
- Position 4: A
- The word contains L and T (so they must be in positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints: L not in 3, T not in 5).

So possible assignments for L and T:
- L can be in 1,2,5
- T can be in 1,2,3

But note: we have two more letters to find? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have A, L, T, and two more.

We can try to form a word that has A in 4, and then L and T in the allowed positions, and two new letters.

Example: 
Let me try putting L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

But we don't know what they are. We can choose common letters.

But note: we must avoid the excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can put T in position 3 and L in position 5? 
- T in position 3: allowed because T can be in 3 (we only know it's not in 5).
- L in position 5: allowed because L can be in 5 (we only know it's not in 3).

But then we need letters for position 1 and 2.

Let me think of words that fit: _ _ T A L? 
But we have to check if that's a word. For example, ""CITAL"" is not a word. 

Alternatively, _ _ L A T? But T cannot be in position 5? We know T is not in position 5 from the second guess. So we cannot put T in position 5.

So T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Similarly, L cannot be in 3, so L must be in 1,2, or 5.

But if we put L in 5, then T must be in 1,2, or 3.

So a word like: 
- Position 1: T, position 2: new letter, position 3: new letter, position 4: A, position 5: L -> T _ _ A L
  Example: ""TIGAL"" is not a word.

Another: 
- Position 1: new, position 2: T, position 3: new, position 4: A, position 5: L -> _ T _ A L
  Example: ""ITAL"" is 4 letters, so we need 5: ""VITAL"" - but ""VITAL"" has V, I, T, A, L. 
  But note: we haven't tested V and I. Also, ""VITAL"" is a word.

But in ""VITAL"", T is in position 3? Let's count: 
  V-I-T-A-L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L.

But we know T cannot be in position 5? That's fine, here T is in 3. And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3, but 5 is okay).

Also, we are testing V and I.

But note: we have to avoid S, P, etc. V and I are not excluded.

So ""VITAL"" is a candidate.

But we also have to consider: in the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 3, which is consistent because now A is in 4.

In the second guess, we had L in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we are putting L in 5, which is a different position. Similarly, T was in 5 (wrong) and now we are putting it in 3.

But we don't know if the secret word has T in 3 and L in 5? It might.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put both L and T in positions we haven't tested? But we have to test them.

Another candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need two new letters for 3 and 5.

Word: L _ _ A _ 
But with T in position 2: L T _ A _ 
Then we need a letter for 3 and 5.

Example: ""L T ? A ?"" 
Words: ""LTA"" is not a word. How about ""LOTAS""? But S is excluded. 
""LITAS""? S excluded. 
""LUTEA""? But E is excluded.

Avoiding excluded letters: no E, S, P, etc.

Possible: ""LITHA""? But H is allowed. ""LITHA"" is not a common word? I'm not sure. 

Another: ""LATHA""? But A is already in 4, and we are putting T in 2? ""LATHA"" would be L-A-T-H-A, but then position 4 is T? We need position 4 to be A. So that doesn't fit.

We need the fourth letter to be A.

So back to ""L T ? A ?"". We need a word like ""LT?A?"".

I can't think of a common word. 

Another idea: put T in position 1 and L in position 2: T L _ A _ 
Example: ""TALAK""? Not a word. ""TALMA""? Not common. 

Put T in position 1, and L in position 5: T _ _ A L 
Example: ""TIGAL"" not a word. ""TONAL"" but O is allowed, but N is excluded. N is in the excluded list.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, P. So N is out.

""TOFAL""? Not a word.

""TIDAL"" -> T-I-D-A-L. This is a word. 
But in ""TIDAL"": 
  T in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, A in 4, L in 5.

But we know from the second guess that T cannot be in position 5? That's fine, here T is in 1. 
And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3). 

Also, we are testing I and D.

So ""TIDAL"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""VITAL"" as above.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

But note: in ""VITAL"", we are putting T in position 3. We don't have any feedback about position 3 for T yet. Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are putting T in 1 and L in 5.

We want to maximize information. We know the word has T and L, but we don't know their positions. 

In ""VITAL"", we are testing T in position 3 and L in position 5. 
In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in position 1 and L in position 5.

We also know that T cannot be in 5 (from the second guess) and L cannot be in 3 (from the second guess). 

So in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in a new position (3) and L in a position that is allowed (5). 
In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in a new position (1) and L in 5.

Both are testing two new letters: V and I for ""VITAL"", and T and I and D for ""TIDAL""? Actually, ""TIDAL"" has I and D.

But note: we are also testing the positions.

We might also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence of that so far.

I think both are good. Let me see which one uses more common letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put L in 5? Because if we put L in 5 and it's not correct, then we still don't know about other positions.

But we have to start somewhere.

Another candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 3? But L cannot be in position 1? Wait, no: L can be in 1. And T can be in 3? Yes.

So word: L _ T A _ 
Example: ""LITAY""? Not a word. ""LUTAY""? Not a word. ""LATAK""? Not a word. 

""LOTAH""? Not common. 

I think ""VITAL"" and ""TIDAL"" are better.

I'll go with ""VITAL"" because it has V and I, which are less common than D and I? Actually, D is more common than V. But we are testing two vowels in ""VITAL""? V is a consonant, I is a vowel.

But let's look at frequency. In English, D is more common than V. So testing D might be better? 

But we are also testing positions. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests only one new letter? But we have two positions to fill (besides the known A and the two known letters L and T that we are placing). Actually, we are testing two new letters in either case.

But note: we have to fill all positions. 

Another idea: we know the word has L and T, and A in 4. We can try to use a word that has L and T in positions we haven't eliminated and that also uses common letters for the rest.

How about ""DELTA""? But D, E, L, T, A -> but E is excluded. 

""BALTY""? Not a word.

""GALT""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""TIDAL"" and ""VITAL"" are both good. 

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""VITAL"" because it tests T in position 3 (which we haven't tested for T) and L in position 5 (which we haven't tested for L). In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 and L in 5. We already know T is not in 5, but we don't know about T in 1 or 3. Similarly for L, we know not in 3, but we don't know about 1,2,5.

So both are testing new positions.

But in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in 3 and L in 5. In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in 1 and L in 5. 

We have more information about T: we know T is not in 5, but we don't know about 1,2,3. Similarly for L: not in 3, but we don't know about 1,2,5.

So testing T in 3 (as in ""VITAL"") is a new position, and testing L in 5 is a new position.

In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 (new) and L in 5 (new).

But we have two unknown positions: 1 and 2 in the pattern. In ""VITAL"", we are using V for 1 and I for 2. In ""TIDAL"", we are using T for 1 and I for 2 and D for 3? No, in ""TIDAL"": 
  Position 1: T (so we are testing T in 1, which is new)
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: D
  Position 4: A (known)
  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)

So in ""TIDAL"", we are testing two new letters: I and D, and also testing T in 1 and L in 5.

In ""VITAL"":
  Position 1: V
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: T (testing T in 3)
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)

So both test two new letters and the positions for T and L.

But note: in ""TIDAL"", we are using position 3 for D, which we haven't tested for any known letter. In ""VITAL"", we are using position 3 for T, which is a known letter.

So ""VITAL"" might be better because we are using a known letter (T) in a new position (3) that we are unsure of, and we are testing two new letters (V and I) in positions 1 and 2.

Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are testing a known letter (T) in position 1 and another known letter (L) in position 5, and new letters in 2 and 3.

But we don't know if T is in position 1 or 3? So both are valid tests.

I think I'll go with ""VITAL"" because it uses the known T in a position (3) that we haven't tested for T (and we know T is in the word, so we need to find its position).

So let's choose ""VITAL"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use excluded letters. V and I are not excluded.

So guess: VITAL

But let me double-check the feedback we have to ensure consistency.

First guess: crane -> A was present but not in 3. In VITAL, A is in 4, which is correct.

Second guess: splat -> A was correct in 4, L was present but not in 3 (in VITAL, L is in 5, not 3, so that's okay), T was present but not in 5 (in VITAL, T is in 3, not 5, so that's okay).

Also, we are not using any excluded letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""VITAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SPLAT)**: A is correct in position 4. L is present but not in position 3. T is present but not in position 5. S and P are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ A _`.
2. **Confirmed letters**: A (position 4), L, and T are in the word.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P.
4. **Position constraints**:
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from SPLAT feedback).
   - T cannot be in position 5 (from SPLAT feedback).
5. **Goal for next guess**: Test possible positions for L and T while introducing new common letters to uncover the remaining characters.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include L and T**: Place them in positions not yet ruled out:
  - L allowed in positions 1, 2, or 5.
  - T allowed in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- **Test new positions**: Prioritize placing T in position 3 (untested) and L in position 5 (untested) to maximize positional information.
- **New letters**: Use high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet tested (e.g., V, I, D) and avoid excluded letters.
- **Word choice**: ""VITAL"" fits perfectly:
  - `V` (new), `I` (new), `T` (in position 3), `A` (fixed in position 4), `L` (in position 5).
  - Tests T in position 3 and L in position 5, while checking V and I for positions 1 and 2.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.\n Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).\n The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.\n\n However, I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative return on an investment over time) that is also used by some because it has common letters and is high scoring in terms of letter frequency.\n\n But let\'s stick with a more common one: ""CRANE"".\n\n So, my first guess will be: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": \n C: x (not in the word)\n R: x (not in the word)\n A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n N: x (not in the word)\n E: x (not in the word)\n\n So, we know:\n - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess\'s third position and marked as wrong position).\n - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (as per our guess). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.\n\n We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word) and in a different position than the third.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We know the word must have an A. Let\'s try to put A in a different position.\n\n Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We also want to test other common letters. Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has A and avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? Also, it has L and D which we haven\'t tested.\n - But note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\n However, we have only one known letter (A) so far, so we can try to use as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s consider the word ""SLATE"": but it has E (which we know is not in the word) and also T and L are common. But E is excluded.\n\n We need to avoid E. So let\'s avoid words with E.\n\n Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but it has two A\'s? And also P, S, T. But let\'s check the letters: P, A, S, T. We haven\'t tested these. However, note that we have to avoid E, and this word doesn\'t have E. But it has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s, but that\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess only showed one A (and we don\'t know if there are more). But in ""crane"", we had one A and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the word has at least one A.\n\n But note: if the word had two A\'s, then in the feedback we would have seen only one mark? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence that is in the word. However, if the word has two A\'s and we only have one A in our guess, then we only get one mark. So we don\'t know if there are more.\n\n However, to be safe, we can try a word with only one A and then see.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A and four other new letters.\n\n Let\'s try to find a word that has A and common consonants: S, T, L, P, etc.\n\n Example: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) - but it has Y which is less common. Also, we don\'t know if Y is in the word.\n\n Another: ""TAPAS"" - but that has two A\'s and S. Also, it\'s 5 letters? TAPAS is 5 letters. But we might get less information because of duplicate A.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try ""OUIJA"" - but that has O, U, I, J, A. J is uncommon.\n\n We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n Let me think of a word that has A and four other common letters that we haven\'t tried (and avoiding C, R, N, E).\n\n How about ""PLAIT""? \n - P, L, A, I, T. \n - A is in position 3? But we know that in the secret word, A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A was in the wrong position. The secret word might have A in position 3? Wait, no: because we put A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in the third position. So we must avoid putting A in position 3 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put A in any position except 3? Actually, we can put it in position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should try a different position.\n\n However, note: the feedback doesn\'t prevent the same letter from being in the same position again, but we know that position 3 is not A. So we should try A in a new position.\n\n In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3 again. So that\'s not good.\n\n Let\'s try ""PILOT"": but no A.\n\n We need to include A.\n\n How about ""ALPHA""? \n - A in position 1, then L, P, H, A. \n - But it has two A\'s and H is not the most common. Also, we are repeating A in position 5? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s.\n\n Alternatively, ""STAMP"": \n - S, T, A, M, P. \n - A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know it\'s not there, so it would be a waste of a position. We should put A in a position we haven\'t tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n In ""STAMP"", A is in position 3. So that\'s the same as before. We should avoid.\n\n How about ""PASTA"": \n - P, A, S, T, A -> A in position 2 and 5. \n - This way we test A in two new positions (2 and 5). \n - Also, we test P, S, T.\n\n But note: we are using two A\'s. If the secret word has only one A, then one of these A\'s might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark each A that is in the word. If the word has one A, then only one of the two A\'s in ""PASTA"" will be marked (and it will be the one that is in the correct position, or if both are wrong then the one that is in the word? Actually, the game marks each occurrence that is in the word, but if the word has only one A, then only one A in the guess will be marked as present (and if neither is in the correct position, then one will be marked with \'-\' and the other with \'x\').\n\n However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using two A\'s might not be efficient because we are using two slots for the same letter when we could test two different letters.\n\n Therefore, I think it\'s better to use a word with distinct letters.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has A and four new distinct letters, and put A in a new position (not position 3).\n\n Example: \n - Position 1: A? -> words like ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. \n - Avoid E: so ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. But we don\'t know about U, D, I, O. \n   However, note that we have to avoid R, C, N, E? Yes, and also we haven\'t tested U, D, I, O.\n\n But ""AUDIO"" is a valid word. It has A in position 1, which is a new position.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. Also valid.\n\n But which one is better? ""AUDIO"" has more vowels, which might be less common? Actually, vowels are common, but we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). Consonants might be more informative.\n\n Another word: ""SPLAT"": \n - S, P, L, A, T. \n - A is in position 4 (which is new). \n - Letters: S, P, L, A, T. All distinct and common.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, N, E. ""SPLAT"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""SPLAT"".\n\n However, note: we are on the second guess. We have 5 more guesses? Actually, 6 tries total, so this is the second.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""PALMS"": \n - P, A, L, M, S. \n - A in position 2.\n\n But ""SPLAT"" seems fine.\n\n Let me confirm: S in position 1, P in 2, L in 3, A in 4, T in 5.\n\n We are testing S, P, L, A, T. And A is in a new position (4).\n\n So, I choose ""SPLAT"".\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, L, or T. We are testing them.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""SPLAT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, N, E not in the word; A present but not in position 3), I need a new guess that:\n- Includes A in a position other than 3 (to test new locations)\n- Avoids C, R, N, E entirely\n- Uses common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, P)\n- Prefers distinct letters to cover more possibilities\n\nThe word ""**SPLAT**"" fits well:\n- A is in position 4 (new location to test)\n- Tests new common letters: S, P, L, T\n- No repeated letters or excluded characters\n\n<guess>splat</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: splat -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n  C: not in word\n  R: not in word\n  A: in word but wrong position (not in position 3)\n  N: not in word\n  E: not in word\n\nSo we know the secret word contains A (but not in position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.\n\nGuess 2: ""splat"" -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)\nMeaning:\n  S: not in word\n  P: not in word\n  L: in word but wrong position (not in position 3 of ""splat"", which is the third letter)\n  A: in word and in the correct position (position 4 of ""splat"", which is the fourth letter of the secret word)\n  T: in word but wrong position (not in position 5)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has A in the fourth position (because A is marked correct in position 4 of ""splat"").\n- The secret word contains L and T, but not in the positions we guessed (L not in position 3, T not in position 5).\n- The secret word does not contain S or P.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 4.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P.\n\nNow, we know the secret word:\n- Must have A in the 4th position: so the pattern is _ _ _ A _\n- Contains L and T (each at least once) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively (from the second guess).\n- Also, L is not in position 3 (from ""splat"") and T is not in position 5 (from ""splat"").\n\nMoreover, we know the word has at least three distinct letters: A, L, T.\n\nWe need to make a third guess. We should:\n1. Include L and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don\'t know their positions).\n2. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, P.\n3. Try to find the positions for L and T, and also find the remaining letters.\n\nWe also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters to discover.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for L and T:\n- L cannot be in position 3 (from ""splat"" feedback: L was in position 3 and marked as wrong position, so L is in the word but not there).\n- T cannot be in position 5 (from ""splat"" feedback: T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so T is in the word but not there).\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we know A is in position 4.\n\nWe can try to form a word that:\n- Has A in the 4th position.\n- Includes L and T in positions that we haven\'t ruled out.\n- Uses two new letters (that we haven\'t tested) that are common and not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, P.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note L and T are already in the word, so we can reuse them? Actually, we don\'t know if they appear more than once, but to be safe, we can assume one occurrence unless feedback suggests otherwise.\n\nWe need to test new letters to find the remaining ones.\n\nThe positions we have:\nPosition 1: unknown\nPosition 2: unknown\nPosition 3: unknown (but we know it\'s not A, and not L? Actually, we only know L is not in position 3 from the second guess, but it could be in position 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is A, so L can be in 1,2, or 5. Similarly, T can be in 1,2,3,4? But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know T is not in position 5, so T can be in 1,2, or 3.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid putting L in position 3 and T in position 5 because we know they are not there.\n\nSo for our next guess, we can try:\n- Put L in position 1 or 2 (to test a new position) and T in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nBut we also want to test two new letters for the remaining positions.\n\nThe word pattern: _ _ _ A _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 4: A\n- The word contains L and T (so they must be in positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints: L not in 3, T not in 5).\n\nSo possible assignments for L and T:\n- L can be in 1,2,5\n- T can be in 1,2,3\n\nBut note: we have two more letters to find? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have A, L, T, and two more.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has A in 4, and then L and T in the allowed positions, and two new letters.\n\nExample: \nLet me try putting L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need a letter for position 3 and 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know what they are. We can choose common letters.\n\nBut note: we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can put T in position 3 and L in position 5? \n- T in position 3: allowed because T can be in 3 (we only know it\'s not in 5).\n- L in position 5: allowed because L can be in 5 (we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\nBut then we need letters for position 1 and 2.\n\nLet me think of words that fit: _ _ T A L? \nBut we have to check if that\'s a word. For example, ""CITAL"" is not a word. \n\nAlternatively, _ _ L A T? But T cannot be in position 5? We know T is not in position 5 from the second guess. So we cannot put T in position 5.\n\nSo T must be in 1,2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly, L cannot be in 3, so L must be in 1,2, or 5.\n\nBut if we put L in 5, then T must be in 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo a word like: \n- Position 1: T, position 2: new letter, position 3: new letter, position 4: A, position 5: L -> T _ _ A L\n  Example: ""TIGAL"" is not a word.\n\nAnother: \n- Position 1: new, position 2: T, position 3: new, position 4: A, position 5: L -> _ T _ A L\n  Example: ""ITAL"" is 4 letters, so we need 5: ""VITAL"" - but ""VITAL"" has V, I, T, A, L. \n  But note: we haven\'t tested V and I. Also, ""VITAL"" is a word.\n\nBut in ""VITAL"", T is in position 3? Let\'s count: \n  V-I-T-A-L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L.\n\nBut we know T cannot be in position 5? That\'s fine, here T is in 3. And L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3, but 5 is okay).\n\nAlso, we are testing V and I.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid S, P, etc. V and I are not excluded.\n\nSo ""VITAL"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we also have to consider: in the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 3, which is consistent because now A is in 4.\n\nIn the second guess, we had L in position 3 (which was wrong) and now we are putting L in 5, which is a different position. Similarly, T was in 5 (wrong) and now we are putting it in 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has T in 3 and L in 5? It might.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t put both L and T in positions we haven\'t tested? But we have to test them.\n\nAnother candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 2. Then we need two new letters for 3 and 5.\n\nWord: L _ _ A _ \nBut with T in position 2: L T _ A _ \nThen we need a letter for 3 and 5.\n\nExample: ""L T ? A ?"" \nWords: ""LTA"" is not a word. How about ""LOTAS""? But S is excluded. \n""LITAS""? S excluded. \n""LUTEA""? But E is excluded.\n\nAvoiding excluded letters: no E, S, P, etc.\n\nPossible: ""LITHA""? But H is allowed. ""LITHA"" is not a common word? I\'m not sure. \n\nAnother: ""LATHA""? But A is already in 4, and we are putting T in 2? ""LATHA"" would be L-A-T-H-A, but then position 4 is T? We need position 4 to be A. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be A.\n\nSo back to ""L T ? A ?"". We need a word like ""LT?A?"".\n\nI can\'t think of a common word. \n\nAnother idea: put T in position 1 and L in position 2: T L _ A _ \nExample: ""TALAK""? Not a word. ""TALMA""? Not common. \n\nPut T in position 1, and L in position 5: T _ _ A L \nExample: ""TIGAL"" not a word. ""TONAL"" but O is allowed, but N is excluded. N is in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded: C, R, N, E, S, P. So N is out.\n\n""TOFAL""? Not a word.\n\n""TIDAL"" -> T-I-D-A-L. This is a word. \nBut in ""TIDAL"": \n  T in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, A in 4, L in 5.\n\nBut we know from the second guess that T cannot be in position 5? That\'s fine, here T is in 1. \nAnd L is in 5, which is allowed (we only know L is not in 3). \n\nAlso, we are testing I and D.\n\nSo ""TIDAL"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""VITAL"" as above.\n\nNow, which one to choose? Both are valid.\n\nBut note: in ""VITAL"", we are putting T in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback about position 3 for T yet. Similarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are putting T in 1 and L in 5.\n\nWe want to maximize information. We know the word has T and L, but we don\'t know their positions. \n\nIn ""VITAL"", we are testing T in position 3 and L in position 5. \nIn ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in position 1 and L in position 5.\n\nWe also know that T cannot be in 5 (from the second guess) and L cannot be in 3 (from the second guess). \n\nSo in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in a new position (3) and L in a position that is allowed (5). \nIn ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in a new position (1) and L in 5.\n\nBoth are testing two new letters: V and I for ""VITAL"", and T and I and D for ""TIDAL""? Actually, ""TIDAL"" has I and D.\n\nBut note: we are also testing the positions.\n\nWe might also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence of that so far.\n\nI think both are good. Let me see which one uses more common letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put L in 5? Because if we put L in 5 and it\'s not correct, then we still don\'t know about other positions.\n\nBut we have to start somewhere.\n\nAnother candidate: put L in position 1 and T in position 3? But L cannot be in position 1? Wait, no: L can be in 1. And T can be in 3? Yes.\n\nSo word: L _ T A _ \nExample: ""LITAY""? Not a word. ""LUTAY""? Not a word. ""LATAK""? Not a word. \n\n""LOTAH""? Not common. \n\nI think ""VITAL"" and ""TIDAL"" are better.\n\nI\'ll go with ""VITAL"" because it has V and I, which are less common than D and I? Actually, D is more common than V. But we are testing two vowels in ""VITAL""? V is a consonant, I is a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s look at frequency. In English, D is more common than V. So testing D might be better? \n\nBut we are also testing positions. \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests only one new letter? But we have two positions to fill (besides the known A and the two known letters L and T that we are placing). Actually, we are testing two new letters in either case.\n\nBut note: we have to fill all positions. \n\nAnother idea: we know the word has L and T, and A in 4. We can try to use a word that has L and T in positions we haven\'t eliminated and that also uses common letters for the rest.\n\nHow about ""DELTA""? But D, E, L, T, A -> but E is excluded. \n\n""BALTY""? Not a word.\n\n""GALT""? Not 5 letters.\n\nI think ""TIDAL"" and ""VITAL"" are both good. \n\nBut let me check the dictionary: both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""VITAL"" because it tests T in position 3 (which we haven\'t tested for T) and L in position 5 (which we haven\'t tested for L). In ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 and L in 5. We already know T is not in 5, but we don\'t know about T in 1 or 3. Similarly for L, we know not in 3, but we don\'t know about 1,2,5.\n\nSo both are testing new positions.\n\nBut in ""VITAL"", we are testing T in 3 and L in 5. In ""TIDAL"", we are testing T in 1 and L in 5. \n\nWe have more information about T: we know T is not in 5, but we don\'t know about 1,2,3. Similarly for L: not in 3, but we don\'t know about 1,2,5.\n\nSo testing T in 3 (as in ""VITAL"") is a new position, and testing L in 5 is a new position.\n\nIn ""TIDAL"", we test T in 1 (new) and L in 5 (new).\n\nBut we have two unknown positions: 1 and 2 in the pattern. In ""VITAL"", we are using V for 1 and I for 2. In ""TIDAL"", we are using T for 1 and I for 2 and D for 3? No, in ""TIDAL"": \n  Position 1: T (so we are testing T in 1, which is new)\n  Position 2: I\n  Position 3: D\n  Position 4: A (known)\n  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)\n\nSo in ""TIDAL"", we are testing two new letters: I and D, and also testing T in 1 and L in 5.\n\nIn ""VITAL"":\n  Position 1: V\n  Position 2: I\n  Position 3: T (testing T in 3)\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: L (testing L in 5)\n\nSo both test two new letters and the positions for T and L.\n\nBut note: in ""TIDAL"", we are using position 3 for D, which we haven\'t tested for any known letter. In ""VITAL"", we are using position 3 for T, which is a known letter.\n\nSo ""VITAL"" might be better because we are using a known letter (T) in a new position (3) that we are unsure of, and we are testing two new letters (V and I) in positions 1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""TIDAL"", we are testing a known letter (T) in position 1 and another known letter (L) in position 5, and new letters in 2 and 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T is in position 1 or 3? So both are valid tests.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""VITAL"" because it uses the known T in a position (3) that we haven\'t tested for T (and we know T is in the word, so we need to find its position).\n\nSo let\'s choose ""VITAL"".\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure we don\'t use excluded letters. V and I are not excluded.\n\nSo guess: VITAL\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have to ensure consistency.\n\nFirst guess: crane -> A was present but not in 3. In VITAL, A is in 4, which is correct.\n\nSecond guess: splat -> A was correct in 4, L was present but not in 3 (in VITAL, L is in 5, not 3, so that\'s okay), T was present but not in 5 (in VITAL, T is in 3, not 5, so that\'s okay).\n\nAlso, we are not using any excluded letters.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""VITAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3.

We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""splat"" -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)
  - A is in the correct position (4).
  - L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - T is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""vital"" -> V(x) I(x) T(-) A(✓) L(✓)
  - A is correct in position 4 (already known).
  - L is correct in position 5 (new information).
  - T is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked as '-' in position 3).
  - V and I are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 4 and L in position 5. So the pattern is: _ _ _ A L
- The word contains T, but not in position 3 (from ""vital"") and not in position 5 (from ""splat"", but position 5 is now L). Also, T cannot be in position 4 (A) or position 5 (L). So T must be in position 1 or 2.
- We have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P, V, I.

The secret word pattern: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] A L

We know:
- T is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2.
- The word has at least three letters: T, A, L. And we need two more letters for positions 1,2,3? But note: T will take one of position 1 or 2, so we need one more letter for the remaining position and position 3.

Actually, the word has 5 letters: 
  Position 1: either T or a new letter
  Position 2: either T or a new letter (but not both T, unless duplicated, but we don't know)
  Position 3: a new letter (since T cannot be in 3, and we have no other known letters)

But we know T is in the word, so one of position 1 or 2 must be T, and the other can be a new letter. And position 3 is a new letter.

So the word is either:
  Option 1: T [new1] [new2] A L
  Option 2: [new1] T [new2] A L

We need to find two new letters (let's call them X and Y) and the position of T.

We have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P, V, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now).

We have to make a guess that fits the pattern and tests the possibilities.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 1 and then two new common letters, or T in position 2 and two new common letters.

But we don't know which one, so we should choose a word that tests one of these and uses common letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and then uses common letters for the other positions, or T in position 2.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

We can try to cover both possibilities? Actually, no, we have to choose one.

But we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and then if it's wrong, we know T is in position 2.

But we also need to test the new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit the pattern.

First, if T is in position 1: T _ _ A L
  We need two letters for position 2 and 3.

  Common words: 
    ""TOTAL"" -> but O is allowed, but T is repeated? And we have T in position 1 and then another T? But we don't know if T is duplicated. Also, ""TOTAL"" has T, O, T, A, L -> but position 3 is T? But we know T cannot be in position 3? Because from ""vital"", T is in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""vital"", T was in position 3 and marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if the word had two T's, then one of them might be in position 3? But the feedback marks each occurrence. In ""vital"", we had one T and it was marked as present but wrong position, so the secret word has at least one T, but not in position 3. It could have another T in position 3? But the feedback would have marked the T in position 3 as present if it were in the word? Actually, no: if the secret word had two T's, and we guess one T in position 3 (which is wrong position) and the other T is not in the word? But wait, the feedback per letter is independent. 

  However, the standard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately. But if we guess a letter once and it appears multiple times in the secret word, the feedback will only mark the one we guessed if there is an occurrence? Actually, no: if we guess a letter once and the word has it multiple times, we might not get full information. But in this case, we guessed T once in ""vital"" and it was marked as present (but wrong position), so the word has at least one T, but not in position 3. It could have more than one T, but we don't know.

  However, to be safe, we should not assume duplicates. But we can test.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  So for T _ _ A L, common words: 
    ""TEPAL"" (a botanical term) -> T, E, P, A, L -> but E and P are excluded (from guess1 and guess2: E and P are absent). 
    ""TOWAL"" -> not a word.

  How about ""TAL"" with two letters? ""TANGLE""? Too long.

  Actually, 5 letters: T _ _ A L.

  ""TUTAL"" -> not common.

  ""TAIGA"" -> but G is in position 3? T-A-I-G-A -> but we need A in position 4? Here position 4 is G? Not matching.

  We need position 4 to be A and 5 to be L.

  So T X Y A L.

  Words: 
    ""TUFAL"" -> not a word.
    ""TAMAL"" -> a type of food, but M is allowed? T-A-M-A-L -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:M, 4:A, 5:L -> but we have two A's? And position 2 is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, in the first guess, we had A and it was present, and now we have A in position 4 and 5? But position 5 is L. In ""TAMAL"", position 4 is A (good) and position 5 is L (good). But position 2 is A. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two A's.

  But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present (wrong position). That A could be the same as the one in position 4? But no, because position 4 is fixed. So the secret word has at least two A's? Or the A in the first guess was referring to the A in position 4? 

  Actually, in the first guess, we had A in position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position. Then in the second guess, we put A in position 4 and it was correct. So the secret word has an A in position 4. The A in the first guess (position 3) was marked as present, but that must be a different A? Because if it were the same A, then when we put it in position 4 (correct) it would have been marked correct, but the first guess had it in 3 and marked as present (so it's not in 3). Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's? Or the feedback in the first guess was for the same A? 

  But Wordle feedback: if a letter appears only once, and you guess it in two different positions, one of them might be marked as correct and the other as absent? But in this case, the first guess had A in 3 (marked present) and the second guess had A in 4 (marked correct). So if there is only one A, then the first guess should have been marked as present (because it's in the word but not in 3) and the second as correct. That is consistent with one A. But the first guess mark for A was for the same A that is in position 4? Yes, because it was present but not in 3. Then when we put it in 4, it was correct.

  So we don't have evidence of two A's. Therefore, we should assume one A for now.

  So ""TAMAL"" has two A's, which might not be necessary.

  How about ""TAXAL"" (relating to a taxon)? Not common.

  ""TABLA"" -> but it ends with A, not L. 

  It's hard to find common words for T _ _ A L.

Now, the other option: T in position 2: so pattern: _ T _ A L

  Common words: 
    ""BUTYL"" -> B-U-T-Y-L, but U and Y are allowed? And we have T in position 3? No: position 2 is T? 
      B (1), U (2)? No: we need position 2 to be T. So: 
      Position 1: ?, position 2: T, position 3: ?, position 4: A, position 5: L.

    Example: ""METAL"" -> M-E-T-A-L -> but E is excluded. 
    ""FATAL"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> but A is in position 2? We need position 2 to be T. 
    ""FATAL"" has F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A in position 4 and L in 5, so that matches. But position 2 is A, not T. 

    We need position 2 to be T: so [letter] T [letter] A L.

    Words: 
      ""BETAL"" (a chemical) -> B-E-T-A-L -> E excluded.
      ""CITAL"" -> C excluded.
      ""DOTAL"" -> D-O-T-A-L -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need position 2 to be T? Here it's O. 

    Actually, we need: position 1: ?, position 2: T, position 3: ?, position 4: A, position 5: L.

    So: X T Y A L.

    Examples: 
      ""ITALY"" -> not 5 letters? ""ITALY"" is 5: I-T-A-L-Y -> but that's I(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we need A in position 4 and L in 5? Here A is in 3 and L in 4. Not matching.

    How about ""ATTAL"" -> not a word.

    ""OCTAL"" -> O-C-T-A-L -> C excluded.

    ""RITUAL"" -> too long.

    ""KATAL"" (a unit) -> K-A-T-A-L -> A in position 2, T in 3 -> not T in 2.

    I'm struggling. 

    Another: ""HUTIA"" -> not ending with L.

    ""CATTLE"" -> too long.

    Let me search: words ending with ""AL"" and having T in position 2 and A in position 4? 

    Actually, position 4 is A and 5 is L, so the last two are ""AL"". And position 2 is T.

    So pattern: _ T _ A L

    Valid words: 
      ""STAAL"" -> but S is excluded.
      ""PTYAL"" -> not common.
      ""UTILE"" -> not ending with AL.

    How about ""METAL"" but E is excluded.

    ""DOTAL"" -> D-O-T-A-L: 
        Position 1: D
        Position 2: O -> but we need T here? No, we need position 2 to be T. In ""DOTAL"", position 2 is O, position 3 is T.

    We need position 2 to be T, so the second letter is T.

    Words: 
      ""ATEAL"" -> not a word.
      ""UTTAL"" -> not a word.
      ""ITEM"" -> not 5.

    I found: ""AITU L"" -> no.

    Actually, there is ""LUTEA"" but E and not matching.

    This is difficult. 

    Alternatively, we can consider that T might be in position 1, and we found ""TAMAL"" but it has two A's. But let's check if it's acceptable.

    ""TAMAL"": T-A-M-A-L -> 
        Position 1: T
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A is in position 2? We only know A is in position 4. 
        Position 3: M
        Position 4: A (correct)
        Position 5: L (correct)

    But we have A in position 2 and 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two A's.

    And in the first guess, we had only one A in ""crane"", and it was marked as present. That could be either of the two A's? But when we guessed ""splat"" and ""vital"", we only had one A and it was marked correct in position 4. So the secret word has at least one A in position 4. The first guess had A in position 3 and marked as present, which could be the same A (if it were in 4) or a different A. But if there is only one A, then the first guess A (position 3) is the same as the one in position 4, and it was marked as present because it's in the word but not in 3. Then in subsequent guesses, we put it in 4 and it was correct. That works for one A.

    But if there are two A's, then the first guess A (position 3) could be for the second A? And the second guess A (position 4) is for the first A. But in the first guess, we only had one A, and it was marked as present, so there is at least one A. In the second guess, we had one A and it was marked correct, so there is an A in position 4. If there is a second A, it could be in any position except 3 (because if it were in 3, then in the first guess it would have been marked correct? But no, we put it in 3 and it was marked as present but not correct, so it's not in 3). So a second A could be in 1,2, or 5. But position 5 is L, so not 5. So position 1 or 2.

    In ""TAMAL"", we have A in position 2 and 4. That is possible.

    And ""TAMAL"" is a valid word (a Mexican dish).

    But we have to check the letters: T, A, M, A, L. 
    - M is not excluded (we haven't tested M).
    - T is in position 1, which is allowed (T can be in 1 or 2).
    - A in position 2: we haven't tested position 2 for A, but it could be there.

    So ""TAMAL"" is a candidate.

    Another candidate: ""TAHAL"" (not common).

    Or ""TAGAL"" (a language) -> T-A-G-A-L.

    But ""TAMAL"" is more common.

    But note: in ""TAMAL"", we are using A in position 2. We don't know if that is allowed, but it's possible.

    Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use A in position 2, but uses two new letters.

    How about ""TODAY"" -> not ending with L.

    Back to the pattern: T _ _ A L -> we need a word with T in 1, then two letters, then A and L.

    Another word: ""TICAL"" (a weight unit) -> T-I-C-A-L -> but C is excluded.

    ""TOWAL"" -> not a word.

    ""TEGUA"" -> not.

    ""TAVAL"" -> not.

    ""TAXOL"" -> T-A-X-O-L -> but we need A in position 4? Here position 2 is A, position 4 is O. Not matching.

    So ""TAMAL"" seems like a possibility.

    But let's consider the other option: T in position 2. We need a word: _ T _ A L.

    I found: ""ATTAL"" is not valid. ""MTAL"" not 5.

    How about ""HOTEL"" -> not ending with AL.

    ""FATAL"" -> has T in position 3, not 2.

    ""METAL"" -> T in 3.

    I think it's hard. Maybe ""CABAL"" -> C-A-B-A-L -> but C is excluded, and A in position 2 and 4.

    ""DEDAL"" -> D-E-D-A-L -> E excluded.

    ""JETON"" -> not.

    So perhaps the secret word has T in position 1.

    Another idea: the word ""MEDAL"" -> but E excluded and not T in 2.

    We might have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

    Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters.

    Pattern: _ _ _ A L, with T in position 1 or 2.

    We can try to put T in position 1 and use common letters for 2 and 3.

    For example, ""TO"" and ""A"" are common, but we need position 2 and 3.

    How about ""TODAL"" -> not a word.

    ""TONAL"" -> T-O-N-A-L -> but N is excluded.

    ""TOGAL"" -> not a word.

    ""TOKAL"" -> not.

    ""TOFAL"" -> not.

    ""TOWAL"" -> not.

    ""TUBAL"" -> T-U-B-A-L -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:B, 4:A, 5:L -> this is a word (relating to a tube). 
        And U and B are not excluded.

    So ""TUBAL"" is a candidate.

    Similarly, for the other pattern, if we put T in position 2: _ T _ A L, we have ""UTILE"" not matching, but ""BUTE"" not 5.

    Another word for _ T _ A L: ""STOAL"" -> S excluded.

    ""Moral"" -> M-O-R-A-L -> R excluded.

    So ""TUBAL"" seems good.

    In ""TUBAL"":
        T in position 1 (allowed)
        U in position 2 (new)
        B in position 3 (new)
        A in position 4 (correct)
        L in position 5 (correct)

    This tests T in position 1, and if it's correct, then we get information about U and B. If not, then T must be in position 2.

    So I think ""TUBAL"" is a good guess.

    Let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""TUBAL"":
        T: in position 1 -> if the secret word has T in position 1, then it would be correct (✓). But if the secret word has T in position 2, then T in position 1 would be marked as absent or present? 
        But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

    But in this guess, we are also have positions 2 and 3 as U and B.

    We are not sure.

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 2. But we couldn't find a common one.

    Another candidate: ""DUCAL"" -> D-U-C-A-L -> C excluded.

    ""FUCAL"" -> F-U-C-A-L -> C excluded.

    ""JUDAL"" -> not common.

    So ""TUBAL"" is a reasonable choice.

    Therefore, I'll guess ""TUBAL"".

    But note: we are on guess 4.

    If the secret word is ""TUBAL"", then we might win. If not, we get information.

    Another possibility: the word might be ""LOCAL"" but L is in position 1, but we have L in position 5 fixed, and ""LOCAL"" has L in 1 and 5? But then in position 5 is L, which is correct, but position 1 is L, which we don't know. But in our pattern, position 5 is L, and position 1 is something else. Also, ""LOCAL"" doesn't have T.

    We know T is in the word, so ""LOCAL"" doesn't work.

    Similarly, ""FOCAL"" has no T.

    So ""TUBAL"" is a good try.

    Let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is present but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SPLAT)**: A is correct in position 4. L is present but not in position 3. T is present but not in position 5. S, P are absent.
- **Guess 3 (VITAL)**: A is correct in position 4. L is correct in position 5. T is present but not in position 3. V, I are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 4: A
   - Position 5: L  
   Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ A L`
2. **Confirmed letters**: 
   - T is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from SPLAT and VITAL feedback). Thus, T must be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P, V, I.
4. **Remaining slots**: Positions 1, 2, and 3 need resolution, with T occupying either position 1 or 2, and one new letter in position 3.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test T in position 1**: This is a plausible position given constraints.
- **Introduce new letters**: Use high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, U) not yet tested or excluded.
- **Word choice**: ""TUBAL"" fits perfectly:
  - `T` in position 1 (tests T's placement).
  - `U` and `B` (new high-frequency letters) in positions 2 and 3.
  - Matches the `_ _ _ A L` pattern.
- **Why ""TUBAL""?** 
  - If T is correct in position 1, feedback will confirm and reveal U/B status.
  - If T is absent in position 1, T must be in position 2 (last remaining option).

<guess>tubal</guess>",tubal,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""splat"" -> S(x) P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(-)
  - A is in the correct position (4).
  - L is in the word but not in position 3.
  - T is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""vital"" -> V(x) I(x) T(-) A(✓) L(✓)
  - A is correct in position 4 (already known).
  - L is correct in position 5 (new information).
  - T is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked as '-' in position 3).
  - V and I are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 4 and L in position 5. So the pattern is: _ _ _ A L
- The word contains T, but not in position 3 (from ""vital"") and not in position 5 (from ""splat"", but position 5 is now L). Also, T cannot be in position 4 (A) or position 5 (L). So T must be in position 1 or 2.
- We have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P, V, I.

The secret word pattern: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] A L

We know:
- T is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2.
- The word has at least three letters: T, A, L. And we need two more letters for positions 1,2,3? But note: T will take one of position 1 or 2, so we need one more letter for the remaining position and position 3.

Actually, the word has 5 letters: 
  Position 1: either T or a new letter
  Position 2: either T or a new letter (but not both T, unless duplicated, but we don't know)
  Position 3: a new letter (since T cannot be in 3, and we have no other known letters)

But we know T is in the word, so one of position 1 or 2 must be T, and the other can be a new letter. And position 3 is a new letter.

So the word is either:
  Option 1: T [new1] [new2] A L
  Option 2: [new1] T [new2] A L

We need to find two new letters (let's call them X and Y) and the position of T.

We have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, P, V, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now).

We have to make a guess that fits the pattern and tests the possibilities.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 1 and then two new common letters, or T in position 2 and two new common letters.

But we don't know which one, so we should choose a word that tests one of these and uses common letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and then uses common letters for the other positions, or T in position 2.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

We can try to cover both possibilities? Actually, no, we have to choose one.

But we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and then if it's wrong, we know T is in position 2.

But we also need to test the new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit the pattern.

First, if T is in position 1: T _ _ A L
  We need two letters for position 2 and 3.

  Common words: 
    ""TOTAL"" -> but O is allowed, but T is repeated? And we have T in position 1 and then another T? But we don't know if T is duplicated. Also, ""TOTAL"" has T, O, T, A, L -> but position 3 is T? But we know T cannot be in position 3? Because from ""vital"", T is in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""vital"", T was in position 3 and marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if the word had two T's, then one of them might be in position 3? But the feedback marks each occurrence. In ""vital"", we had one T and it was marked as present but wrong position, so the secret word has at least one T, but not in position 3. It could have another T in position 3? But the feedback would have marked the T in position 3 as present if it were in the word? Actually, no: if the secret word had two T's, and we guess one T in position 3 (which is wrong position) and the other T is not in the word? But wait, the feedback per letter is independent. 

  However, the standard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately. But if we guess a letter once and it appears multiple times in the secret word, the feedback will only mark the one we guessed if there is an occurrence? Actually, no: if we guess a letter once and the word has it multiple times, we might not get full information. But in this case, we guessed T once in ""vital"" and it was marked as present (but wrong position), so the word has at least one T, but not in position 3. It could have more than one T, but we don't know.

  However, to be safe, we should not assume duplicates. But we can test.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  So for T _ _ A L, common words: 
    ""TEPAL"" (a botanical term) -> T, E, P, A, L -> but E and P are excluded (from guess1 and guess2: E and P are absent). 
    ""TOWAL"" -> not a word.

  How about ""TAL"" with two letters? ""TANGLE""? Too long.

  Actually, 5 letters: T _ _ A L.

  ""TUTAL"" -> not common.

  ""TAIGA"" -> but G is in position 3? T-A-I-G-A -> but we need A in position 4? Here position 4 is G? Not matching.

  We need position 4 to be A and 5 to be L.

  So T X Y A L.

  Words: 
    ""TUFAL"" -> not a word.
    ""TAMAL"" -> a type of food, but M is allowed? T-A-M-A-L -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:M, 4:A, 5:L -> but we have two A's? And position 2 is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, in the first guess, we had A and it was present, and now we have A in position 4 and 5? But position 5 is L. In ""TAMAL"", position 4 is A (good) and position 5 is L (good). But position 2 is A. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two A's.

  But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present (wrong position). That A could be the same as the one in position 4? But no, because position 4 is fixed. So the secret word has at least two A's? Or the A in the first guess was referring to the A in position 4? 

  Actually, in the first guess, we had A in position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position. Then in the second guess, we put A in position 4 and it was correct. So the secret word has an A in position 4. The A in the first guess (position 3) was marked as present, but that must be a different A? Because if it were the same A, then when we put it in position 4 (correct) it would have been marked correct, but the first guess had it in 3 and marked as present (so it's not in 3). Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's? Or the feedback in the first guess was for the same A? 

  But Wordle feedback: if a letter appears only once, and you guess it in two different positions, one of them might be marked as correct and the other as absent? But in this case, the first guess had A in 3 (marked present) and the second guess had A in 4 (marked correct). So if there is only one A, then the first guess should have been marked as present (because it's in the word but not in 3) and the second as correct. That is consistent with one A. But the first guess mark for A was for the same A that is in position 4? Yes, because it was present but not in 3. Then when we put it in 4, it was correct.

  So we don't have evidence of two A's. Therefore, we should assume one A for now.

  So ""TAMAL"" has two A's, which might not be necessary.

  How about ""TAXAL"" (relating to a taxon)? Not common.

  ""TABLA"" -> but it ends with A, not L. 

  It's hard to find common words for T _ _ A L.

Now, the other option: T in position 2: so pattern: _ T _ A L

  Common words: 
    ""BUTYL"" -> B-U-T-Y-L, but U and Y are allowed? And we have T in position 3? No: position 2 is T? 
      B (1), U (2)? No: we need position 2 to be T. So: 
      Position 1: ?, position 2: T, position 3: ?, position 4: A, position 5: L.

    Example: ""METAL"" -> M-E-T-A-L -> but E is excluded. 
    ""FATAL"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> but A is in position 2? We need position 2 to be T. 
    ""FATAL"" has F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A in position 4 and L in 5, so that matches. But position 2 is A, not T. 

    We need position 2 to be T: so [letter] T [letter] A L.

    Words: 
      ""BETAL"" (a chemical) -> B-E-T-A-L -> E excluded.
      ""CITAL"" -> C excluded.
      ""DOTAL"" -> D-O-T-A-L -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need position 2 to be T? Here it's O. 

    Actually, we need: position 1: ?, position 2: T, position 3: ?, position 4: A, position 5: L.

    So: X T Y A L.

    Examples: 
      ""ITALY"" -> not 5 letters? ""ITALY"" is 5: I-T-A-L-Y -> but that's I(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we need A in position 4 and L in 5? Here A is in 3 and L in 4. Not matching.

    How about ""ATTAL"" -> not a word.

    ""OCTAL"" -> O-C-T-A-L -> C excluded.

    ""RITUAL"" -> too long.

    ""KATAL"" (a unit) -> K-A-T-A-L -> A in position 2, T in 3 -> not T in 2.

    I'm struggling. 

    Another: ""HUTIA"" -> not ending with L.

    ""CATTLE"" -> too long.

    Let me search: words ending with ""AL"" and having T in position 2 and A in position 4? 

    Actually, position 4 is A and 5 is L, so the last two are ""AL"". And position 2 is T.

    So pattern: _ T _ A L

    Valid words: 
      ""STAAL"" -> but S is excluded.
      ""PTYAL"" -> not common.
      ""UTILE"" -> not ending with AL.

    How about ""METAL"" but E is excluded.

    ""DOTAL"" -> D-O-T-A-L: 
        Position 1: D
        Position 2: O -> but we need T here? No, we need position 2 to be T. In ""DOTAL"", position 2 is O, position 3 is T.

    We need position 2 to be T, so the second letter is T.

    Words: 
      ""ATEAL"" -> not a word.
      ""UTTAL"" -> not a word.
      ""ITEM"" -> not 5.

    I found: ""AITU L"" -> no.

    Actually, there is ""LUTEA"" but E and not matching.

    This is difficult. 

    Alternatively, we can consider that T might be in position 1, and we found ""TAMAL"" but it has two A's. But let's check if it's acceptable.

    ""TAMAL"": T-A-M-A-L -> 
        Position 1: T
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A is in position 2? We only know A is in position 4. 
        Position 3: M
        Position 4: A (correct)
        Position 5: L (correct)

    But we have A in position 2 and 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two A's.

    And in the first guess, we had only one A in ""crane"", and it was marked as present. That could be either of the two A's? But when we guessed ""splat"" and ""vital"", we only had one A and it was marked correct in position 4. So the secret word has at least one A in position 4. The first guess had A in position 3 and marked as present, which could be the same A (if it were in 4) or a different A. But if there is only one A, then the first guess A (position 3) is the same as the one in position 4, and it was marked as present because it's in the word but not in 3. Then in subsequent guesses, we put it in 4 and it was correct. That works for one A.

    But if there are two A's, then the first guess A (position 3) could be for the second A? And the second guess A (position 4) is for the first A. But in the first guess, we only had one A, and it was marked as present, so there is at least one A. In the second guess, we had one A and it was marked correct, so there is an A in position 4. If there is a second A, it could be in any position except 3 (because if it were in 3, then in the first guess it would have been marked correct? But no, we put it in 3 and it was marked as present but not correct, so it's not in 3). So a second A could be in 1,2, or 5. But position 5 is L, so not 5. So position 1 or 2.

    In ""TAMAL"", we have A in position 2 and 4. That is possible.

    And ""TAMAL"" is a valid word (a Mexican dish).

    But we have to check the letters: T, A, M, A, L. 
    - M is not excluded (we haven't tested M).
    - T is in position 1, which is allowed (T can be in 1 or 2).
    - A in position 2: we haven't tested position 2 for A, but it could be there.

    So ""TAMAL"" is a candidate.

    Another candidate: ""TAHAL"" (not common).

    Or ""TAGAL"" (a language) -> T-A-G-A-L.

    But ""TAMAL"" is more common.

    But note: in ""TAMAL"", we are using A in position 2. We don't know if that is allowed, but it's possible.

    Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use A in position 2, but uses two new letters.

    How about ""TODAY"" -> not ending with L.

    Back to the pattern: T _ _ A L -> we need a word with T in 1, then two letters, then A and L.

    Another word: ""TICAL"" (a weight unit) -> T-I-C-A-L -> but C is excluded.

    ""TOWAL"" -> not a word.

    ""TEGUA"" -> not.

    ""TAVAL"" -> not.

    ""TAXOL"" -> T-A-X-O-L -> but we need A in position 4? Here position 2 is A, position 4 is O. Not matching.

    So ""TAMAL"" seems like a possibility.

    But let's consider the other option: T in position 2. We need a word: _ T _ A L.

    I found: ""ATTAL"" is not valid. ""MTAL"" not 5.

    How about ""HOTEL"" -> not ending with AL.

    ""FATAL"" -> has T in position 3, not 2.

    ""METAL"" -> T in 3.

    I think it's hard. Maybe ""CABAL"" -> C-A-B-A-L -> but C is excluded, and A in position 2 and 4.

    ""DEDAL"" -> D-E-D-A-L -> E excluded.

    ""JETON"" -> not.

    So perhaps the secret word has T in position 1.

    Another idea: the word ""MEDAL"" -> but E excluded and not T in 2.

    We might have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

    Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters.

    Pattern: _ _ _ A L, with T in position 1 or 2.

    We can try to put T in position 1 and use common letters for 2 and 3.

    For example, ""TO"" and ""A"" are common, but we need position 2 and 3.

    How about ""TODAL"" -> not a word.

    ""TONAL"" -> T-O-N-A-L -> but N is excluded.

    ""TOGAL"" -> not a word.

    ""TOKAL"" -> not.

    ""TOFAL"" -> not.

    ""TOWAL"" -> not.

    ""TUBAL"" -> T-U-B-A-L -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:B, 4:A, 5:L -> this is a word (relating to a tube). 
        And U and B are not excluded.

    So ""TUBAL"" is a candidate.

    Similarly, for the other pattern, if we put T in position 2: _ T _ A L, we have ""UTILE"" not matching, but ""BUTE"" not 5.

    Another word for _ T _ A L: ""STOAL"" -> S excluded.

    ""Moral"" -> M-O-R-A-L -> R excluded.

    So ""TUBAL"" seems good.

    In ""TUBAL"":
        T in position 1 (allowed)
        U in position 2 (new)
        B in position 3 (new)
        A in position 4 (correct)
        L in position 5 (correct)

    This tests T in position 1, and if it's correct, then we get information about U and B. If not, then T must be in position 2.

    So I think ""TUBAL"" is a good guess.

    Let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""TUBAL"":
        T: in position 1 -> if the secret word has T in position 1, then it would be correct (✓). But if the secret word has T in position 2, then T in position 1 would be marked as absent or present? 
        But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

    But in this guess, we are also have positions 2 and 3 as U and B.

    We are not sure.

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 2. But we couldn't find a common one.

    Another candidate: ""DUCAL"" -> D-U-C-A-L -> C excluded.

    ""FUCAL"" -> F-U-C-A-L -> C excluded.

    ""JUDAL"" -> not common.

    So ""TUBAL"" is a reasonable choice.

    Therefore, I'll guess ""TUBAL"".

    But note: we are on guess 4.

    If the secret word is ""TUBAL"", then we might win. If not, we get information.

    Another possibility: the word might be ""LOCAL"" but L is in position 1, but we have L in position 5 fixed, and ""LOCAL"" has L in 1 and 5? But then in position 5 is L, which is correct, but position 1 is L, which we don't know. But in our pattern, position 5 is L, and position 1 is something else. Also, ""LOCAL"" doesn't have T.

    We know T is in the word, so ""LOCAL"" doesn't work.

    Similarly, ""FOCAL"" has no T.

    So ""TUBAL"" is a good try.

    Let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is present but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SPLAT)**: A is correct in position 4. L is present but not in position 3. T is present but not in position 5. S, P are absent.
- **Guess 3 (VITAL)**: A is correct in position 4. L is correct in position 5. T is present but not in position 3. V, I are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 4: A
   - Position 5: L  
   Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ A L`
2. **Confirmed letters**: 
   - T is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from SPLAT and VITAL feedback). Thus, T must be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, P, V, I.
4. **Remaining slots**: Positions 1, 2, and 3 need resolution, with T occupying either position 1 or 2, and one new letter in position 3.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test T in position 1**: This is a plausible position given constraints.
- **Introduce new letters**: Use high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, U) not yet tested or excluded.
- **Word choice**: ""TUBAL"" fits perfectly:
  - `T` in position 1 (tests T's placement).
  - `U` and `B` (new high-frequency letters) in positions 2 and 3.
  - Matches the `_ _ _ A L` pattern.
- **Why ""TUBAL""?** 
  - If T is correct in position 1, feedback will confirm and reveal U/B status.
  - If T is absent in position 1, T must be in position 2 (last remaining option).",Guess 4: tubal -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(✓) B(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
