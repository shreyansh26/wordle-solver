We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that can give us maximum information.
 Common starting words in Wordle often use vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters.
 A good starting word should have:
   - Common letters (vowels: A, E, I, O, U and consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
   - No repeated letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Some popular starting words are:
   ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"". It has:
   C, R, A, N, E -> covering common consonants and vowels.

 But note: the example given in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". Since the example secret word was ""BRISK"", we don't want to bias too much.

 However, since this is the first guess, any good starting word is acceptable.

 Let me select ""CRANE"".

 Therefore, the guessed word will be ""CRANE"".

For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes the information I can get about the secret word. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels to quickly identify vowel positions
- Common consonants that appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters to cover more ground

The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels ('A', 'E') and common consonants ('C', 'R', 'N')
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to test five different characters
- It's a very common starting word in word games due to its balanced letter distribution

This guess will immediately reveal:
- Which letters exist in the secret word (and whether they're in the correct position)
- Which letters are absent, allowing me to eliminate them from future guesses

We have the feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Therefore, we know the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Since none of these are present, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters completely.

The word must be composed of letters that are not in the set {C, R, A, N, E}.

Recall common vowels: we have already eliminated A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll see).

Common consonants: avoid C, R, N. Also, note that R and N are very common, but we must exclude them.

We need to pick a word that uses other vowels and consonants.

Some possible second words: We might try to cover vowels I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

Another popular starting word is ""SLOTH"" but let's check available letters.

Avoided letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We can try words with:
- Vowels: I, O, U
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

But preferably, we want common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants that are left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Common vowels: O, I, U is less common.

A good candidate: ""SLIMY"" - but let's see if it uses avoided letters? It has S, L, I, M, Y. Avoided letters we are excluding: no C,R,A,N,E. So S, L, I, M, Y are all allowed.

But we can also think of ""PIOUS"" or ""GUILT"", etc.

Another one: ""TOILS"", ""MOIST"", ""POUND"", etc.

But since we don't have any letters present, we still want to test new vowels and consonants.

Let me consider ""OUIJA"" - but that might not be a standard word? The rules say valid English word, and it has J which is less common.

Better to stick to common words.

""SLUMP"" - S, L, U, M, P. All letters allowed? U is allowed. No C,R,A,N,E.

But let me be systematic: the best approach is to use a word that contains vowels I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, L.

Word: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. All these are not in {C,R,A,N,E}.

Similarly, ""POUND"" - P, O, U, N, D? Wait, has N which is excluded? N is in the avoided set? Yes, N is already excluded from first feedback. So we cannot use N.

In ""POUND"", N is present? So invalid? The feedback says letters not in the word, so if N is not in secret word, we shouldn't use N.

But in our feedback, N was marked x, meaning not in word. So for new guess, we must not use C, R, A, N, E.

Therefore, ""POUND"" has N -> invalid for use.

Similarly, any word must avoid C,R,A,N,E.

So back to ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of those are excluded? 
M not excluded? Check: excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E. So M, O, I, S, T are all fine.

Similarly, ""GHOUL"": G, H, O, U, L. But U and O are vowels, and G,H,L consonants.

But ""ghoul"" is a word? Maybe, but let's stick to more common ones.

""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T. Same as MOIST but H instead of M.

""MOIST"" is a common word.

Another possibility: ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S. Y can be a vowel. And all letters allowed.

But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:
- It contains three vowels? O and I are vowels, S,T,M are consonants. Actually, two vowels: O, I? But O and I are vowels. Three vowel letters? MOIST has O and I - that's two vowels. But each vowel we test helps.

Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y. Y is sometimes a vowel. Testing Y might be good.

We can also consider ""GUILD"", but D is okay, but let's see.

But I think either ""MOIST"" or ""SLIMY"" is fine.

I'll go with ""MOIST"" because it uses more common letters and is a standard word.

So next guess: MOIST.

But note: there might be other words like ""POUTY"" or ""SWIFT"", etc.

To cover U: we haven't covered U yet. But in a third guess if needed.

So for now, MOIST seems reasonable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as ""x"", we know that none of these letters exist in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word cannot contain C, R, A, N, or E.

For the second guess:
- We must avoid using C, R, A, N, E.
- We should choose a word with common letters not yet tested, preferably including vowels like I, O, U and frequently used consonants.
- The word ""MOIST"" is a strong choice because:
  - It uses letters not in the excluded set: M, O, I, S, T.
  - It tests new vowels (O, I) and common consonants (S, T, M).
  - All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>MOIST</guess>
</think>
The previous guess CRANE had all letters marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, I must avoid these letters entirely in my next guess.

A good second guess should focus on untested common letters, especially vowels like O, U, and consonants like S, T, L, M, B. Using a word like ""MOIST"" fits this strategy because:
- It avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- It introduces new vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T)
- It maximizes coverage of common English letters still in play
- All letters are distinct, providing efficient feedback

Similarly, ""GHOUL"": G, H, O, U, L. But U and O are vowels, and G,H,L consonants.

But ""ghoul"" is a word? Maybe, but let's stick to more common ones.

""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T. Same as MOIST but H instead of M.

""MOIST"" is a common word.

Another possibility: ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S. Y can be a vowel. And all letters allowed.

But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:
- It contains three vowels? O and I are vowels, S,T,M are consonants. Actually, two vowels: O, I? But O and I are vowels. Three vowel letters? MOIST has O and I - that's two vowels. But each vowel we test helps.

Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y. Y is sometimes a vowel. Testing Y might be good.

We can also consider ""GUILD"", but D is okay, but let's see.

But I think either ""MOIST"" or ""SLIMY"" is fine.

I'll go with ""MOIST"" because it uses more common letters and is a standard word.

So next guess: MOIST.

But note: there might be other words like ""POUTY"" or ""SWIFT"", etc.

To cover U: we haven't covered U yet. But in a third guess if needed.

So for now, MOIST seems reasonable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as ""x"", we know that none of these letters exist in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word cannot contain C, R, A, N, or E.

For the second guess:
- We must avoid using C, R, A, N, E.
- We should choose a word with common letters not yet tested, preferably including vowels like I, O, U and frequently used consonants.
- The word ""MOIST"" is a strong choice because:
  - It uses letters not in the excluded set: M, O, I, S, T.
  - It tests new vowels (O, I) and common consonants (S, T, M).
  - All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word (all marked x). So secret word has none of these.
2. MOIST: Feedback:
   M(x) -> M not in the word
   O(✓) -> O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since MOIST: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T)
   I(-) -> I is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But wait, positions: the word is indexed 1-5, and we only know it's not at position 3. Also note that the secret word has I, but not at position 3.
   S(-) -> S is in the word but not in position 4 (position: in MOIST, S is at index 4). So S is present but not at index 4.
   T(✓) -> T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

Summary:
- Known letters: O, I, S, T are in the word (from MOIST), but M is not (since x).
- Positions: 
  - O must be at position 2 (since ✓ in position 2).
  - T must be at position 5 (since ✓ in position 5).
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O and position 5 is T, so I cannot be there? Wait, the word has 5 positions. Position 2 is O (fixed), position 5 is T (fixed). So I must be at position 1 or 4? And S must be in the word but not at position 4. Also note that I and S are both present and must be placed correctly.

But wait, the secret word:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: T
- I is present but not at position 3 -> so it can be at position 1 or 4.
- S is present but not at position 4 -> so S must be at position 1 or 3? Because position 2 and 5 are taken. Only positions 1,3,4 left? Actually, the positions are:
  1: must be I or S? or something else? But note, we don't know position 1 and 3 and 4 yet.

But also, we know that S cannot be at position 4 (because in MOIST it was at 4 and marked -). Similarly, I cannot be at position 3.

Moreover, we have eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M. So we cannot use any of these.

Now, let's list all letters that are not eliminated: 
Alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,E,M -> B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we know the secret word contains: O (at pos2), I (somewhere, not pos3), S (somewhere, not pos4), T (at pos5). And there is one more letter (since 5-letter word: positions 1,2,3,4,5; 2 and 5 fixed, so 1,3,4 are unknown, but two of them are I and S, and one is a new letter?).

The secret word form: 
  Position: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Known: 
      2: O
      5: T
      And the word has I and S, but they cannot be at position 3 (for I) and position 4 (for S). So I must be at 1 or 4, and S must be at 1 or 3? But wait, if S is at 3, that's possible? Because in MOIST, S was at 4 and was wrong, but it could be at 3. Similarly, I cannot be at 3, so it must be at 1 or 4.

But note: if I is at position 4, then S could be at position 1 or 3. But we have an additional letter? The secret word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have O at 2, T at 5, and letters at 1,3,4. But the word has I and S, and one more letter (since we guessed two letters correctly, but we have I and S that are present in the word, but we don't know the third? Actually, in MOIST we introduced M (which is absent), and O,I,S,T are present? But O and T are fixed, I and S are present but misplaced. So the word also has one more letter? 

Actually, the word must have exactly 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case we don't know if there are duplicates. But in the feedback, we only know that I and S are present but not at those positions. And M is absent. So the secret word contains O (pos2), T (pos5), I (elsewhere), S (elsewhere), and one more letter at the remaining position? 

Let me denote the secret word as: [ p1, O, p3, p4, T ]

We know p1, p3, p4 are letters to be guessed. Among these three, one is I (but not at p3, because I was at position 3 in MOIST and marked -, meaning it's not there). In MOIST, I was at position 3 and we got - (meaning present but wrong position). So I cannot be at p3. Therefore, I must be at p1 or p4.

Similarly, S was at position 4 in MOIST and got - (present but wrong position), so S cannot be at p4? But wait, in the secret word, position 4 is p4. So S cannot be at p4.

Therefore:
  I must be at p1 or p4, but cannot be at p3 (already known) or p5? But p5 is T, fixed. Similarly, S must be at p1, p3? or p3? Because p4 is not allowed for S? But note: S was at position 4 in the guess and we got -, meaning that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. So S must be at p1 or p3? Because p2 is O, fixed, p5 is T, fixed. 

But note: if S were at p3, that would be acceptable? Yes, because in the guess MOIST we put S at position 4, but if it's actually at position 3, then that would get marked as - (wrong position) for S? Actually, the feedback for S was -, meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. It could be at p1 or p3.

Similarly, I is in the word but not at p3? And p3 is the third position.

Therefore:
- Position p1: could be I or S or a new letter? But note, we must assign I to p1 or p4, and S to p1 or p3? And p3 cannot be I? 

But if we assign S to p1, then I must be at p4? Because I cannot be at p3? Similarly, if S is at p3, then I must be at p1 or p4? But also, we have p3: if S is at p3, then that's fine, but if not, then p3 must be a new letter.

We also have the constraint that the third letter (p3) cannot be I? Because I was at position 3 and got -, so p3 is not I.

So let me create cases:

Case 1: I is at p1.
Case 2: I is at p4.

Similarly, S must be at p1 or p3? But if we are in Case 1: I is at p1, then S cannot be at p1 because distinct? But wait, the word can have duplicate letters? But in the feedback, we don't know. It's possible? However, let's assume without duplicates? Because MOIST has distinct letters, and in the secret word, we don't know. But in Wordle rules, duplicates are allowed? Actually, the rules don't specify, but typically you can have duplicate letters? Though in the example, it was BRISK, distinct. But to be safe, we assume duplicates are possible? However, in standard Wordle, words may have duplicate letters? So we must consider? But to simplify, initially assume distinct?

But in this feedback, we know that O and T are fixed at positions 2 and 5. We have I and S present. And we have three positions: p1, p3, p4. We must place I, S, and one more letter? Because the word must have five letters? And if we place I in p1 and S in p3, then p4 is a new letter? Or if we place I in p1 and S in p4, but S cannot be at p4? So that is impossible? Because S cannot be at p4 (because of feedback from MOIST).

Therefore, in Case 1 (I at p1):
  S cannot be at p4 -> so S must be at p3? Because p1 is taken by I, so S must be at p3? Then p4 must be a new letter, say X.

Then word: [ I, O, S, X, T ]? But wait, I is at p1, but we said I is at p1? Then S at p3. And p4 is new letter. But we know S was at position 4 in the guess and got -, meaning that in the secret word, S is not at position 4? But if we put S at p3, then that's okay? And for p4 we have a new letter? So the word: I O S X T? Then we have X must be a letter not eliminated.

But wait, we have:
  Position: 1: I (from assigning)
            2: O (known)
            3: S (from assigning) -> but is this possible? Then S is at p3? And we have feedback that S was at position 4 in the guess and that position was marked ""-"" meaning S is in the word but not at position 4? That does not prevent S from being at p3? So okay.

Similarly, Case 2 (I at p4):
  Then S must be at p1 or p3? But if I is at p4, then we cannot put S at p4? Therefore, S at p1 or p3? Then:
  If S at p1: then word starts with S, then O, then p3 must be a new letter (not I, not S), then I at p4, T at 5: [ S, O, ?, I, T ]
  Or if S at p3: then [ ?, O, S, I, T ] -> but I is at p4.

Now, note that in Case 1: word would be of form I O S * T? Then the last letter is T, so: I O S ? T. Then the pattern is: _ O _ _ T, but then positions: 1:I, 2:O, 3:S, 4:?, 5:T -> so the word might be like ""IOS?T"" but that is position 1=I, 2=O, 3=S, 4=?, 5=T.

For Case 2a: S at p1: [ S, O, ?, I, T ] -> so ""SO?IT""
For Case 2b: S at p3: [ ?, O, S, I, T ] -> so ""?OSIT""

Now, we have to think about possible words.

But we don't know which case? We need a word to test.

Also, we have eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M. So the remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to guess a word that will help us distinguish these cases.

We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

We know that position 2 is O, position 5 is T.

Our guess must include the known letters appropriately? But we can include O and T? But we know they are fixed? Actually, we can, but must put O at position 2 and T at position 5? To confirm? But we already know they are fixed? Or we can move them? But the feedback will tell us?

We should avoid using eliminated letters: so no C,R,A,N,E,M.

We also know that I and S are in the word, so we should include them? But we don't know their positions.

Therefore, we can try a word that has:
- Position 2: O (to confirm it's still there) -> optional? Actually, we already have it fixed? But if we change, then if it's still there we get ✓ again? But we know it's fixed? Actually, the feedback rules say that if we put a letter in the correct position again, it will show ✓? So we should avoid? Or we can use? Actually, to maximize information about other positions, we might avoid repeating known fixed letters? But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, we have 4 left? Wait, the game allows 6 tries? So we have 4 left.

Alternatively, we can try to cover the possibilities:

Option: make a guess that has I and S, but at different positions to test.

For example, we can guess a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3? Or I at position 4 and S at position 1, etc.

But we also need to include only allowed letters.

Let me brainstorm words:

Case 1 pattern: I O ? S T? But wait, in Case 1 we have [I, O, S, ?, T] -> so the middle letter is actually at position 4, so the word is I O S ? T? Is that a word? For example, ""IOST"" is not complete.

Actually, we don't know? We need to find words that fit the patterns.

For Case 1: word of form IOSS?T? No, we don't know. But we have position 1=I, 2=O, 3=S, 4=?, 5=T.

What words: ""IOST"" must be filled? Not many? ""IOIST"" duplicate? Invalid? No, not distinct? In English, is there a word? How about ""JOIST"": J-O-I-S-T? But wait, that would have J at 1, not I? Form: if the word has I at 1 and S at 3: such as ""IO S ? T"" -> but there aren't many? ""IOSIT"" isn't a word? Or?

Perhaps Case 1 is less likely? Because the word must be a valid English word. Words that start with ""IOS"" are rare? Like ""iosif"" not English? We know: joist, moist, hoist? But in our case, if we have position 1=I, 2=O, 3=S, 4=?, 5=T. Then the word would be like IO?ST? But with four letters? Wait: I O S ? T -> the word has 5: I-O-S-?-T. What word ends with ""ST"" and has I at start? None? So maybe Case 1 is impossible? Because it would require a word ""I?S?T"" but with O at 2? Specifically: positions: 
1: I
2: O
3: S
4: ? 
5: T -> word = I O S ? T

The word must be like ""IOST"" + letter? And not many? Actually, ""joist"" is J-O-I-S-T, so it has O at 2, I at 3, S at 4? Wait, ""joist"": positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. But in our case we have I at position 1? That's impossible? So ""joist"" has J at 1, not I? And it has I at 3? But we are asking for I at 1? Which would be word: I at position 1, O at 2, S at 3? Then ending: ""OST"" but ending with T? 

For instance: the word ""GHOST"": G-H-O-S-T -> but that's not I at 1? Or ""HOSTS"" duplicates? Or ""MOSTS"" duplicates? It doesn't have I at 1? And we already know I is in the word? But the word with pattern I O S ? T? It doesn't exist? Like ""ios"" are only really in words like ""ios"", not English? So Case 1 is very unlikely? 

Therefore, probably Case 1 is not possible? So I must be at position 4? Therefore, Case 2.

So Case 2: I at p4 (position 4). Then S can be at p1 or p3? And p1 and p3 are letter positions? Also, p3 cannot be I (as we know? Because in MOIST I was at p3 and feedback said it was present but wrong position? Actually, in secret word, I is not at p3? So S at p1: [S, O, ?, I, T] or S at p3: [?, O, S, I, T]

Now, possible words:

First subcase: S at p1 -> ""S O ? I T"" -> word: S O * I T? Like ""SPOIT""? Only valid five-letter words: ""spoilt""? But spoilt: S-P-O-I-L-T? 6 letters? Not 5. ""Squit"": S-Q-U-I-T? That has U at position 3.

""Suite"": S-U-I-T-E, but E is eliminated? So not possible? ""Skint"": S-K-I-N-T? N is eliminated? ""Shift"": S-H-I-F-T? That has O? Not? Without O? But we have O fixed at position 2? So must be S followed by O at position 2? So: ""S O ? I T"" -> like ""SOFIT""? Which is a word? Also ""SOLIT""? But we must avoid eliminated letters? Currently eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M.

Words like:
- ""SOBIT"": not a word?
- ""SODIT"": not? 
- ""SOFIT"": valid? It means a type of recess? Yes, acceptable.
- ""SOHIT"": not?
- ""SOLIT"": not a word? Solitary?
- ""SONIT"": but N eliminated? 
- ""SOUIT"": not common? 
- ""SOWIT"": not?
- ""SOPIT"": not?
- ""SORIT"": not? And R is eliminated? R is eliminated? No, R was eliminated? In guess 1, R was marked x? So R cannot be used? Therefore, no words? Unless ""SOFIT"" or others? 

But let me think: if S at p1 and I at p4, then pattern ""S O ? I T""? Also ""SO?IT"", so the third letter? Must be a letter? 

Common words: Maybe ""SPOIT"" not? ""SUIT"" is 4 letters? 

Perhaps ""SOULT"": S-O-U-L-T? But that doesn't have I? We must have I? Because I is in the word? And in this pattern, I is at position 4? So the word must have I at position 4? So ""SO?IT"", with the I at position 4? So the letter at position 3 must be the third letter? And word: S O letter1 letter2 T? But with that pattern? Typically, it would be like ""S O X Y T"" but we know positions: 
1: S
2: O
3: ? (call it X)
4: I 
5: T

So word: S O X I T? What X? Allowed letters? And must be a word? For example: ""SOLIT"": S-O-L-I-T -> yes, that is a word? Actually, ""SOLIT"" isn't common? But ""solitary"" is longer? Or ""split"" is S-P-L-I-T, but without O?

Another: ""SPLIT"": S-P-L-I-T -> but position 2 must be O, so wrong? Here the pattern is fixed: second letter O? So ""S O ? I T"". 

Valid word: ""SOFIT"" (which is a real word: an architectural term). Also known: no? Maybe ""SUINT"" but U at position 3 and N? N eliminated? Not possible? Or ""SPRIT"" has R? R eliminated? ""STOIT"" not? 

What about ""SHIFT""? S-H-I-F-T -> but then: 
- Position: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:F, 5:T -> that's ""SHIFT"", but we need O at position 2? So impossible? 

Therefore, to have O at position 2, and S at 1, I at 4, T at 5: words: 
- ""SOFIT"": S-O-F-I-T? 
- ""SPOIT""? Not a word? 
- ""SOJIT""? Not? 

Other? ""BOSIT""? Not? 

Perhaps it's easier to consider the other subcase: S at position 3, and I at position 4: pattern: [ ? , O, S, I, T ] -> ? O S I T? 

Letters: position 1 must be a letter, and positions: 1: unknown, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T.

Then words: 
- ""HOSIT""? Not?
- ""MOSIT""? But M is eliminated? 
- ""DOSIT""? Not?
- ""POSIT"": P-O-S-I-T? Yes, that's a valid word? Meaning to assume?
- ""KOSIT""? 
- ""FOIST"": F-O-I-S-T? But we have I at position 3? But in this pattern, position 3 is S? So ""FOIST"" has I at position 3, not S? So wrong pattern? 

The pattern is: ? O S I T? So ""P O S I T""? That's ""posit"" (meaning: to put forward as fact). Also, ""joist"" is J-O-I-S-T, which has I at 3 and S at 4? Not S at 3? 

Other words: ""rosit"" not? And R eliminated? ""losit"" not? 

But ""posit"" is valid? Also ""coset"" has E? Eliminated? ""cost"" not long? 

Another: ""gossit""? Not? 

Perhaps ""posit"" or ""bosit""? Not? 

But also, ""boost"" has two O's? Not? And T at the end? But ends with T: B-O-O-S-T? That's 5: B,O,O,S,T -> but that has O at position 2 and 3? However, in our pattern we need S at position 3? So ""boost"" has O at 3? Not S? So not.

The word ""posit"" fits: P-O-S-I-T? Yes? 

Similarly, ""joint"": J-O-I-N-T? But N is eliminated? 

So the candidates are:
- Subcase S at p1: ""SOFIT"" (S-O-F-I-T)
- Subcase S at p3: ""POSIT"" (P-O-S-I-T), also ""COSIT"" but C eliminated? ""LOSIT"" not word? ""DOSIT"" not? ""QOSIT"" not?

But ""POSIT"" uses P,O,S,I,T? Also the letter P is not eliminated.

So two primary possibilities: 
1. SOFIT 
2. POSIT 

But note: we may also consider the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? For instance, if the secret word is ""FOIST"" but F-O-I-S-T? Then positions: 
- If secret word: F O I S T
- Our feedback: 
  - MOIST: M (wrong) -> M not present? It would get ✓ for O (at 2): O at position 2 -> correct. Then I at position 3? But in MOIST we put I at 3? And the secret has I at 3? Then it should be marked ✓? But the feedback for I was ""-""? So that means that I is present but not at position 3? But if secret has I at 3, then it should be ✓? So not? Therefore, the secret word cannot have I at position 3? So ""FOIST"" has I at position 3? So it would be marked correctly? But in MOIST we had I at 3 and got ""-"", meaning it's not correct? So that letter is not I? Therefore, secret cannot be ""FOIST""? Because at position 3 it must not be I? 

Hence, for subcase S at p3: we have position 1: ?, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> so likely ""POSIT"".

Similarly, for S at p1: ""SOFIT"".

Now, both words avoid eliminated letters? 
For SOFIT: S, O, F, I, T -> letters: S,O,F,I,T -> no C,R,A,N,E,M? Good.
For POSIT: P,O,S,I,T -> no C,R,A,N,E,M? Good.

Now, we need to test? We can make a guess that covers both? The differences are the first letter and the third letter? But we know position 2=O and 5=T.

We can ask: what is the letter at position 1? In SOFIT, it is S? In POSIT, it is P? And position 3: in SOFIT it is F? In POSIT it is S? But we already know S is in the word? And we are trying to place it? In POSIT, S is at position 3? But we don't know if it's at 3 or 1? 

A good guess is to pick one? We have 4 guesses left? And we can try SOFIT? Or POSIT? Either one? But if it's not that, we can try the other? 

We can also pick a third word that can help? But that might be more efficient? For example, choose a word that has P or F? And distinguishes the positions?

Suppose we choose a word that has P and F? But we don't know? 

Another option: choose a word that has the letter at position 1 and position 3 tested.

We can choose ""SPOIT""? But invalid? 

But our goal is to guess the secret word? So let's try one? Since SOFIT is less common? We can try POSIT first? Or SOFIT? 

Alternatively, to maximize information: 
- Since we know O and T are fixed? We don't need to repeat? But we should include O and T to get feedback on their positions again? But we know they are fixed? So we can omit? 

But to test the pattern: suppose we guess ""POSIT"": 
- If the word is ""POSIT"", we win.
- If wrong, then maybe it gives feedback: 
  - For P: if P is not in the word, then we know it's SOFIT? But if P is in the word, then...?

But also, note that ""SOFIT"" starts with S. If the secret word starts with S? So we can choose a word that does not necessarily match? 

We can choose ""SPITE"": but eliminated letters? E eliminated? Not? 

So let me choose ""POSIT"" as a guess? 

Or ""SOFIT""? 

But to save guesses, we can try ""POSIT"". Why POSIT? Because POSIT is a common word? 

Also, note that SOFIT has F? Which is less common? 

I'll go with ""POSIT"". 

So our guess: POSIT.

But check: if secret word is ""POSIT"": 
- P-O-S-I-T -> feedback: 
  - Compared to secret POSIT: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) I(✓) T(✓) -> Win.

If secret word is ""SOFIT"": 
- POSIT vs SOFIT: 
  - P: at position 1: in SOFIT, position 1 is S -> so P not in word? Actually, secret ""SOFIT"" has S,O,F,I,T -> no P? So in guess POSIT: 
     - P: not in word -> x? 
     - O: at position 2: matches -> ✓? 
     - S: at position 3: in secret, there is S at position 1? But position 3: in SOFIT is F, so S not at position 3? But S is in the word (at position 1)? So feedback for S: -? 
     - I: at position 4: matches ✓? 
     - T: at position 5: matches ✓? 
  So feedback: P(x) O(✓) S(- I(✓) T(✓)

Thus, if we get that feedback, we know the secret must be SOFIT? So we can guess next.

Therefore, by guessing POSIT, we can either win or get enough information.

We must also consider other words? Are there others? 

Is there a word like ""TOILS""? But T at position 1? And we know T is fixed at position 5? And in this guess, we want to place O at 2? So let's stick to the above.

So next guess: POSIT.

But we can also design a guess that tests both S and F? For example, guess ""SOFIT"" directly?  Then:
- If secret is SOFIT: win? 
- If secret is POSIT: then feedback S(-) because in POSIT, S is at position 3? But we guess S at 1? So: 
  SOFIT vs POSIT:
    S at 1: secret has S at position 3 -> so S present but wrong position? So S(-) for position 1?
    O at 2: ✓
    F at 3: secret POSIT has O at 2? Then S at 3? So F not present? So F(x)
    I at 4: secret has I at 4? So ✓
    T at 5: ✓
  Feedback: S(-) O(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(✓)

Then we know the secret must be POSIT? 

So either choice is good? Then guess POSIT.

Alternatively, we can choose a different word that may test more letters? But we have avoided many letters? Only 16 allowed? And we're trying this.

Therefore, I will guess ""POSIT"".
</think>
From the feedback:
- Guess 1: CRANE → all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- Guess 2: MOIST → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(-), S(-), T(✓). This means:
  - O is in the word and at position 2 (correct position).
  - T is in the word and at position 5 (correct position).
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (wrong position).
  - S is in the word but not at position 4 (wrong position).
  - M is absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has positions 2 and 5 fixed as O and T: [_ , O, _, _, T].
- I must be at position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be at position 3, and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- S must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 4, and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M. Allowed letters include B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given the constraints, possible word structures include:
  - S at position 1 + I at position 4: pattern [S, O, ?, I, T] (e.g., SOFIT).
  - S at position 3 + I at position 4: pattern [?, O, S, I, T] (e.g., POSIT).

To test these possibilities efficiently, ""POSIT"" is guessed because:
- If correct, it wins immediately.
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or refute key placements:
  - If P is absent (x) and S receives (-), it strongly supports SOFIT.
  - Other feedback patterns will provide positional clarity for S and I.

<guess>POSIT</guess>",POSIT,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word (all marked x). So secret word has none of these.
2. MOIST: Feedback:
   M(x) -> M not in the word
   O(✓) -> O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since MOIST: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T)
   I(-) -> I is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But wait, positions: the word is indexed 1-5, and we only know it's not at position 3. Also note that the secret word has I, but not at position 3.
   S(-) -> S is in the word but not in position 4 (position: in MOIST, S is at index 4). So S is present but not at index 4.
   T(✓) -> T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

Summary:
- Known letters: O, I, S, T are in the word (from MOIST), but M is not (since x).
- Positions: 
  - O must be at position 2 (since ✓ in position 2).
  - T must be at position 5 (since ✓ in position 5).
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O and position 5 is T, so I cannot be there? Wait, the word has 5 positions. Position 2 is O (fixed), position 5 is T (fixed). So I must be at position 1 or 4? And S must be in the word but not at position 4. Also note that I and S are both present and must be placed correctly.

But wait, the secret word:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: T
- I is present but not at position 3 -> so it can be at position 1 or 4.
- S is present but not at position 4 -> so S must be at position 1 or 3? Because position 2 and 5 are taken. Only positions 1,3,4 left? Actually, the positions are:
  1: must be I or S? or something else? But note, we don't know position 1 and 3 and 4 yet.

But also, we know that S cannot be at position 4 (because in MOIST it was at 4 and marked -). Similarly, I cannot be at position 3.

Moreover, we have eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M. So we cannot use any of these.

Now, let's list all letters that are not eliminated: 
Alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,E,M -> B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we know the secret word contains: O (at pos2), I (somewhere, not pos3), S (somewhere, not pos4), T (at pos5). And there is one more letter (since 5-letter word: positions 1,2,3,4,5; 2 and 5 fixed, so 1,3,4 are unknown, but two of them are I and S, and one is a new letter?).

The secret word form: 
  Position: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Known: 
      2: O
      5: T
      And the word has I and S, but they cannot be at position 3 (for I) and position 4 (for S). So I must be at 1 or 4, and S must be at 1 or 3? But wait, if S is at 3, that's possible? Because in MOIST, S was at 4 and was wrong, but it could be at 3. Similarly, I cannot be at 3, so it must be at 1 or 4.

But note: if I is at position 4, then S could be at position 1 or 3. But we have an additional letter? The secret word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have O at 2, T at 5, and letters at 1,3,4. But the word has I and S, and one more letter (since we guessed two letters correctly, but we have I and S that are present in the word, but we don't know the third? Actually, in MOIST we introduced M (which is absent), and O,I,S,T are present? But O and T are fixed, I and S are present but misplaced. So the word also has one more letter? 

Actually, the word must have exactly 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case we don't know if there are duplicates. But in the feedback, we only know that I and S are present but not at those positions. And M is absent. So the secret word contains O (pos2), T (pos5), I (elsewhere), S (elsewhere), and one more letter at the remaining position? 

Let me denote the secret word as: [ p1, O, p3, p4, T ]

We know p1, p3, p4 are letters to be guessed. Among these three, one is I (but not at p3, because I was at position 3 in MOIST and marked -, meaning it's not there). In MOIST, I was at position 3 and we got - (meaning present but wrong position). So I cannot be at p3. Therefore, I must be at p1 or p4.

Similarly, S was at position 4 in MOIST and got - (present but wrong position), so S cannot be at p4? But wait, in the secret word, position 4 is p4. So S cannot be at p4.

Therefore:
  I must be at p1 or p4, but cannot be at p3 (already known) or p5? But p5 is T, fixed. Similarly, S must be at p1, p3? or p3? Because p4 is not allowed for S? But note: S was at position 4 in the guess and we got -, meaning that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. So S must be at p1 or p3? Because p2 is O, fixed, p5 is T, fixed. 

But note: if S were at p3, that would be acceptable? Yes, because in the guess MOIST we put S at position 4, but if it's actually at position 3, then that would get marked as - (wrong position) for S? Actually, the feedback for S was -, meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. It could be at p1 or p3.

Similarly, I is in the word but not at p3? And p3 is the third position.

Therefore:
- Position p1: could be I or S or a new letter? But note, we must assign I to p1 or p4, and S to p1 or p3? And p3 cannot be I? 

But if we assign S to p1, then I must be at p4? Because I cannot be at p3? Similarly, if S is at p3, then I must be at p1 or p4? But also, we have p3: if S is at p3, then that's fine, but if not, then p3 must be a new letter.

We also have the constraint that the third letter (p3) cannot be I? Because I was at position 3 and got -, so p3 is not I.

So let me create cases:

Case 1: I is at p1.
Case 2: I is at p4.

Similarly, S must be at p1 or p3? But if we are in Case 1: I is at p1, then S cannot be at p1 because distinct? But wait, the word can have duplicate letters? But in the feedback, we don't know. It's possible? However, let's assume without duplicates? Because MOIST has distinct letters, and in the secret word, we don't know. But in Wordle rules, duplicates are allowed? Actually, the rules don't specify, but typically you can have duplicate letters? Though in the example, it was BRISK, distinct. But to be safe, we assume duplicates are possible? However, in standard Wordle, words may have duplicate letters? So we must consider? But to simplify, initially assume distinct?

But in this feedback, we know that O and T are fixed at positions 2 and 5. We have I and S present. And we have three positions: p1, p3, p4. We must place I, S, and one more letter? Because the word must have five letters? And if we place I in p1 and S in p3, then p4 is a new letter? Or if we place I in p1 and S in p4, but S cannot be at p4? So that is impossible? Because S cannot be at p4 (because of feedback from MOIST).

Therefore, in Case 1 (I at p1):
  S cannot be at p4 -> so S must be at p3? Because p1 is taken by I, so S must be at p3? Then p4 must be a new letter, say X.

Then word: [ I, O, S, X, T ]? But wait, I is at p1, but we said I is at p1? Then S at p3. And p4 is new letter. But we know S was at position 4 in the guess and got -, meaning that in the secret word, S is not at position 4? But if we put S at p3, then that's okay? And for p4 we have a new letter? So the word: I O S X T? Then we have X must be a letter not eliminated.

But wait, we have:
  Position: 1: I (from assigning)
            2: O (known)
            3: S (from assigning) -> but is this possible? Then S is at p3? And we have feedback that S was at position 4 in the guess and that position was marked ""-"" meaning S is in the word but not at position 4? That does not prevent S from being at p3? So okay.

Similarly, Case 2 (I at p4):
  Then S must be at p1 or p3? But if I is at p4, then we cannot put S at p4? Therefore, S at p1 or p3? Then:
  If S at p1: then word starts with S, then O, then p3 must be a new letter (not I, not S), then I at p4, T at 5: [ S, O, ?, I, T ]
  Or if S at p3: then [ ?, O, S, I, T ] -> but I is at p4.

Now, note that in Case 1: word would be of form I O S * T? Then the last letter is T, so: I O S ? T. Then the pattern is: _ O _ _ T, but then positions: 1:I, 2:O, 3:S, 4:?, 5:T -> so the word might be like ""IOS?T"" but that is position 1=I, 2=O, 3=S, 4=?, 5=T.

For Case 2a: S at p1: [ S, O, ?, I, T ] -> so ""SO?IT""
For Case 2b: S at p3: [ ?, O, S, I, T ] -> so ""?OSIT""

Now, we have to think about possible words.

But we don't know which case? We need a word to test.

Also, we have eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M. So the remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, we need to guess a word that will help us distinguish these cases.

We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

We know that position 2 is O, position 5 is T.

Our guess must include the known letters appropriately? But we can include O and T? But we know they are fixed? Actually, we can, but must put O at position 2 and T at position 5? To confirm? But we already know they are fixed? Or we can move them? But the feedback will tell us?

We should avoid using eliminated letters: so no C,R,A,N,E,M.

We also know that I and S are in the word, so we should include them? But we don't know their positions.

Therefore, we can try a word that has:
- Position 2: O (to confirm it's still there) -> optional? Actually, we already have it fixed? But if we change, then if it's still there we get ✓ again? But we know it's fixed? Actually, the feedback rules say that if we put a letter in the correct position again, it will show ✓? So we should avoid? Or we can use? Actually, to maximize information about other positions, we might avoid repeating known fixed letters? But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, we have 4 left? Wait, the game allows 6 tries? So we have 4 left.

Alternatively, we can try to cover the possibilities:

Option: make a guess that has I and S, but at different positions to test.

For example, we can guess a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3? Or I at position 4 and S at position 1, etc.

But we also need to include only allowed letters.

Let me brainstorm words:

Case 1 pattern: I O ? S T? But wait, in Case 1 we have [I, O, S, ?, T] -> so the middle letter is actually at position 4, so the word is I O S ? T? Is that a word? For example, ""IOST"" is not complete.

Actually, we don't know? We need to find words that fit the patterns.

For Case 1: word of form IOSS?T? No, we don't know. But we have position 1=I, 2=O, 3=S, 4=?, 5=T.

What words: ""IOST"" must be filled? Not many? ""IOIST"" duplicate? Invalid? No, not distinct? In English, is there a word? How about ""JOIST"": J-O-I-S-T? But wait, that would have J at 1, not I? Form: if the word has I at 1 and S at 3: such as ""IO S ? T"" -> but there aren't many? ""IOSIT"" isn't a word? Or?

Perhaps Case 1 is less likely? Because the word must be a valid English word. Words that start with ""IOS"" are rare? Like ""iosif"" not English? We know: joist, moist, hoist? But in our case, if we have position 1=I, 2=O, 3=S, 4=?, 5=T. Then the word would be like IO?ST? But with four letters? Wait: I O S ? T -> the word has 5: I-O-S-?-T. What word ends with ""ST"" and has I at start? None? So maybe Case 1 is impossible? Because it would require a word ""I?S?T"" but with O at 2? Specifically: positions: 
1: I
2: O
3: S
4: ? 
5: T -> word = I O S ? T

The word must be like ""IOST"" + letter? And not many? Actually, ""joist"" is J-O-I-S-T, so it has O at 2, I at 3, S at 4? Wait, ""joist"": positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. But in our case we have I at position 1? That's impossible? So ""joist"" has J at 1, not I? And it has I at 3? But we are asking for I at 1? Which would be word: I at position 1, O at 2, S at 3? Then ending: ""OST"" but ending with T? 

For instance: the word ""GHOST"": G-H-O-S-T -> but that's not I at 1? Or ""HOSTS"" duplicates? Or ""MOSTS"" duplicates? It doesn't have I at 1? And we already know I is in the word? But the word with pattern I O S ? T? It doesn't exist? Like ""ios"" are only really in words like ""ios"", not English? So Case 1 is very unlikely? 

Therefore, probably Case 1 is not possible? So I must be at position 4? Therefore, Case 2.

So Case 2: I at p4 (position 4). Then S can be at p1 or p3? And p1 and p3 are letter positions? Also, p3 cannot be I (as we know? Because in MOIST I was at p3 and feedback said it was present but wrong position? Actually, in secret word, I is not at p3? So S at p1: [S, O, ?, I, T] or S at p3: [?, O, S, I, T]

Now, possible words:

First subcase: S at p1 -> ""S O ? I T"" -> word: S O * I T? Like ""SPOIT""? Only valid five-letter words: ""spoilt""? But spoilt: S-P-O-I-L-T? 6 letters? Not 5. ""Squit"": S-Q-U-I-T? That has U at position 3.

""Suite"": S-U-I-T-E, but E is eliminated? So not possible? ""Skint"": S-K-I-N-T? N is eliminated? ""Shift"": S-H-I-F-T? That has O? Not? Without O? But we have O fixed at position 2? So must be S followed by O at position 2? So: ""S O ? I T"" -> like ""SOFIT""? Which is a word? Also ""SOLIT""? But we must avoid eliminated letters? Currently eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M.

Words like:
- ""SOBIT"": not a word?
- ""SODIT"": not? 
- ""SOFIT"": valid? It means a type of recess? Yes, acceptable.
- ""SOHIT"": not?
- ""SOLIT"": not a word? Solitary?
- ""SONIT"": but N eliminated? 
- ""SOUIT"": not common? 
- ""SOWIT"": not?
- ""SOPIT"": not?
- ""SORIT"": not? And R is eliminated? R is eliminated? No, R was eliminated? In guess 1, R was marked x? So R cannot be used? Therefore, no words? Unless ""SOFIT"" or others? 

But let me think: if S at p1 and I at p4, then pattern ""S O ? I T""? Also ""SO?IT"", so the third letter? Must be a letter? 

Common words: Maybe ""SPOIT"" not? ""SUIT"" is 4 letters? 

Perhaps ""SOULT"": S-O-U-L-T? But that doesn't have I? We must have I? Because I is in the word? And in this pattern, I is at position 4? So the word must have I at position 4? So ""SO?IT"", with the I at position 4? So the letter at position 3 must be the third letter? And word: S O letter1 letter2 T? But with that pattern? Typically, it would be like ""S O X Y T"" but we know positions: 
1: S
2: O
3: ? (call it X)
4: I 
5: T

So word: S O X I T? What X? Allowed letters? And must be a word? For example: ""SOLIT"": S-O-L-I-T -> yes, that is a word? Actually, ""SOLIT"" isn't common? But ""solitary"" is longer? Or ""split"" is S-P-L-I-T, but without O?

Another: ""SPLIT"": S-P-L-I-T -> but position 2 must be O, so wrong? Here the pattern is fixed: second letter O? So ""S O ? I T"". 

Valid word: ""SOFIT"" (which is a real word: an architectural term). Also known: no? Maybe ""SUINT"" but U at position 3 and N? N eliminated? Not possible? Or ""SPRIT"" has R? R eliminated? ""STOIT"" not? 

What about ""SHIFT""? S-H-I-F-T -> but then: 
- Position: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:F, 5:T -> that's ""SHIFT"", but we need O at position 2? So impossible? 

Therefore, to have O at position 2, and S at 1, I at 4, T at 5: words: 
- ""SOFIT"": S-O-F-I-T? 
- ""SPOIT""? Not a word? 
- ""SOJIT""? Not? 

Other? ""BOSIT""? Not? 

Perhaps it's easier to consider the other subcase: S at position 3, and I at position 4: pattern: [ ? , O, S, I, T ] -> ? O S I T? 

Letters: position 1 must be a letter, and positions: 1: unknown, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T.

Then words: 
- ""HOSIT""? Not?
- ""MOSIT""? But M is eliminated? 
- ""DOSIT""? Not?
- ""POSIT"": P-O-S-I-T? Yes, that's a valid word? Meaning to assume?
- ""KOSIT""? 
- ""FOIST"": F-O-I-S-T? But we have I at position 3? But in this pattern, position 3 is S? So ""FOIST"" has I at position 3, not S? So wrong pattern? 

The pattern is: ? O S I T? So ""P O S I T""? That's ""posit"" (meaning: to put forward as fact). Also, ""joist"" is J-O-I-S-T, which has I at 3 and S at 4? Not S at 3? 

Other words: ""rosit"" not? And R eliminated? ""losit"" not? 

But ""posit"" is valid? Also ""coset"" has E? Eliminated? ""cost"" not long? 

Another: ""gossit""? Not? 

Perhaps ""posit"" or ""bosit""? Not? 

But also, ""boost"" has two O's? Not? And T at the end? But ends with T: B-O-O-S-T? That's 5: B,O,O,S,T -> but that has O at position 2 and 3? However, in our pattern we need S at position 3? So ""boost"" has O at 3? Not S? So not.

The word ""posit"" fits: P-O-S-I-T? Yes? 

Similarly, ""joint"": J-O-I-N-T? But N is eliminated? 

So the candidates are:
- Subcase S at p1: ""SOFIT"" (S-O-F-I-T)
- Subcase S at p3: ""POSIT"" (P-O-S-I-T), also ""COSIT"" but C eliminated? ""LOSIT"" not word? ""DOSIT"" not? ""QOSIT"" not?

But ""POSIT"" uses P,O,S,I,T? Also the letter P is not eliminated.

So two primary possibilities: 
1. SOFIT 
2. POSIT 

But note: we may also consider the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? For instance, if the secret word is ""FOIST"" but F-O-I-S-T? Then positions: 
- If secret word: F O I S T
- Our feedback: 
  - MOIST: M (wrong) -> M not present? It would get ✓ for O (at 2): O at position 2 -> correct. Then I at position 3? But in MOIST we put I at 3? And the secret has I at 3? Then it should be marked ✓? But the feedback for I was ""-""? So that means that I is present but not at position 3? But if secret has I at 3, then it should be ✓? So not? Therefore, the secret word cannot have I at position 3? So ""FOIST"" has I at position 3? So it would be marked correctly? But in MOIST we had I at 3 and got ""-"", meaning it's not correct? So that letter is not I? Therefore, secret cannot be ""FOIST""? Because at position 3 it must not be I? 

Hence, for subcase S at p3: we have position 1: ?, 2:O, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> so likely ""POSIT"".

Similarly, for S at p1: ""SOFIT"".

Now, both words avoid eliminated letters? 
For SOFIT: S, O, F, I, T -> letters: S,O,F,I,T -> no C,R,A,N,E,M? Good.
For POSIT: P,O,S,I,T -> no C,R,A,N,E,M? Good.

Now, we need to test? We can make a guess that covers both? The differences are the first letter and the third letter? But we know position 2=O and 5=T.

We can ask: what is the letter at position 1? In SOFIT, it is S? In POSIT, it is P? And position 3: in SOFIT it is F? In POSIT it is S? But we already know S is in the word? And we are trying to place it? In POSIT, S is at position 3? But we don't know if it's at 3 or 1? 

A good guess is to pick one? We have 4 guesses left? And we can try SOFIT? Or POSIT? Either one? But if it's not that, we can try the other? 

We can also pick a third word that can help? But that might be more efficient? For example, choose a word that has P or F? And distinguishes the positions?

Suppose we choose a word that has P and F? But we don't know? 

Another option: choose a word that has the letter at position 1 and position 3 tested.

We can choose ""SPOIT""? But invalid? 

But our goal is to guess the secret word? So let's try one? Since SOFIT is less common? We can try POSIT first? Or SOFIT? 

Alternatively, to maximize information: 
- Since we know O and T are fixed? We don't need to repeat? But we should include O and T to get feedback on their positions again? But we know they are fixed? So we can omit? 

But to test the pattern: suppose we guess ""POSIT"": 
- If the word is ""POSIT"", we win.
- If wrong, then maybe it gives feedback: 
  - For P: if P is not in the word, then we know it's SOFIT? But if P is in the word, then...?

But also, note that ""SOFIT"" starts with S. If the secret word starts with S? So we can choose a word that does not necessarily match? 

We can choose ""SPITE"": but eliminated letters? E eliminated? Not? 

So let me choose ""POSIT"" as a guess? 

Or ""SOFIT""? 

But to save guesses, we can try ""POSIT"". Why POSIT? Because POSIT is a common word? 

Also, note that SOFIT has F? Which is less common? 

I'll go with ""POSIT"". 

So our guess: POSIT.

But check: if secret word is ""POSIT"": 
- P-O-S-I-T -> feedback: 
  - Compared to secret POSIT: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) I(✓) T(✓) -> Win.

If secret word is ""SOFIT"": 
- POSIT vs SOFIT: 
  - P: at position 1: in SOFIT, position 1 is S -> so P not in word? Actually, secret ""SOFIT"" has S,O,F,I,T -> no P? So in guess POSIT: 
     - P: not in word -> x? 
     - O: at position 2: matches -> ✓? 
     - S: at position 3: in secret, there is S at position 1? But position 3: in SOFIT is F, so S not at position 3? But S is in the word (at position 1)? So feedback for S: -? 
     - I: at position 4: matches ✓? 
     - T: at position 5: matches ✓? 
  So feedback: P(x) O(✓) S(- I(✓) T(✓)

Thus, if we get that feedback, we know the secret must be SOFIT? So we can guess next.

Therefore, by guessing POSIT, we can either win or get enough information.

We must also consider other words? Are there others? 

Is there a word like ""TOILS""? But T at position 1? And we know T is fixed at position 5? And in this guess, we want to place O at 2? So let's stick to the above.

So next guess: POSIT.

But we can also design a guess that tests both S and F? For example, guess ""SOFIT"" directly?  Then:
- If secret is SOFIT: win? 
- If secret is POSIT: then feedback S(-) because in POSIT, S is at position 3? But we guess S at 1? So: 
  SOFIT vs POSIT:
    S at 1: secret has S at position 3 -> so S present but wrong position? So S(-) for position 1?
    O at 2: ✓
    F at 3: secret POSIT has O at 2? Then S at 3? So F not present? So F(x)
    I at 4: secret has I at 4? So ✓
    T at 5: ✓
  Feedback: S(-) O(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(✓)

Then we know the secret must be POSIT? 

So either choice is good? Then guess POSIT.

Alternatively, we can choose a different word that may test more letters? But we have avoided many letters? Only 16 allowed? And we're trying this.

Therefore, I will guess ""POSIT"".From the feedback:
- Guess 1: CRANE → all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- Guess 2: MOIST → Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(-), S(-), T(✓). This means:
  - O is in the word and at position 2 (correct position).
  - T is in the word and at position 5 (correct position).
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (wrong position).
  - S is in the word but not at position 4 (wrong position).
  - M is absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has positions 2 and 5 fixed as O and T: [_ , O, _, _, T].
- I must be at position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be at position 3, and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- S must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 4, and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M. Allowed letters include B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given the constraints, possible word structures include:
  - S at position 1 + I at position 4: pattern [S, O, ?, I, T] (e.g., SOFIT).
  - S at position 3 + I at position 4: pattern [?, O, S, I, T] (e.g., POSIT).

To test these possibilities efficiently, ""POSIT"" is guessed because:
- If correct, it wins immediately.
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or refute key placements:
  - If P is absent (x) and S receives (-), it strongly supports SOFIT.
  - Other feedback patterns will provide positional clarity for S and I.",Guess 3: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) I(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
