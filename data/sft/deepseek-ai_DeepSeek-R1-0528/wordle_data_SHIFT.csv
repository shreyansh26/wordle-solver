Alright, let's tackle this Wordle-like game. It's my first guess, so I don't have any prior feedback to go on. I need to pick a 5-letter word that maximizes the information I can get. 

I recall that in word games, starting with words that have a lot of common vowels and consonants helps narrow down possibilities quickly. Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they cover frequent letters. 

Considering letter frequencies in English: vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, N, L are common. So a word that includes several of these would give better feedback. 

Looking at ""CRANE"": it has C, R, A, N, E. That gives me three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (R, N), plus C which is moderately common. Alternatives like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) also seem strong, but let's stick with ""CRANE"" for now—it's a classic opener.

After this guess, the feedback will tell me which letters are correct or present, helping me adjust my next guess. For instance:
- If any letters are ✓, I'll know some positions.
- If any are -, I'll know they exist elsewhere.
- If any are x, I can exclude them.

So ""CRANE"" feels like a solid start to gather broad initial data.

I need to make my first guess without any prior feedback. A good starting word should include common letters and vowels to maximize information. Based on letter frequency in English, words with R, S, T, L, N, E, or A are strategic. I'll choose **CRANE** because it contains:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Distinct letters (no duplicates) to test more possibilities

After guessing ""CRANE"", the feedback will reveal which letters are in the word and/or correctly positioned, helping narrow down the next guess.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means none of these letters are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" are present, we need to choose a word that uses other common letters. Let's think about English letter frequencies.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the next most common consonants are T, L, S, D, M, etc., and vowels O, I, U.

 A good second guess should cover as many new frequent letters as possible. We also have to avoid the excluded letters.

 Possible vowels to include: O, I, U (since A and E are out)
 Common consonants: T, L, S, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word like ""TOILS"" but note that S is common. Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a popular choice, but we must check the letters.

 However, note that ""crane"" had R and N which are excluded, so ""moist"" has M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the excluded list? Let's check: M not excluded, O not excluded, I not excluded, S not excluded, T not excluded.

 Since feedback for ""crane"" showed all letters absent, we can safely use any of these.

 Another option is ""PILOT"" but that has P, I, L, O, T. L is also a common letter. However, ""moist"" covers M, O, I, S, T which are among the top frequencies remaining.

 But note: We must avoid C, R, A, N, E. So M, O, I, S, T are all allowed.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it contains two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), and these are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""TULIP"" might be another option but U is less common. So ""MOIST"" seems better.

 Let me check if ""MOIST"" is a valid word: yes, it means damp or having moisture.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""moist"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane,"" which showed that **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**, I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. This means the secret word contains none of these 5 letters.

### Strategy for the second guess:
1. **Excluded letters**: Avoid C, R, A, N, E.
2. **New letter coverage**: Focus on high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common consonants like T, L, S, D, M and vowels like O, I, U are strong candidates.
3. **Balanced word choice**: Opt for a word with diverse letters to maximize information gain about the secret word's composition.

A good candidate is **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses **M, O, I, S, T**—all new letters not excluded by the first guess.
- Together, these letters cover 3 common consonants (M, S, T) and 2 vowels (O, I).
- It's a valid English word and will provide broad feedback to narrow down possibilities further.

So ""MOIST"" seems better.\n\n Let me check if ""MOIST"" is a valid word: yes, it means damp or having moisture.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess ""moist"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane,"" which showed that **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**, I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. This means the secret word contains none of these 5 letters.\n\n### Strategy for the second guess:\n1. **Excluded letters**: Avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n2. **New letter coverage**: Focus on high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common consonants like T, L, S, D, M and vowels like O, I, U are strong candidates.\n3. **Balanced word choice**: Opt for a word with diverse letters to maximize information gain about the secret word\'s composition.\n\nA good candidate is **""MOIST""** because:\n- It uses **M, O, I, S, T**—all new letters not excluded by the first guess.\n- Together, these letters cover 3 common consonants (M, S, T) and 2 vowels (O, I).\n- It\'s a valid English word and will provide broad feedback to narrow down possibilities further.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Let's analyze the feedback from both guesses step by step.

First, from Guess 1: crane -> all letters are incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word). So the secret word has none of these letters.

Now, Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(✓)

Breakdown:
- M(x) -> M is not in the word.
- O(x) -> O is not in the word.
- I(✓) -> I is in the word and in the correct position. Since I was the third letter in ""moist"", the third letter of the secret word is I.
- S(-) -> S is in the word but not in the fourth position (where it was guessed). So S is in the secret word, but must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).
- T(✓) -> T is in the word and in the correct position. T was the fifth letter, so the fifth letter of the secret word is T.

Summary so far:
- The third letter is I.
- The fifth letter is T.
- S is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 2.
- Position 4 can't be S, and we know from feedback that S is present.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O must not be in the word.

Positions:
Position 1: ? (unknown, not S? Not yet fixed)
Position 2: ? (unknown, could be S?)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: ? (unknown, not S)
Position 5: T (fixed)

And S is somewhere, but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

Available information:
- Secret word: _ _ I _ T
- S is in position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O

Letters that could be used: Since S is confirmed, and we need to fill other positions. Also, all letters must not be from the excluded list.

Possible letters: After excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O, the remaining letters are:
Vowels: I,U (I is already used, but could be elsewhere? Wait, I is already in position 3, but the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show duplicates, so we should assume letters are not duplicated unless indicated. But S might appear elsewhere? Wait, in ""moist"", S was only once, and it got - , so S is present once, and not in pos 4.

Similarly, I was ✓, so only one I? Not necessarily, but for now, we assume no duplicates until forced otherwise.

Standard strategy is to consider letter frequencies remaining.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (U is vowel/consonant?)

But S is already in.

Since S must be in position 1 or 2.

Let me try to list possible words that fit _ _ I _ T, with S in position 1 or 2.

Case 1: S in position 1: then word is S _ I _ T

Case 2: S in position 2: then word is _ S I _ T

Now, unknown positions: for case 1, need second and fourth letter; for case 2, need first and fourth letter.

All must be from unused letters.

Unused letters not in excluded list. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O

So available: B,D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But S and T are used; T is fixed in position 5, S is fixed in position 1 or 2.

Other letters like Q,X,Z are rare; probable common letters left.

Common English letters left: L,U,D,P,B,F,G,H,K,J, etc., but G and H are available since not excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O – so G,H are available.

List of available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And S,T,I are used but might be reused if duplicated? Probably not duplicated for now.

Since I is in position 3, and not necessarily duplicated.

Similarly for T.

For the next guess, my goal is to test possible positions for S and find other letters.

I could guess a word that places S in position 1 or 2 to confirm.

For example, if I put S in position 1, and choose common letters for others.

But position 4 needs to be guessed.

Possible guesses:

Let me think of words that end with IT or something.

The secret word ends with IT? Position 4 and 5: ? T, so not necessarily IT.

Fifth is T, so last two could be IT or not.

Common words: for S _ I _ T, could be SKILL? S K I L L, but L might be duplicated, and S is in first, which is good. But we have feedback only one S indicated? In ""moist"", S was at fourth and got -, so if there were two S, it might not show, but we don't know.

Possibly the word has one S.

SKILT? Not common.

SHIRT? But H is allowed, R is excluded – R is in excluded list.

R is excluded from guess 1.

R not in word.

Similarly, words like SPIT: S P I T – but only 4 letters, need 5 letters.

SPITS? But ends with S, but position 5 is T, not S.

Must be _ _ I _ T, so five letters.

Possible words with pattern X Y I Z T.

With S in 1st or 2nd.

Case 1: S in first position: S _ I _ T

Possible words: SWIFT, SKINT, SPLIT – S P L I T, but 4 positions? Split is 5 letters? S-P-L-I-T, so positions:1:S,2:P,3:L? But third is L, not I. We need third position to be I.

Position 3 is fixed to I, so S ? I ? T

So for S in position 1: words like: SMELL? S M E L L, but E is excluded, and third letter E, not I.

No.

VALID? S V I D T? Not word.

Common: SWIFT - S W I F T -> positions:1:S,2:W,3:I,4:F,5:T

Yes.

SKIFF? S K I F F, but last F, ends with F, not T.

Must end with T.

So S ? I ? T ending with T.

Other possibilities: SHIFT - S H I F T -> 1:S,2:H,3:I,4:F,5:T

H and F are possible.

S L I P T? Slip't? Not a word.

BUILT? But S not first.

For S in position 2: words like ? S I ? T

For example, USUAL? U S U A L, not ending with T.

FOCUS? F O C U S, O excluded, not ending with T.

Possible: J S I S T? Not word.

MUSIT? Obscure.

AUDIT? A excluded.

Could be WORST? W O R S T, O excluded, R excluded.

Since O and R excluded.

L S I D T? No.

PSYST? No.

Perhaps words like DAISY? D A I S Y, A excluded, not ending with T.

Not fitting.

Better to consider the second case if S in position 2: _ S I ? T

Possible common words: EXIST – E excluded.

VISIT – V I S I T, but positions: if V in pos 1, S in pos 2? Assume position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: I, position 4: ?, position 5: T

For VISIT: V I S I T -> positions:1:V,2:I,3:S,4:I,5:T – but this has I at position 2 and 4, which might be duplicated. But in ""moist"", I was green at position 3, so if I is duplicated, it might be yellow elsewhere? But in guess 2, for ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got correct (✓), and no other I, so if there is another I, it might not be shown if not guessed.

But in this case, for the word VISIT, if secret is VISIT, then guessing ""moist"" would have:
M vs V: x
O vs I: x?
Position 2 in guess is O, secret position 2 is I? Secret position 2 is I, guess position 2 is O, so O(x) since O not in word? But for VISIT, letters are V,I,S,I,T.

Guess ""moist"": M vs V? M not in VISIT, so (- or x? Since incorrect letter.

Feedback shows:
First letter M: compared to V, not match, M not in word? VISIT has V,I,S,I,T — M not present, so M(x)
Second letter O: compared to I, not match, O not in word, so O(x)
Third letter I: compared to S? Position 3: guess I vs secret S? Secret position 3 is S, guess I, which is different, so I vs S? But I is in the word at position 2 or 4, so it should be yellow (-) for being in wrong position? Not necessarily.

Clarify:
For each position, feedback is based on the letter in that position.
Position 3: guess has I, but secret has S, and S is in position 3, but I is not S. Now, is I in the word? Secret has two I's (positions 2 and 4), so I is in the word. But since position 3 is incorrect and I is present elsewhere, it should be yellow (-) for position 3? But in the feedback example, for ""BRAVE"" vs ""BRISK"", B R matched, A not in word V not in word E not, so A(x) V(x) E(x), but no yellow.

In the initial example: secret BRISK, guess BRAVE: B✓ R✓ A(x) V(x) E(x) because A,V,E not in BRISK.

But for a guess with a correct letter wrong position, like in the first guess STORM vs BRISK: S is in BRISK but not position 1, so S(-).

Similarly, R is in BRISK not position 4, so R(-).

In our case, for ""moist"" feedback: I(✓) means exactly correct position and letter, S(-) means S is in word but not position 4.

If the secret had another I, when guessing ""moist"", position 3 is I which is correct and green, position 4 is S which is wrong position yellow, but if there were another I, say in position 1 or 2, and guess has O at position 2, which might be yellow if I were there? But O is not I, so O(x) if not in word.

Back to possible secret words.

From feedback, we have:
Position 3: I must be I.
Position 5: T must be T.
S is in word, not position 4, and not position 3 (since position 3 is I), so S must be position 1 or 2.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O

Available letters for position 1,2,4.

Position 4 is any letter except S and it must be from available letters.

Also, the word has 5 letters, all must be distinct? Not necessarily, but let's avoid duplicates for now.

Now, for the guess, I should choose a word that has I in position 3, T in position 5, to keep them confirmed.

And put S in position 1 or 2 to test.

For example, if I guess a word with S in position 1, and new letters for others.

Similarly, position 2 and 4 to discover more.

Common ending IT?.

Possible words with _ _ I _ T pattern.

List plausible words:

- If S in position 1: SHIFT (S H I F T), F is available
- SWIFT (S W I F T)
- SKINT (S K I N T), but N excluded, cannot
- SPLIT (S P L I T), but T at end? S P L I T, position 1:S,2:P,3:L? Not I at position 3; position 3 is L in SPLIT, not I.
SPLIT letters: S-P-L-I-T so positions:1:S,2:P,3:L,4:I,5:T — but we need position 3 to be I, so not.

Words with position 3 I and 5 T: for example:
BLIST? Not word
FLINT? F L I N T, N excluded
GLINT? G L I N T, N excl
GUILT? G U I L T, L at position 4
QUILT? Q U I L T
TWIST? T W I S T, S at position 4? Not allowed, S cannot be position 4, and T at position 1.

TWIST:1:T,2:W,3:I,4:S,5:T — position 5 T, but position 5 is T, which matches, but S is at position 4, which the feedback says S not position 4.

Also, T at position 1, duplicated? Possible.

But if secret is TWIST, guess ""moist"": M vs T: how?
Position 1: guess M, secret T, T in word? It's at position 1 and 5? Position 1 secret T, guess M not T, M not in word? TWIST has T,W,I,S,T — M not present, so M(x)
Position 2: guess O vs W, O not in word? O not present, O(x)
Position 3: guess I vs I ✓ match
Position 4: guess S vs S but position 4 secret S, guess S so it should be ✓ but feedback has S(-) which means correct letter wrong position? Contradiction.

For secret TWIST, position 4 is S, guess ""moist"" position 4 is S, so it should be green ✓, but feedback shows S(-) which is yellow for wrong position. Inconsistency, so TWIST cannot be if S is not at position 4.

Similarly, S cannot be at position 4.

Back to possible words with S at 1 or 2.

For S at position 1: SHIFT, SWIFT

For S at position 2: such as USUAL? Not

EXIST: E excluded

JOIST: J O I S T, O excluded

VASTY? Not common.

Better: words like DAILY? Not ending T.

HAPPY? Not.

Perhaps F GIST? Not, GIST is four letters.

With I and T fixed, common words: K I L T S, but ends S.

The word must end with T.

Possible: BUILT - B U I L T, S not present, but we have S in word.
If S not at 1 or 2 in guess, we might miss.

Another word: FLIRT? R excluded.

Perhaps SHIRE? Not ending T.

For S at position 2: words like O S I S T? Osist? No.

PSYST? No.

Valid words: for example, SIGHT? S I G H T, but I at position 2, we need position 3 I.
SIGHT:1:S,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T — position 3 is G, not I.

If secret is SIGHT, guess ""moist"":
Pos1 M vs S: M not in SIGHT? SIGHT has S,I,G,H,T — M not present, M(x)
Pos2 O vs I: guess O, secret I, different, O not in word? Not, O(x)
Pos3 I vs G: I not G, but I is in word at position 2, so it should be yellow? Yes, position 3 guess I vs secret G, incorrect letter, but I is in secret at position 2, so for position 3, it should be I(-) meaning present but wrong position. But in our feedback, for position 3, it was I(✓), green check, which means correct letter and position. For SIGHT, secret position 3 is G, not I, so guess I vs G should be I(-) if I is elsewhere, not green.

But in guess 2, position 3 was I(✓), so it must be that position 3 is I in secret.

Similarly, position 5 guess T vs secret T, green.

So for SIGHT, it would not have position 3 green.

Therefore, secret must have I at position 3.

Similarly, T at 5.

Back to guessing a word.

My next guess should:
- Include I at position 3 (fixed)
- Include T at position 5 (fixed)
- Include S somewhere, but not at position 4 (try position 1 or 2)
- Avoid excluded letters: C R A N E M O
- Use new letters for positions 1,2,4.

Possible guess:
If I put S at position 1: then guess S _ I _ T

Good choices for position 2 and 4 could be common letters like H, U, P, etc.

For example, SHIPT? Not word.
SHIFT: S H I F T – valid word, letters H and F are available.

Similarly, SUITE? SU I T E, E excluded.
SUITE: S U I T E, but E at position 5? Position 4 T? 1:S,2:U,3:I,4:T,5:E — but position 5 should be T? Not, E at position 5, so not SUITE.

S L I T H? Not ending T.

SWIPT? Not word.

Best option: SHIFT or SWIFT.

SWIFT: S W I F T – good.

SHIFT: S H I F T

Both possible.

If S in position 2: then _ S I _ T

Words: PSYST? No
USUAL? Not ending T.
EXIST: E excluded.
BUIST? Uncommon.
DUIST? No.
Perhaps GUEST? G U E S T, E excluded.
JOUST? O excluded.
LIEST? L I E S T, E excluded.
MISTY? M I S T Y, but M excluded, and position 3 is S not I.
MISTY:1:M,2:I,3:S,4:T,5:Y — position 3 secret S, guess position 3 is I in ""moist"" it was position 3 I which is green for secret MISTY? But secret position 3 is S, not I, so it would not be green.

Not fitting.

FAINT? F A I N T, A and N excluded.

Not.

So fewer options for S in position 2, S at position 1 seems more likely.

Also, from common words, SHIFT and SWIFT are good.

Other possibility: SKIFF not ending T.

So for next guess, I can choose SHIFT: which tests if S is at position 1 and H, F in other positions.

Similarly, SWIFT tests W and F.

I think SHIFT is a good guess because it uses common letters.

Position 4: F could be it.

Since S might be at position 1, let's guess that.

Also, in SHIFT, letters: S,H,I,F,T – all possible except S and I,T are fixed.

So guess: SHIFT

With feedback, if S is actually at position 1, it might be green; if not, yellow or something.

If S is at position 1, in secret, then SHIFT will have S at position 1 same, so it could be green if correct.

If secret has S at position 2, then guessing SHIFT will have S at position 1 vs not S position 1, so S(-) position 1 and so on.

Similarly for other letters.

Moreover, it covers the letter H and F.

So let's go with SHIFT.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist → Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(✓)**.
  - **M and O are absent (x)**, so they are not in the word.
  - **I is correct at position 3 (✓)**, meaning the secret word has ""I"" as the third letter.
  - **S is present but in the wrong position (-)**, meaning S is in the word but not at position 4. Given the fixed positions (I at 3, T at 5), S must be in position 1 or 2.
  - **T is correct at position 5 (✓)**, meaning the secret word has ""T"" as the fifth letter.

### Deductions:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O (must not appear in the word).
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 3: ""I""
  - Position 5: ""T""
- **S position**: Must be at position 1 or 2 (since it cannot be at position 4, and positions 3 and 5 are fixed).
- **Available positions**: 
  - Position 1: Could be S or another letter if S is not here.
  - Position 2: Could be S or another letter.
  - Position 4: Any unused letter (not S, and not excluded).
- **Letters to avoid**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.
- **Remaining usable letters**: High-frequency letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, etc.

Given that S needs to be tested at position 1 or 2, and new letters should be introduced for information gain, a strong guess is **SHIFT**:
- **Pattern**: `S _ I _ T` (positions: S at 1, ? at 2, I at 3, ? at 4, T at 5).
- **Why SHIFT?** 
  - Tests S in position 1: If S is correct at position 1, we get green (✓); if S is actually in position 2, we get yellow (-).
  - Uses common new letters: H (position 2) and F (position 4), which are high-frequency and not excluded.
  - Confirms I and T in their fixed positions, maintaining valuable constraints.
  - Avoids excluded letters—C, R, A, N, E, M, O not used.
- **Outcomes**: 
  - If S is green at position 1, it confirms S at position 1, position 4 may be F, and position 2 needs solving.
  - If S is yellow (wrong position), it confirms S must be at position 2.
  - H and F provide clues: Absence (x) eliminates them; presence (-/✓) reveals their positions.

<guess>shift</guess>",shift,"Let's analyze the feedback from both guesses step by step.

First, from Guess 1: crane -> all letters are incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word). So the secret word has none of these letters.

Now, Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(✓)

Breakdown:
- M(x) -> M is not in the word.
- O(x) -> O is not in the word.
- I(✓) -> I is in the word and in the correct position. Since I was the third letter in ""moist"", the third letter of the secret word is I.
- S(-) -> S is in the word but not in the fourth position (where it was guessed). So S is in the secret word, but must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).
- T(✓) -> T is in the word and in the correct position. T was the fifth letter, so the fifth letter of the secret word is T.

Summary so far:
- The third letter is I.
- The fifth letter is T.
- S is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 2.
- Position 4 can't be S, and we know from feedback that S is present.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O must not be in the word.

Positions:
Position 1: ? (unknown, not S? Not yet fixed)
Position 2: ? (unknown, could be S?)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: ? (unknown, not S)
Position 5: T (fixed)

And S is somewhere, but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

Available information:
- Secret word: _ _ I _ T
- S is in position 1 or 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O

Letters that could be used: Since S is confirmed, and we need to fill other positions. Also, all letters must not be from the excluded list.

Possible letters: After excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O, the remaining letters are:
Vowels: I,U (I is already used, but could be elsewhere? Wait, I is already in position 3, but the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show duplicates, so we should assume letters are not duplicated unless indicated. But S might appear elsewhere? Wait, in ""moist"", S was only once, and it got - , so S is present once, and not in pos 4.

Similarly, I was ✓, so only one I? Not necessarily, but for now, we assume no duplicates until forced otherwise.

Standard strategy is to consider letter frequencies remaining.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (U is vowel/consonant?)

But S is already in.

Since S must be in position 1 or 2.

Let me try to list possible words that fit _ _ I _ T, with S in position 1 or 2.

Case 1: S in position 1: then word is S _ I _ T

Case 2: S in position 2: then word is _ S I _ T

Now, unknown positions: for case 1, need second and fourth letter; for case 2, need first and fourth letter.

All must be from unused letters.

Unused letters not in excluded list. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O

So available: B,D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But S and T are used; T is fixed in position 5, S is fixed in position 1 or 2.

Other letters like Q,X,Z are rare; probable common letters left.

Common English letters left: L,U,D,P,B,F,G,H,K,J, etc., but G and H are available since not excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O – so G,H are available.

List of available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And S,T,I are used but might be reused if duplicated? Probably not duplicated for now.

Since I is in position 3, and not necessarily duplicated.

Similarly for T.

For the next guess, my goal is to test possible positions for S and find other letters.

I could guess a word that places S in position 1 or 2 to confirm.

For example, if I put S in position 1, and choose common letters for others.

But position 4 needs to be guessed.

Possible guesses:

Let me think of words that end with IT or something.

The secret word ends with IT? Position 4 and 5: ? T, so not necessarily IT.

Fifth is T, so last two could be IT or not.

Common words: for S _ I _ T, could be SKILL? S K I L L, but L might be duplicated, and S is in first, which is good. But we have feedback only one S indicated? In ""moist"", S was at fourth and got -, so if there were two S, it might not show, but we don't know.

Possibly the word has one S.

SKILT? Not common.

SHIRT? But H is allowed, R is excluded – R is in excluded list.

R is excluded from guess 1.

R not in word.

Similarly, words like SPIT: S P I T – but only 4 letters, need 5 letters.

SPITS? But ends with S, but position 5 is T, not S.

Must be _ _ I _ T, so five letters.

Possible words with pattern X Y I Z T.

With S in 1st or 2nd.

Case 1: S in first position: S _ I _ T

Possible words: SWIFT, SKINT, SPLIT – S P L I T, but 4 positions? Split is 5 letters? S-P-L-I-T, so positions:1:S,2:P,3:L? But third is L, not I. We need third position to be I.

Position 3 is fixed to I, so S ? I ? T

So for S in position 1: words like: SMELL? S M E L L, but E is excluded, and third letter E, not I.

No.

VALID? S V I D T? Not word.

Common: SWIFT - S W I F T -> positions:1:S,2:W,3:I,4:F,5:T

Yes.

SKIFF? S K I F F, but last F, ends with F, not T.

Must end with T.

So S ? I ? T ending with T.

Other possibilities: SHIFT - S H I F T -> 1:S,2:H,3:I,4:F,5:T

H and F are possible.

S L I P T? Slip't? Not a word.

BUILT? But S not first.

For S in position 2: words like ? S I ? T

For example, USUAL? U S U A L, not ending with T.

FOCUS? F O C U S, O excluded, not ending with T.

Possible: J S I S T? Not word.

MUSIT? Obscure.

AUDIT? A excluded.

Could be WORST? W O R S T, O excluded, R excluded.

Since O and R excluded.

L S I D T? No.

PSYST? No.

Perhaps words like DAISY? D A I S Y, A excluded, not ending with T.

Not fitting.

Better to consider the second case if S in position 2: _ S I ? T

Possible common words: EXIST – E excluded.

VISIT – V I S I T, but positions: if V in pos 1, S in pos 2? Assume position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: I, position 4: ?, position 5: T

For VISIT: V I S I T -> positions:1:V,2:I,3:S,4:I,5:T – but this has I at position 2 and 4, which might be duplicated. But in ""moist"", I was green at position 3, so if I is duplicated, it might be yellow elsewhere? But in guess 2, for ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got correct (✓), and no other I, so if there is another I, it might not be shown if not guessed.

But in this case, for the word VISIT, if secret is VISIT, then guessing ""moist"" would have:
M vs V: x
O vs I: x?
Position 2 in guess is O, secret position 2 is I? Secret position 2 is I, guess position 2 is O, so O(x) since O not in word? But for VISIT, letters are V,I,S,I,T.

Guess ""moist"": M vs V? M not in VISIT, so (- or x? Since incorrect letter.

Feedback shows:
First letter M: compared to V, not match, M not in word? VISIT has V,I,S,I,T — M not present, so M(x)
Second letter O: compared to I, not match, O not in word, so O(x)
Third letter I: compared to S? Position 3: guess I vs secret S? Secret position 3 is S, guess I, which is different, so I vs S? But I is in the word at position 2 or 4, so it should be yellow (-) for being in wrong position? Not necessarily.

Clarify:
For each position, feedback is based on the letter in that position.
Position 3: guess has I, but secret has S, and S is in position 3, but I is not S. Now, is I in the word? Secret has two I's (positions 2 and 4), so I is in the word. But since position 3 is incorrect and I is present elsewhere, it should be yellow (-) for position 3? But in the feedback example, for ""BRAVE"" vs ""BRISK"", B R matched, A not in word V not in word E not, so A(x) V(x) E(x), but no yellow.

In the initial example: secret BRISK, guess BRAVE: B✓ R✓ A(x) V(x) E(x) because A,V,E not in BRISK.

But for a guess with a correct letter wrong position, like in the first guess STORM vs BRISK: S is in BRISK but not position 1, so S(-).

Similarly, R is in BRISK not position 4, so R(-).

In our case, for ""moist"" feedback: I(✓) means exactly correct position and letter, S(-) means S is in word but not position 4.

If the secret had another I, when guessing ""moist"", position 3 is I which is correct and green, position 4 is S which is wrong position yellow, but if there were another I, say in position 1 or 2, and guess has O at position 2, which might be yellow if I were there? But O is not I, so O(x) if not in word.

Back to possible secret words.

From feedback, we have:
Position 3: I must be I.
Position 5: T must be T.
S is in word, not position 4, and not position 3 (since position 3 is I), so S must be position 1 or 2.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O

Available letters for position 1,2,4.

Position 4 is any letter except S and it must be from available letters.

Also, the word has 5 letters, all must be distinct? Not necessarily, but let's avoid duplicates for now.

Now, for the guess, I should choose a word that has I in position 3, T in position 5, to keep them confirmed.

And put S in position 1 or 2 to test.

For example, if I guess a word with S in position 1, and new letters for others.

Similarly, position 2 and 4 to discover more.

Common ending IT?.

Possible words with _ _ I _ T pattern.

List plausible words:

- If S in position 1: SHIFT (S H I F T), F is available
- SWIFT (S W I F T)
- SKINT (S K I N T), but N excluded, cannot
- SPLIT (S P L I T), but T at end? S P L I T, position 1:S,2:P,3:L? Not I at position 3; position 3 is L in SPLIT, not I.
SPLIT letters: S-P-L-I-T so positions:1:S,2:P,3:L,4:I,5:T — but we need position 3 to be I, so not.

Words with position 3 I and 5 T: for example:
BLIST? Not word
FLINT? F L I N T, N excluded
GLINT? G L I N T, N excl
GUILT? G U I L T, L at position 4
QUILT? Q U I L T
TWIST? T W I S T, S at position 4? Not allowed, S cannot be position 4, and T at position 1.

TWIST:1:T,2:W,3:I,4:S,5:T — position 5 T, but position 5 is T, which matches, but S is at position 4, which the feedback says S not position 4.

Also, T at position 1, duplicated? Possible.

But if secret is TWIST, guess ""moist"": M vs T: how?
Position 1: guess M, secret T, T in word? It's at position 1 and 5? Position 1 secret T, guess M not T, M not in word? TWIST has T,W,I,S,T — M not present, so M(x)
Position 2: guess O vs W, O not in word? O not present, O(x)
Position 3: guess I vs I ✓ match
Position 4: guess S vs S but position 4 secret S, guess S so it should be ✓ but feedback has S(-) which means correct letter wrong position? Contradiction.

For secret TWIST, position 4 is S, guess ""moist"" position 4 is S, so it should be green ✓, but feedback shows S(-) which is yellow for wrong position. Inconsistency, so TWIST cannot be if S is not at position 4.

Similarly, S cannot be at position 4.

Back to possible words with S at 1 or 2.

For S at position 1: SHIFT, SWIFT

For S at position 2: such as USUAL? Not

EXIST: E excluded

JOIST: J O I S T, O excluded

VASTY? Not common.

Better: words like DAILY? Not ending T.

HAPPY? Not.

Perhaps F GIST? Not, GIST is four letters.

With I and T fixed, common words: K I L T S, but ends S.

The word must end with T.

Possible: BUILT - B U I L T, S not present, but we have S in word.
If S not at 1 or 2 in guess, we might miss.

Another word: FLIRT? R excluded.

Perhaps SHIRE? Not ending T.

For S at position 2: words like O S I S T? Osist? No.

PSYST? No.

Valid words: for example, SIGHT? S I G H T, but I at position 2, we need position 3 I.
SIGHT:1:S,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T — position 3 is G, not I.

If secret is SIGHT, guess ""moist"":
Pos1 M vs S: M not in SIGHT? SIGHT has S,I,G,H,T — M not present, M(x)
Pos2 O vs I: guess O, secret I, different, O not in word? Not, O(x)
Pos3 I vs G: I not G, but I is in word at position 2, so it should be yellow? Yes, position 3 guess I vs secret G, incorrect letter, but I is in secret at position 2, so for position 3, it should be I(-) meaning present but wrong position. But in our feedback, for position 3, it was I(✓), green check, which means correct letter and position. For SIGHT, secret position 3 is G, not I, so guess I vs G should be I(-) if I is elsewhere, not green.

But in guess 2, position 3 was I(✓), so it must be that position 3 is I in secret.

Similarly, position 5 guess T vs secret T, green.

So for SIGHT, it would not have position 3 green.

Therefore, secret must have I at position 3.

Similarly, T at 5.

Back to guessing a word.

My next guess should:
- Include I at position 3 (fixed)
- Include T at position 5 (fixed)
- Include S somewhere, but not at position 4 (try position 1 or 2)
- Avoid excluded letters: C R A N E M O
- Use new letters for positions 1,2,4.

Possible guess:
If I put S at position 1: then guess S _ I _ T

Good choices for position 2 and 4 could be common letters like H, U, P, etc.

For example, SHIPT? Not word.
SHIFT: S H I F T – valid word, letters H and F are available.

Similarly, SUITE? SU I T E, E excluded.
SUITE: S U I T E, but E at position 5? Position 4 T? 1:S,2:U,3:I,4:T,5:E — but position 5 should be T? Not, E at position 5, so not SUITE.

S L I T H? Not ending T.

SWIPT? Not word.

Best option: SHIFT or SWIFT.

SWIFT: S W I F T – good.

SHIFT: S H I F T

Both possible.

If S in position 2: then _ S I _ T

Words: PSYST? No
USUAL? Not ending T.
EXIST: E excluded.
BUIST? Uncommon.
DUIST? No.
Perhaps GUEST? G U E S T, E excluded.
JOUST? O excluded.
LIEST? L I E S T, E excluded.
MISTY? M I S T Y, but M excluded, and position 3 is S not I.
MISTY:1:M,2:I,3:S,4:T,5:Y — position 3 secret S, guess position 3 is I in ""moist"" it was position 3 I which is green for secret MISTY? But secret position 3 is S, not I, so it would not be green.

Not fitting.

FAINT? F A I N T, A and N excluded.

Not.

So fewer options for S in position 2, S at position 1 seems more likely.

Also, from common words, SHIFT and SWIFT are good.

Other possibility: SKIFF not ending T.

So for next guess, I can choose SHIFT: which tests if S is at position 1 and H, F in other positions.

Similarly, SWIFT tests W and F.

I think SHIFT is a good guess because it uses common letters.

Position 4: F could be it.

Since S might be at position 1, let's guess that.

Also, in SHIFT, letters: S,H,I,F,T – all possible except S and I,T are fixed.

So guess: SHIFT

With feedback, if S is actually at position 1, it might be green; if not, yellow or something.

If S is at position 1, in secret, then SHIFT will have S at position 1 same, so it could be green if correct.

If secret has S at position 2, then guessing SHIFT will have S at position 1 vs not S position 1, so S(-) position 1 and so on.

Similarly for other letters.

Moreover, it covers the letter H and F.

So let's go with SHIFT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist → Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(✓)**.
  - **M and O are absent (x)**, so they are not in the word.
  - **I is correct at position 3 (✓)**, meaning the secret word has ""I"" as the third letter.
  - **S is present but in the wrong position (-)**, meaning S is in the word but not at position 4. Given the fixed positions (I at 3, T at 5), S must be in position 1 or 2.
  - **T is correct at position 5 (✓)**, meaning the secret word has ""T"" as the fifth letter.

### Deductions:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O (must not appear in the word).
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 3: ""I""
  - Position 5: ""T""
- **S position**: Must be at position 1 or 2 (since it cannot be at position 4, and positions 3 and 5 are fixed).
- **Available positions**: 
  - Position 1: Could be S or another letter if S is not here.
  - Position 2: Could be S or another letter.
  - Position 4: Any unused letter (not S, and not excluded).
- **Letters to avoid**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.
- **Remaining usable letters**: High-frequency letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, etc.

Given that S needs to be tested at position 1 or 2, and new letters should be introduced for information gain, a strong guess is **SHIFT**:
- **Pattern**: `S _ I _ T` (positions: S at 1, ? at 2, I at 3, ? at 4, T at 5).
- **Why SHIFT?** 
  - Tests S in position 1: If S is correct at position 1, we get green (✓); if S is actually in position 2, we get yellow (-).
  - Uses common new letters: H (position 2) and F (position 4), which are high-frequency and not excluded.
  - Confirms I and T in their fixed positions, maintaining valuable constraints.
  - Avoids excluded letters—C, R, A, N, E, M, O not used.
- **Outcomes**: 
  - If S is green at position 1, it confirms S at position 1, position 4 may be F, and position 2 needs solving.
  - If S is yellow (wrong position), it confirms S must be at position 2.
  - H and F provide clues: Absence (x) eliminates them; presence (-/✓) reveals their positions.",Guess 3: shift -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) F(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
