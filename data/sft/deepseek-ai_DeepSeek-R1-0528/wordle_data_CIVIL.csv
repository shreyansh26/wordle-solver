We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible to get useful feedback.
 Common starting words in word games often include vowels and frequent consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Another is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E.

 However, note that the feedback has three symbols: 
   ✓ for correct letter and position, 
   - for correct letter but wrong position,

 Since we are at the first guess, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable.

 I choose ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters: A, E (vowels) and C, R, N (consonants).

For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it includes common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N), which helps gather broad feedback about the secret word. This strategy maximizes information early on by testing multiple high-frequency letters across different positions.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the word starts with C and has 5 letters, it must be of the form C _ _ _ _

 We know that the letters R, A, N, E cannot appear anywhere in the word.

 We have 6 tries total, and this is our second guess.

 Now, we need to choose a word that starts with C and uses other common letters that haven't been tested yet, excluding R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: We can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. The vowels left are I, O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also have to test letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

 Given that position 1 is C, we can try a word that has I, O, U and some common consonants.

 A good candidate might be ""CLOCK"", but note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E. However, ""CLOCK"" has O and K, but also has L and C (which we know). But we need to check if it's valid. However, ""clock"" has two C's? Let me see: C L O C K -> but the second C is at position 4? Actually, it's C, L, O, C, K. However, the feedback for the first C was correct (position 1), so if the word has another C? The feedback didn't say that there was an extra C, but it didn't rule out duplicate letters either. The feedback for the first guess: we only know that C is at position 1, and the other positions did not have C necessarily? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. So we don't know if the secret word has another C.

 But note: the first guess was ""crane"" and the secret word starts with C. At position 1 we have C and it was marked correct. For the other positions, we didn't have a C, so we don't know if there are more C's. But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters.

 However, in the first guess, the letter C was only at position 1, so if the secret word had another C, we wouldn't have known because we didn't guess C elsewhere.

 Therefore, in the second guess, we might want to test for duplicate C? But primarily, we need to get information about the remaining letters.

 Since we cannot use R, A, N, E, let's list possible words starting with C that use common letters.

 Some common words: 
  - ""cloud"": has L, O, U, D -> but U and O are vowels and D is a consonant. However, ""cloud"" ends with D? But note: we don't know about D yet.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""chill"", but it has double L? Or ""civic"", but that has duplicate C's and I's? 

 Another idea: since we have the constraint that the word does not have R, A, N, E, we can choose a word that maximizes new information by using common untested letters.

 Letters we have tested: C, R, A, N, E. So we know C is present at position 1 and R,A,N,E are absent.

 Untested common vowels: I, O, U (but Y can sometimes be a vowel too).
 Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to include I and O and some consonants.

 Consider ""CHOPI"" -> not a word? Let's think of real words: 
  - ""CHOMP"": has O, M, P, but not an actual word? Wait, ""chomp"" is a word. But it does not contain R,A,N,E? Let's check: C H O M P? Yes. However, note that we already know C at position 1, so we should put C at first position again.

 So, a word: ""chomp"" -> C at position 1? But we want to test new letters in the other positions. Actually, we must have the first letter as C because we know it's correct.

 We must choose a word that starts with C.

 Possible words: 
  - ""child"": has H, I, L, D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes.
  - ""cough"": has O, U, G, H -> note that ""cough"" has 5 letters? C O U G H -> that's 5? Actually, ""cough"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-G-H -> 5 letters. And it doesn't have R,A,N,E.

 But note: we don't know about G and H yet.

 Alternatively, ""could"": C O U L D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes. And it tests O, U, L, D.

 Since we are missing a lot of information, let's choose ""could"". It uses O, U, L, D which are common.

 Another candidate: ""coils"" -> C O I L S -> tests O, I, L, S.

 But I think we should try to cover more vowels? We have O and U, or O and I.

 However, we don't have any feedback about vowels other than A and E being absent. So testing both vowels is good?

 Considering that, ""COULD"" might be a good choice:
   - Position 1: C (we know is correct, so we keep it that way to avoid wasting the spot)
   - Position 2: O -> a vowel
   - Position 3: U -> a vowel
   - Position 4: L -> consonant
   - Position 5: D -> consonant

 So it tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (L and D) that we haven't tried.

 Another candidate: ""CHOMP"" or ""COILS"". But ""coils"" avoids R,A,N,E? Yes: C O I L S -> no R,A,N,E.

 However, ""coils"" does not have U. We might want to test U? But if we test O and I, that's two vowels as well.

 Actually, since we haven't tested U at all, we might test it.

 But note: we are limited by the English words we have. Maybe ""coils"" is a better word because it has S at the end, which is common.

 After considering, I think a balanced word is ""could"", but let me see if we can do better.

 Another common starting guess might be ""CRYPT"", but that has R? We cannot use R. So no.

 Alternatively, ""CISTI"" is not common. So let's stick with real common words.

 We can choose ""COULD"" as the next guess.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""could"".

 However, let me double-check: ""could"" is a 5-letter word: C-O-U-L-D.

 And it avoids R, A, N, E.

 So the guess is ""could"".

 But note: we have to consider what we'll learn from the feedback. 

 If we get feedback for ""could"":
   - If O is in the word and at position 2, it will show as ✓ for O?
   - Similarly, U, L, D might give us more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""COILS"" to include I and S? But we can try that next.

 Given that we are at guess 2, and we have many possibilities, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""could"" because it uses U and O together, which might help us narrow down the vowels.

 Other common C words: ""couch"" but has H? And duplicate C? Wait, ""couch"" is C O U C H. But we have to avoid: it has a second C? And H. But we don't know if the word allows duplicates?

 But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The feedback system doesn't prohibit them.

 However, ""couch"" has C at position 1 and position 4. We know position 1 is correct. So if the secret word has another C, then position 4 might be marked as - or ✓? We don't know.

 But for now, let's avoid introducing duplicate C until we have more information because we don't know if the word has two C's.

 So ""could"" doesn't duplicate C.

 Therefore, I choose ""could"".

<guess>could</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** means ""C"" is in the secret word at position 1.
- **R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)** mean none of R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This tells us:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The word contains none of: R, A, N, E.
- Only position 1 is confirmed; positions 2–5 are unknown and must avoid the excluded letters.

For my second guess:
1. I prioritize testing new common letters (untested vowels **O**, **U**, **I** and consonants **L**, **D**, **S**, etc.).
2. I ensure the word starts with **C** to maintain the correct position 1.
3. The word must be valid and avoid **R, A, N, E**.
4. I selected **COULD** because:
   - It includes **O** and **U** (frequent untested vowels).
   - It adds common consonants **L** and **D**.
   - No duplicate letters, maximizing information from the feedback.
   - It uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will test for:
- **O** (position 2), **U** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **D** (position 5).
- Feedback will clarify if any of these are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x)—narrowing the solution space.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible to get useful feedback.
 Common starting words in word games often include vowels and frequent consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Another is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E.

 However, note that the feedback has three symbols: 
   ✓ for correct letter and position, 
   - for correct letter but wrong position, 
   x for letter not in the word.

 Since we are at the first guess, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable.

 I choose ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters: A, E (vowels) and C, R, N (consonants).

 Let's use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

 Therefore, the response should be: <guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it includes common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N), which helps gather broad feedback about the secret word. This strategy maximizes information early on by testing multiple high-frequency letters across different positions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the word starts with C and has 5 letters, it must be of the form C _ _ _ _

 We know that the letters R, A, N, E cannot appear anywhere in the word.

 We have 6 tries total, and this is our second guess.

 Now, we need to choose a word that starts with C and uses other common letters that haven't been tested yet, excluding R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: We can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. The vowels left are I, O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also have to test letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

 Given that position 1 is C, we can try a word that has I, O, U and some common consonants.

 A good candidate might be ""CLOCK"", but note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E. However, ""CLOCK"" has O and K, but also has L and C (which we know). But we need to check if it's valid. However, ""clock"" has two C's? Let me see: C L O C K -> but the second C is at position 4? Actually, it's C, L, O, C, K. However, the feedback for the first C was correct (position 1), so if the word has another C? The feedback didn't say that there was an extra C, but it didn't rule out duplicate letters either. The feedback for the first guess: we only know that C is at position 1, and the other positions did not have C necessarily? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. So we don't know if the secret word has another C.

 But note: the first guess was ""crane"" and the secret word starts with C. At position 1 we have C and it was marked correct. For the other positions, we didn't have a C, so we don't know if there are more C's. But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters.

 However, in the first guess, the letter C was only at position 1, so if the secret word had another C, we wouldn't have known because we didn't guess C elsewhere.

 Therefore, in the second guess, we might want to test for duplicate C? But primarily, we need to get information about the remaining letters.

 Since we cannot use R, A, N, E, let's list possible words starting with C that use common letters.

 Some common words: 
  - ""cloud"": has L, O, U, D -> but U and O are vowels and D is a consonant. However, ""cloud"" ends with D? But note: we don't know about D yet.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""chill"", but it has double L? Or ""civic"", but that has duplicate C's and I's? 

 Another idea: since we have the constraint that the word does not have R, A, N, E, we can choose a word that maximizes new information by using common untested letters.

 Letters we have tested: C, R, A, N, E. So we know C is present at position 1 and R,A,N,E are absent.

 Untested common vowels: I, O, U (but Y can sometimes be a vowel too).
 Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to include I and O and some consonants.

 Consider ""CHOPI"" -> not a word? Let's think of real words: 
  - ""CHOMP"": has O, M, P, but not an actual word? Wait, ""chomp"" is a word. But it does not contain R,A,N,E? Let's check: C H O M P? Yes. However, note that we already know C at position 1, so we should put C at first position again.

 So, a word: ""chomp"" -> C at position 1? But we want to test new letters in the other positions. Actually, we must have the first letter as C because we know it's correct.

 We must choose a word that starts with C.

 Possible words: 
  - ""child"": has H, I, L, D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes.
  - ""cough"": has O, U, G, H -> note that ""cough"" has 5 letters? C O U G H -> that's 5? Actually, ""cough"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-G-H -> 5 letters. And it doesn't have R,A,N,E.

 But note: we don't know about G and H yet.

 Alternatively, ""could"": C O U L D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes. And it tests O, U, L, D.

 Since we are missing a lot of information, let's choose ""could"". It uses O, U, L, D which are common.

 Another candidate: ""coils"" -> C O I L S -> tests O, I, L, S.

 But I think we should try to cover more vowels? We have O and U, or O and I.

 However, we don't have any feedback about vowels other than A and E being absent. So testing both vowels is good?

 Considering that, ""COULD"" might be a good choice:
   - Position 1: C (we know is correct, so we keep it that way to avoid wasting the spot)
   - Position 2: O -> a vowel
   - Position 3: U -> a vowel
   - Position 4: L -> consonant
   - Position 5: D -> consonant

 So it tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (L and D) that we haven't tried.

 Another candidate: ""CHOMP"" or ""COILS"". But ""coils"" avoids R,A,N,E? Yes: C O I L S -> no R,A,N,E.

 However, ""coils"" does not have U. We might want to test U? But if we test O and I, that's two vowels as well.

 Actually, since we haven't tested U at all, we might test it.

 But note: we are limited by the English words we have. Maybe ""coils"" is a better word because it has S at the end, which is common.

 After considering, I think a balanced word is ""could"", but let me see if we can do better.

 Another common starting guess might be ""CRYPT"", but that has R? We cannot use R. So no.

 Alternatively, ""CISTI"" is not common. So let's stick with real common words.

 We can choose ""COULD"" as the next guess.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""could"".

 However, let me double-check: ""could"" is a 5-letter word: C-O-U-L-D.

 And it avoids R, A, N, E.

 So the guess is ""could"".

 But note: we have to consider what we'll learn from the feedback. 

 If we get feedback for ""could"":
   - If O is in the word and at position 2, it will show as ✓ for O?
   - Similarly, U, L, D might give us more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""COILS"" to include I and S? But we can try that next.

 Given that we are at guess 2, and we have many possibilities, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""could"" because it uses U and O together, which might help us narrow down the vowels.

 Other common C words: ""couch"" but has H? And duplicate C? Wait, ""couch"" is C O U C H. But we have to avoid: it has a second C? And H. But we don't know if the word allows duplicates?

 But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The feedback system doesn't prohibit them.

 However, ""couch"" has C at position 1 and position 4. We know position 1 is correct. So if the secret word has another C, then position 4 might be marked as - or ✓? We don't know.

 But for now, let's avoid introducing duplicate C until we have more information because we don't know if the word has two C's.

 So ""could"" doesn't duplicate C.

 Therefore, I choose ""could"".

<guess>could</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** means ""C"" is in the secret word at position 1.
- **R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)** mean none of R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This tells us:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The word contains none of: R, A, N, E.
- Only position 1 is confirmed; positions 2–5 are unknown and must avoid the excluded letters.

For my second guess:
1. I prioritize testing new common letters (untested vowels **O**, **U**, **I** and consonants **L**, **D**, **S**, etc.).
2. I ensure the word starts with **C** to maintain the correct position 1.
3. The word must be valid and avoid **R, A, N, E**.
4. I selected **COULD** because:
   - It includes **O** and **U** (frequent untested vowels).
   - It adds common consonants **L** and **D**.
   - No duplicate letters, maximizing information from the feedback.
   - It uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will test for:
- **O** (position 2), **U** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **D** (position 5).
- Feedback will clarify if any of these are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x)—narrowing the solution space.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is correct and in position 1.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""could"" -> C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)
   - C is correct (again in position 1).
   - O and U are not in the word (so we can exclude them).
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (since we put L in position 4 and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
   - D is not in the word.

Summary:
- Confirmed: Position 1 is C.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, O, U, D. (since both guesses show they are 'x', meaning absent)
- Additionally, we know L is in the word, but not in position 4.

Now, we know the secret word starts with C and contains L (not in position 4). It does not contain R, A, N, E, O, U, D.

We need to make a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains L (must be in positions 2, 3, or 5; not position 4).
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E, O, U, D.

We have to choose a word that uses the remaining letters of the alphabet. We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels left): 
Vowels left: I and sometimes Y (since O and U are out, and A,E are out). 
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since L is present, we must include it in a position that is not 4 (so positions 2, 3, or 5). We also need to test for other common letters.

Possible words? Let's think:

We can try words like:
- ""CHILL"": But it has double L? And H, I. However, L is at position 4? We need L not in position 4. In ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> L is at position 4? So that's invalid because L cannot be at position 4. So we must place L in position 2,3, or 5.

Alternatively, ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> L is at position 2, which is okay. Also, contains I, M, B. But note that we haven't tested I, M, B yet. And it avoids the excluded letters.

Is ""climb"" a valid word? Yes.

Another option: ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> S is common. But again, L at position 2.

We might also consider words where L is at position 3, like ""CYLIX""? Uncommon. Or position 5, like ""CIVIL"", but we don't know about V and I? And ""civil"" has I and V.

But note: We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: include Y? Words like ""CHYME""? Complex. Let's stick to common words.

Also, we might consider testing S and T? They are very common.

So, ""CLIST""? Not a word. ""CLIPT""? Not common.

What about ""CLAMS"": C L A M S -> but A is excluded? Yes, in the first guess A was marked as absent, so we cannot use A. So ""clams"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""CLIPS"" avoids A? Yes. C L I P S -> no A, uses I, P, S.

Or ""CLIPT"" is not a word.

So possible options:
1. ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> letters: L (position 2), I, M, B
2. ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> L (position 2), I, P, S
3. ""CLIPT"": not a word? Perhaps ""CLIPT"" is not valid.
4. ""CLICK"": but C is duplicated? And we have to avoid K? We don't know about K yet, but we haven't excluded it. However, ""click"" has C at the start and then L at position 2? But the second C might be an issue? Also, I and K. But note: the secret word might have duplicate C? We don't know. But we didn't get any feedback about duplicate C because we didn't test it. In fact, from ""crane"" we know that C is at position 1, but we don't know if there's another C. Similarly, in ""could"" we didn't have another C. So it's still possible.

But let's not assume duplicates until necessary. And we want to test new letters.

Another word: ""CLINK"": C L I N K -> N is excluded? From guess 1, N is absent (x). So we cannot use N. So ""CLINK"" is invalid because of N.

Therefore, ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"" are good candidates.

Also, consider words with L not in position 2? For example, position 3: like ""CABIN"" but A,B are: A is excluded? Yes. So not.

Or ""COLIC"": but O and C duplicate? And O is excluded too.

We must avoid O (excluded).

Position 5: Try a word ending with L? Like ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> positions: C(1), I(2), V(3), I? And L at 5. However, has double I? But we don't know about I and V. Also, it avoids excluded letters? Check: C, I, V, I, L -> no R,A,N,E,O,U,D? Yes. But is ""civil"" valid? It is a word. However, it has two I's.

But we are testing I (vowel) if not tested before.

Another possibility: ""CHECK"": has E? Excluded? First guess showed E as absent? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot.

So let's compare ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"":

- Both start with C and have L in position 2 (so L will be at a new position? Remember, L cannot be at 4, but we are putting it at 2 which is okay). 
- However, from the feedback we know L is not at position 4, but it might be at position 2, 3, or 5. By placing L at position 2, we'll get feedback: 
   - If L is correct at position 2, then it will be ✓.
   - If L is not at position 2 but is in the word, then it will be marked as -, meaning present but in wrong position? Actually, if it appears in the word in a different position, we'll get '-'.

But note: in our second guess (could), L was placed at position 4 and got marked as -, meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. Now, if we put L at position 2, and the secret word has L at position 2, it will show ✓. Otherwise, it will show - meaning it's still present but in a different position (so either position 3 or 5).

So by putting L at position 2, we can quickly determine if it's in the correct place.

This is efficient.

In terms of letter coverage:
- CLIMB: tests letters L (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), B (position 5).
- CLIPS: tests L (position 2), I (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5).

S is more common than B, so CLIPS might be better? 

Also, we haven't tested S or P yet? Both are common letters.

Alternatively, there is ""CLIPT"" but invalid.

Another option: ""CLUMP""? But U is excluded.

Since we want to test other vowels? I is a vowel left. So both CLIMB and CLIPS use I at position 3.

Now, we are at guess 3, so we have 4 guesses left? That should be plenty.

After comparison, I think ""CLIPS"" is slightly better because it tests S (very common ending letter) and P.

But we must note: in CLIPS, after C, we have L at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5.

If the word turns out to have L at 2 and I at 3, that's good? But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""CLIPT"" is not valid. But ""CLIPT"" might be accepted? Actually, not a standard English word.

Let's look for words with L at position 3? Like ""CEILI""? Not a word? ""ABACI"" but A excluded. Or ""BYLIC""? Not common.

Perhaps ""CYILS""? Not a word.

So it's easier to put L at position 2.

Another word: ""CLING"": has G? But also N? N is excluded? From first guess N is absent? Yes. So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""CLIPS"".

Also, note that we tested M? No? So CLIMB tests M. But S is more common? According to English letter frequencies, S is more common than M.

So CLIPS might be better.

But both are valid. Let me see an online word list? Well, I cannot, but I trust ""clips"" is common.

We might also consider ""CLINK"" but N excluded.

Another option: ""CHILI"": but has H, I, L, I. But L must be not at position 4? In ""chili"": C H I L I -> L is at position 4? Exactly position 4? But we know L cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid putting L at position 4. Therefore, ""chili"" is invalid for our purpose.

Similarly, other words.

So, I decide on ""CLIPS"".

But wait: in CLIPS, L is at position 2. If the secret word has L at position 2, then good. Otherwise, if L is at position 3 or 5, then putting L at position 2 might give us '-' again? Then we know L is still not at 2? Then we can try another position next.

This guess will help us pinpoint L's position.

Similarly, we'll get information about I, P, S.

So, let's use ""CLIPS"".

Therefore, the third guess: ""clips"".

But let me double-check the word: ""CLIPS"" is a valid English word meaning sharp objects or moving quickly. It is 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""clips"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
  - Confirms **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - Eliminates **R, A, N, E** from the word entirely.  

- **Guess 2: ""could"" → C(✓), O(x), U(x), L(-), D(x)**  
  - Confirms **C** still correct at position 1.  
  - Eliminates **O, U, D** from the word.  
  - Reveals **L** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  
  - Meaning: **L** must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  

**Current Constraints:**  
- Secret word starts with **C**.  
- Contains **L** (position 2, 3, or 5).  
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, O, U, D** (absolutely not present).  
- Remaining vowels to test: **I** (primary vowel left, as Y is less common).  
- Remaining common consonants: **S, T, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y**, etc.  

**Strategy for Guess 3:**  
- Focus on pinpointing **L**'s position by placing it at **position 2** (untried spot).  
- Test new high-frequency letters: Prioritize **I** (common vowel) and **S** (very common ending consonant).  
- Include **P** to cover another common consonant and maximize information.  
- Valid word: **CLIPS** fits perfectly:  
  - Starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
  - Places **L** at position 2 (test if correct or narrow to position 3/5).  
  - Tests **I** at position 3, **P** at position 4, **S** at position 5.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  

**Expected Insight:**  
- If **L** is ✓ at position 2, we lock its position.  
- If **L** is -, it confirms **L** is at position 3 or 5.  
- Feedback on **I**, **P**, **S** will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), further reducing possibilities.  

<guess>clips</guess>",clips,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is correct and in position 1.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""could"" -> C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)
   - C is correct (again in position 1).
   - O and U are not in the word (so we can exclude them).
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (since we put L in position 4 and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
   - D is not in the word.

Summary:
- Confirmed: Position 1 is C.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, O, U, D. (since both guesses show they are 'x', meaning absent)
- Additionally, we know L is in the word, but not in position 4.

Now, we know the secret word starts with C and contains L (not in position 4). It does not contain R, A, N, E, O, U, D.

We need to make a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains L (must be in positions 2, 3, or 5; not position 4).
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E, O, U, D.

We have to choose a word that uses the remaining letters of the alphabet. We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels left): 
Vowels left: I and sometimes Y (since O and U are out, and A,E are out). 
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since L is present, we must include it in a position that is not 4 (so positions 2, 3, or 5). We also need to test for other common letters.

Possible words? Let's think:

We can try words like:
- ""CHILL"": But it has double L? And H, I. However, L is at position 4? We need L not in position 4. In ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> L is at position 4? So that's invalid because L cannot be at position 4. So we must place L in position 2,3, or 5.

Alternatively, ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> L is at position 2, which is okay. Also, contains I, M, B. But note that we haven't tested I, M, B yet. And it avoids the excluded letters.

Is ""climb"" a valid word? Yes.

Another option: ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> S is common. But again, L at position 2.

We might also consider words where L is at position 3, like ""CYLIX""? Uncommon. Or position 5, like ""CIVIL"", but we don't know about V and I? And ""civil"" has I and V.

But note: We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: include Y? Words like ""CHYME""? Complex. Let's stick to common words.

Also, we might consider testing S and T? They are very common.

So, ""CLIST""? Not a word. ""CLIPT""? Not common.

What about ""CLAMS"": C L A M S -> but A is excluded? Yes, in the first guess A was marked as absent, so we cannot use A. So ""clams"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""CLIPS"" avoids A? Yes. C L I P S -> no A, uses I, P, S.

Or ""CLIPT"" is not a word.

So possible options:
1. ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> letters: L (position 2), I, M, B
2. ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> L (position 2), I, P, S
3. ""CLIPT"": not a word? Perhaps ""CLIPT"" is not valid.
4. ""CLICK"": but C is duplicated? And we have to avoid K? We don't know about K yet, but we haven't excluded it. However, ""click"" has C at the start and then L at position 2? But the second C might be an issue? Also, I and K. But note: the secret word might have duplicate C? We don't know. But we didn't get any feedback about duplicate C because we didn't test it. In fact, from ""crane"" we know that C is at position 1, but we don't know if there's another C. Similarly, in ""could"" we didn't have another C. So it's still possible.

But let's not assume duplicates until necessary. And we want to test new letters.

Another word: ""CLINK"": C L I N K -> N is excluded? From guess 1, N is absent (x). So we cannot use N. So ""CLINK"" is invalid because of N.

Therefore, ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"" are good candidates.

Also, consider words with L not in position 2? For example, position 3: like ""CABIN"" but A,B are: A is excluded? Yes. So not.

Or ""COLIC"": but O and C duplicate? And O is excluded too.

We must avoid O (excluded).

Position 5: Try a word ending with L? Like ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> positions: C(1), I(2), V(3), I? And L at 5. However, has double I? But we don't know about I and V. Also, it avoids excluded letters? Check: C, I, V, I, L -> no R,A,N,E,O,U,D? Yes. But is ""civil"" valid? It is a word. However, it has two I's.

But we are testing I (vowel) if not tested before.

Another possibility: ""CHECK"": has E? Excluded? First guess showed E as absent? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot.

So let's compare ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"":

- Both start with C and have L in position 2 (so L will be at a new position? Remember, L cannot be at 4, but we are putting it at 2 which is okay). 
- However, from the feedback we know L is not at position 4, but it might be at position 2, 3, or 5. By placing L at position 2, we'll get feedback: 
   - If L is correct at position 2, then it will be ✓.
   - If L is not at position 2 but is in the word, then it will be marked as -, meaning present but in wrong position? Actually, if it appears in the word in a different position, we'll get '-'.

But note: in our second guess (could), L was placed at position 4 and got marked as -, meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. Now, if we put L at position 2, and the secret word has L at position 2, it will show ✓. Otherwise, it will show - meaning it's still present but in a different position (so either position 3 or 5).

So by putting L at position 2, we can quickly determine if it's in the correct place.

This is efficient.

In terms of letter coverage:
- CLIMB: tests letters L (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), B (position 5).
- CLIPS: tests L (position 2), I (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5).

S is more common than B, so CLIPS might be better? 

Also, we haven't tested S or P yet? Both are common letters.

Alternatively, there is ""CLIPT"" but invalid.

Another option: ""CLUMP""? But U is excluded.

Since we want to test other vowels? I is a vowel left. So both CLIMB and CLIPS use I at position 3.

Now, we are at guess 3, so we have 4 guesses left? That should be plenty.

After comparison, I think ""CLIPS"" is slightly better because it tests S (very common ending letter) and P.

But we must note: in CLIPS, after C, we have L at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5.

If the word turns out to have L at 2 and I at 3, that's good? But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""CLIPT"" is not valid. But ""CLIPT"" might be accepted? Actually, not a standard English word.

Let's look for words with L at position 3? Like ""CEILI""? Not a word? ""ABACI"" but A excluded. Or ""BYLIC""? Not common.

Perhaps ""CYILS""? Not a word.

So it's easier to put L at position 2.

Another word: ""CLING"": has G? But also N? N is excluded? From first guess N is absent? Yes. So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""CLIPS"".

Also, note that we tested M? No? So CLIMB tests M. But S is more common? According to English letter frequencies, S is more common than M.

So CLIPS might be better.

But both are valid. Let me see an online word list? Well, I cannot, but I trust ""clips"" is common.

We might also consider ""CLINK"" but N excluded.

Another option: ""CHILI"": but has H, I, L, I. But L must be not at position 4? In ""chili"": C H I L I -> L is at position 4? Exactly position 4? But we know L cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid putting L at position 4. Therefore, ""chili"" is invalid for our purpose.

Similarly, other words.

So, I decide on ""CLIPS"".

But wait: in CLIPS, L is at position 2. If the secret word has L at position 2, then good. Otherwise, if L is at position 3 or 5, then putting L at position 2 might give us '-' again? Then we know L is still not at 2? Then we can try another position next.

This guess will help us pinpoint L's position.

Similarly, we'll get information about I, P, S.

So, let's use ""CLIPS"".

Therefore, the third guess: ""clips"".

But let me double-check the word: ""CLIPS"" is a valid English word meaning sharp objects or moving quickly. It is 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""clips"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible to get useful feedback.
 Common starting words in word games often include vowels and frequent consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Another is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E.

 However, note that the feedback has three symbols: 
   ✓ for correct letter and position, 
   - for correct letter but wrong position, 
   x for letter not in the word.

 Since we are at the first guess, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable.

 I choose ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters: A, E (vowels) and C, R, N (consonants).

 Let's use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

 Therefore, the response should be: <guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because it includes common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (C, R, N), which helps gather broad feedback about the secret word. This strategy maximizes information early on by testing multiple high-frequency letters across different positions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the word starts with C and has 5 letters, it must be of the form C _ _ _ _

 We know that the letters R, A, N, E cannot appear anywhere in the word.

 We have 6 tries total, and this is our second guess.

 Now, we need to choose a word that starts with C and uses other common letters that haven't been tested yet, excluding R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: We can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. The vowels left are I, O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also have to test letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

 Given that position 1 is C, we can try a word that has I, O, U and some common consonants.

 A good candidate might be ""CLOCK"", but note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E. However, ""CLOCK"" has O and K, but also has L and C (which we know). But we need to check if it's valid. However, ""clock"" has two C's? Let me see: C L O C K -> but the second C is at position 4? Actually, it's C, L, O, C, K. However, the feedback for the first C was correct (position 1), so if the word has another C? The feedback didn't say that there was an extra C, but it didn't rule out duplicate letters either. The feedback for the first guess: we only know that C is at position 1, and the other positions did not have C necessarily? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. So we don't know if the secret word has another C.

 But note: the first guess was ""crane"" and the secret word starts with C. At position 1 we have C and it was marked correct. For the other positions, we didn't have a C, so we don't know if there are more C's. But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters.

 However, in the first guess, the letter C was only at position 1, so if the secret word had another C, we wouldn't have known because we didn't guess C elsewhere.

 Therefore, in the second guess, we might want to test for duplicate C? But primarily, we need to get information about the remaining letters.

 Since we cannot use R, A, N, E, let's list possible words starting with C that use common letters.

 Some common words: 
  - ""cloud"": has L, O, U, D -> but U and O are vowels and D is a consonant. However, ""cloud"" ends with D? But note: we don't know about D yet.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""chill"", but it has double L? Or ""civic"", but that has duplicate C's and I's? 

 Another idea: since we have the constraint that the word does not have R, A, N, E, we can choose a word that maximizes new information by using common untested letters.

 Letters we have tested: C, R, A, N, E. So we know C is present at position 1 and R,A,N,E are absent.

 Untested common vowels: I, O, U (but Y can sometimes be a vowel too).
 Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to include I and O and some consonants.

 Consider ""CHOPI"" -> not a word? Let's think of real words: 
  - ""CHOMP"": has O, M, P, but not an actual word? Wait, ""chomp"" is a word. But it does not contain R,A,N,E? Let's check: C H O M P? Yes. However, note that we already know C at position 1, so we should put C at first position again.

 So, a word: ""chomp"" -> C at position 1? But we want to test new letters in the other positions. Actually, we must have the first letter as C because we know it's correct.

 We must choose a word that starts with C.

 Possible words: 
  - ""child"": has H, I, L, D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes.
  - ""cough"": has O, U, G, H -> note that ""cough"" has 5 letters? C O U G H -> that's 5? Actually, ""cough"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-G-H -> 5 letters. And it doesn't have R,A,N,E.

 But note: we don't know about G and H yet.

 Alternatively, ""could"": C O U L D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes. And it tests O, U, L, D.

 Since we are missing a lot of information, let's choose ""could"". It uses O, U, L, D which are common.

 Another candidate: ""coils"" -> C O I L S -> tests O, I, L, S.

 But I think we should try to cover more vowels? We have O and U, or O and I.

 However, we don't have any feedback about vowels other than A and E being absent. So testing both vowels is good?

 Considering that, ""COULD"" might be a good choice:
   - Position 1: C (we know is correct, so we keep it that way to avoid wasting the spot)
   - Position 2: O -> a vowel
   - Position 3: U -> a vowel
   - Position 4: L -> consonant
   - Position 5: D -> consonant

 So it tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (L and D) that we haven't tried.

 Another candidate: ""CHOMP"" or ""COILS"". But ""coils"" avoids R,A,N,E? Yes: C O I L S -> no R,A,N,E.

 However, ""coils"" does not have U. We might want to test U? But if we test O and I, that's two vowels as well.

 Actually, since we haven't tested U at all, we might test it.

 But note: we are limited by the English words we have. Maybe ""coils"" is a better word because it has S at the end, which is common.

 After considering, I think a balanced word is ""could"", but let me see if we can do better.

 Another common starting guess might be ""CRYPT"", but that has R? We cannot use R. So no.

 Alternatively, ""CISTI"" is not common. So let's stick with real common words.

 We can choose ""COULD"" as the next guess.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""could"".

 However, let me double-check: ""could"" is a 5-letter word: C-O-U-L-D.

 And it avoids R, A, N, E.

 So the guess is ""could"".

 But note: we have to consider what we'll learn from the feedback. 

 If we get feedback for ""could"":
   - If O is in the word and at position 2, it will show as ✓ for O?
   - Similarly, U, L, D might give us more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""COILS"" to include I and S? But we can try that next.

 Given that we are at guess 2, and we have many possibilities, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""could"" because it uses U and O together, which might help us narrow down the vowels.

 Other common C words: ""couch"" but has H? And duplicate C? Wait, ""couch"" is C O U C H. But we have to avoid: it has a second C? And H. But we don't know if the word allows duplicates?

 But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The feedback system doesn't prohibit them.

 However, ""couch"" has C at position 1 and position 4. We know position 1 is correct. So if the secret word has another C, then position 4 might be marked as - or ✓? We don't know.

 But for now, let's avoid introducing duplicate C until we have more information because we don't know if the word has two C's.

 So ""could"" doesn't duplicate C.

 Therefore, I choose ""could"".

<guess>could</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** means ""C"" is in the secret word at position 1.
- **R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)** mean none of R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This tells us:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- The word contains none of: R, A, N, E.
- Only position 1 is confirmed; positions 2–5 are unknown and must avoid the excluded letters.

For my second guess:
1. I prioritize testing new common letters (untested vowels **O**, **U**, **I** and consonants **L**, **D**, **S**, etc.).
2. I ensure the word starts with **C** to maintain the correct position 1.
3. The word must be valid and avoid **R, A, N, E**.
4. I selected **COULD** because:
   - It includes **O** and **U** (frequent untested vowels).
   - It adds common consonants **L** and **D**.
   - No duplicate letters, maximizing information from the feedback.
   - It uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will test for:
- **O** (position 2), **U** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **D** (position 5).
- Feedback will clarify if any of these are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x)—narrowing the solution space.

   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
2. ""could"" -> C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)
   - C is correct (again in position 1).
   - O and U are not in the word (so we can exclude them).
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (since we put L in position 4 and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
   - D is not in the word.

Summary:
- Confirmed: Position 1 is C.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, O, U, D. (since both guesses show they are 'x', meaning absent)
- Additionally, we know L is in the word, but not in position 4.

Now, we know the secret word starts with C and contains L (not in position 4). It does not contain R, A, N, E, O, U, D.

We need to make a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains L (must be in positions 2, 3, or 5; not position 4).
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E, O, U, D.

We have to choose a word that uses the remaining letters of the alphabet. We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels left): 
Vowels left: I and sometimes Y (since O and U are out, and A,E are out). 
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since L is present, we must include it in a position that is not 4 (so positions 2, 3, or 5). We also need to test for other common letters.

Possible words? Let's think:

We can try words like:
- ""CHILL"": But it has double L? And H, I. However, L is at position 4? We need L not in position 4. In ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> L is at position 4? So that's invalid because L cannot be at position 4. So we must place L in position 2,3, or 5.

Alternatively, ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> L is at position 2, which is okay. Also, contains I, M, B. But note that we haven't tested I, M, B yet. And it avoids the excluded letters.

Is ""climb"" a valid word? Yes.

Another option: ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> S is common. But again, L at position 2.

We might also consider words where L is at position 3, like ""CYLIX""? Uncommon. Or position 5, like ""CIVIL"", but we don't know about V and I? And ""civil"" has I and V.

But note: We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: include Y? Words like ""CHYME""? Complex. Let's stick to common words.

Also, we might consider testing S and T? They are very common.

So, ""CLIST""? Not a word. ""CLIPT""? Not common.

What about ""CLAMS"": C L A M S -> but A is excluded? Yes, in the first guess A was marked as absent, so we cannot use A. So ""clams"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""CLIPS"" avoids A? Yes. C L I P S -> no A, uses I, P, S.

Or ""CLIPT"" is not a word.

So possible options:
1. ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> letters: L (position 2), I, M, B
2. ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> L (position 2), I, P, S
3. ""CLIPT"": not a word? Perhaps ""CLIPT"" is not valid.
4. ""CLICK"": but C is duplicated? And we have to avoid K? We don't know about K yet, but we haven't excluded it. However, ""click"" has C at the start and then L at position 2? But the second C might be an issue? Also, I and K. But note: the secret word might have duplicate C? We don't know. But we didn't get any feedback about duplicate C because we didn't test it. In fact, from ""crane"" we know that C is at position 1, but we don't know if there's another C. Similarly, in ""could"" we didn't have another C. So it's still possible.

But let's not assume duplicates until necessary. And we want to test new letters.

Another word: ""CLINK"": C L I N K -> N is excluded? From guess 1, N is absent (x). So we cannot use N. So ""CLINK"" is invalid because of N.

Therefore, ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"" are good candidates.

Also, consider words with L not in position 2? For example, position 3: like ""CABIN"" but A,B are: A is excluded? Yes. So not.

Or ""COLIC"": but O and C duplicate? And O is excluded too.

We must avoid O (excluded).

Position 5: Try a word ending with L? Like ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> positions: C(1), I(2), V(3), I? And L at 5. However, has double I? But we don't know about I and V. Also, it avoids excluded letters? Check: C, I, V, I, L -> no R,A,N,E,O,U,D? Yes. But is ""civil"" valid? It is a word. However, it has two I's.

But we are testing I (vowel) if not tested before.

Another possibility: ""CHECK"": has E? Excluded? First guess showed E as absent? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot.

So let's compare ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"":

- Both start with C and have L in position 2 (so L will be at a new position? Remember, L cannot be at 4, but we are putting it at 2 which is okay). 
- However, from the feedback we know L is not at position 4, but it might be at position 2, 3, or 5. By placing L at position 2, we'll get feedback: 
   - If L is correct at position 2, then it will be ✓.
   - If L is not at position 2 but is in the word, then it will be marked as -, meaning present but in wrong position? Actually, if it appears in the word in a different position, we'll get '-'.

But note: in our second guess (could), L was placed at position 4 and got marked as -, meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. Now, if we put L at position 2, and the secret word has L at position 2, it will show ✓. Otherwise, it will show - meaning it's still present but in a different position (so either position 3 or 5).

So by putting L at position 2, we can quickly determine if it's in the correct place.

This is efficient.

In terms of letter coverage:
- CLIMB: tests letters L (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), B (position 5).
- CLIPS: tests L (position 2), I (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5).

S is more common than B, so CLIPS might be better? 

Also, we haven't tested S or P yet? Both are common letters.

Alternatively, there is ""CLIPT"" but invalid.

Another option: ""CLUMP""? But U is excluded.

Since we want to test other vowels? I is a vowel left. So both CLIMB and CLIPS use I at position 3.

Now, we are at guess 3, so we have 4 guesses left? That should be plenty.

After comparison, I think ""CLIPS"" is slightly better because it tests S (very common ending letter) and P.

But we must note: in CLIPS, after C, we have L at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5.

If the word turns out to have L at 2 and I at 3, that's good? But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""CLIPT"" is not valid. But ""CLIPT"" might be accepted? Actually, not a standard English word.

Let's look for words with L at position 3? Like ""CEILI""? Not a word? ""ABACI"" but A excluded. Or ""BYLIC""? Not common.

Perhaps ""CYILS""? Not a word.

So it's easier to put L at position 2.

Another word: ""CLING"": has G? But also N? N is excluded? From first guess N is absent? Yes. So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""CLIPS"".

Also, note that we tested M? No? So CLIMB tests M. But S is more common? According to English letter frequencies, S is more common than M.

So CLIPS might be better.

But both are valid. Let me see an online word list? Well, I cannot, but I trust ""clips"" is common.

We might also consider ""CLINK"" but N excluded.

Another option: ""CHILI"": but has H, I, L, I. But L must be not at position 4? In ""chili"": C H I L I -> L is at position 4? Exactly position 4? But we know L cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid putting L at position 4. Therefore, ""chili"" is invalid for our purpose.

Similarly, other words.

So, I decide on ""CLIPS"".

But wait: in CLIPS, L is at position 2. If the secret word has L at position 2, then good. Otherwise, if L is at position 3 or 5, then putting L at position 2 might give us '-' again? Then we know L is still not at 2? Then we can try another position next.

This guess will help us pinpoint L's position.

Similarly, we'll get information about I, P, S.

So, let's use ""CLIPS"".

Therefore, the third guess: ""clips"".

But let me double-check the word: ""CLIPS"" is a valid English word meaning sharp objects or moving quickly. It is 5 letters.

So, we'll guess ""clips"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
  - Confirms **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - Eliminates **R, A, N, E** from the word entirely.  

- **Guess 2: ""could"" → C(✓), O(x), U(x), L(-), D(x)**  
  - Confirms **C** still correct at position 1.  
  - Eliminates **O, U, D** from the word.  
  - Reveals **L** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  
  - Meaning: **L** must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  

**Current Constraints:**  
- Secret word starts with **C**.  
- Contains **L** (position 2, 3, or 5).  
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, O, U, D** (absolutely not present).  
- Remaining vowels to test: **I** (primary vowel left, as Y is less common).  
- Remaining common consonants: **S, T, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y**, etc.  

**Strategy for Guess 3:**  
- Focus on pinpointing **L**'s position by placing it at **position 2** (untried spot).  
- Test new high-frequency letters: Prioritize **I** (common vowel) and **S** (very common ending consonant).  
- Include **P** to cover another common consonant and maximize information.  
- Valid word: **CLIPS** fits perfectly:  
  - Starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
  - Places **L** at position 2 (test if correct or narrow to position 3/5).  
  - Tests **I** at position 3, **P** at position 4, **S** at position 5.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  

**Expected Insight:**  
- If **L** is ✓ at position 2, we lock its position.  
- If **L** is -, it confirms **L** is at position 3 or 5.  
- Feedback on **I**, **P**, **S** will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), further reducing possibilities.

The vowels left are I, O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also have to test letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n Given that position 1 is C, we can try a word that has I, O, U and some common consonants.\n\n A good candidate might be ""CLOCK"", but note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E.

Actually, it\'s C, L, O, C, K. However, the feedback for the first C was correct (position 1), so if the word has another C? The feedback didn\'t say that there was an extra C, but it didn\'t rule out duplicate letters either. The feedback for the first guess: we only know that C is at position 1, and the other positions did not have C necessarily? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. So we don\'t know if the secret word has another C.\n\n But note: the first guess was ""crane"" and the secret word starts with C. At position 1 we have C and it was marked correct. For the other positions, we didn\'t have a C, so we don\'t know if there are more C\'s. But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters.\n\n However, in the first guess, the letter C was only at position 1, so if the secret word had another C, we wouldn\'t have known because we didn\'t guess C elsewhere.\n\n Therefore, in the second guess, we might want to test for duplicate C?

However, ""cloud"" ends with D? But note: we don\'t know about D yet.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""cloud"" does not contain these, so it\'s acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""chill"", but it has double L? Or ""civic"", but that has duplicate C\'s and I\'s? \n\n Another idea: since we have the constraint that the word does not have R, A, N, E, we can choose a word that maximizes new information by using common untested letters.\n\n Letters we have tested: C, R, A, N, E. So we know C is present at position 1 and R,A,N,E are absent.\n\n Untested common vowels: I, O, U (but Y can sometimes be a vowel too).\n Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, B, etc.\n\n A good starting point might be to include I and O and some consonants.\n\n Consider ""CHOPI"" -> not a word? Let\'s think of real words: \n  - ""CHOMP"": has O, M, P, but not an actual word? Wait, ""chomp"" is a word. But it does not contain R,A,N,E? Let\'s check: C H O M P? Yes. However, note that we already know C at position 1, so we should put C at first position again.\n\n So, a word: ""chomp"" -> C at position 1? But we want to test new letters in the other positions. Actually, we must have the first letter as C because we know it\'s correct.\n\n We must choose a word that starts with C.\n\n Possible words: \n  - ""child"": has H, I, L, D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes.\n  - ""cough"": has O, U, G, H -> note that ""cough"" has 5 letters? C O U G H -> that\'s 5? Actually, ""cough"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-G-H -> 5 letters. And it doesn\'t have R,A,N,E.\n\n But note: we don\'t know about G and H yet.\n\n Alternatively, ""could"": C O U L D -> avoids R,A,N,E? Yes. And it tests O, U, L, D.\n\n Since we are missing a lot of information, let\'s choose ""could"". It uses O, U, L, D which are common.\n\n Another candidate: ""coils"" -> C O I L S -> tests O, I, L, S.\n\n But I think we should try to cover more vowels? We have O and U, or O and I.\n\n However, we don\'t have any feedback about vowels other than A and E being absent. So testing both vowels is good?\n\n Considering that, ""COULD"" might be a good choice:\n   - Position 1: C (we know is correct, so we keep it that way to avoid wasting the spot)\n   - Position 2: O -> a vowel\n   - Position 3: U -> a vowel\n   - Position 4: L -> consonant\n   - Position 5: D -> consonant\n\n So it tests two vowels (O and U) and two consonants (L and D) that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Another candidate: ""CHOMP"" or ""COILS"". But ""coils"" avoids R,A,N,E? Yes: C O I L S -> no R,A,N,E.\n\n However, ""coils"" does not have U. We might want to test U? But if we test O and I, that\'s two vowels as well.\n\n Actually, since we haven\'t tested U at all, we might test it.\n\n But note: we are limited by the English words we have. Maybe ""coils"" is a better word because it has S at the end, which is common.\n\n After considering, I think a balanced word is ""could"", but let me see if we can do better.\n\n Another common starting guess might be ""CRYPT"", but that has R? We cannot use R. So no.\n\n Alternatively, ""CISTI"" is not common. So let\'s stick with real common words.\n\n We can choose ""COULD"" as the next guess.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess ""could"".\n\n However, let me double-check: ""could"" is a 5-letter word: C-O-U-L-D.\n\n And it avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n So the guess is ""could"".\n\n But note: we have to consider what we\'ll learn from the feedback. \n\n If we get feedback for ""could"":\n   - If O is in the word and at position 2, it will show as ✓ for O?\n   - Similarly, U, L, D might give us more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""COILS"" to include I and S? But we can try that next.\n\n Given that we are at guess 2, and we have many possibilities, either is fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ""could"" because it uses U and O together, which might help us narrow down the vowels.\n\n Other common C words: ""couch"" but has H? And duplicate C? Wait, ""couch"" is C O U C H. But we have to avoid: it has a second C? And H. But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates?\n\n But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The feedback system doesn\'t prohibit them.\n\n However, ""couch"" has C at position 1 and position 4. We know position 1 is correct. So if the secret word has another C, then position 4 might be marked as - or ✓? We don\'t know.\n\n But for now, let\'s avoid introducing duplicate C until we have more information because we don\'t know if the word has two C\'s.\n\n So ""could"" doesn\'t duplicate C.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""could"".\n\n<guess>could</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C(✓)** means ""C"" is in the secret word at position 1.\n- **R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)** mean none of R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n\nThis tells us:\n- The secret word starts with **C**.\n- The word contains none of: R, A, N, E.\n- Only position 1 is confirmed; positions 2–5 are unknown and must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nFor my second guess:\n1. I prioritize testing new common letters (untested vowels **O**, **U**, **I** and consonants **L**, **D**, **S**, etc.).\n2. I ensure the word starts with **C** to maintain the correct position 1.\n3. The word must be valid and avoid **R, A, N, E**.\n4. I selected **COULD** because:\n   - It includes **O** and **U** (frequent untested vowels).\n   - It adds common consonants **L** and **D**.\n   - No duplicate letters, maximizing information from the feedback.\n   - It uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities efficiently.\n\nThis guess will test for:\n- **O** (position 2), **U** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **D** (position 5).\n- Feedback will clarify if any of these are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x)—narrowing the solution space.\n\n<guess>could</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: could -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

But again, L at position 2.\n\nWe might also consider words where L is at position 3, like ""CYLIX""? Uncommon. Or position 5, like ""CIVIL"", but we don\'t know about V and I?

Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAlso, we might consider testing S and T? They are very common.\n\nSo, ""CLIST""? Not a word. ""CLIPT""? Not common.\n\nWhat about ""CLAMS"": C L A M S -> but A is excluded? Yes, in the first guess A was marked as absent, so we cannot use A. So ""clams"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLIPS"" avoids A? Yes. C L I P S -> no A, uses I, P, S.\n\nOr ""CLIPT"" is not a word.\n\nSo possible options:\n1. ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> letters: L (position 2), I, M, B\n2. ""CLIPS"": C L I P S -> L (position 2), I, P, S\n3. ""CLIPT"": not a word? Perhaps ""CLIPT"" is not valid.\n4. ""CLICK"": but C is duplicated? And we have to avoid K? We don\'t know about K yet, but we haven\'t excluded it. However, ""click"" has C at the start and then L at position 2? But the second C might be an issue? Also, I and K. But note: the secret word might have duplicate C? We don\'t know. But we didn\'t get any feedback about duplicate C because we didn\'t test it. In fact, from ""crane"" we know that C is at position 1, but we don\'t know if there\'s another C. Similarly, in ""could"" we didn\'t have another C. So it\'s still possible.\n\nBut let\'s not assume duplicates until necessary. And we want to test new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CLINK"": C L I N K -> N is excluded? From guess 1, N is absent (x). So we cannot use N. So ""CLINK"" is invalid because of N.\n\nTherefore, ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"" are good candidates.\n\nAlso, consider words with L not in position 2? For example, position 3: like ""CABIN"" but A,B are: A is excluded? Yes. So not.\n\nOr ""COLIC"": but O and C duplicate? And O is excluded too.\n\nWe must avoid O (excluded).\n\nPosition 5: Try a word ending with L? Like ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> positions: C(1), I(2), V(3), I? And L at 5. However, has double I? But we don\'t know about I and V. Also, it avoids excluded letters? Check: C, I, V, I, L -> no R,A,N,E,O,U,D? Yes. But is ""civil"" valid? It is a word. However, it has two I\'s.\n\nBut we are testing I (vowel) if not tested before.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CHECK"": has E? Excluded? First guess showed E as absent? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot.\n\nSo let\'s compare ""CLIMB"" and ""CLIPS"":\n\n- Both start with C and have L in position 2 (so L will be at a new position? Remember, L cannot be at 4, but we are putting it at 2 which is okay). \n- However, from the feedback we know L is not at position 4, but it might be at position 2, 3, or 5. By placing L at position 2, we\'ll get feedback: \n   - If L is correct at position 2, then it will be ✓.\n   - If L is not at position 2 but is in the word, then it will be marked as -, meaning present but in wrong position? Actually, if it appears in the word in a different position, we\'ll get \'-\'.\n\nBut note: in our second guess (could), L was placed at position 4 and got marked as -, meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. Now, if we put L at position 2, and the secret word has L at position 2, it will show ✓. Otherwise, it will show - meaning it\'s still present but in a different position (so either position 3 or 5).\n\nSo by putting L at position 2, we can quickly determine if it\'s in the correct place.\n\nThis is efficient.\n\nIn terms of letter coverage:\n- CLIMB: tests letters L (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), B (position 5).\n- CLIPS: tests L (position 2), I (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5).\n\nS is more common than B, so CLIPS might be better? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested S or P yet? Both are common letters.\n\nAlternatively, there is ""CLIPT"" but invalid.\n\nAnother option: ""CLUMP""? But U is excluded.\n\nSince we want to test other vowels? I is a vowel left. So both CLIMB and CLIPS use I at position 3.\n\nNow, we are at guess 3, so we have 4 guesses left? That should be plenty.\n\nAfter comparison, I think ""CLIPS"" is slightly better because it tests S (very common ending letter) and P.\n\nBut we must note: in CLIPS, after C, we have L at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5.\n\nIf the word turns out to have L at 2 and I at 3, that\'s good? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CLIPT"" is not valid. But ""CLIPT"" might be accepted? Actually, not a standard English word.\n\nLet\'s look for words with L at position 3? Like ""CEILI""? Not a word? ""ABACI"" but A excluded. Or ""BYLIC""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""CYILS""? Not a word.\n\nSo it\'s easier to put L at position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""CLING"": has G? But also N? N is excluded? From first guess N is absent? Yes. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""CLIPS"".\n\nAlso, note that we tested M? No? So CLIMB tests M. But S is more common? According to English letter frequencies, S is more common than M.\n\nSo CLIPS might be better.\n\nBut both are valid. Let me see an online word list? Well, I cannot, but I trust ""clips"" is common.\n\nWe might also consider ""CLINK"" but N excluded.\n\nAnother option: ""CHILI"": but has H, I, L, I. But L must be not at position 4? In ""chili"": C H I L I -> L is at position 4? Exactly position 4? But we know L cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid putting L at position 4. Therefore, ""chili"" is invalid for our purpose.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nSo, I decide on ""CLIPS"".\n\nBut wait: in CLIPS, L is at position 2. If the secret word has L at position 2, then good. Otherwise, if L is at position 3 or 5, then putting L at position 2 might give us \'-\' again? Then we know L is still not at 2? Then we can try another position next.\n\nThis guess will help us pinpoint L\'s position.\n\nSimilarly, we\'ll get information about I, P, S.\n\nSo, let\'s use ""CLIPS"".\n\nTherefore, the third guess: ""clips"".\n\nBut let me double-check the word: ""CLIPS"" is a valid English word meaning sharp objects or moving quickly. It is 5 letters.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""clips"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  \n  - Confirms **C** is correct and in position 1.  \n  - Eliminates **R, A, N, E** from the word entirely.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""could"" → C(✓), O(x), U(x), L(-), D(x)**  \n  - Confirms **C** still correct at position 1.  \n  - Eliminates **O, U, D** from the word.  \n  - Reveals **L** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  \n  - Meaning: **L** must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  \n\n**Current Constraints:**  \n- Secret word starts with **C**.  \n- Contains **L** (position 2, 3, or 5).  \n- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, O, U, D** (absolutely not present).  \n- Remaining vowels to test: **I** (primary vowel left, as Y is less common).  \n- Remaining common consonants: **S, T, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y**, etc.  \n\n**Strategy for Guess 3:**  \n- Focus on pinpointing **L**\'s position by placing it at **position 2** (untried spot).  \n- Test new high-frequency letters: Prioritize **I** (common vowel) and **S** (very common ending consonant).  \n- Include **P** to cover another common consonant and maximize information.  \n- Valid word: **CLIPS** fits perfectly:  \n  - Starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  \n  - Places **L** at position 2 (test if correct or narrow to position 3/5).  \n  - Tests **I** at position 3, **P** at position 4, **S** at position 5.  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters.  \n\n**Expected Insight:**  \n- If **L** is ✓ at position 2, we lock its position.  \n- If **L** is -, it confirms **L** is at position 3 or 5.  \n- Feedback on **I**, **P**, **S** will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), further reducing possibilities.\n\n<guess>clips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: could -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: clips -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(-) I(-) P(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""could"" -> C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - O, U, D are absent.
  - L is present but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""clips"" -> C(✓) L(-) I(-) P(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - L is present but not in position 2 (since we placed it at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
  - I is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got '-').
  - P and S are absent.

Now, let's consolidate:

- Position 1 is C.
- The word contains L and I, but we don't know their positions yet.
  - From guess 2: L is not in position 4.
  - From guess 3: L is not in position 2, so L must be in position 3 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by C and we have 5 positions).
  - Similarly, I is present but not in position 3 (from guess 3). Since position 1 is C, I cannot be there. So I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: L and I, and they are in different positions.

Also, we have the following letters absent: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S.

So the secret word is of the form: C _ _ _ _

With L in position 3 or 5, and I in position 2, 4, or 5.

But note: if L is in position 5, then position 5 is L, and I must be in 2 or 4. Similarly, if L is in position 3, then I can be in 2, 4, or 5.

We also need to consider that the word may have other letters. We have tested 10 unique letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, O, U, L, D, I, P, S. But C, L, I are present, and the rest are absent.

Specifically, the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S.

So the available letters are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know L and I are present.

But we also have to place L and I.

Now, for the next guess, we need to try to determine the positions of L and I and also test new letters.

We know:
- L is in position 3 or 5.
- I is in position 2, 4, or 5.

But note: position 5 might be L or I, but not both? Unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

We haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So, if L is in position 3, then I cannot be in position 3 (but it's already not, because we tried I at 3 and it was wrong). Then I must be in 2,4, or 5, but 3 is taken by L? So I in 2,4,5.

Similarly, if L is in position 5, then I must be in 2 or 4.

We can design a guess that tests these possibilities.

Let me denote the positions: 1: C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ?

We need to test:
- For position 2: we haven't fixed it. We know I might be there.
- For position 3: might be L? Or something else? But we know L is either in 3 or 5.
- For position 4: might be I? Or something else? But we know I might be there.
- For position 5: might be L or I.

We also need to test new letters.

We have to avoid the absent letters: R,A,N,E,O,U,D,P,S.

So let's think of words that start with C and have L in position 3 or 5, and I in position 2,4, or 5, but not conflicting.

But we don't know the exact positions, so we can try to set up a guess that tests one of the possibilities.

For example, if we assume L is in position 3, then we can put L at 3 and then put I at 2 or 4? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to put I at position 2 and L at position 5? Or I at position 4 and L at position 5? Etc.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with new letters to test.

Let me list possible words that fit the constraints.

First, if L is in position 3:
  - The word is: C _ L _ _
  - Then I must be in position 2,4, or 5.
  - So possibilities:
      - C I L ? ?   (I at 2)
      - C ? L I ?   (I at 4)
      - C ? L ? I   (I at 5)

But we need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded.

Similarly, if L is in position 5:
  - The word is: C _ _ _ L
  - Then I must be in position 2 or 4.
      - C I ? ? L   (I at 2)
      - C ? ? I L   (I at 4)

Now, we have to choose a guess that can help distinguish these cases and also test new letters.

We are at guess 4, so we have 3 guesses left? (since 6 total, we've used 3).

We can try to test the position of L by placing it at position 5? Because we haven't tried position 5 for L yet.

In guess 2, we had L at 4 (wrong position), in guess 3 at 2 (wrong position), so now we can try L at 5.

Similarly, for I, we tried it at 3 (wrong), so we can try it at 2 or 4.

But if we put L at 5, then we can put I at 2 or 4? And fill the other positions.

Let me try to form a word with L at 5 and I at 2.

So: C I ? ? L

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4, which must be from the available set and form a word.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also need to test common letters? Like T, H, M, etc.

What words are there? For example, ""CIVIL""? But V is available? But ""CIVIL"" has I at 2 and L at 5? But also V at 3 and I at 4? But we have two I's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in this case, we have I at 2 and 4? But we only know one I is present? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us the count. So it's possible.

But let's check: ""CIVIL"" has letters: C, I, V, I, L. We know C and L are present, and I is present (but we don't know how many). But in guess 3, we had I at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is one I or more. So duplicates are possible.

But ""CIVIL"" has two I's. However, we have excluded letters? V is not excluded? And L is present. But we are putting I at 2 and 4? And L at 5.

But in the word ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V and position 4 is I.

But we are trying to test: if we put I at 2 and L at 5, and we put V at 3 and I at 4? But then we have two I's.

But we don't know if the secret word has two I's? It might.

But let's see if ""CIVIL"" is allowed? It avoids R,A,N,E,O,U,D,P,S? Yes.

But we are at guess 4, and we want to test new letters. V is a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""CITIZ"" not a word.

Or ""CILIA""? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.

Another word: ""CHILL""? But L is at 4? But we are putting L at 5? And ""chill"" has L at 4 and 5? But we are trying L at 5? So if we put L at 5, then position 4 must be something else? In ""CHILL"", it would be C H I L L -> but we have L at 4 and 5? But we are not allowed to put L at 4 because we know L is not at 4? From guess 2, L is not at 4. So we cannot put L at 4 in our guess? Actually, we can put it, but it would be wrong? But we know it's not there, so it's a waste? We should avoid putting L at 4 because we know it's not the correct position.

So in our guess, we should not put L at 4 because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid positions we know are wrong for L.

So for L, we should only try position 3 or 5 in this guess? Because we haven't tried 3 and 5.

Similarly for I, we haven't tried position 2,4,5? But we tried 3 and it was wrong.

So let's try to put L at position 5 and I at position 2.

So the word: C I ? ? L

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- ""CILLY""? Not a word? Or ""CIVIL"" as above? But ""CIVIL"" has I at 4? So it would be C I V I L -> positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:L.

But we are putting I at 2 and 4? So we are testing I at two positions? That might be okay.

But we are also testing V at 3.

Another word: ""CIGAR""? But A and R are excluded? No.

""CIBOL""? Not common? Or ""CIMEX""? Not common.

""B"" is available? ""C I B ? L"" -> ""CABLE""? But A and E excluded? No.

""F"" -> ""C I F ? L"" -> ""CIVIL"" is the only common one I can think of.

But ""CIVIL"" is a valid word.

We could put I at position 4 and L at 5? Then the word: C ? ? I L

For example, ""CIVIL"" again? But that has I at 2 and 4? Not just at 4.

""CHAIL""? But A excluded? No.

""CHILL"" but L at 4? We cannot put L at 4.

""COIL"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""CATIL""? Not a word.

""COMIC""? But O and M? O is excluded? No.

So ""CIVIL"" seems a candidate.

But let's consider the other case: putting L at position 3.

If we put L at position 3, then we can put I at position 2: C I L ? ?

Then we need two letters for 4 and 5. Available letters? For example, ""CILIA""? A excluded? No.

""CILLY""? Not a word.

""CILLI""? Not a word.

""CHILE""? But E excluded? No.

""CHIMB""? Not a word.

""CHIMP""? But P is excluded? From guess 3, P is absent? Yes, P(x) in guess 3. So P is out.

Similarly, S is out.

So hard to find a word with C I L ? ? 

Put I at 4: C ? L I ?

Then words: ""CULMI""? U excluded? No.

""COLIC""? O excluded? No.

""CLIPT""? P excluded? And not a word.

""CLIMB""? But M and B? ""CLIMB"" is C L I M B -> but we are putting L at 3? In ""CLIMB"", L is at 2? Not 3.

We need L at 3: so C ? L ? ?

For example, ""CABLE""? A and E excluded? No.

""CYCLI""? Not a word.

""CAULK""? A and U excluded? No.

""CELLO""? E and O and L? E and O excluded? Yes.

So it's difficult to find a word with L at 3.

Therefore, perhaps the L is at 5? And we should try ""CIVIL"".

But in ""CIVIL"", we have I at 2 and 4? And we are testing I at two positions? That might be efficient.

But we also test V.

Another possibility: put L at 5 and I at 4? Then C ? ? I L

What words? ""CIVIL"" has I at 2 and 4? Not just at 4.

""COMIC"" O excluded? No.

""LOGIC""? Not starting with C? We need C at 1.

""HEMIC""? Not starting with C.

""TONIC""? Not starting with C.

So ""CIVIL"" is a good candidate.

But let's see if there is a word with L at 5 and I at 2 without duplicate I? For example, ""CIVIL"" has two I's, but what about ""CIZEL""? Not a word? Or ""CITAL""? A excluded? No.

""K"" -> ""CINCH""? But N excluded? No.

So I think ""CIVIL"" is acceptable.

But we have to consider that the secret word might not have two I's? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to test only one I and L at 5.

For example, put I at 2 and L at 5, and then for positions 3 and 4, use two new letters that are common.

But what word? C I _ _ L

With the middle two letters from available set.

For example, ""CITIZ"" not a word.

""CHIZZ""? Not a word.

""CHIMB""? Not a word.

""CIBOL""? Not common.

""CYCLO""? O excluded? No.

""CYMLY""? Not a word.

So it's hard. Therefore, ""CIVIL"" might be the best we can do.

Another idea: put L at position 3? But we couldn't find a word.

What about ""C L I _ _""? But we already tried ""clips"" and L was not at 2? And I not at 3? But we are putting L at 3? So C ? L ? ? 

For example, ""C T L I ?"" not a word.

"" C H L I ?"" -> ""CHLIA""? Not a word.

"" C H L O R""? O and R excluded? No.

Perhaps ""CABLY""? A excluded? No.

I think we have to go with ""CIVIL"" for the next guess.

So let's choose ""CIVIL"".

But in ""CIVIL"", we have:
- Position 1: C (correct)
- Position 2: I (we'll see if it's correct or misplaced)
- Position 3: V (new letter)
- Position 4: I (another I? so we test I at 4 as well)
- Position 5: L (we'll see if L is at 5)

This will give us feedback on I at two positions and L at 5, and also on V.

If the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's might be marked as absent? But the feedback might mark the first I as correct or misplaced and the second as absent? Or if the word has two I's, both might be marked.

But it's a bit messy, but we have to try.

Alternatively, we can avoid duplicate I and put I at only one position.

For example, put I at position 4 and L at 5: C ? ? I L

What words? ""CIVIL"" has I at 2 and 4? Not only at 4.

""B"" -> ""CUBIC""? U excluded? No.

""T"" -> ""CUTIN""? U excluded? No.

""F"" -> ""CALIF""? A excluded? No.

""G"" -> ""COLIN""? O excluded? No.

""H"" -> ""CHIML""? Not a word.

""J"" -> ""CIJIL""? Not a word.

""K"" -> ""CYKIN""? Not a word.

""M"" -> ""COMIC""? O excluded? No.

""Q"" -> ""CQI IL""? No.

""T"" -> ""CITIL""? Not a word.

""V"" -> ""CIVIL"" is the only one.

""W"" -> ""CWMIL""? Not a word.

""X"" -> ""CIVIL"" is the only common word I can think of.

So I think we have to go with ""CIVIL"".

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""civil"".

But let's write it: C I V I L

So <guess>civil</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""could"" → C(✓), O(x), U(x), L(-), D(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1).  
  - **O, U, D** are absent.  
  - **L** is present but not in position 4.  
- **Guess 3: ""clips"" → C(✓), L(-), I(-), P(x), S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1).  
  - **L** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **I** is present but not in position 3.  
  - **P, S** are absent.  

**Key Insights:**  
1. **Fixed Position**: Position 1 is **C**.  
2. **Confirmed Present Letters**:  
   - **L** must be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be in 2 or 4, per feedback).  
   - **I** must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be in 3, per feedback).  
3. **Absent Letters**: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S (excluded entirely).  
4. **Untested Letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

**Strategy for Guess 4:**  
- **Test L and I Positions**: Place **L** at position 5 (untried spot) and **I** at position 2 (untried spot) to resolve ambiguity.  
- **Maximize Information**: Use **V** (common untested consonant) and test **I** at position 4 to efficiently check for duplicate letters.  
- **Valid Word Choice**: **CIVIL** fits all constraints:  
  - Starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
  - Places **I** at positions 2 and 4 (tests if **I** is in 2 or 4, or if duplicates exist).  
  - Places **L** at position 5 (tests if **L** is here).  
  - Uses **V** (new letter) at position 3.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  

**Expected Feedback Outcomes:**  
- **I at position 2**: If ✓, confirms **I** at position 2. If -, **I** is in position 4 or 5.  
- **V at position 3**: Tests if **V** is present (✓ or -) or absent (x).  
- **I at position 4**: If ✓, confirms **I** at position 4. If x, no duplicate **I**, and **I** must be at position 2 or 5.  
- **L at position 5**: If ✓, confirms **L** at position 5. If -, **L** must be at position 3.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the remaining possibilities while testing critical positions and new letters.  

<guess>civil</guess>",civil,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""could"" -> C(✓) O(x) U(x) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - O, U, D are absent.
  - L is present but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""clips"" -> C(✓) L(-) I(-) P(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - L is present but not in position 2 (since we placed it at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
  - I is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got '-').
  - P and S are absent.

Now, let's consolidate:

- Position 1 is C.
- The word contains L and I, but we don't know their positions yet.
  - From guess 2: L is not in position 4.
  - From guess 3: L is not in position 2, so L must be in position 3 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by C and we have 5 positions).
  - Similarly, I is present but not in position 3 (from guess 3). Since position 1 is C, I cannot be there. So I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: L and I, and they are in different positions.

Also, we have the following letters absent: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S.

So the secret word is of the form: C _ _ _ _

With L in position 3 or 5, and I in position 2, 4, or 5.

But note: if L is in position 5, then position 5 is L, and I must be in 2 or 4. Similarly, if L is in position 3, then I can be in 2, 4, or 5.

We also need to consider that the word may have other letters. We have tested 10 unique letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, O, U, L, D, I, P, S. But C, L, I are present, and the rest are absent.

Specifically, the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S.

So the available letters are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we know L and I are present.

But we also have to place L and I.

Now, for the next guess, we need to try to determine the positions of L and I and also test new letters.

We know:
- L is in position 3 or 5.
- I is in position 2, 4, or 5.

But note: position 5 might be L or I, but not both? Unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

We haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So, if L is in position 3, then I cannot be in position 3 (but it's already not, because we tried I at 3 and it was wrong). Then I must be in 2,4, or 5, but 3 is taken by L? So I in 2,4,5.

Similarly, if L is in position 5, then I must be in 2 or 4.

We can design a guess that tests these possibilities.

Let me denote the positions: 1: C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ?

We need to test:
- For position 2: we haven't fixed it. We know I might be there.
- For position 3: might be L? Or something else? But we know L is either in 3 or 5.
- For position 4: might be I? Or something else? But we know I might be there.
- For position 5: might be L or I.

We also need to test new letters.

We have to avoid the absent letters: R,A,N,E,O,U,D,P,S.

So let's think of words that start with C and have L in position 3 or 5, and I in position 2,4, or 5, but not conflicting.

But we don't know the exact positions, so we can try to set up a guess that tests one of the possibilities.

For example, if we assume L is in position 3, then we can put L at 3 and then put I at 2 or 4? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to put I at position 2 and L at position 5? Or I at position 4 and L at position 5? Etc.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with new letters to test.

Let me list possible words that fit the constraints.

First, if L is in position 3:
  - The word is: C _ L _ _
  - Then I must be in position 2,4, or 5.
  - So possibilities:
      - C I L ? ?   (I at 2)
      - C ? L I ?   (I at 4)
      - C ? L ? I   (I at 5)

But we need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded.

Similarly, if L is in position 5:
  - The word is: C _ _ _ L
  - Then I must be in position 2 or 4.
      - C I ? ? L   (I at 2)
      - C ? ? I L   (I at 4)

Now, we have to choose a guess that can help distinguish these cases and also test new letters.

We are at guess 4, so we have 3 guesses left? (since 6 total, we've used 3).

We can try to test the position of L by placing it at position 5? Because we haven't tried position 5 for L yet.

In guess 2, we had L at 4 (wrong position), in guess 3 at 2 (wrong position), so now we can try L at 5.

Similarly, for I, we tried it at 3 (wrong), so we can try it at 2 or 4.

But if we put L at 5, then we can put I at 2 or 4? And fill the other positions.

Let me try to form a word with L at 5 and I at 2.

So: C I ? ? L

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4, which must be from the available set and form a word.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also need to test common letters? Like T, H, M, etc.

What words are there? For example, ""CIVIL""? But V is available? But ""CIVIL"" has I at 2 and L at 5? But also V at 3 and I at 4? But we have two I's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in this case, we have I at 2 and 4? But we only know one I is present? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us the count. So it's possible.

But let's check: ""CIVIL"" has letters: C, I, V, I, L. We know C and L are present, and I is present (but we don't know how many). But in guess 3, we had I at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is one I or more. So duplicates are possible.

But ""CIVIL"" has two I's. However, we have excluded letters? V is not excluded? And L is present. But we are putting I at 2 and 4? And L at 5.

But in the word ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V and position 4 is I.

But we are trying to test: if we put I at 2 and L at 5, and we put V at 3 and I at 4? But then we have two I's.

But we don't know if the secret word has two I's? It might.

But let's see if ""CIVIL"" is allowed? It avoids R,A,N,E,O,U,D,P,S? Yes.

But we are at guess 4, and we want to test new letters. V is a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""CITIZ"" not a word.

Or ""CILIA""? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.

Another word: ""CHILL""? But L is at 4? But we are putting L at 5? And ""chill"" has L at 4 and 5? But we are trying L at 5? So if we put L at 5, then position 4 must be something else? In ""CHILL"", it would be C H I L L -> but we have L at 4 and 5? But we are not allowed to put L at 4 because we know L is not at 4? From guess 2, L is not at 4. So we cannot put L at 4 in our guess? Actually, we can put it, but it would be wrong? But we know it's not there, so it's a waste? We should avoid putting L at 4 because we know it's not the correct position.

So in our guess, we should not put L at 4 because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid positions we know are wrong for L.

So for L, we should only try position 3 or 5 in this guess? Because we haven't tried 3 and 5.

Similarly for I, we haven't tried position 2,4,5? But we tried 3 and it was wrong.

So let's try to put L at position 5 and I at position 2.

So the word: C I ? ? L

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- ""CILLY""? Not a word? Or ""CIVIL"" as above? But ""CIVIL"" has I at 4? So it would be C I V I L -> positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:L.

But we are putting I at 2 and 4? So we are testing I at two positions? That might be okay.

But we are also testing V at 3.

Another word: ""CIGAR""? But A and R are excluded? No.

""CIBOL""? Not common? Or ""CIMEX""? Not common.

""B"" is available? ""C I B ? L"" -> ""CABLE""? But A and E excluded? No.

""F"" -> ""C I F ? L"" -> ""CIVIL"" is the only common one I can think of.

But ""CIVIL"" is a valid word.

We could put I at position 4 and L at 5? Then the word: C ? ? I L

For example, ""CIVIL"" again? But that has I at 2 and 4? Not just at 4.

""CHAIL""? But A excluded? No.

""CHILL"" but L at 4? We cannot put L at 4.

""COIL"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""CATIL""? Not a word.

""COMIC""? But O and M? O is excluded? No.

So ""CIVIL"" seems a candidate.

But let's consider the other case: putting L at position 3.

If we put L at position 3, then we can put I at position 2: C I L ? ?

Then we need two letters for 4 and 5. Available letters? For example, ""CILIA""? A excluded? No.

""CILLY""? Not a word.

""CILLI""? Not a word.

""CHILE""? But E excluded? No.

""CHIMB""? Not a word.

""CHIMP""? But P is excluded? From guess 3, P is absent? Yes, P(x) in guess 3. So P is out.

Similarly, S is out.

So hard to find a word with C I L ? ? 

Put I at 4: C ? L I ?

Then words: ""CULMI""? U excluded? No.

""COLIC""? O excluded? No.

""CLIPT""? P excluded? And not a word.

""CLIMB""? But M and B? ""CLIMB"" is C L I M B -> but we are putting L at 3? In ""CLIMB"", L is at 2? Not 3.

We need L at 3: so C ? L ? ?

For example, ""CABLE""? A and E excluded? No.

""CYCLI""? Not a word.

""CAULK""? A and U excluded? No.

""CELLO""? E and O and L? E and O excluded? Yes.

So it's difficult to find a word with L at 3.

Therefore, perhaps the L is at 5? And we should try ""CIVIL"".

But in ""CIVIL"", we have I at 2 and 4? And we are testing I at two positions? That might be efficient.

But we also test V.

Another possibility: put L at 5 and I at 4? Then C ? ? I L

What words? ""CIVIL"" has I at 2 and 4? Not just at 4.

""COMIC"" O excluded? No.

""LOGIC""? Not starting with C? We need C at 1.

""HEMIC""? Not starting with C.

""TONIC""? Not starting with C.

So ""CIVIL"" is a good candidate.

But let's see if there is a word with L at 5 and I at 2 without duplicate I? For example, ""CIVIL"" has two I's, but what about ""CIZEL""? Not a word? Or ""CITAL""? A excluded? No.

""K"" -> ""CINCH""? But N excluded? No.

So I think ""CIVIL"" is acceptable.

But we have to consider that the secret word might not have two I's? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to test only one I and L at 5.

For example, put I at 2 and L at 5, and then for positions 3 and 4, use two new letters that are common.

But what word? C I _ _ L

With the middle two letters from available set.

For example, ""CITIZ"" not a word.

""CHIZZ""? Not a word.

""CHIMB""? Not a word.

""CIBOL""? Not common.

""CYCLO""? O excluded? No.

""CYMLY""? Not a word.

So it's hard. Therefore, ""CIVIL"" might be the best we can do.

Another idea: put L at position 3? But we couldn't find a word.

What about ""C L I _ _""? But we already tried ""clips"" and L was not at 2? And I not at 3? But we are putting L at 3? So C ? L ? ? 

For example, ""C T L I ?"" not a word.

"" C H L I ?"" -> ""CHLIA""? Not a word.

"" C H L O R""? O and R excluded? No.

Perhaps ""CABLY""? A excluded? No.

I think we have to go with ""CIVIL"" for the next guess.

So let's choose ""CIVIL"".

But in ""CIVIL"", we have:
- Position 1: C (correct)
- Position 2: I (we'll see if it's correct or misplaced)
- Position 3: V (new letter)
- Position 4: I (another I? so we test I at 4 as well)
- Position 5: L (we'll see if L is at 5)

This will give us feedback on I at two positions and L at 5, and also on V.

If the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's might be marked as absent? But the feedback might mark the first I as correct or misplaced and the second as absent? Or if the word has two I's, both might be marked.

But it's a bit messy, but we have to try.

Alternatively, we can avoid duplicate I and put I at only one position.

For example, put I at position 4 and L at 5: C ? ? I L

What words? ""CIVIL"" has I at 2 and 4? Not only at 4.

""B"" -> ""CUBIC""? U excluded? No.

""T"" -> ""CUTIN""? U excluded? No.

""F"" -> ""CALIF""? A excluded? No.

""G"" -> ""COLIN""? O excluded? No.

""H"" -> ""CHIML""? Not a word.

""J"" -> ""CIJIL""? Not a word.

""K"" -> ""CYKIN""? Not a word.

""M"" -> ""COMIC""? O excluded? No.

""Q"" -> ""CQI IL""? No.

""T"" -> ""CITIL""? Not a word.

""V"" -> ""CIVIL"" is the only one.

""W"" -> ""CWMIL""? Not a word.

""X"" -> ""CIVIL"" is the only common word I can think of.

So I think we have to go with ""CIVIL"".

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""civil"".

But let's write it: C I V I L

So <guess>civil</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""could"" → C(✓), O(x), U(x), L(-), D(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1).  
  - **O, U, D** are absent.  
  - **L** is present but not in position 4.  
- **Guess 3: ""clips"" → C(✓), L(-), I(-), P(x), S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1).  
  - **L** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **I** is present but not in position 3.  
  - **P, S** are absent.  

**Key Insights:**  
1. **Fixed Position**: Position 1 is **C**.  
2. **Confirmed Present Letters**:  
   - **L** must be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be in 2 or 4, per feedback).  
   - **I** must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be in 3, per feedback).  
3. **Absent Letters**: R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S (excluded entirely).  
4. **Untested Letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

**Strategy for Guess 4:**  
- **Test L and I Positions**: Place **L** at position 5 (untried spot) and **I** at position 2 (untried spot) to resolve ambiguity.  
- **Maximize Information**: Use **V** (common untested consonant) and test **I** at position 4 to efficiently check for duplicate letters.  
- **Valid Word Choice**: **CIVIL** fits all constraints:  
  - Starts with **C** (position 1 fixed).  
  - Places **I** at positions 2 and 4 (tests if **I** is in 2 or 4, or if duplicates exist).  
  - Places **L** at position 5 (tests if **L** is here).  
  - Uses **V** (new letter) at position 3.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  

**Expected Feedback Outcomes:**  
- **I at position 2**: If ✓, confirms **I** at position 2. If -, **I** is in position 4 or 5.  
- **V at position 3**: Tests if **V** is present (✓ or -) or absent (x).  
- **I at position 4**: If ✓, confirms **I** at position 4. If x, no duplicate **I**, and **I** must be at position 2 or 5.  
- **L at position 5**: If ✓, confirms **L** at position 5. If -, **L** must be at position 3.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the remaining possibilities while testing critical positions and new letters.",Guess 4: civil -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) I(✓) V(✓) I(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
