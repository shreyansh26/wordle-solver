We are making the first guess. Since we have no information, we should choose a word that helps us gather as much information as possible.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize coverage.

 One common strategy is to use words that contain common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Therefore, my first guess is: RAISE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the word)
  I: x (I is not in the word)
  S: x (S is not in the word)
  E: - (E is in the word but not in the last position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"".
    Specifically, R is not at position 1 (index 0) and E is not at position 4 (index 4).
  - The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, or S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
  - Does not contain A, I, or S (since they are absent).
  - Includes the letters R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
  - We can also try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Since R and E are in the word, we know the word has at least these two letters.

Let's think about the positions:
  - R was in position 0 in ""raise"" but is not in position 0 in the secret word. So R must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - E was in position 4 in ""raise"" but is not in position 4 in the secret word. So E must be in one of positions 0, 1, 2, or 3.

We also note that the word does not have A, I, or S, so we avoid those.

Common consonants that we haven't tested yet: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that includes R and E, and also tests other common letters.

One idea: use a word that has R and E in positions that are different from the first guess, and also includes other common letters.

For example, let's try to put R in position 1 or 2 and E in position 0 or 2, etc.

Possible words:

We know the word must have R and E, and avoid A, I, S.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common letters like T, N, O, L.

Example words:
  - ""TREED"": but that has two E's? and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. However, we know the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one E and one R. But if the word had two R's, then we would have seen one R marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each occurrence. However, if the word has two R's, then if one is in the correct position we get a check, and the other might be marked as absent or present depending on the position.

But in our case, we only have one R and one E in the guess. So we don't know if the word has more than one of these.

To maximize information, we might avoid duplicates in the next guess? But we are constrained by the fact that we must include R and E.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and E and three new letters.

Let me try to list some words without A, I, S and with R and E:

- ""ROUTE"": but R is in position 0 again? We know R is not at position 0? Actually, the feedback said R is present but not at position 0. So we cannot put R at position 0. So ""ROUTE"" is invalid because R is at 0.

- ""CREST"": but C is not tested, but we have S? We cannot use S because we know S is absent. So avoid S.

- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E. This has R at position 1 and E at position 4. But note: in the feedback, E was not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4. Therefore, ""TROPE"" has E at the end (position 4) which is not allowed.

- ""ENTER"": This has E at position 0 and 3, and R at position 4. But we have two E's. Also, we don't know if the word has two E's. But let's check the positions: 
  - E at position 0: that's allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4, but it could be at 0.
  - However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters. But we are trying to test new letters. Also, we have T and N.

But note: the word ""ENTER"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But if we use it, we might get information about T and N.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and E.

In ""ENTER"":
  - E at 0: allowed (since we only know E is not at 4, so 0 is okay)
  - R at 4: but we know from the first guess that E was at 4 and that was wrong? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So position 4 is not allowed for E? But what about R? The feedback for R was that it is not at position 0. There was no feedback about position 4 for R. So R can be at 4.

But wait: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. That doesn't say anything about R at position 4. So R can be at 4.

So ""ENTER"" is a candidate? But let's see: 
  - It has E at position 0 and 3, and R at 4.
  - We avoid A, I, S.

But we are using two E's. We might not get as much information because we are repeating a letter. Also, we already know E is in the word, so we are only testing two new letters (T and N) and one known letter (R) in a new position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new letters without repetition.

Another candidate: ""ROBED"" -> but R is at 0? We cannot use R at 0.

How about ""BORED"": 
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is at position 2 (which is allowed, since it wasn't at 0 and we don't know about 2)
  - E is at position 3 (which is allowed, because we only know it's not at 4)

But we have to check if we are avoiding A, I, S: yes.

Another: ""LURED"": 
  - L, U, R, E, D -> R at 2, E at 3. Also avoids A, I, S.

But we don't know if U or L are in the word.

Another: ""CREDO"": 
  - C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is not at 4. Also, we test C, D, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CREDO"" is a valid word.

However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess had R and E as present. We are now putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. This might be correct or not.

But we are also testing three new letters: C, D, O.

Another candidate: ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2. This is also good.

But note: we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that is allowed? The feedback only said E is not at 4, so 2 is okay.

We have to avoid the known absent letters: A, I, S.

I think ""CREDO"" and ""TREND"" are both good.

But let me think: we also want to cover more common letters. T, N, D are very common.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? But we don't have enough information.

Another idea: since R is not at 0 and E is not at 4, we can try to put R at 1 and E at 0? But E at 0: that is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4.

For example: ""REACT"" -> but we cannot use A. So avoid.

""REBUT"": 
  - R at 0? We cannot put R at 0. So no.

""BERTH"": 
  - B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is at 1 (which is allowed). We test B, T, H.

But we have to avoid A, I, S: yes.

""BERTH"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing the options:

  - ""CREDO"": tests C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2.
  - ""TREND"": tests T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2.
  - ""BERTH"": tests B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2.

We already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing three new letters in each.

I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because T, N, D are very common.

But note: we are putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. We don't know if that is correct, but it's a possibility.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that we haven't tried at all. In the first guess, R was at 0 and E at 4. Now we are avoiding those. So positions 1,2,3 for R and 0,1,2,3 for E.

In ""TREND"", R is at 1 and E at 2.

Another possibility: ""DETER"" -> but that has two E's and we are repeating. Also, E at 4 is not allowed? We have E at 1 and 4? But we cannot put E at 4. So we avoid.

I think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there is a word that uses R and E and also includes other common letters we haven't tested, and avoids the forbidden positions.

Another candidate: ""OPTER"" -> not a common word? Also, O, P, T, E, R -> R at 4? That's allowed. E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing O, P, T.

But ""OPTER"" might not be a word? Actually, I think ""OPTED"" is a word but that has D. ""OPTED"" has E at 3 and D at 4. But then we are not including R? We must include R and E.

We need both R and E.

""PORTER"" is 6 letters. So no.

""PRONE"": 
  - P, R, O, N, E -> R at 1, E at 4. But we cannot put E at 4? Because the feedback said E is not at 4. So invalid.

""CRONE"": 
  - C, R, O, N, E -> same problem: E at 4.

So we must avoid E at 4.

Therefore, words ending with E are not allowed for this guess.

So ""TREND"" ends with D, so that's okay.

Similarly, ""CREDO"" ends with O, okay.

""BERTH"" ends with H, okay.

I think I'll go with ""TREND"" because it tests T, N, D which are common.

But note: we are putting R at 1 and E at 2. If the secret word has R at 1 and E at 2, then we get two checks. But if not, we get information about the positions of R and E.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that are not 1 and 2? For example, R at 3 and E at 0.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E at 3, R at 4. But E at 3 is allowed? Yes. R at 4 is allowed? Yes. But we are testing U, M, B which are less common.

I think ""TREND"" is better.

Another word: ""TREAD"" -> but we cannot use A.

""TREND"" seems good.

So I choose ""TREND"".

But let me double-check: 
  - T, R, E, N, D
  - We avoid A, I, S.
  - R is at position 1 (not 0) -> allowed.
  - E is at position 2 (not 4) -> allowed.

We are testing T, N, D.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TREND"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is absent (marked as x).
- I is absent (marked as x).
- S is absent (marked as x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are not in the word.
- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is incorrect).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess:
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.
- Include R and E in new positions (not position 1 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TREND"" fits these criteria:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, not 1).
  - E is in position 3 (new position, not 5).
  - Tests T, N, D (common letters not yet evaluated).
  - Valid 5-letter word without A, I, S.

This guess maximizes information by covering new letters and repositioning known letters.

  A: x (A is not in the word)
  I: x (I is not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that we haven't tried at all. In the first guess, R was at 0 and E at 4. Now we are avoiding those. So positions 1,2,3 for R and 0,1,2,3 for E.

In ""TREND"", R is at 1 and E at 2.

Another possibility: ""DETER"" -> but that has two E's and we are repeating. Also, E at 4 is not allowed? We have E at 1 and 4? But we cannot put E at 4. So we avoid.

I think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there is a word that uses R and E and also includes other common letters we haven't tested, and avoids the forbidden positions.

Another candidate: ""OPTER"" -> not a common word? Also, O, P, T, E, R -> R at 4? That's allowed. E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing O, P, T.

But ""OPTER"" might not be a word? Actually, I think ""OPTED"" is a word but that has D. ""OPTED"" has E at 3 and D at 4. But then we are not including R? We must include R and E.

We need both R and E.

""PORTER"" is 6 letters. So no.

""PRONE"": 
  - P, R, O, N, E -> R at 1, E at 4. But we cannot put E at 4? Because the feedback said E is not at 4. So invalid.

""CRONE"": 
  - C, R, O, N, E -> same problem: E at 4.

So we must avoid E at 4.

Therefore, words ending with E are not allowed for this guess.

So ""TREND"" ends with D, so that's okay.

Similarly, ""CREDO"" ends with O, okay.

""BERTH"" ends with H, okay.

I think I'll go with ""TREND"" because it tests T, N, D which are common.

But note: we are putting R at 1 and E at 2. If the secret word has R at 1 and E at 2, then we get two checks. But if not, we get information about the positions of R and E.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that are not 1 and 2? For example, R at 3 and E at 0.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E at 3, R at 4. But E at 3 is allowed? Yes. R at 4 is allowed? Yes. But we are testing U, M, B which are less common.

I think ""TREND"" is better.

Another word: ""TREAD"" -> but we cannot use A.

""TREND"" seems good.

So I choose ""TREND"".

But let me double-check: 
  - T, R, E, N, D
  - We avoid A, I, S.
  - R is at position 1 (not 0) -> allowed.
  - E is at position 2 (not 4) -> allowed.

We are testing T, N, D.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TREND"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is absent (marked as x).
- I is absent (marked as x).
- S is absent (marked as x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are not in the word.
- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is incorrect).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess:
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.
- Include R and E in new positions (not position 1 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TREND"" fits these criteria:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, not 1).
  - E is in position 3 (new position, not 5).
  - Tests T, N, D (common letters not yet evaluated).
  - Valid 5-letter word without A, I, S.

This guess maximizes information by covering new letters and repositioning known letters.",Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,greet,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no information, we should choose a word that helps us gather as much information as possible.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize coverage.

 One common strategy is to use words that contain common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Therefore, my first guess is: RAISE

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the word)
  I: x (I is not in the word)
  S: x (S is not in the word)
  E: - (E is in the word but not in the last position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"".
    Specifically, R is not at position 1 (index 0) and E is not at position 4 (index 4).
  - The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, or S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
  - Does not contain A, I, or S (since they are absent).
  - Includes the letters R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
  - We can also try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Since R and E are in the word, we know the word has at least these two letters.

Let's think about the positions:
  - R was in position 0 in ""raise"" but is not in position 0 in the secret word. So R must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - E was in position 4 in ""raise"" but is not in position 4 in the secret word. So E must be in one of positions 0, 1, 2, or 3.

We also note that the word does not have A, I, or S, so we avoid those.

Common consonants that we haven't tested yet: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that includes R and E, and also tests other common letters.

One idea: use a word that has R and E in positions that are different from the first guess, and also includes other common letters.

For example, let's try to put R in position 1 or 2 and E in position 0 or 2, etc.

Possible words:

We know the word must have R and E, and avoid A, I, S.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common letters like T, N, O, L.

Example words:
  - ""TREED"": but that has two E's? and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. However, we know the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one E and one R. But if the word had two R's, then we would have seen one R marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each occurrence. However, if the word has two R's, then if one is in the correct position we get a check, and the other might be marked as absent or present depending on the position.

But in our case, we only have one R and one E in the guess. So we don't know if the word has more than one of these.

To maximize information, we might avoid duplicates in the next guess? But we are constrained by the fact that we must include R and E.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and E and three new letters.

Let me try to list some words without A, I, S and with R and E:

- ""ROUTE"": but R is in position 0 again? We know R is not at position 0? Actually, the feedback said R is present but not at position 0. So we cannot put R at position 0. So ""ROUTE"" is invalid because R is at 0.

- ""CREST"": but C is not tested, but we have S? We cannot use S because we know S is absent. So avoid S.

- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E. This has R at position 1 and E at position 4. But note: in the feedback, E was not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4. Therefore, ""TROPE"" has E at the end (position 4) which is not allowed.

- ""ENTER"": This has E at position 0 and 3, and R at position 4. But we have two E's. Also, we don't know if the word has two E's. But let's check the positions: 
  - E at position 0: that's allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4, but it could be at 0.
  - However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters. But we are trying to test new letters. Also, we have T and N.

But note: the word ""ENTER"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But if we use it, we might get information about T and N.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and E.

In ""ENTER"":
  - E at 0: allowed (since we only know E is not at 4, so 0 is okay)
  - R at 4: but we know from the first guess that E was at 4 and that was wrong? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So position 4 is not allowed for E? But what about R? The feedback for R was that it is not at position 0. There was no feedback about position 4 for R. So R can be at 4.

But wait: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. That doesn't say anything about R at position 4. So R can be at 4.

So ""ENTER"" is a candidate? But let's see: 
  - It has E at position 0 and 3, and R at 4.
  - We avoid A, I, S.

But we are using two E's. We might not get as much information because we are repeating a letter. Also, we already know E is in the word, so we are only testing two new letters (T and N) and one known letter (R) in a new position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new letters without repetition.

Another candidate: ""ROBED"" -> but R is at 0? We cannot use R at 0.

How about ""BORED"": 
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is at position 2 (which is allowed, since it wasn't at 0 and we don't know about 2)
  - E is at position 3 (which is allowed, because we only know it's not at 4)

But we have to check if we are avoiding A, I, S: yes.

Another: ""LURED"": 
  - L, U, R, E, D -> R at 2, E at 3. Also avoids A, I, S.

But we don't know if U or L are in the word.

Another: ""CREDO"": 
  - C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is not at 4. Also, we test C, D, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CREDO"" is a valid word.

However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess had R and E as present. We are now putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. This might be correct or not.

But we are also testing three new letters: C, D, O.

Another candidate: ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2. This is also good.

But note: we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that is allowed? The feedback only said E is not at 4, so 2 is okay.

We have to avoid the known absent letters: A, I, S.

I think ""CREDO"" and ""TREND"" are both good.

But let me think: we also want to cover more common letters. T, N, D are very common.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? But we don't have enough information.

Another idea: since R is not at 0 and E is not at 4, we can try to put R at 1 and E at 0? But E at 0: that is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4.

For example: ""REACT"" -> but we cannot use A. So avoid.

""REBUT"": 
  - R at 0? We cannot put R at 0. So no.

""BERTH"": 
  - B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is at 1 (which is allowed). We test B, T, H.

But we have to avoid A, I, S: yes.

""BERTH"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing the options:

  - ""CREDO"": tests C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2.
  - ""TREND"": tests T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2.
  - ""BERTH"": tests B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2.

We already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing three new letters in each.

I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because T, N, D are very common.

But note: we are putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. We don't know if that is correct, but it's a possibility.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that we haven't tried at all. In the first guess, R was at 0 and E at 4. Now we are avoiding those. So positions 1,2,3 for R and 0,1,2,3 for E.

In ""TREND"", R is at 1 and E at 2.

Another possibility: ""DETER"" -> but that has two E's and we are repeating. Also, E at 4 is not allowed? We have E at 1 and 4? But we cannot put E at 4. So we avoid.

I think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there is a word that uses R and E and also includes other common letters we haven't tested, and avoids the forbidden positions.

Another candidate: ""OPTER"" -> not a common word? Also, O, P, T, E, R -> R at 4? That's allowed. E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing O, P, T.

But ""OPTER"" might not be a word? Actually, I think ""OPTED"" is a word but that has D. ""OPTED"" has E at 3 and D at 4. But then we are not including R? We must include R and E.

We need both R and E.

""PORTER"" is 6 letters. So no.

""PRONE"": 
  - P, R, O, N, E -> R at 1, E at 4. But we cannot put E at 4? Because the feedback said E is not at 4. So invalid.

""CRONE"": 
  - C, R, O, N, E -> same problem: E at 4.

So we must avoid E at 4.

Therefore, words ending with E are not allowed for this guess.

So ""TREND"" ends with D, so that's okay.

Similarly, ""CREDO"" ends with O, okay.

""BERTH"" ends with H, okay.

I think I'll go with ""TREND"" because it tests T, N, D which are common.

But note: we are putting R at 1 and E at 2. If the secret word has R at 1 and E at 2, then we get two checks. But if not, we get information about the positions of R and E.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that are not 1 and 2? For example, R at 3 and E at 0.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E at 3, R at 4. But E at 3 is allowed? Yes. R at 4 is allowed? Yes. But we are testing U, M, B which are less common.

I think ""TREND"" is better.

Another word: ""TREAD"" -> but we cannot use A.

""TREND"" seems good.

So I choose ""TREND"".

But let me double-check: 
  - T, R, E, N, D
  - We avoid A, I, S.
  - R is at position 1 (not 0) -> allowed.
  - E is at position 2 (not 4) -> allowed.

We are testing T, N, D.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TREND"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is absent (marked as x).
- I is absent (marked as x).
- S is absent (marked as x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are not in the word.
- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is incorrect).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess:
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.
- Include R and E in new positions (not position 1 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TREND"" fits these criteria:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, not 1).
  - E is in position 3 (new position, not 5).
  - Tests T, N, D (common letters not yet evaluated).
  - Valid 5-letter word without A, I, S.

This guess maximizes information by covering new letters and repositioning known letters.

But we don\'t have enough information.\n\nAnother idea: since R is not at 0 and E is not at 4, we can try to put R at 1 and E at 0? But E at 0: that is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4.\n\nFor example: ""REACT"" -> but we cannot use A. So avoid.\n\n""REBUT"": \n  - R at 0? We cannot put R at 0. So no.\n\n""BERTH"": \n  - B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is at 1 (which is allowed). We test B, T, H.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, I, S: yes.\n\n""BERTH"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n  - ""CREDO"": tests C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2.\n  - ""TREND"": tests T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2.\n  - ""BERTH"": tests B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2.\n\nWe already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing three new letters in each.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is a good choice because T, N, D are very common.\n\nBut note: we are putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. We don\'t know if that is correct, but it\'s a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that we haven\'t tried at all. In the first guess, R was at 0 and E at 4. Now we are avoiding those. So positions 1,2,3 for R and 0,1,2,3 for E.\n\nIn ""TREND"", R is at 1 and E at 2.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DETER"" -> but that has two E\'s and we are repeating. Also, E at 4 is not allowed? We have E at 1 and 4? But we cannot put E at 4. So we avoid.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that uses R and E and also includes other common letters we haven\'t tested, and avoids the forbidden positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OPTER"" -> not a common word? Also, O, P, T, E, R -> R at 4? That\'s allowed. E at 3? That\'s allowed. But we are testing O, P, T.\n\nBut ""OPTER"" might not be a word? Actually, I think ""OPTED"" is a word but that has D. ""OPTED"" has E at 3 and D at 4. But then we are not including R? We must include R and E.\n\nWe need both R and E.\n\n""PORTER"" is 6 letters. So no.\n\n""PRONE"": \n  - P, R, O, N, E -> R at 1, E at 4. But we cannot put E at 4? Because the feedback said E is not at 4. So invalid.\n\n""CRONE"": \n  - C, R, O, N, E -> same problem: E at 4.\n\nSo we must avoid E at 4.\n\nTherefore, words ending with E are not allowed for this guess.\n\nSo ""TREND"" ends with D, so that\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""CREDO"" ends with O, okay.\n\n""BERTH"" ends with H, okay.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""TREND"" because it tests T, N, D which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting R at 1 and E at 2. If the secret word has R at 1 and E at 2, then we get two checks. But if not, we get information about the positions of R and E.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that are not 1 and 2? For example, R at 3 and E at 0.\n\nExample: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E at 3, R at 4. But E at 3 is allowed? Yes. R at 4 is allowed? Yes. But we are testing U, M, B which are less common.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""TREAD"" -> but we cannot use A.\n\n""TREND"" seems good.\n\nSo I choose ""TREND"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  - T, R, E, N, D\n  - We avoid A, I, S.\n  - R is at position 1 (not 0) -> allowed.\n  - E is at position 2 (not 4) -> allowed.\n\nWe are testing T, N, D.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""TREND"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -).\n- A is absent (marked as x).\n- I is absent (marked as x).\n- S is absent (marked as x).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.\n- A, I, and S are not in the word.\n- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is incorrect).\n- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is incorrect).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid A, I, S entirely.\n- Include R and E in new positions (not position 1 for R, not position 5 for E).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, N, D) to gather more information.\n- ""TREND"" fits these criteria:\n  - R is in position 2 (new position, not 1).\n  - E is in position 3 (new position, not 5).\n  - Tests T, N, D (common letters not yet evaluated).\n  - Valid 5-letter word without A, I, S.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by covering new letters and repositioning known letters.\n\n<guess>trend</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""raise"" -> R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
  - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).
  A, I, S are not in the word at all.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4).

Second guess: ""trend"" -> T(-), R(✓), E(✓), N(x), D(x)
Interpretation:
  - T is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).
  - R is correct and at position 2 (index 1) because in ""trend"", R is at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked correct.
  - E is correct and at position 3 (index 2) because in ""trend"", E is at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked correct.
  - N and D are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
  - The secret word has R at position 1 (zero-based index 1) and E at position 2 (zero-based index 2). That means the word is: _ R E _ _
  - Additionally, we know T is in the word but not at position 0 (so it must be at position 3 or 4, since positions 0,1,2 are occupied by ?, R, E).
  - We also know that A, I, S, N, D are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the pattern: [letter] R E [letter] [letter]

The known letters:
  - Must include T (somewhere, but not at index 0) and the letters R and E at fixed positions.
  - We have two more letters to find.

Also, the letter at position 0 is not T (since T is not at index 0) and not any of A, I, S, N, D. Similarly, the letters at positions 3 and 4 must not be T? Wait no: T can be at position 3 or 4.

Moreover, we know that the word does not contain A, I, S, N, D.

We have two positions to fill: position 0 and positions 3 and 4.

We also have the constraint that T must be in the word and at one of positions 3 or 4 (because it cannot be at 0, and positions 1 and 2 are taken by R and E, so only 3 or 4 are available for T).

Now, we can make a guess that respects:
  - Position 1 must be R (known correct).
  - Position 2 must be E (known correct).
  - We must include T in one of positions 3 or 4 (since it's present but not at 0).
  - We avoid A, I, S, N, D.

We also want to test letters for the unknown positions: position 0 and whichever of position 3/4 doesn't have T.

But note: we don't know which of position 3 or 4 has T? Actually, we know T is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, but we don't know which one.

So our guess should test:
  - Position 0: we need to guess a letter for that.
  - And we need to put T in either position 3 or 4 to check.

We also have to consider that the letter at position 3 or 4 might not be T? Actually, no: T must be at one of them. So if we put T in position 3 and get feedback that it's wrong (x or -) then it must be at position 4.

But we can also test another letter for one position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two new letters: one at position 0 and one at position 3 OR 4, and put T in the other position.

We have only 6 guesses and we are on the third guess. We have a lot of information.

The pattern: [letter] R E [T?] [different letter?]

But note: we don't know which of the last two positions has T.

We must choose a valid English word.

List of possibilities:

We know the word has T, so it must be at 3 or 4.

Case 1: T at position 3 -> pattern: _ R E T _
Case 2: T at position 4 -> pattern: _ R E _ T

We need to fill the other positions.

Also, the first letter: cannot be A, I, S, N, D, and also not T (since T is at 3 or 4 and we can't repeat? We don't know if the word allows repeats. But note: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we haven't tested for duplicates either).

So let's assume for the moment that all letters are distinct, but we cannot count on it.

We'll avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Possible words:

For case 1: ? R E T ? -> words ending with T at position 3? Then position 4 is the last letter.

But note: position 3 is index 3, and position 4 is index 4.

Examples: 
  - ""CRET"": not 5 letters.
  - We need 5 letters: first letter, then R, E, T, then last letter.

Some words: ""GREET"" -> but G at 0, then R, E, T? But we have two E's? And also E at position 1? No: the word would be G R E E T? Wait: that's five: G, R, E, E, T? But we have E at index 2 and then E again? The feedback from the first guess had E marked as present but not at the end? Here we are putting E at index 2 and again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But note: in the first guess, we had one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't tell us if there are more.

But in ""trend"", we had E at index 2 and that was correct, so if there is another E, it would be a duplicate.

However, ""GREET"" has two E's? Actually, it has E at index 2 and index 3? But we are trying to put T at index 3, so it would be G R E T. But that's only 4 letters? Wait: GREET is 5: G, R, E, E, T? So positions: 
  - index0: G
  - index1: R
  - index2: E
  - index3: E -> but we want T? So no.

We want the pattern: _ (0) R(1) E(2) T(3) ?(4)

So words like: 
  - ""TRUET"": not a word.
  - ""WREST"": but S is absent? We know S is absent. So no.

Words with T at position 3:

  - ""CRET"": not a word.
  - ""PRET"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps it's better to think of words that match the known pattern.

We know R at index1 and E at index2.

So words: ...R E ... 

With T at either position 3 or 4.

And the previous absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.

So possible letters for position0: since no A,I,S,N,D, and not T (if we assume no duplicate T? But we don't know), but we haven't ruled out duplicates.

To be safe, let's try to avoid duplicates until forced.

Position0 can be: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But common letters.

Similarly, for the last position: same set.

But we also must include T if we don't put it at position0? No: we must include T, so if we don't put it at position3 or 4, but we have only those positions left? Actually, position0 cannot be T because we know T is not at position0 from the second guess feedback.

So T must be at 3 or 4.

Therefore, we must assign T to either position3 or position4.

Now, let's make a guess that will help us determine the position of T and also test new letters.

We can set:

Option: Put T at position3 and a new letter at position4? But then position0 must be a letter we haven't tested.

Similarly, put T at position4 and a new letter at position3.

But we also have to choose position0.

So our next guess should:

  - Have R at index1 and E at index2.
  - Have T at index3 OR at index4 (we choose one arbitrarily, to test).
  - Choose a letter for the other unknown position (if T at 3, then we choose position4 and position0; if T at 4, then we choose position3 and position0).

But we have two more unknown positions: position0 and either position3 or position4 (depending on where we put T).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We haven't tested: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But many are less common.

Common letters: O, U, L, C, M, P.

We can choose a word that uses two of these.

But note: we must form a valid word.

Possible words with T at position3:
  - ? R E T ?: 
      ""URET"" ? not 5. 
      ""CRET"" not a word.
      ""GRETA"": but A is absent.
      ""FRET"": 4 letters.
      I can't think of any? Maybe ""BREW"" but that would be 4 letters? 

Wait, 5-letter words:
  - ""PRETZ"": not common? Actually, pretzel is 7.
  - ""PREXY"": not common.
  - ""WRECK"": but we know S? No S, but W, R, E, C, K -> W at0, R at1, E at2, C at3, K at4. But we want T at3? So not.

Actually, we cannot put T at3? Because the word must have T. But if we put T at3, then the word must be _ R E T ?, and that ? must be a letter that makes a word.

Possible words: 
  - ""TREET"" -> no, that would be T R E E T? And E would be duplicate and T duplicate? Also, we have E at2 and then E at3? But we want T at3.

Perhaps ""GREET"" again? But that has E at3, not T.

Alternatively, T at position4:

Pattern: ? R E ? T

Examples:
  - ""FORET"": not a word? Forest? But ends with ST? and S is absent? 
  - ""CREST"": S is absent? So no.
  - ""GRUNT"": N is absent? But we know N is absent? From the second guess: N was marked absent? Yes, so we avoid N.

Possibilities: 
  - ""BRETT"": B R E T T? So T at3 and T at4? Duplicate T? But we know T is present? Possibly. Also, we avoid A,I,S,N,D.

Or ""CREST"" has S which is absent.

Another: ""WREST"": but S absent.

""PURE""? Not 5.

""BREW"" only 4.

""FORET"" is not common? But Foret is a surname? Not a common word.

Another: ""FRET"": 4 letters.

Well-known words: 
  - ""GREET"": but that doesn't end with T? It ends with T? G R E E T -> not, it ends with T? Actually, GREET: let's check: 
      G - 0
      R - 1? but wait: in our pattern, R must be at index1, but if we put ""GREET"": 
          G at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But then index3 is E, which is not T? So we want the fourth letter (index3) to be a letter and then T at index4? That works? But we have an extra E? 

But wait: we need the pattern: ? R E ? T.

So for ""GREET"": 
  - position0: G
  - position1: R -> matches
  - position2: E -> matches
  - position3: E -> we are testing this (could be E, but we don't know if duplicates allowed)
  - position4: T -> then T is at4.

But we avoid including absent letters? We haven't tested E at position3? And it might be present? But we already have E at2, and we know E is present? But if there is a duplicate E, we don't know.

But the second guess ""trend"" had one E and it was at2 and correct. If the secret word has two E's, then we might not have known? But the feedback only tells us about what we guess.

But ""GREET"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we must make sure we don't break known absent letters: A,I,S,N,D. ""GREET"" doesn't have them? True.

However, in ""GREET"", we are testing:
  - G at0
  - R(known correct) at1
  - E(known correct) at2
  - E at3: this is a duplicate? If the word has only one E, then it might be marked absent? But we know E is in the word, so if it's duplicated, we might get present? But if the secret word does not have E at3, we will get feedback.

But we are also testing T at4.

Another candidate: ""CREPT"": 
  - C at0, R at1, E at2, P at3, T at4? This is a valid word.
  - Avoids A,I,S,N,D.
  - Tests C and P.

Also, ""BREW"" is only 4.

Another candidate: ""FREET""???? Not a word.

Good one: ""FREMT"" not.

But ""CREPT"" is a word. Similarly, ""TRAPT"" not.

Also, ""PREKT"" not.

""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T.

Yes, that works.

Another: ""BERET"": but E at position3 and T at4? But we have B and E? B R E E T? And E at3? 
  - But B is new.

But same duplicate E issue.

We have CREPT and GREET and BERET.

To minimize duplicates, let's choose ""CREPT"" because it does not duplicate any known letter? We don't know about C and P.

Similarly, ""BREWT"", not a word.

""PLENT"" has N? But N is absent? So avoid.

I think ""CREPT"" is a good candidate.

We can test C at0 and P at3, and put T at4.

But we have to remember that if T is in the word and we put it at4, and if it's correct, then good. If not, then T must be at position3? Actually, we know T must be at either 3 or 4? But we are putting at4? If we get feedback that T is not correct at4 (like marked - or x), that would mean T is not at4? But wait: feedback: if T is at4 and we put it, then we get ✓? But if T is at3 and we put it at4, we get x? But no: if T is in the word but at a different position, it would be marked as -? Only if it's not present at all, it would be x.

But we know T is present? So if we put T at4 and the actual word has T at3, then we expect T to be marked as absent (x) at position4? No: actually, if T is in the word but not at position4, and if we put T at4, and the word has T at3, then we are guessing T for two different positions? Actually, the feedback will only say that T at4 is not present? But it doesn't tell about the other positions? More accurately, if T is in the word (at position3) and we put T at4, then we get:
  - The T at4 is not in the word? But wait, the T at4 would be marked as absent (x) only if there is no other T? But if there is already a T at3, and we haven't guessed that position? Then the feedback for the T at4 might be marked as - (present elsewhere)? Actually, it depends on how the rules work: if the word has only one T, then it would be marked as absent. But if it has two T's, then it would be marked as -? 

But the secret word might have duplicate T? We don't know.

This complicates.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in our guess at a position that might be wrong? Instead, we can test the positions separately? But then we lose efficiency.

We know T is present and must be at 3 or 4.

So we can do:

Guess: put T at position 3 and put a different letter at position 4? And then we choose position0.

That way, if T is at3, we get a ✓ or -? But since we are guessing at the correct position? If we put T at3 and the secret word has T at3, it will be ✓. If the secret word has T at4, then we are putting T at3? Then we get marked as -? Because T is present but in the wrong position? 

Similarly, if we put T at4, then if it's at4 we get ✓; if it's at3 and not at4, we get -? 

In both cases, we can pinpoint T's position.

But also, we will have our tested letters at the other positions.

I think ""CREPT"" is a good choice because:
  - C at0: new letter tested? 
  - R at1: already correct
  - E at2: already correct
  - P at3: new letter? 
  - T at4: which we know is present? But we put at4? If T is actually at4, it will be ✓? If not, it will be marked as - (since T is present elsewhere) or x (if there is no duplicate)? But we know there is at least one T? So if it's not at4, it will be -.

Also, ""CREPT"" is a valid word: past tense of creep? Or crept.

The feedback will tell us:

  - If T is marked as ✓ at4? Then T is at4? And P at3 is tested.
  - If T is marked as - or x? Then T is not at4? Then T must be at3? And we know P at3 might or might not be correct? But if T is marked as - for position4, then it means T is in the word and not at4? Since we know only positions 3 and4 are possible, then T must be at3? So then the secret word has T at3? So then P would have to be not correct? Because position3 is occupied by T? So we expect P to be absent? 

Alternatively, let's not get ahead.

We'll know after the feedback.

But note: we don't want to waste a guess by having two guesses covered? But we are covering C and P? And also testing T at4.

We could choose a word that puts T at3? 

For example: choose a word with pattern: C R E T ? -> but then what? ""CRET"" not 5? ""CRETS"" -> S absent? ""CRETO"" not valid? 

Another: ""PRET"": not 5.

So maybe it is better to put T at4? Because we have more candidate words.

We can consider:

""BERET"": 
  - B at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But E at3? 
  - Feedback for E at3: if it's not in the word? But we know E is in the word? So if the secret word does not have two E's, then E at3 will be marked as absent? If it does, then present? 

Same issue.

""CREPT"" seems better because it doesn't duplicate any known letters? We haven't used C and P? And no conflict.

So I choose ""CREPT"".

We can also consider ""WRECK"" -> but W, R, E, C, K -> then index3 is C? and index4 is K? But then T is missing? We know T is in the word? So we must include T? Therefore, we must put T at one of the last two positions.

So we cannot use ""WRECK"" because it doesn't include T? 

So ""CREPT"" is good.

Another: ""BRENT"": but N absent.

""CROFT"": O, F? But T in position4? yes: C, R, O, F, T -> then index3 is F? But no T at3? Actually, it ends with T? But does it have T required? But N absent? Avoid N.

Yes.

But ""CREPT"" is known to me.

Final choice: ""CREPT"".

So third guess: ""CREPT""

Let's summarize:
  - We have to respect fixed R at1 and E at2.
  - T must be placed at position4? in this guess? But we are testing if T is at4.
  - We are testing C at0 and P at3.

<guess>crept</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the previous feedback:
- From ""raise"": R and E are in the word but not in positions 0 or 4 respectively; A, I, S are absent.
- From ""trend"": R is correct at position 1 and E is correct at position 2; T is present but not at position 0; N and D are absent.

Thus, the word structure is: _ R E _ _
- Positions 1 and 2 are fixed as R and E.
- T must be present, but not in position 0 (from ""trend"" feedback), leaving positions 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.

For the third guess:
- Position 1 is R ✓ (must stay).
- Position 2 is E ✓ (must stay).
- Position 4 is set to T to test if it belongs there (since it must be in position 3 or 4).
- Position 3 is assigned P to test a new consonant.
- Position 0 is assigned C to test a new consonant.
- This forms ""CREPT"", a valid 5-letter word that tests:
  - C at position 0 (unknown).
  - P at position 3 (unknown).
  - T at position 4 (suspected position).

This guess efficiently tests T's location while probing two new letters (C, P) without repeating known absent letters.

<guess>crept</guess>",crept,"We are given the feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""raise"" -> R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
  - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).
  A, I, S are not in the word at all.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4).

Second guess: ""trend"" -> T(-), R(✓), E(✓), N(x), D(x)
Interpretation:
  - T is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).
  - R is correct and at position 2 (index 1) because in ""trend"", R is at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked correct.
  - E is correct and at position 3 (index 2) because in ""trend"", E is at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked correct.
  - N and D are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
  - The secret word has R at position 1 (zero-based index 1) and E at position 2 (zero-based index 2). That means the word is: _ R E _ _
  - Additionally, we know T is in the word but not at position 0 (so it must be at position 3 or 4, since positions 0,1,2 are occupied by ?, R, E).
  - We also know that A, I, S, N, D are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the pattern: [letter] R E [letter] [letter]

The known letters:
  - Must include T (somewhere, but not at index 0) and the letters R and E at fixed positions.
  - We have two more letters to find.

Also, the letter at position 0 is not T (since T is not at index 0) and not any of A, I, S, N, D. Similarly, the letters at positions 3 and 4 must not be T? Wait no: T can be at position 3 or 4.

Moreover, we know that the word does not contain A, I, S, N, D.

We have two positions to fill: position 0 and positions 3 and 4.

We also have the constraint that T must be in the word and at one of positions 3 or 4 (because it cannot be at 0, and positions 1 and 2 are taken by R and E, so only 3 or 4 are available for T).

Now, we can make a guess that respects:
  - Position 1 must be R (known correct).
  - Position 2 must be E (known correct).
  - We must include T in one of positions 3 or 4 (since it's present but not at 0).
  - We avoid A, I, S, N, D.

We also want to test letters for the unknown positions: position 0 and whichever of position 3/4 doesn't have T.

But note: we don't know which of position 3 or 4 has T? Actually, we know T is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, but we don't know which one.

So our guess should test:
  - Position 0: we need to guess a letter for that.
  - And we need to put T in either position 3 or 4 to check.

We also have to consider that the letter at position 3 or 4 might not be T? Actually, no: T must be at one of them. So if we put T in position 3 and get feedback that it's wrong (x or -) then it must be at position 4.

But we can also test another letter for one position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two new letters: one at position 0 and one at position 3 OR 4, and put T in the other position.

We have only 6 guesses and we are on the third guess. We have a lot of information.

The pattern: [letter] R E [T?] [different letter?]

But note: we don't know which of the last two positions has T.

We must choose a valid English word.

List of possibilities:

We know the word has T, so it must be at 3 or 4.

Case 1: T at position 3 -> pattern: _ R E T _
Case 2: T at position 4 -> pattern: _ R E _ T

We need to fill the other positions.

Also, the first letter: cannot be A, I, S, N, D, and also not T (since T is at 3 or 4 and we can't repeat? We don't know if the word allows repeats. But note: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we haven't tested for duplicates either).

So let's assume for the moment that all letters are distinct, but we cannot count on it.

We'll avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Possible words:

For case 1: ? R E T ? -> words ending with T at position 3? Then position 4 is the last letter.

But note: position 3 is index 3, and position 4 is index 4.

Examples: 
  - ""CRET"": not 5 letters.
  - We need 5 letters: first letter, then R, E, T, then last letter.

Some words: ""GREET"" -> but G at 0, then R, E, T? But we have two E's? And also E at position 1? No: the word would be G R E E T? Wait: that's five: G, R, E, E, T? But we have E at index 2 and then E again? The feedback from the first guess had E marked as present but not at the end? Here we are putting E at index 2 and again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But note: in the first guess, we had one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't tell us if there are more.

But in ""trend"", we had E at index 2 and that was correct, so if there is another E, it would be a duplicate.

However, ""GREET"" has two E's? Actually, it has E at index 2 and index 3? But we are trying to put T at index 3, so it would be G R E T. But that's only 4 letters? Wait: GREET is 5: G, R, E, E, T? So positions: 
  - index0: G
  - index1: R
  - index2: E
  - index3: E -> but we want T? So no.

We want the pattern: _ (0) R(1) E(2) T(3) ?(4)

So words like: 
  - ""TRUET"": not a word.
  - ""WREST"": but S is absent? We know S is absent. So no.

Words with T at position 3:

  - ""CRET"": not a word.
  - ""PRET"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps it's better to think of words that match the known pattern.

We know R at index1 and E at index2.

So words: ...R E ... 

With T at either position 3 or 4.

And the previous absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.

So possible letters for position0: since no A,I,S,N,D, and not T (if we assume no duplicate T? But we don't know), but we haven't ruled out duplicates.

To be safe, let's try to avoid duplicates until forced.

Position0 can be: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But common letters.

Similarly, for the last position: same set.

But we also must include T if we don't put it at position0? No: we must include T, so if we don't put it at position3 or 4, but we have only those positions left? Actually, position0 cannot be T because we know T is not at position0 from the second guess feedback.

So T must be at 3 or 4.

Therefore, we must assign T to either position3 or position4.

Now, let's make a guess that will help us determine the position of T and also test new letters.

We can set:

Option: Put T at position3 and a new letter at position4? But then position0 must be a letter we haven't tested.

Similarly, put T at position4 and a new letter at position3.

But we also have to choose position0.

So our next guess should:

  - Have R at index1 and E at index2.
  - Have T at index3 OR at index4 (we choose one arbitrarily, to test).
  - Choose a letter for the other unknown position (if T at 3, then we choose position4 and position0; if T at 4, then we choose position3 and position0).

But we have two more unknown positions: position0 and either position3 or position4 (depending on where we put T).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We haven't tested: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But many are less common.

Common letters: O, U, L, C, M, P.

We can choose a word that uses two of these.

But note: we must form a valid word.

Possible words with T at position3:
  - ? R E T ?: 
      ""URET"" ? not 5. 
      ""CRET"" not a word.
      ""GRETA"": but A is absent.
      ""FRET"": 4 letters.
      I can't think of any? Maybe ""BREW"" but that would be 4 letters? 

Wait, 5-letter words:
  - ""PRETZ"": not common? Actually, pretzel is 7.
  - ""PREXY"": not common.
  - ""WRECK"": but we know S? No S, but W, R, E, C, K -> W at0, R at1, E at2, C at3, K at4. But we want T at3? So not.

Actually, we cannot put T at3? Because the word must have T. But if we put T at3, then the word must be _ R E T ?, and that ? must be a letter that makes a word.

Possible words: 
  - ""TREET"" -> no, that would be T R E E T? And E would be duplicate and T duplicate? Also, we have E at2 and then E at3? But we want T at3.

Perhaps ""GREET"" again? But that has E at3, not T.

Alternatively, T at position4:

Pattern: ? R E ? T

Examples:
  - ""FORET"": not a word? Forest? But ends with ST? and S is absent? 
  - ""CREST"": S is absent? So no.
  - ""GRUNT"": N is absent? But we know N is absent? From the second guess: N was marked absent? Yes, so we avoid N.

Possibilities: 
  - ""BRETT"": B R E T T? So T at3 and T at4? Duplicate T? But we know T is present? Possibly. Also, we avoid A,I,S,N,D.

Or ""CREST"" has S which is absent.

Another: ""WREST"": but S absent.

""PURE""? Not 5.

""BREW"" only 4.

""FORET"" is not common? But Foret is a surname? Not a common word.

Another: ""FRET"": 4 letters.

Well-known words: 
  - ""GREET"": but that doesn't end with T? It ends with T? G R E E T -> not, it ends with T? Actually, GREET: let's check: 
      G - 0
      R - 1? but wait: in our pattern, R must be at index1, but if we put ""GREET"": 
          G at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But then index3 is E, which is not T? So we want the fourth letter (index3) to be a letter and then T at index4? That works? But we have an extra E? 

But wait: we need the pattern: ? R E ? T.

So for ""GREET"": 
  - position0: G
  - position1: R -> matches
  - position2: E -> matches
  - position3: E -> we are testing this (could be E, but we don't know if duplicates allowed)
  - position4: T -> then T is at4.

But we avoid including absent letters? We haven't tested E at position3? And it might be present? But we already have E at2, and we know E is present? But if there is a duplicate E, we don't know.

But the second guess ""trend"" had one E and it was at2 and correct. If the secret word has two E's, then we might not have known? But the feedback only tells us about what we guess.

But ""GREET"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we must make sure we don't break known absent letters: A,I,S,N,D. ""GREET"" doesn't have them? True.

However, in ""GREET"", we are testing:
  - G at0
  - R(known correct) at1
  - E(known correct) at2
  - E at3: this is a duplicate? If the word has only one E, then it might be marked absent? But we know E is in the word, so if it's duplicated, we might get present? But if the secret word does not have E at3, we will get feedback.

But we are also testing T at4.

Another candidate: ""CREPT"": 
  - C at0, R at1, E at2, P at3, T at4? This is a valid word.
  - Avoids A,I,S,N,D.
  - Tests C and P.

Also, ""BREW"" is only 4.

Another candidate: ""FREET""???? Not a word.

Good one: ""FREMT"" not.

But ""CREPT"" is a word. Similarly, ""TRAPT"" not.

Also, ""PREKT"" not.

""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T.

Yes, that works.

Another: ""BERET"": but E at position3 and T at4? But we have B and E? B R E E T? And E at3? 
  - But B is new.

But same duplicate E issue.

We have CREPT and GREET and BERET.

To minimize duplicates, let's choose ""CREPT"" because it does not duplicate any known letter? We don't know about C and P.

Similarly, ""BREWT"", not a word.

""PLENT"" has N? But N is absent? So avoid.

I think ""CREPT"" is a good candidate.

We can test C at0 and P at3, and put T at4.

But we have to remember that if T is in the word and we put it at4, and if it's correct, then good. If not, then T must be at position3? Actually, we know T must be at either 3 or 4? But we are putting at4? If we get feedback that T is not correct at4 (like marked - or x), that would mean T is not at4? But wait: feedback: if T is at4 and we put it, then we get ✓? But if T is at3 and we put it at4, we get x? But no: if T is in the word but at a different position, it would be marked as -? Only if it's not present at all, it would be x.

But we know T is present? So if we put T at4 and the actual word has T at3, then we expect T to be marked as absent (x) at position4? No: actually, if T is in the word but not at position4, and if we put T at4, and the word has T at3, then we are guessing T for two different positions? Actually, the feedback will only say that T at4 is not present? But it doesn't tell about the other positions? More accurately, if T is in the word (at position3) and we put T at4, then we get:
  - The T at4 is not in the word? But wait, the T at4 would be marked as absent (x) only if there is no other T? But if there is already a T at3, and we haven't guessed that position? Then the feedback for the T at4 might be marked as - (present elsewhere)? Actually, it depends on how the rules work: if the word has only one T, then it would be marked as absent. But if it has two T's, then it would be marked as -? 

But the secret word might have duplicate T? We don't know.

This complicates.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in our guess at a position that might be wrong? Instead, we can test the positions separately? But then we lose efficiency.

We know T is present and must be at 3 or 4.

So we can do:

Guess: put T at position 3 and put a different letter at position 4? And then we choose position0.

That way, if T is at3, we get a ✓ or -? But since we are guessing at the correct position? If we put T at3 and the secret word has T at3, it will be ✓. If the secret word has T at4, then we are putting T at3? Then we get marked as -? Because T is present but in the wrong position? 

Similarly, if we put T at4, then if it's at4 we get ✓; if it's at3 and not at4, we get -? 

In both cases, we can pinpoint T's position.

But also, we will have our tested letters at the other positions.

I think ""CREPT"" is a good choice because:
  - C at0: new letter tested? 
  - R at1: already correct
  - E at2: already correct
  - P at3: new letter? 
  - T at4: which we know is present? But we put at4? If T is actually at4, it will be ✓? If not, it will be marked as - (since T is present elsewhere) or x (if there is no duplicate)? But we know there is at least one T? So if it's not at4, it will be -.

Also, ""CREPT"" is a valid word: past tense of creep? Or crept.

The feedback will tell us:

  - If T is marked as ✓ at4? Then T is at4? And P at3 is tested.
  - If T is marked as - or x? Then T is not at4? Then T must be at3? And we know P at3 might or might not be correct? But if T is marked as - for position4, then it means T is in the word and not at4? Since we know only positions 3 and4 are possible, then T must be at3? So then the secret word has T at3? So then P would have to be not correct? Because position3 is occupied by T? So we expect P to be absent? 

Alternatively, let's not get ahead.

We'll know after the feedback.

But note: we don't want to waste a guess by having two guesses covered? But we are covering C and P? And also testing T at4.

We could choose a word that puts T at3? 

For example: choose a word with pattern: C R E T ? -> but then what? ""CRET"" not 5? ""CRETS"" -> S absent? ""CRETO"" not valid? 

Another: ""PRET"": not 5.

So maybe it is better to put T at4? Because we have more candidate words.

We can consider:

""BERET"": 
  - B at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But E at3? 
  - Feedback for E at3: if it's not in the word? But we know E is in the word? So if the secret word does not have two E's, then E at3 will be marked as absent? If it does, then present? 

Same issue.

""CREPT"" seems better because it doesn't duplicate any known letters? We haven't used C and P? And no conflict.

So I choose ""CREPT"".

We can also consider ""WRECK"" -> but W, R, E, C, K -> then index3 is C? and index4 is K? But then T is missing? We know T is in the word? So we must include T? Therefore, we must put T at one of the last two positions.

So we cannot use ""WRECK"" because it doesn't include T? 

So ""CREPT"" is good.

Another: ""BRENT"": but N absent.

""CROFT"": O, F? But T in position4? yes: C, R, O, F, T -> then index3 is F? But no T at3? Actually, it ends with T? But does it have T required? But N absent? Avoid N.

Yes.

But ""CREPT"" is known to me.

Final choice: ""CREPT"".

So third guess: ""CREPT""

Let's summarize:
  - We have to respect fixed R at1 and E at2.
  - T must be placed at position4? in this guess? But we are testing if T is at4.
  - We are testing C at0 and P at3.

<guess>crept</guess>After reviewing the previous feedback:
- From ""raise"": R and E are in the word but not in positions 0 or 4 respectively; A, I, S are absent.
- From ""trend"": R is correct at position 1 and E is correct at position 2; T is present but not at position 0; N and D are absent.

Thus, the word structure is: _ R E _ _
- Positions 1 and 2 are fixed as R and E.
- T must be present, but not in position 0 (from ""trend"" feedback), leaving positions 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.

For the third guess:
- Position 1 is R ✓ (must stay).
- Position 2 is E ✓ (must stay).
- Position 4 is set to T to test if it belongs there (since it must be in position 3 or 4).
- Position 3 is assigned P to test a new consonant.
- Position 0 is assigned C to test a new consonant.
- This forms ""CREPT"", a valid 5-letter word that tests:
  - C at position 0 (unknown).
  - P at position 3 (unknown).
  - T at position 4 (suspected position).

This guess efficiently tests T's location while probing two new letters (C, P) without repeating known absent letters.",Guess 3: crept -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) E(✓) P(x) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,greet,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no information, we should choose a word that helps us gather as much information as possible.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize coverage.

 One common strategy is to use words that contain common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Therefore, my first guess is: RAISE

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the word)
  I: x (I is not in the word)
  S: x (S is not in the word)
  E: - (E is in the word but not in the last position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"".
    Specifically, R is not at position 1 (index 0) and E is not at position 4 (index 4).
  - The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.

We also know that the word does not contain A, I, or S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
  - Does not contain A, I, or S (since they are absent).
  - Includes the letters R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
  - We can also try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Since R and E are in the word, we know the word has at least these two letters.

Let's think about the positions:
  - R was in position 0 in ""raise"" but is not in position 0 in the secret word. So R must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - E was in position 4 in ""raise"" but is not in position 4 in the secret word. So E must be in one of positions 0, 1, 2, or 3.

We also note that the word does not have A, I, or S, so we avoid those.

Common consonants that we haven't tested yet: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that includes R and E, and also tests other common letters.

One idea: use a word that has R and E in positions that are different from the first guess, and also includes other common letters.

For example, let's try to put R in position 1 or 2 and E in position 0 or 2, etc.

Possible words:

We know the word must have R and E, and avoid A, I, S.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and use other common letters like T, N, O, L.

Example words:
  - ""TREED"": but that has two E's? and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess them. However, we know the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one E and one R. But if the word had two R's, then we would have seen one R marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each occurrence. However, if the word has two R's, then if one is in the correct position we get a check, and the other might be marked as absent or present depending on the position.

But in our case, we only have one R and one E in the guess. So we don't know if the word has more than one of these.

To maximize information, we might avoid duplicates in the next guess? But we are constrained by the fact that we must include R and E.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R and E and three new letters.

Let me try to list some words without A, I, S and with R and E:

- ""ROUTE"": but R is in position 0 again? We know R is not at position 0? Actually, the feedback said R is present but not at position 0. So we cannot put R at position 0. So ""ROUTE"" is invalid because R is at 0.

- ""CREST"": but C is not tested, but we have S? We cannot use S because we know S is absent. So avoid S.

- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E. This has R at position 1 and E at position 4. But note: in the feedback, E was not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4. Therefore, ""TROPE"" has E at the end (position 4) which is not allowed.

- ""ENTER"": This has E at position 0 and 3, and R at position 4. But we have two E's. Also, we don't know if the word has two E's. But let's check the positions: 
  - E at position 0: that's allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4, but it could be at 0.
  - However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters. But we are trying to test new letters. Also, we have T and N.

But note: the word ""ENTER"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But if we use it, we might get information about T and N.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and E.

In ""ENTER"":
  - E at 0: allowed (since we only know E is not at 4, so 0 is okay)
  - R at 4: but we know from the first guess that E was at 4 and that was wrong? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So position 4 is not allowed for E? But what about R? The feedback for R was that it is not at position 0. There was no feedback about position 4 for R. So R can be at 4.

But wait: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. That doesn't say anything about R at position 4. So R can be at 4.

So ""ENTER"" is a candidate? But let's see: 
  - It has E at position 0 and 3, and R at 4.
  - We avoid A, I, S.

But we are using two E's. We might not get as much information because we are repeating a letter. Also, we already know E is in the word, so we are only testing two new letters (T and N) and one known letter (R) in a new position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new letters without repetition.

Another candidate: ""ROBED"" -> but R is at 0? We cannot use R at 0.

How about ""BORED"": 
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is at position 2 (which is allowed, since it wasn't at 0 and we don't know about 2)
  - E is at position 3 (which is allowed, because we only know it's not at 4)

But we have to check if we are avoiding A, I, S: yes.

Another: ""LURED"": 
  - L, U, R, E, D -> R at 2, E at 3. Also avoids A, I, S.

But we don't know if U or L are in the word.

Another: ""CREDO"": 
  - C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is not at 4. Also, we test C, D, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CREDO"" is a valid word.

However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess had R and E as present. We are now putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. This might be correct or not.

But we are also testing three new letters: C, D, O.

Another candidate: ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2. This is also good.

But note: we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that is allowed? The feedback only said E is not at 4, so 2 is okay.

We have to avoid the known absent letters: A, I, S.

I think ""CREDO"" and ""TREND"" are both good.

But let me think: we also want to cover more common letters. T, N, D are very common.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? But we don't have enough information.

Another idea: since R is not at 0 and E is not at 4, we can try to put R at 1 and E at 0? But E at 0: that is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4.

For example: ""REACT"" -> but we cannot use A. So avoid.

""REBUT"": 
  - R at 0? We cannot put R at 0. So no.

""BERTH"": 
  - B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is at 1 (which is allowed). We test B, T, H.

But we have to avoid A, I, S: yes.

""BERTH"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing the options:

  - ""CREDO"": tests C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2.
  - ""TREND"": tests T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2.
  - ""BERTH"": tests B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2.

We already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing three new letters in each.

I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because T, N, D are very common.

But note: we are putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. We don't know if that is correct, but it's a possibility.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that we haven't tried at all. In the first guess, R was at 0 and E at 4. Now we are avoiding those. So positions 1,2,3 for R and 0,1,2,3 for E.

In ""TREND"", R is at 1 and E at 2.

Another possibility: ""DETER"" -> but that has two E's and we are repeating. Also, E at 4 is not allowed? We have E at 1 and 4? But we cannot put E at 4. So we avoid.

I think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there is a word that uses R and E and also includes other common letters we haven't tested, and avoids the forbidden positions.

Another candidate: ""OPTER"" -> not a common word? Also, O, P, T, E, R -> R at 4? That's allowed. E at 3? That's allowed. But we are testing O, P, T.

But ""OPTER"" might not be a word? Actually, I think ""OPTED"" is a word but that has D. ""OPTED"" has E at 3 and D at 4. But then we are not including R? We must include R and E.

We need both R and E.

""PORTER"" is 6 letters. So no.

""PRONE"": 
  - P, R, O, N, E -> R at 1, E at 4. But we cannot put E at 4? Because the feedback said E is not at 4. So invalid.

""CRONE"": 
  - C, R, O, N, E -> same problem: E at 4.

So we must avoid E at 4.

Therefore, words ending with E are not allowed for this guess.

So ""TREND"" ends with D, so that's okay.

Similarly, ""CREDO"" ends with O, okay.

""BERTH"" ends with H, okay.

I think I'll go with ""TREND"" because it tests T, N, D which are common.

But note: we are putting R at 1 and E at 2. If the secret word has R at 1 and E at 2, then we get two checks. But if not, we get information about the positions of R and E.

Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that are not 1 and 2? For example, R at 3 and E at 0.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E at 3, R at 4. But E at 3 is allowed? Yes. R at 4 is allowed? Yes. But we are testing U, M, B which are less common.

I think ""TREND"" is better.

Another word: ""TREAD"" -> but we cannot use A.

""TREND"" seems good.

So I choose ""TREND"".

But let me double-check: 
  - T, R, E, N, D
  - We avoid A, I, S.
  - R is at position 1 (not 0) -> allowed.
  - E is at position 2 (not 4) -> allowed.

We are testing T, N, D.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TREND"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is absent (marked as x).
- I is absent (marked as x).
- S is absent (marked as x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are not in the word.
- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is incorrect).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess:
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.
- Include R and E in new positions (not position 1 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, N, D) to gather more information.
- ""TREND"" fits these criteria:
  - R is in position 2 (new position, not 1).
  - E is in position 3 (new position, not 5).
  - Tests T, N, D (common letters not yet evaluated).
  - Valid 5-letter word without A, I, S.

This guess maximizes information by covering new letters and repositioning known letters.

<guess>trend</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""raise"" -> R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
  - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).
  A, I, S are not in the word at all.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4).

Second guess: ""trend"" -> T(-), R(✓), E(✓), N(x), D(x)
Interpretation:
  - T is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).
  - R is correct and at position 2 (index 1) because in ""trend"", R is at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked correct.
  - E is correct and at position 3 (index 2) because in ""trend"", E is at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked correct.
  - N and D are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
  - The secret word has R at position 1 (zero-based index 1) and E at position 2 (zero-based index 2). That means the word is: _ R E _ _
  - Additionally, we know T is in the word but not at position 0 (so it must be at position 3 or 4, since positions 0,1,2 are occupied by ?, R, E).
  - We also know that A, I, S, N, D are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the pattern: [letter] R E [letter] [letter]

The known letters:
  - Must include T (somewhere, but not at index 0) and the letters R and E at fixed positions.
  - We have two more letters to find.

Also, the letter at position 0 is not T (since T is not at index 0) and not any of A, I, S, N, D. Similarly, the letters at positions 3 and 4 must not be T? Wait no: T can be at position 3 or 4.

Moreover, we know that the word does not contain A, I, S, N, D.

We have two positions to fill: position 0 and positions 3 and 4.

We also have the constraint that T must be in the word and at one of positions 3 or 4 (because it cannot be at 0, and positions 1 and 2 are taken by R and E, so only 3 or 4 are available for T).

Now, we can make a guess that respects:
  - Position 1 must be R (known correct).
  - Position 2 must be E (known correct).
  - We must include T in one of positions 3 or 4 (since it's present but not at 0).
  - We avoid A, I, S, N, D.

We also want to test letters for the unknown positions: position 0 and whichever of position 3/4 doesn't have T.

But note: we don't know which of position 3 or 4 has T? Actually, we know T is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, but we don't know which one.

So our guess should test:
  - Position 0: we need to guess a letter for that.
  - And we need to put T in either position 3 or 4 to check.

We also have to consider that the letter at position 3 or 4 might not be T? Actually, no: T must be at one of them. So if we put T in position 3 and get feedback that it's wrong (x or -) then it must be at position 4.

But we can also test another letter for one position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two new letters: one at position 0 and one at position 3 OR 4, and put T in the other position.

We have only 6 guesses and we are on the third guess. We have a lot of information.

The pattern: [letter] R E [T?] [different letter?]

But note: we don't know which of the last two positions has T.

We must choose a valid English word.

List of possibilities:

We know the word has T, so it must be at 3 or 4.

Case 1: T at position 3 -> pattern: _ R E T _
Case 2: T at position 4 -> pattern: _ R E _ T

We need to fill the other positions.

Also, the first letter: cannot be A, I, S, N, D, and also not T (since T is at 3 or 4 and we can't repeat? We don't know if the word allows repeats. But note: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we haven't tested for duplicates either).

So let's assume for the moment that all letters are distinct, but we cannot count on it.

We'll avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Possible words:

For case 1: ? R E T ? -> words ending with T at position 3? Then position 4 is the last letter.

But note: position 3 is index 3, and position 4 is index 4.

Examples: 
  - ""CRET"": not 5 letters.
  - We need 5 letters: first letter, then R, E, T, then last letter.

Some words: ""GREET"" -> but G at 0, then R, E, T? But we have two E's? And also E at position 1? No: the word would be G R E E T? Wait: that's five: G, R, E, E, T? But we have E at index 2 and then E again? The feedback from the first guess had E marked as present but not at the end? Here we are putting E at index 2 and again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But note: in the first guess, we had one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't tell us if there are more.

But in ""trend"", we had E at index 2 and that was correct, so if there is another E, it would be a duplicate.

However, ""GREET"" has two E's? Actually, it has E at index 2 and index 3? But we are trying to put T at index 3, so it would be G R E T. But that's only 4 letters? Wait: GREET is 5: G, R, E, E, T? So positions: 
  - index0: G
  - index1: R
  - index2: E
  - index3: E -> but we want T? So no.

We want the pattern: _ (0) R(1) E(2) T(3) ?(4)

So words like: 
  - ""TRUET"": not a word.
  - ""WREST"": but S is absent? We know S is absent. So no.

Words with T at position 3:

  - ""CRET"": not a word.
  - ""PRET"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps it's better to think of words that match the known pattern.

We know R at index1 and E at index2.

So words: ...R E ... 

With T at either position 3 or 4.

And the previous absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.

So possible letters for position0: since no A,I,S,N,D, and not T (if we assume no duplicate T? But we don't know), but we haven't ruled out duplicates.

To be safe, let's try to avoid duplicates until forced.

Position0 can be: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But common letters.

Similarly, for the last position: same set.

But we also must include T if we don't put it at position0? No: we must include T, so if we don't put it at position3 or 4, but we have only those positions left? Actually, position0 cannot be T because we know T is not at position0 from the second guess feedback.

So T must be at 3 or 4.

Therefore, we must assign T to either position3 or position4.

Now, let's make a guess that will help us determine the position of T and also test new letters.

We can set:

Option: Put T at position3 and a new letter at position4? But then position0 must be a letter we haven't tested.

Similarly, put T at position4 and a new letter at position3.

But we also have to choose position0.

So our next guess should:

  - Have R at index1 and E at index2.
  - Have T at index3 OR at index4 (we choose one arbitrarily, to test).
  - Choose a letter for the other unknown position (if T at 3, then we choose position4 and position0; if T at 4, then we choose position3 and position0).

But we have two more unknown positions: position0 and either position3 or position4 (depending on where we put T).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We haven't tested: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But many are less common.

Common letters: O, U, L, C, M, P.

We can choose a word that uses two of these.

But note: we must form a valid word.

Possible words with T at position3:
  - ? R E T ?: 
      ""URET"" ? not 5. 
      ""CRET"" not a word.
      ""GRETA"": but A is absent.
      ""FRET"": 4 letters.
      I can't think of any? Maybe ""BREW"" but that would be 4 letters? 

Wait, 5-letter words:
  - ""PRETZ"": not common? Actually, pretzel is 7.
  - ""PREXY"": not common.
  - ""WRECK"": but we know S? No S, but W, R, E, C, K -> W at0, R at1, E at2, C at3, K at4. But we want T at3? So not.

Actually, we cannot put T at3? Because the word must have T. But if we put T at3, then the word must be _ R E T ?, and that ? must be a letter that makes a word.

Possible words: 
  - ""TREET"" -> no, that would be T R E E T? And E would be duplicate and T duplicate? Also, we have E at2 and then E at3? But we want T at3.

Perhaps ""GREET"" again? But that has E at3, not T.

Alternatively, T at position4:

Pattern: ? R E ? T

Examples:
  - ""FORET"": not a word? Forest? But ends with ST? and S is absent? 
  - ""CREST"": S is absent? So no.
  - ""GRUNT"": N is absent? But we know N is absent? From the second guess: N was marked absent? Yes, so we avoid N.

Possibilities: 
  - ""BRETT"": B R E T T? So T at3 and T at4? Duplicate T? But we know T is present? Possibly. Also, we avoid A,I,S,N,D.

Or ""CREST"" has S which is absent.

Another: ""WREST"": but S absent.

""PURE""? Not 5.

""BREW"" only 4.

""FORET"" is not common? But Foret is a surname? Not a common word.

Another: ""FRET"": 4 letters.

Well-known words: 
  - ""GREET"": but that doesn't end with T? It ends with T? G R E E T -> not, it ends with T? Actually, GREET: let's check: 
      G - 0
      R - 1? but wait: in our pattern, R must be at index1, but if we put ""GREET"": 
          G at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But then index3 is E, which is not T? So we want the fourth letter (index3) to be a letter and then T at index4? That works? But we have an extra E? 

But wait: we need the pattern: ? R E ? T.

So for ""GREET"": 
  - position0: G
  - position1: R -> matches
  - position2: E -> matches
  - position3: E -> we are testing this (could be E, but we don't know if duplicates allowed)
  - position4: T -> then T is at4.

But we avoid including absent letters? We haven't tested E at position3? And it might be present? But we already have E at2, and we know E is present? But if there is a duplicate E, we don't know.

But the second guess ""trend"" had one E and it was at2 and correct. If the secret word has two E's, then we might not have known? But the feedback only tells us about what we guess.

But ""GREET"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we must make sure we don't break known absent letters: A,I,S,N,D. ""GREET"" doesn't have them? True.

However, in ""GREET"", we are testing:
  - G at0
  - R(known correct) at1
  - E(known correct) at2
  - E at3: this is a duplicate? If the word has only one E, then it might be marked absent? But we know E is in the word, so if it's duplicated, we might get present? But if the secret word does not have E at3, we will get feedback.

But we are also testing T at4.

Another candidate: ""CREPT"": 
  - C at0, R at1, E at2, P at3, T at4? This is a valid word.
  - Avoids A,I,S,N,D.
  - Tests C and P.

Also, ""BREW"" is only 4.

Another candidate: ""FREET""???? Not a word.

Good one: ""FREMT"" not.

But ""CREPT"" is a word. Similarly, ""TRAPT"" not.

Also, ""PREKT"" not.

""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T.

Yes, that works.

Another: ""BERET"": but E at position3 and T at4? But we have B and E? B R E E T? And E at3? 
  - But B is new.

But same duplicate E issue.

We have CREPT and GREET and BERET.

To minimize duplicates, let's choose ""CREPT"" because it does not duplicate any known letter? We don't know about C and P.

Similarly, ""BREWT"", not a word.

""PLENT"" has N? But N is absent? So avoid.

I think ""CREPT"" is a good candidate.

We can test C at0 and P at3, and put T at4.

But we have to remember that if T is in the word and we put it at4, and if it's correct, then good. If not, then T must be at position3? Actually, we know T must be at either 3 or 4? But we are putting at4? If we get feedback that T is not correct at4 (like marked - or x), that would mean T is not at4? But wait: feedback: if T is at4 and we put it, then we get ✓? But if T is at3 and we put it at4, we get x? But no: if T is in the word but at a different position, it would be marked as -? Only if it's not present at all, it would be x.

But we know T is present? So if we put T at4 and the actual word has T at3, then we expect T to be marked as absent (x) at position4? No: actually, if T is in the word but not at position4, and if we put T at4, and the word has T at3, then we are guessing T for two different positions? Actually, the feedback will only say that T at4 is not present? But it doesn't tell about the other positions? More accurately, if T is in the word (at position3) and we put T at4, then we get:
  - The T at4 is not in the word? But wait, the T at4 would be marked as absent (x) only if there is no other T? But if there is already a T at3, and we haven't guessed that position? Then the feedback for the T at4 might be marked as - (present elsewhere)? Actually, it depends on how the rules work: if the word has only one T, then it would be marked as absent. But if it has two T's, then it would be marked as -? 

But the secret word might have duplicate T? We don't know.

This complicates.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in our guess at a position that might be wrong? Instead, we can test the positions separately? But then we lose efficiency.

We know T is present and must be at 3 or 4.

So we can do:

Guess: put T at position 3 and put a different letter at position 4? And then we choose position0.

That way, if T is at3, we get a ✓ or -? But since we are guessing at the correct position? If we put T at3 and the secret word has T at3, it will be ✓. If the secret word has T at4, then we are putting T at3? Then we get marked as -? Because T is present but in the wrong position? 

Similarly, if we put T at4, then if it's at4 we get ✓; if it's at3 and not at4, we get -? 

In both cases, we can pinpoint T's position.

But also, we will have our tested letters at the other positions.

I think ""CREPT"" is a good choice because:
  - C at0: new letter tested? 
  - R at1: already correct
  - E at2: already correct
  - P at3: new letter? 
  - T at4: which we know is present? But we put at4? If T is actually at4, it will be ✓? If not, it will be marked as - (since T is present elsewhere) or x (if there is no duplicate)? But we know there is at least one T? So if it's not at4, it will be -.

Also, ""CREPT"" is a valid word: past tense of creep? Or crept.

The feedback will tell us:

  - If T is marked as ✓ at4? Then T is at4? And P at3 is tested.
  - If T is marked as - or x? Then T is not at4? Then T must be at3? And we know P at3 might or might not be correct? But if T is marked as - for position4, then it means T is in the word and not at4? Since we know only positions 3 and4 are possible, then T must be at3? So then the secret word has T at3? So then P would have to be not correct? Because position3 is occupied by T? So we expect P to be absent? 

Alternatively, let's not get ahead.

We'll know after the feedback.

But note: we don't want to waste a guess by having two guesses covered? But we are covering C and P? And also testing T at4.

We could choose a word that puts T at3? 

For example: choose a word with pattern: C R E T ? -> but then what? ""CRET"" not 5? ""CRETS"" -> S absent? ""CRETO"" not valid? 

Another: ""PRET"": not 5.

So maybe it is better to put T at4? Because we have more candidate words.

We can consider:

""BERET"": 
  - B at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But E at3? 
  - Feedback for E at3: if it's not in the word? But we know E is in the word? So if the secret word does not have two E's, then E at3 will be marked as absent? If it does, then present? 

Same issue.

""CREPT"" seems better because it doesn't duplicate any known letters? We haven't used C and P? And no conflict.

So I choose ""CREPT"".

We can also consider ""WRECK"" -> but W, R, E, C, K -> then index3 is C? and index4 is K? But then T is missing? We know T is in the word? So we must include T? Therefore, we must put T at one of the last two positions.

So we cannot use ""WRECK"" because it doesn't include T? 

So ""CREPT"" is good.

Another: ""BRENT"": but N absent.

""CROFT"": O, F? But T in position4? yes: C, R, O, F, T -> then index3 is F? But no T at3? Actually, it ends with T? But does it have T required? But N absent? Avoid N.

Yes.

But ""CREPT"" is known to me.

Final choice: ""CREPT"".

So third guess: ""CREPT""

Let's summarize:
  - We have to respect fixed R at1 and E at2.
  - T must be placed at position4? in this guess? But we are testing if T is at4.
  - We are testing C at0 and P at3.

<guess>crept</guess>After reviewing the previous feedback:
- From ""raise"": R and E are in the word but not in positions 0 or 4 respectively; A, I, S are absent.
- From ""trend"": R is correct at position 1 and E is correct at position 2; T is present but not at position 0; N and D are absent.

Thus, the word structure is: _ R E _ _
- Positions 1 and 2 are fixed as R and E.
- T must be present, but not in position 0 (from ""trend"" feedback), leaving positions 3 or 4.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.

For the third guess:
- Position 1 is R ✓ (must stay).
- Position 2 is E ✓ (must stay).
- Position 4 is set to T to test if it belongs there (since it must be in position 3 or 4).
- Position 3 is assigned P to test a new consonant.
- Position 0 is assigned C to test a new consonant.
- This forms ""CREPT"", a valid 5-letter word that tests:
  - C at position 0 (unknown).
  - P at position 3 (unknown).
  - T at position 4 (suspected position).

This guess efficiently tests T's location while probing two new letters (C, P) without repeating known absent letters.

So we don\'t know if the word has more than one of these.\n\nTo maximize information, we might avoid duplicates in the next guess? But we are constrained by the fact that we must include R and E.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R and E and three new letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words without A, I, S and with R and E:\n\n- ""ROUTE"": but R is in position 0 again? We know R is not at position 0? Actually, the feedback said R is present but not at position 0. So we cannot put R at position 0. So ""ROUTE"" is invalid because R is at 0.\n\n- ""CREST"": but C is not tested, but we have S? We cannot use S because we know S is absent. So avoid S.\n\n- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E. This has R at position 1 and E at position 4. But note: in the feedback, E was not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4. Therefore, ""TROPE"" has E at the end (position 4) which is not allowed.\n\n- ""ENTER"": This has E at position 0 and 3, and R at position 4. But we have two E\'s. Also, we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. But let\'s check the positions: \n  - E at position 0: that\'s allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4, but it could be at 0.\n  - However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters. But we are trying to test new letters. Also, we have T and N.\n\nBut note: the word ""ENTER"" has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. But if we use it, we might get information about T and N.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and E.\n\nIn ""ENTER"":\n  - E at 0: allowed (since we only know E is not at 4, so 0 is okay)\n  - R at 4: but we know from the first guess that E was at 4 and that was wrong? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So position 4 is not allowed for E? But what about R? The feedback for R was that it is not at position 0. There was no feedback about position 4 for R. So R can be at 4.\n\nBut wait: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 4. That doesn\'t say anything about R at position 4. So R can be at 4.\n\nSo ""ENTER"" is a candidate? But let\'s see: \n  - It has E at position 0 and 3, and R at 4.\n  - We avoid A, I, S.\n\nBut we are using two E\'s. We might not get as much information because we are repeating a letter. Also, we already know E is in the word, so we are only testing two new letters (T and N) and one known letter (R) in a new position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses R and E and three new letters without repetition.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROBED"" -> but R is at 0? We cannot use R at 0.\n\nHow about ""BORED"": \n  - B, O, R, E, D\n  - R is at position 2 (which is allowed, since it wasn\'t at 0 and we don\'t know about 2)\n  - E is at position 3 (which is allowed, because we only know it\'s not at 4)\n\nBut we have to check if we are avoiding A, I, S: yes.\n\nAnother: ""LURED"": \n  - L, U, R, E, D -> R at 2, E at 3. Also avoids A, I, S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U or L are in the word.\n\nAnother: ""CREDO"": \n  - C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is not at 4. Also, we test C, D, O.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CREDO"" is a valid word.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess had R and E as present. We are now putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. This might be correct or not.\n\nBut we are also testing three new letters: C, D, O.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TREND"": \n  - T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2. This is also good.\n\nBut note: we are putting E at position 2. We don\'t know if that is allowed? The feedback only said E is not at 4, so 2 is okay.\n\nWe have to avoid the known absent letters: A, I, S.\n\nI think ""CREDO"" and ""TREND"" are both good.\n\nBut let me think: we also want to cover more common letters. T, N, D are very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? But we don\'t have enough information.\n\nAnother idea: since R is not at 0 and E is not at 4, we can try to put R at 1 and E at 0? But E at 0: that is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 4.\n\nFor example: ""REACT"" -> but we cannot use A. So avoid.\n\n""REBUT"": \n  - R at 0? We cannot put R at 0. So no.\n\n""BERTH"": \n  - B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2. This is good because R is not at 0 and E is at 1 (which is allowed). We test B, T, H.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, I, S: yes.\n\n""BERTH"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n  - ""CREDO"": tests C, R, E, D, O -> R at 1, E at 2.\n  - ""TREND"": tests T, R, E, N, D -> R at 1, E at 2.\n  - ""BERTH"": tests B, E, R, T, H -> E at 1, R at 2.\n\nWe already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing three new letters in each.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is a good choice because T, N, D are very common.\n\nBut note: we are putting R at position 1 and E at position 2. We don\'t know if that is correct, but it\'s a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that we haven\'t tried at all. In the first guess, R was at 0 and E at 4. Now we are avoiding those. So positions 1,2,3 for R and 0,1,2,3 for E.\n\nIn ""TREND"", R is at 1 and E at 2.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DETER"" -> but that has two E\'s and we are repeating. Also, E at 4 is not allowed? We have E at 1 and 4? But we cannot put E at 4. So we avoid.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that uses R and E and also includes other common letters we haven\'t tested, and avoids the forbidden positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OPTER"" -> not a common word? Also, O, P, T, E, R -> R at 4? That\'s allowed. E at 3? That\'s allowed. But we are testing O, P, T.\n\nBut ""OPTER"" might not be a word? Actually, I think ""OPTED"" is a word but that has D. ""OPTED"" has E at 3 and D at 4. But then we are not including R? We must include R and E.\n\nWe need both R and E.\n\n""PORTER"" is 6 letters. So no.\n\n""PRONE"": \n  - P, R, O, N, E -> R at 1, E at 4. But we cannot put E at 4? Because the feedback said E is not at 4. So invalid.\n\n""CRONE"": \n  - C, R, O, N, E -> same problem: E at 4.\n\nSo we must avoid E at 4.\n\nTherefore, words ending with E are not allowed for this guess.\n\nSo ""TREND"" ends with D, so that\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""CREDO"" ends with O, okay.\n\n""BERTH"" ends with H, okay.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""TREND"" because it tests T, N, D which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting R at 1 and E at 2. If the secret word has R at 1 and E at 2, then we get two checks. But if not, we get information about the positions of R and E.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions that are not 1 and 2? For example, R at 3 and E at 0.\n\nExample: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E at 3, R at 4. But E at 3 is allowed? Yes. R at 4 is allowed? Yes. But we are testing U, M, B which are less common.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""TREAD"" -> but we cannot use A.\n\n""TREND"" seems good.\n\nSo I choose ""TREND"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  - T, R, E, N, D\n  - We avoid A, I, S.\n  - R is at position 1 (not 0) -> allowed.\n  - E is at position 2 (not 4) -> allowed.\n\nWe are testing T, N, D.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""TREND"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -).\n- A is absent (marked as x).\n- I is absent (marked as x).\n- S is absent (marked as x).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.\n- A, I, and S are not in the word.\n- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is incorrect).\n- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is incorrect).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid A, I, S entirely.\n- Include R and E in new positions (not position 1 for R, not position 5 for E).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, N, D) to gather more information.\n- ""TREND"" fits these criteria:\n  - R is in position 2 (new position, not 1).\n  - E is in position 3 (new position, not 5).\n  - Tests T, N, D (common letters not yet evaluated).\n  - Valid 5-letter word without A, I, S.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by covering new letters and repositioning known letters.\n\n<guess>trend</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""raise"" -> R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)\nInterpretation:\n  - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).\n  A, I, S are not in the word at all.\n  - E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4).\n\nSecond guess: ""trend"" -> T(-), R(✓), E(✓), N(x), D(x)\nInterpretation:\n  - T is in the word but not at position 1 (index 0).\n  - R is correct and at position 2 (index 1) because in ""trend"", R is at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked correct.\n  - E is correct and at position 3 (index 2) because in ""trend"", E is at position 2 (index 2) and it was marked correct.\n  - N and D are not in the word at all.\n\nSo now we know:\n  - The secret word has R at position 1 (zero-based index 1) and E at position 2 (zero-based index 2). That means the word is: _ R E _ _\n  - Additionally, we know T is in the word but not at position 0 (so it must be at position 3 or 4, since positions 0,1,2 are occupied by ?, R, E).\n  - We also know that A, I, S, N, D are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the word has the pattern: [letter] R E [letter] [letter]\n\nThe known letters:\n  - Must include T (somewhere, but not at index 0) and the letters R and E at fixed positions.\n  - We have two more letters to find.\n\nAlso, the letter at position 0 is not T (since T is not at index 0) and not any of A, I, S, N, D. Similarly, the letters at positions 3 and 4 must not be T? Wait no: T can be at position 3 or 4.\n\nMoreover, we know that the word does not contain A, I, S, N, D.\n\nWe have two positions to fill: position 0 and positions 3 and 4.\n\nWe also have the constraint that T must be in the word and at one of positions 3 or 4 (because it cannot be at 0, and positions 1 and 2 are taken by R and E, so only 3 or 4 are available for T).\n\nNow, we can make a guess that respects:\n  - Position 1 must be R (known correct).\n  - Position 2 must be E (known correct).\n  - We must include T in one of positions 3 or 4 (since it\'s present but not at 0).\n  - We avoid A, I, S, N, D.\n\nWe also want to test letters for the unknown positions: position 0 and whichever of position 3/4 doesn\'t have T.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which of position 3 or 4 has T? Actually, we know T is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, but we don\'t know which one.\n\nSo our guess should test:\n  - Position 0: we need to guess a letter for that.\n  - And we need to put T in either position 3 or 4 to check.\n\nWe also have to consider that the letter at position 3 or 4 might not be T? Actually, no: T must be at one of them. So if we put T in position 3 and get feedback that it\'s wrong (x or -) then it must be at position 4.\n\nBut we can also test another letter for one position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests two new letters: one at position 0 and one at position 3 OR 4, and put T in the other position.\n\nWe have only 6 guesses and we are on the third guess. We have a lot of information.\n\nThe pattern: [letter] R E [T?] [different letter?]\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which of the last two positions has T.\n\nWe must choose a valid English word.\n\nList of possibilities:\n\nWe know the word has T, so it must be at 3 or 4.\n\nCase 1: T at position 3 -> pattern: _ R E T _\nCase 2: T at position 4 -> pattern: _ R E _ T\n\nWe need to fill the other positions.\n\nAlso, the first letter: cannot be A, I, S, N, D, and also not T (since T is at 3 or 4 and we can\'t repeat? We don\'t know if the word allows repeats. But note: the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicate, but we haven\'t tested for duplicates either).\n\nSo let\'s assume for the moment that all letters are distinct, but we cannot count on it.\n\nWe\'ll avoid duplicates unless necessary.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFor case 1: ? R E T ? -> words ending with T at position 3? Then position 4 is the last letter.\n\nBut note: position 3 is index 3, and position 4 is index 4.\n\nExamples: \n  - ""CRET"": not 5 letters.\n  - We need 5 letters: first letter, then R, E, T, then last letter.\n\nSome words: ""GREET"" -> but G at 0, then R, E, T? But we have two E\'s? And also E at position 1? No: the word would be G R E E T? Wait: that\'s five: G, R, E, E, T? But we have E at index 2 and then E again? The feedback from the first guess had E marked as present but not at the end? Here we are putting E at index 2 and again? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had one E and it was marked present, but that doesn\'t tell us if there are more.\n\nBut in ""trend"", we had E at index 2 and that was correct, so if there is another E, it would be a duplicate.\n\nHowever, ""GREET"" has two E\'s? Actually, it has E at index 2 and index 3? But we are trying to put T at index 3, so it would be G R E T. But that\'s only 4 letters? Wait: GREET is 5: G, R, E, E, T? So positions: \n  - index0: G\n  - index1: R\n  - index2: E\n  - index3: E -> but we want T? So no.\n\nWe want the pattern: _ (0) R(1) E(2) T(3) ?(4)\n\nSo words like: \n  - ""TRUET"": not a word.\n  - ""WREST"": but S is absent? We know S is absent. So no.\n\nWords with T at position 3:\n\n  - ""CRET"": not a word.\n  - ""PRET"" not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to think of words that match the known pattern.\n\nWe know R at index1 and E at index2.\n\nSo words: ...R E ... \n\nWith T at either position 3 or 4.\n\nAnd the previous absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.\n\nSo possible letters for position0: since no A,I,S,N,D, and not T (if we assume no duplicate T? But we don\'t know), but we haven\'t ruled out duplicates.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s try to avoid duplicates until forced.\n\nPosition0 can be: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But common letters.\n\nSimilarly, for the last position: same set.\n\nBut we also must include T if we don\'t put it at position0? No: we must include T, so if we don\'t put it at position3 or 4, but we have only those positions left? Actually, position0 cannot be T because we know T is not at position0 from the second guess feedback.\n\nSo T must be at 3 or 4.\n\nTherefore, we must assign T to either position3 or position4.\n\nNow, let\'s make a guess that will help us determine the position of T and also test new letters.\n\nWe can set:\n\nOption: Put T at position3 and a new letter at position4? But then position0 must be a letter we haven\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly, put T at position4 and a new letter at position3.\n\nBut we also have to choose position0.\n\nSo our next guess should:\n\n  - Have R at index1 and E at index2.\n  - Have T at index3 OR at index4 (we choose one arbitrarily, to test).\n  - Choose a letter for the other unknown position (if T at 3, then we choose position4 and position0; if T at 4, then we choose position3 and position0).\n\nBut we have two more unknown positions: position0 and either position3 or position4 (depending on where we put T).\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But many are less common.\n\nCommon letters: O, U, L, C, M, P.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses two of these.\n\nBut note: we must form a valid word.\n\nPossible words with T at position3:\n  - ? R E T ?: \n      ""URET"" ? not 5. \n      ""CRET"" not a word.\n      ""GRETA"": but A is absent.\n      ""FRET"": 4 letters.\n      I can\'t think of any? Maybe ""BREW"" but that would be 4 letters? \n\nWait, 5-letter words:\n  - ""PRETZ"": not common? Actually, pretzel is 7.\n  - ""PREXY"": not common.\n  - ""WRECK"": but we know S? No S, but W, R, E, C, K -> W at0, R at1, E at2, C at3, K at4. But we want T at3? So not.\n\nActually, we cannot put T at3? Because the word must have T. But if we put T at3, then the word must be _ R E T ?, and that ? must be a letter that makes a word.\n\nPossible words: \n  - ""TREET"" -> no, that would be T R E E T? And E would be duplicate and T duplicate? Also, we have E at2 and then E at3? But we want T at3.\n\nPerhaps ""GREET"" again? But that has E at3, not T.\n\nAlternatively, T at position4:\n\nPattern: ? R E ? T\n\nExamples:\n  - ""FORET"": not a word? Forest? But ends with ST? and S is absent? \n  - ""CREST"": S is absent? So no.\n  - ""GRUNT"": N is absent? But we know N is absent? From the second guess: N was marked absent? Yes, so we avoid N.\n\nPossibilities: \n  - ""BRETT"": B R E T T? So T at3 and T at4? Duplicate T? But we know T is present? Possibly. Also, we avoid A,I,S,N,D.\n\nOr ""CREST"" has S which is absent.\n\nAnother: ""WREST"": but S absent.\n\n""PURE""? Not 5.\n\n""BREW"" only 4.\n\n""FORET"" is not common? But Foret is a surname? Not a common word.\n\nAnother: ""FRET"": 4 letters.\n\nWell-known words: \n  - ""GREET"": but that doesn\'t end with T? It ends with T? G R E E T -> not, it ends with T? Actually, GREET: let\'s check: \n      G - 0\n      R - 1? but wait: in our pattern, R must be at index1, but if we put ""GREET"": \n          G at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But then index3 is E, which is not T? So we want the fourth letter (index3) to be a letter and then T at index4? That works? But we have an extra E? \n\nBut wait: we need the pattern: ? R E ? T.\n\nSo for ""GREET"": \n  - position0: G\n  - position1: R -> matches\n  - position2: E -> matches\n  - position3: E -> we are testing this (could be E, but we don\'t know if duplicates allowed)\n  - position4: T -> then T is at4.\n\nBut we avoid including absent letters? We haven\'t tested E at position3? And it might be present? But we already have E at2, and we know E is present? But if there is a duplicate E, we don\'t know.\n\nBut the second guess ""trend"" had one E and it was at2 and correct. If the secret word has two E\'s, then we might not have known? But the feedback only tells us about what we guess.\n\nBut ""GREET"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we must make sure we don\'t break known absent letters: A,I,S,N,D. ""GREET"" doesn\'t have them? True.\n\nHowever, in ""GREET"", we are testing:\n  - G at0\n  - R(known correct) at1\n  - E(known correct) at2\n  - E at3: this is a duplicate? If the word has only one E, then it might be marked absent? But we know E is in the word, so if it\'s duplicated, we might get present? But if the secret word does not have E at3, we will get feedback.\n\nBut we are also testing T at4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CREPT"": \n  - C at0, R at1, E at2, P at3, T at4? This is a valid word.\n  - Avoids A,I,S,N,D.\n  - Tests C and P.\n\nAlso, ""BREW"" is only 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FREET""???? Not a word.\n\nGood one: ""FREMT"" not.\n\nBut ""CREPT"" is a word. Similarly, ""TRAPT"" not.\n\nAlso, ""PREKT"" not.\n\n""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother: ""BERET"": but E at position3 and T at4? But we have B and E? B R E E T? And E at3? \n  - But B is new.\n\nBut same duplicate E issue.\n\nWe have CREPT and GREET and BERET.\n\nTo minimize duplicates, let\'s choose ""CREPT"" because it does not duplicate any known letter? We don\'t know about C and P.\n\nSimilarly, ""BREWT"", not a word.\n\n""PLENT"" has N? But N is absent? So avoid.\n\nI think ""CREPT"" is a good candidate.\n\nWe can test C at0 and P at3, and put T at4.\n\nBut we have to remember that if T is in the word and we put it at4, and if it\'s correct, then good. If not, then T must be at position3? Actually, we know T must be at either 3 or 4? But we are putting at4? If we get feedback that T is not correct at4 (like marked - or x), that would mean T is not at4? But wait: feedback: if T is at4 and we put it, then we get ✓? But if T is at3 and we put it at4, we get x? But no: if T is in the word but at a different position, it would be marked as -? Only if it\'s not present at all, it would be x.\n\nBut we know T is present? So if we put T at4 and the actual word has T at3, then we expect T to be marked as absent (x) at position4? No: actually, if T is in the word but not at position4, and if we put T at4, and the word has T at3, then we are guessing T for two different positions? Actually, the feedback will only say that T at4 is not present? But it doesn\'t tell about the other positions? More accurately, if T is in the word (at position3) and we put T at4, then we get:\n  - The T at4 is not in the word? But wait, the T at4 would be marked as absent (x) only if there is no other T? But if there is already a T at3, and we haven\'t guessed that position? Then the feedback for the T at4 might be marked as - (present elsewhere)? Actually, it depends on how the rules work: if the word has only one T, then it would be marked as absent. But if it has two T\'s, then it would be marked as -? \n\nBut the secret word might have duplicate T? We don\'t know.\n\nThis complicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting T in our guess at a position that might be wrong? Instead, we can test the positions separately? But then we lose efficiency.\n\nWe know T is present and must be at 3 or 4.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nGuess: put T at position 3 and put a different letter at position 4? And then we choose position0.\n\nThat way, if T is at3, we get a ✓ or -? But since we are guessing at the correct position? If we put T at3 and the secret word has T at3, it will be ✓. If the secret word has T at4, then we are putting T at3? Then we get marked as -? Because T is present but in the wrong position? \n\nSimilarly, if we put T at4, then if it\'s at4 we get ✓; if it\'s at3 and not at4, we get -? \n\nIn both cases, we can pinpoint T\'s position.\n\nBut also, we will have our tested letters at the other positions.\n\nI think ""CREPT"" is a good choice because:\n  - C at0: new letter tested? \n  - R at1: already correct\n  - E at2: already correct\n  - P at3: new letter? \n  - T at4: which we know is present? But we put at4? If T is actually at4, it will be ✓? If not, it will be marked as - (since T is present elsewhere) or x (if there is no duplicate)? But we know there is at least one T? So if it\'s not at4, it will be -.\n\nAlso, ""CREPT"" is a valid word: past tense of creep? Or crept.\n\nThe feedback will tell us:\n\n  - If T is marked as ✓ at4? Then T is at4? And P at3 is tested.\n  - If T is marked as - or x? Then T is not at4? Then T must be at3? And we know P at3 might or might not be correct? But if T is marked as - for position4, then it means T is in the word and not at4? Since we know only positions 3 and4 are possible, then T must be at3? So then the secret word has T at3? So then P would have to be not correct? Because position3 is occupied by T? So we expect P to be absent? \n\nAlternatively, let\'s not get ahead.\n\nWe\'ll know after the feedback.\n\nBut note: we don\'t want to waste a guess by having two guesses covered? But we are covering C and P? And also testing T at4.\n\nWe could choose a word that puts T at3? \n\nFor example: choose a word with pattern: C R E T ? -> but then what? ""CRET"" not 5? ""CRETS"" -> S absent? ""CRETO"" not valid? \n\nAnother: ""PRET"": not 5.\n\nSo maybe it is better to put T at4? Because we have more candidate words.\n\nWe can consider:\n\n""BERET"": \n  - B at0, R at1, E at2, E at3, T at4? But E at3? \n  - Feedback for E at3: if it\'s not in the word? But we know E is in the word? So if the secret word does not have two E\'s, then E at3 will be marked as absent? If it does, then present? \n\nSame issue.\n\n""CREPT"" seems better because it doesn\'t duplicate any known letters? We haven\'t used C and P? And no conflict.\n\nSo I choose ""CREPT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""WRECK"" -> but W, R, E, C, K -> then index3 is C? and index4 is K? But then T is missing? We know T is in the word? So we must include T? Therefore, we must put T at one of the last two positions.\n\nSo we cannot use ""WRECK"" because it doesn\'t include T? \n\nSo ""CREPT"" is good.\n\nAnother: ""BRENT"": but N absent.\n\n""CROFT"": O, F? But T in position4? yes: C, R, O, F, T -> then index3 is F? But no T at3? Actually, it ends with T? But does it have T required? But N absent? Avoid N.\n\nYes.\n\nBut ""CREPT"" is known to me.\n\nFinal choice: ""CREPT"".\n\nSo third guess: ""CREPT""\n\nLet\'s summarize:\n  - We have to respect fixed R at1 and E at2.\n  - T must be placed at position4? in this guess? But we are testing if T is at4.\n  - We are testing C at0 and P at3.\n\n<guess>crept</guess>After reviewing the previous feedback:\n- From ""raise"": R and E are in the word but not in positions 0 or 4 respectively; A, I, S are absent.\n- From ""trend"": R is correct at position 1 and E is correct at position 2; T is present but not at position 0; N and D are absent.\n\nThus, the word structure is: _ R E _ _\n- Positions 1 and 2 are fixed as R and E.\n- T must be present, but not in position 0 (from ""trend"" feedback), leaving positions 3 or 4.\n- Absent letters: A, I, S, N, D.\n\nFor the third guess:\n- Position 1 is R ✓ (must stay).\n- Position 2 is E ✓ (must stay).\n- Position 4 is set to T to test if it belongs there (since it must be in position 3 or 4).\n- Position 3 is assigned P to test a new consonant.\n- Position 0 is assigned C to test a new consonant.\n- This forms ""CREPT"", a valid 5-letter word that tests:\n  - C at position 0 (unknown).\n  - P at position 3 (unknown).\n  - T at position 4 (suspected position).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests T\'s location while probing two new letters (C, P) without repeating known absent letters.\n\n<guess>crept</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: crept -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) E(✓) P(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: - (present, not in position 1)
  A: x (absent)
  I: x (absent)
  S: x (absent)
  E: - (present, not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""trend""
  T: - (present, not in position 1)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  E: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  N: x (absent)
  D: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""crept""
  C: x (absent)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 2)  [Note: position indexing: 0-based, so position 1 in the word is index1? Actually, in the feedback, the positions are as per the word. In ""crept"", R is at index1, E at index2, T at index4? But let's map the feedback to the positions.]

But note: the feedback for ""crept"" is:
  C (position0): x
  R (position1): ✓
  E (position2): ✓
  P (position3): x
  T (position4): ✓

So from this, we know:
  - The secret word has R at position1 (index1) and E at position2 (index2) and T at position4 (index4). 
  - Therefore, the word is: _ R E _ T

We also know that the missing letter is at position3 (index3).

Additionally, we have the following absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P.

And we know that T is present and now we know it is at position4.

Now, what about the letter at position0? We don't know it yet? But wait, the word is _ R E _ T, so position0 is the first letter and position3 is the fourth letter.

But from the feedback of ""trend"", we know that T is present and not at position0? But now we know T is at position4, so that's consistent.

Also, from the first guess, we know that R is present and not at position0? But now we have R at position1, which is not position0, so that's consistent.

Now, we need to find the letter at position0 and position3? But wait, the word has only 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4. We have:
  - position1: R
  - position2: E
  - position4: T
  - position0: unknown
  - position3: unknown

But note: the feedback from ""crept"" tells us that C and P are absent? So the letter at position0 is not C, and the letter at position3 is not P.

Also, we know the absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P.

So the letters at position0 and position3 must be from the remaining letters.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to make a fourth guess. But note: we already have three letters fixed: R at1, E at2, T at4. And we only have two positions to fill: 0 and 3.

But we don't know the letter at position0 and position3.

We can try to guess a word that has:
  - position0: a letter we haven't tried (and not absent)
  - position1: R (fixed)
  - position2: E (fixed)
  - position3: a letter we haven't tried (and not absent)
  - position4: T (fixed)

We want to test as many new letters as possible? But we have two positions and we can test two new letters? However, we have limited guesses and we are on the fourth guess.

But note: we have 6 guesses total? So we have two more guesses? But we might solve it in this guess.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern and uses letters that are common and not yet tested.

The set of absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, W, Y.

We need to form a word: [letter] R E [letter] T

Possible words:

  - ""FRET"": but that's 4 letters? No, ""FRET"" is 4. We need 5: so ""FRET"" is not 5.

  - ""GREET"": but that has two E's? And we have E at position2? Then position3 would be E? So ""GREET"" is G R E E T? That's 5 letters. But we have E at position2 and E at position3? So the word would be G, R, E, E, T.

But we don't know if the word allows duplicate E? But the feedback so far hasn't shown a duplicate? But it's possible.

  - ""TREAT"": but A is absent? So no.

  - ""BRENT"": but N is absent? So no.

  - ""CREST"": C and S absent? So no.

  - ""WREST"": S absent? So no.

  - ""PREST"": P and S absent? So no.

  - ""GRUET"": not a word.

  - ""BRUTE"": B R U T E? But we have E at position2? But in ""BRUTE"", the E is at position4? But we need T at position4? So ""BRUTE"" is B R U T E -> then E is at4? But we need T at4? So not.

  - ""BRUT"": not 5.

  - ""BROWT"": not a word.

  - ""GROUT"": G R O U T -> 
        position0: G
        position1: R
        position2: O? But we need E at position2? So no.

We must have E at position2? So the third letter must be E.

So the word must be: [0] R E [3] T

So the pattern: ? R E ? T

Now, common words:

  - ""GREET"": G R E E T -> position3 is E? So if we use this, we are guessing that position3 is E? But we don't know? And we are testing G at0.

  - ""SWEET"": but S is absent? So no.

  - ""FREET"": not a word.

  - ""CREET"": not a word.

  - ""BREAD"": but A and D absent? So no.

  - ""BREED"": B R E E D -> but D is absent? So no.

  - ""BREEK"": not common? But B R E E K? Then position3 is E? and position4 is K? But we need T at4? So not.

  - ""BREVE"": B R E V E -> then position3 is V? and position4 is E? But we need T at4? So not.

  - ""BREME"": not common.

  - ""BRERE"": not a word.

  - ""FRETT"": not a word? Or F R E T T? But T at3 and T at4? Duplicate T? But we know T is at4? So if we put T at3? Then we have two T's? But we don't know if duplicate T is allowed? And ""FRETT"" is not a standard word.

  - ""GREET"" is the most common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? ""GREET"" has G and E? E is already present? But we are using it again? But the absent letters are A,I,S,N,D,C,P? So G is not absent? And E is allowed to be duplicated? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So if we guess ""GREET"", then:

  - If the secret word has two E's, then we get E at position3 as correct? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate E? 

For example: ""GROUT"" doesn't work because it has O at2? We need E at2.

Another: ""GRUMPT"" not 5.

""GRIFT"": G R I F T? But I is absent? So no.

""GRAFT"": A absent? So no.

""WRITE"": W R I T E? But I is absent? And E is at4? But we need T at4? So not.

""WREST"": S absent.

""CRWTH"": not common? And C absent? So no.

""TROUT"": T R O U T? But T at0? And we have T at4? Duplicate? And O at2? But we need E at2? So no.

""BROWN"": N absent? So no.

""BROAD"": A and D absent? So no.

""BROIL"": I absent? So no.

""BROCH"": not common? And C absent? So no.

""BROGH"": not common.

""BROSE"": S absent? So no.

""BROME"": M? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

""BROTE"": not a word.

""FROTH"": F R O T H? Then position2 is O? But we need E? So no.

""FROZE"": O and Z? But E at4? We need T? So no.

""FROWN"": N absent? So no.

""GROVE"": O and V? But E at4? We need T? So no.

""GROWL"": O and W? But L? And no E at2? So no.

""GROPE"": O and P? But P absent? And E at4? We need T? So no.

""GROUP"": O and P? P absent? So no.

""GROUT"": already considered.

""GROSS"": S absent? So no.

""GROAN"": A and N absent? So no.

""GROOM"": O? But no E at2? So no.

""GLUET"": not a word.

""GLENT"": N absent? So no.

""GLERT"": not a word.

""GLOST"": S absent? So no.

""GLEET"": G L E E T? This is a word? Gleet is a word? It means a type of discharge? But it's valid? So ""GLEET"": G L E E T? Then:
  - position0: G
  - position1: L? But we need R at position1? So no.

We must have R at position1? So the second letter is R.

So the word must be: [0] R E [3] T

So the only common word I can think of is ""GREET"".

But let me search for others:

  - ""BREWS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""BREVE"": E at4? We need T at4? So no.

  - ""BREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""CREEL"": C absent? So no.

  - ""FREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""FREMD"": not a word.

  - ""FRESH"": S and H? But S absent? So no.

  - ""FRETS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""GREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""GREEN"": N absent? So no.

  - ""GREES"": S absent? So no.

  - ""GREET"": valid.

  - ""KREEP"": K and P? P absent? So no.

  - ""PREED"": P and D absent? So no.

  - ""TREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""TREEN"": N absent? So no.

  - ""TREES"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TREKS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TREMS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TREST"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TRET"": not 5.

  - ""WREAK"": A absent? So no.

  - ""WREAT"": not a word? Or W R E A T? A absent? So no.

  - ""WRECK"": C absent? So no.

  - ""WREST"": S absent? So no.

  - ""WRICK"": C absent? So no.

  - ""WROTE"": O? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

  - ""WRATH"": A absent? So no.

  - ""BROTH"": O? But no E at2? So no.

  - ""BRUTE"": U? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

  - ""BRUME"": M? But E at4? We need T? So not.

  - ""BRUTE"" is B R U T E -> then T is at3 and E at4? But we need T at4? So if we put ""BRUTE"", then position3 is T? and position4 is E? But we know T is at4? So that would be E at4? But we have T at4 fixed? So we cannot.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids absent letters is ""GREET"".

Therefore, we must consider that the secret word might be ""GREET"".

But we are not sure? We have to guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests a different letter at position3? But we have to have R at1, E at2, T at4? And we need to choose position0 and position3.

But we can choose a word that has a new letter at position0 and a new letter at position3? But we don't know which letters are present? 

For example, we can try ""GRUFT"" not a word.

Or ""GROFT"" not a word.

""GRAFT"" has A? Absent.

""GRIFT"" has I? Absent.

""GRUNT"" has N? Absent.

""GRUBT"" not a word.

""GRUMP"" not 5? And P absent? So no.

""GRUME"" but E at4? We need T at4? So not.

""GRUFE"" not a word.

So it seems ""GREET"" is the only common word.

But let me think: what about ""WRAPT""? But A and P absent? So no.

""WRATH"" A absent.

""WROTH"" O? But no E at2? So no.

""BROTH"" no E.

So I think ""GREET"" is the only possibility.

But we have to make a guess? So we guess ""GREET"".

But note: we are on the fourth guess? And we have two more if needed.

But if we guess ""GREET"", and it's not the word? Then we know the word has a different letter at position0 and position3? But we have no other information? So we might waste a guess.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests one of the positions? But we have to fix R, E, T? So we cannot change them? 

But we can make a guess that doesn't fix T? But we know T is at4? From the feedback of ""crept"", T is at4? So it's fixed.

Similarly, R and E are fixed.

So we have to have a word with R at1, E at2, T at4.

So the only flexibility is position0 and position3.

We can try to guess a word that uses a common letter for position0 and a common letter for position3? But we don't have many common letters left? And we don't know which ones are present.

But we can try ""GREET"" as it is the most likely.

Another word: ""BROTH"" is not.

""FRONT"": N and O? But no E at2? So no.

""FROST"": S and O? But no E? So no.

""GROVE"": O and V? But no E at2? So no.

""GRATE"": A? Absent? So no.

""GRIME"": I? Absent? So no.

""GRONE"": not common? And N? Absent? So no.

""GROVE"": already.

""GROPE"": P absent? So no.

""GROVE"": same.

""GROWL"": no E.

""GROSS"": S absent.

""GROAN"": A and N absent.

""GROOM"": no E.

""GRUEL"": U and E? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

""GRUFF"": F? But no E? So no.

""GRUNT"": N absent.

""GRUSH"": not common? And S? Absent? So no.

""GRYKE"": not common? And K? But E at4? We need T? So not.

""GWINE"": not common? And I? Absent? So no.

So I think ""GREET"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""GREET"".

But let's confirm the pattern: 
  - G at0
  - R at1 (fixed)
  - E at2 (fixed)
  - E at3
  - T at4 (fixed)

And the absent letters we know: A, I, S, N, D, C, P. G is not in that list? So it's allowed.

So fourth guess: ""GREET""

<guess>greet</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- The secret word has R at position 1, E at position 2, and T at position 4 (confirmed by Guess 3: ""crept"").
- The pattern is: _ R E _ T
- Absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P (from previous feedback).
- The only common English word fitting this pattern without using absent letters is ""GREET"" (G at 0, E at 3).

This guess tests:
- G at position 0 (new letter).
- E at position 3 (possible duplicate, but E is known to be present).

If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, it provides new information on positions 0 and 3.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

#### Feedback Summary:
1. **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
   - R: Present but not in position 1 → `-`  
   - A: Absent → `x`  
   - I: Absent → `x`  
   - S: Absent → `x`  
   - E: Present but not in position 5 → `-`  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - R and E are in the word.  
     - A, I, S are **not** in the word.  
     - R cannot be in position 1, E cannot be in position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""trend""**  
   - T: Present but not in position 1 → `-`  
   - R: Correct in position 2 → `✓`  
   - E: Correct in position 3 → `✓`  
   - N: Absent → `x`  
   - D: Absent → `x`  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - R is **fixed at position 2** (index 1).  
     - E is **fixed at position 3** (index 2).  
     - T is present but not in position 1.  
     - N and D are **not** in the word.  
     - Word structure: `_ R E _ _` (positions 0, 3, 4 unknown).

3. **Guess 3: ""crept""**  
   - C: Absent → `x`  
   - R: Correct in position 2 → `✓` (confirms R at index 1)  
   - E: Correct in position 3 → `✓` (confirms E at index 2)  
   - P: Absent → `x`  
   - T: Correct in position 5 → `✓`  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - T is **fixed at position 5** (index 4).  
     - C and P are **not** in the word.  
     - Word structure: `_ R E _ T` (only positions 0 and 3 unknown).  
     - Absent letters: **A, I, S, N, D, C, P**.

#### Current Word Structure:
- **Positions**:  
  - 0: Unknown (must be a letter not in absent list).  
  - 1: **R** (fixed).  
  - 2: **E** (fixed).  
  - 3: Unknown (must be a letter not in absent list).  
  - 4: **T** (fixed).  
- **Absent Letters**: A, I, S, N, D, C, P (cannot be used).  
- **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

#### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to solve for positions 0 and 3.  
- The only common English word fitting `_ R E _ T` without using absent letters is **""GREET""**:  
  - Position 0: **G** (tests a new common consonant).  
  - Position 3: **E** (tests for a duplicate E; E is already confirmed at position 2, but duplicates are possible).  
- If ""GREET"" is correct, the puzzle is solved. If not, feedback on G and the duplicate E will reveal the solution in the next guess.  

### Next Guess:  
<guess>greet</guess>",greet,"We are given the feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: - (present, not in position 1)
  A: x (absent)
  I: x (absent)
  S: x (absent)
  E: - (present, not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""trend""
  T: - (present, not in position 1)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  E: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  N: x (absent)
  D: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""crept""
  C: x (absent)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 2)  [Note: position indexing: 0-based, so position 1 in the word is index1? Actually, in the feedback, the positions are as per the word. In ""crept"", R is at index1, E at index2, T at index4? But let's map the feedback to the positions.]

But note: the feedback for ""crept"" is:
  C (position0): x
  R (position1): ✓
  E (position2): ✓
  P (position3): x
  T (position4): ✓

So from this, we know:
  - The secret word has R at position1 (index1) and E at position2 (index2) and T at position4 (index4). 
  - Therefore, the word is: _ R E _ T

We also know that the missing letter is at position3 (index3).

Additionally, we have the following absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P.

And we know that T is present and now we know it is at position4.

Now, what about the letter at position0? We don't know it yet? But wait, the word is _ R E _ T, so position0 is the first letter and position3 is the fourth letter.

But from the feedback of ""trend"", we know that T is present and not at position0? But now we know T is at position4, so that's consistent.

Also, from the first guess, we know that R is present and not at position0? But now we have R at position1, which is not position0, so that's consistent.

Now, we need to find the letter at position0 and position3? But wait, the word has only 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4. We have:
  - position1: R
  - position2: E
  - position4: T
  - position0: unknown
  - position3: unknown

But note: the feedback from ""crept"" tells us that C and P are absent? So the letter at position0 is not C, and the letter at position3 is not P.

Also, we know the absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P.

So the letters at position0 and position3 must be from the remaining letters.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to make a fourth guess. But note: we already have three letters fixed: R at1, E at2, T at4. And we only have two positions to fill: 0 and 3.

But we don't know the letter at position0 and position3.

We can try to guess a word that has:
  - position0: a letter we haven't tried (and not absent)
  - position1: R (fixed)
  - position2: E (fixed)
  - position3: a letter we haven't tried (and not absent)
  - position4: T (fixed)

We want to test as many new letters as possible? But we have two positions and we can test two new letters? However, we have limited guesses and we are on the fourth guess.

But note: we have 6 guesses total? So we have two more guesses? But we might solve it in this guess.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern and uses letters that are common and not yet tested.

The set of absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, W, Y.

We need to form a word: [letter] R E [letter] T

Possible words:

  - ""FRET"": but that's 4 letters? No, ""FRET"" is 4. We need 5: so ""FRET"" is not 5.

  - ""GREET"": but that has two E's? And we have E at position2? Then position3 would be E? So ""GREET"" is G R E E T? That's 5 letters. But we have E at position2 and E at position3? So the word would be G, R, E, E, T.

But we don't know if the word allows duplicate E? But the feedback so far hasn't shown a duplicate? But it's possible.

  - ""TREAT"": but A is absent? So no.

  - ""BRENT"": but N is absent? So no.

  - ""CREST"": C and S absent? So no.

  - ""WREST"": S absent? So no.

  - ""PREST"": P and S absent? So no.

  - ""GRUET"": not a word.

  - ""BRUTE"": B R U T E? But we have E at position2? But in ""BRUTE"", the E is at position4? But we need T at position4? So ""BRUTE"" is B R U T E -> then E is at4? But we need T at4? So not.

  - ""BRUT"": not 5.

  - ""BROWT"": not a word.

  - ""GROUT"": G R O U T -> 
        position0: G
        position1: R
        position2: O? But we need E at position2? So no.

We must have E at position2? So the third letter must be E.

So the word must be: [0] R E [3] T

So the pattern: ? R E ? T

Now, common words:

  - ""GREET"": G R E E T -> position3 is E? So if we use this, we are guessing that position3 is E? But we don't know? And we are testing G at0.

  - ""SWEET"": but S is absent? So no.

  - ""FREET"": not a word.

  - ""CREET"": not a word.

  - ""BREAD"": but A and D absent? So no.

  - ""BREED"": B R E E D -> but D is absent? So no.

  - ""BREEK"": not common? But B R E E K? Then position3 is E? and position4 is K? But we need T at4? So not.

  - ""BREVE"": B R E V E -> then position3 is V? and position4 is E? But we need T at4? So not.

  - ""BREME"": not common.

  - ""BRERE"": not a word.

  - ""FRETT"": not a word? Or F R E T T? But T at3 and T at4? Duplicate T? But we know T is at4? So if we put T at3? Then we have two T's? But we don't know if duplicate T is allowed? And ""FRETT"" is not a standard word.

  - ""GREET"" is the most common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? ""GREET"" has G and E? E is already present? But we are using it again? But the absent letters are A,I,S,N,D,C,P? So G is not absent? And E is allowed to be duplicated? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So if we guess ""GREET"", then:

  - If the secret word has two E's, then we get E at position3 as correct? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate E? 

For example: ""GROUT"" doesn't work because it has O at2? We need E at2.

Another: ""GRUMPT"" not 5.

""GRIFT"": G R I F T? But I is absent? So no.

""GRAFT"": A absent? So no.

""WRITE"": W R I T E? But I is absent? And E is at4? But we need T at4? So not.

""WREST"": S absent.

""CRWTH"": not common? And C absent? So no.

""TROUT"": T R O U T? But T at0? And we have T at4? Duplicate? And O at2? But we need E at2? So no.

""BROWN"": N absent? So no.

""BROAD"": A and D absent? So no.

""BROIL"": I absent? So no.

""BROCH"": not common? And C absent? So no.

""BROGH"": not common.

""BROSE"": S absent? So no.

""BROME"": M? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

""BROTE"": not a word.

""FROTH"": F R O T H? Then position2 is O? But we need E? So no.

""FROZE"": O and Z? But E at4? We need T? So no.

""FROWN"": N absent? So no.

""GROVE"": O and V? But E at4? We need T? So no.

""GROWL"": O and W? But L? And no E at2? So no.

""GROPE"": O and P? But P absent? And E at4? We need T? So no.

""GROUP"": O and P? P absent? So no.

""GROUT"": already considered.

""GROSS"": S absent? So no.

""GROAN"": A and N absent? So no.

""GROOM"": O? But no E at2? So no.

""GLUET"": not a word.

""GLENT"": N absent? So no.

""GLERT"": not a word.

""GLOST"": S absent? So no.

""GLEET"": G L E E T? This is a word? Gleet is a word? It means a type of discharge? But it's valid? So ""GLEET"": G L E E T? Then:
  - position0: G
  - position1: L? But we need R at position1? So no.

We must have R at position1? So the second letter is R.

So the word must be: [0] R E [3] T

So the only common word I can think of is ""GREET"".

But let me search for others:

  - ""BREWS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""BREVE"": E at4? We need T at4? So no.

  - ""BREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""CREEL"": C absent? So no.

  - ""FREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""FREMD"": not a word.

  - ""FRESH"": S and H? But S absent? So no.

  - ""FRETS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""GREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""GREEN"": N absent? So no.

  - ""GREES"": S absent? So no.

  - ""GREET"": valid.

  - ""KREEP"": K and P? P absent? So no.

  - ""PREED"": P and D absent? So no.

  - ""TREED"": D absent? So no.

  - ""TREEN"": N absent? So no.

  - ""TREES"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TREKS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TREMS"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TREST"": S absent? So no.

  - ""TRET"": not 5.

  - ""WREAK"": A absent? So no.

  - ""WREAT"": not a word? Or W R E A T? A absent? So no.

  - ""WRECK"": C absent? So no.

  - ""WREST"": S absent? So no.

  - ""WRICK"": C absent? So no.

  - ""WROTE"": O? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

  - ""WRATH"": A absent? So no.

  - ""BROTH"": O? But no E at2? So no.

  - ""BRUTE"": U? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

  - ""BRUME"": M? But E at4? We need T? So not.

  - ""BRUTE"" is B R U T E -> then T is at3 and E at4? But we need T at4? So if we put ""BRUTE"", then position3 is T? and position4 is E? But we know T is at4? So that would be E at4? But we have T at4 fixed? So we cannot.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids absent letters is ""GREET"".

Therefore, we must consider that the secret word might be ""GREET"".

But we are not sure? We have to guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests a different letter at position3? But we have to have R at1, E at2, T at4? And we need to choose position0 and position3.

But we can choose a word that has a new letter at position0 and a new letter at position3? But we don't know which letters are present? 

For example, we can try ""GRUFT"" not a word.

Or ""GROFT"" not a word.

""GRAFT"" has A? Absent.

""GRIFT"" has I? Absent.

""GRUNT"" has N? Absent.

""GRUBT"" not a word.

""GRUMP"" not 5? And P absent? So no.

""GRUME"" but E at4? We need T at4? So not.

""GRUFE"" not a word.

So it seems ""GREET"" is the only common word.

But let me think: what about ""WRAPT""? But A and P absent? So no.

""WRATH"" A absent.

""WROTH"" O? But no E at2? So no.

""BROTH"" no E.

So I think ""GREET"" is the only possibility.

But we have to make a guess? So we guess ""GREET"".

But note: we are on the fourth guess? And we have two more if needed.

But if we guess ""GREET"", and it's not the word? Then we know the word has a different letter at position0 and position3? But we have no other information? So we might waste a guess.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests one of the positions? But we have to fix R, E, T? So we cannot change them? 

But we can make a guess that doesn't fix T? But we know T is at4? From the feedback of ""crept"", T is at4? So it's fixed.

Similarly, R and E are fixed.

So we have to have a word with R at1, E at2, T at4.

So the only flexibility is position0 and position3.

We can try to guess a word that uses a common letter for position0 and a common letter for position3? But we don't have many common letters left? And we don't know which ones are present.

But we can try ""GREET"" as it is the most likely.

Another word: ""BROTH"" is not.

""FRONT"": N and O? But no E at2? So no.

""FROST"": S and O? But no E? So no.

""GROVE"": O and V? But no E at2? So no.

""GRATE"": A? Absent? So no.

""GRIME"": I? Absent? So no.

""GRONE"": not common? And N? Absent? So no.

""GROVE"": already.

""GROPE"": P absent? So no.

""GROVE"": same.

""GROWL"": no E.

""GROSS"": S absent.

""GROAN"": A and N absent.

""GROOM"": no E.

""GRUEL"": U and E? But E at4? We need T at4? So not.

""GRUFF"": F? But no E? So no.

""GRUNT"": N absent.

""GRUSH"": not common? And S? Absent? So no.

""GRYKE"": not common? And K? But E at4? We need T? So not.

""GWINE"": not common? And I? Absent? So no.

So I think ""GREET"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""GREET"".

But let's confirm the pattern: 
  - G at0
  - R at1 (fixed)
  - E at2 (fixed)
  - E at3
  - T at4 (fixed)

And the absent letters we know: A, I, S, N, D, C, P. G is not in that list? So it's allowed.

So fourth guess: ""GREET""

<guess>greet</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- The secret word has R at position 1, E at position 2, and T at position 4 (confirmed by Guess 3: ""crept"").
- The pattern is: _ R E _ T
- Absent letters: A, I, S, N, D, C, P (from previous feedback).
- The only common English word fitting this pattern without using absent letters is ""GREET"" (G at 0, E at 3).

This guess tests:
- G at position 0 (new letter).
- E at position 3 (possible duplicate, but E is known to be present).

If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, it provides new information on positions 0 and 3.

   - R: Present but not in position 1 → `-`  
   - A: Absent → `x`  
   - I: Absent → `x`  
   - S: Absent → `x`  
   - E: Present but not in position 5 → `-`  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - R and E are in the word.  
     - A, I, S are **not** in the word.  
     - R cannot be in position 1, E cannot be in position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""trend""**  
   - T: Present but not in position 1 → `-`  
   - R: Correct in position 2 → `✓`  
   - E: Correct in position 3 → `✓`  
   - N: Absent → `x`  
   - D: Absent → `x`  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - R is **fixed at position 2** (index 1).  
     - E is **fixed at position 3** (index 2).  
     - T is present but not in position 1.  
     - N and D are **not** in the word.  
     - Word structure: `_ R E _ _` (positions 0, 3, 4 unknown).

3. **Guess 3: ""crept""**  
   - C: Absent → `x`  
   - R: Correct in position 2 → `✓` (confirms R at index 1)  
   - E: Correct in position 3 → `✓` (confirms E at index 2)  
   - P: Absent → `x`  
   - T: Correct in position 5 → `✓`  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - T is **fixed at position 5** (index 4).  
     - C and P are **not** in the word.  
     - Word structure: `_ R E _ T` (only positions 0 and 3 unknown).  
     - Absent letters: **A, I, S, N, D, C, P**.

#### Current Word Structure:
- **Positions**:  
  - 0: Unknown (must be a letter not in absent list).  
  - 1: **R** (fixed).  
  - 2: **E** (fixed).  
  - 3: Unknown (must be a letter not in absent list).  
  - 4: **T** (fixed).  
- **Absent Letters**: A, I, S, N, D, C, P (cannot be used).  
- **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

#### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to solve for positions 0 and 3.  
- The only common English word fitting `_ R E _ T` without using absent letters is **""GREET""**:  
  - Position 0: **G** (tests a new common consonant).  
  - Position 3: **E** (tests for a duplicate E; E is already confirmed at position 2, but duplicates are possible).  
- If ""GREET"" is correct, the puzzle is solved. If not, feedback on G and the duplicate E will reveal the solution in the next guess.
