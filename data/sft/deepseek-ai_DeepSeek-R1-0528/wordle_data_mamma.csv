We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the secret word but not in the position it was guessed (so not the third position).
   - C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3 (since the guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning wrong position).

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent, so we should avoid using them in the next guess.

 For the next guess, we want to try to include A (but in a different position) and test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 We also want to avoid repeating the absent letters (C, R, N, E).

 Common consonants and vowels to consider: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A (but not in the third position) and use other common letters.

 Since A was in position 3 and now we know it's not there, let's try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Position 2: _ A _ _ _
   Position 4: _ _ _ A _
   Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

 We also note that we have not tested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses as many of these unused common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has A in a new position and includes S and T.

 Example words:
   If A is in position 1: ALERT, ABLED, etc. But avoid R (already absent) and E (absent) -> so ALERT is bad because of E and R.

   Let's find words without C, R, N, E.

   Words with A in position 1: 
        SALAD? -> but L and D are new, but S is common. However, we can use also T.
        We want distinct letters to maximize information.

   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn't use E. So we must avoid E.

   Let's try A in position 2: 
        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.

   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don't know if A appears multiple times.

   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.

   Let's consider: 

   Option: Place A in position 4: 
        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A's. And Z is uncommon.

   Option: Place A in position 5: 
        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A's.

   Alternatively, let's try A in position 2.

   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S's. But S is common and we haven't tried S.

   Actually, without E and R, here's a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.

   SALTY: 
        S: not tested
        A: we know is present (but we'll put it in position 2, not 3)
        L, T, Y: not tested

   This covers several new common letters.

   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

   We must avoid N because it's absent.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.

   SALTY: 
      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? 
        C: absent -> not here
        R: absent -> not here
        N: absent -> not here
        E: absent -> not here

   So SALTY is acceptable.

   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don't care if it helps test P? Also, we don't know about P.

   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

   Why SALTY?
      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).
      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.

   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don't know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? 
   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it's present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. 
   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.

   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? 
   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a '-' again? But we already know it's not there? 
   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we'll get a '-'? 
   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.

   Therefore, let's pick SALTY: A in position 2.

   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? 
   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven't tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.

   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.

   So I think SALTY is a good choice.

   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.

   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a '-' meaning A is present but not in that position.

   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it's wrong. We don't gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? 
   Actually, we might if there are two A's? But we don't know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.

   Therefore, I choose SALTY.

   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.

   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.

   This tests:
        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?
        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?
        L at position 3: new letter
        T at position 4: new letter
        Y at position 5: new letter

   And we avoid the known absent letters.

   So let's go with SALTY.

   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it's not in the word.

   So we avoid STAIR.

   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F's and we can test F? But we don't know. However, it has F repeated? 
   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? 

   So SALTY seems better.

   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.

   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.

   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. 

   Therefore, SALTY is better.

   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.

   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.

   So I will guess: SALTY

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:
- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.
- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y. All letters are untested and avoid the known absent ones.

 We want a word that uses as many of these unused common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has A in a new position and includes S and T.

 Example words:
   If A is in position 1: ALERT, ABLED, etc. But avoid R (already absent) and E (absent) -> so ALERT is bad because of E and R.

   Let's find words without C, R, N, E.

   Words with A in position 1: 
        SALAD? -> but L and D are new, but S is common. However, we can use also T.
        We want distinct letters to maximize information.

   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn't use E. So we must avoid E.

   Let's try A in position 2: 
        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.

   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don't know if A appears multiple times.

   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.

   Let's consider: 

   Option: Place A in position 4: 
        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A's. And Z is uncommon.

   Option: Place A in position 5: 
        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A's.

   Alternatively, let's try A in position 2.

   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S's. But S is common and we haven't tried S.

   Actually, without E and R, here's a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.

   SALTY: 
        S: not tested
        A: we know is present (but we'll put it in position 2, not 3)
        L, T, Y: not tested

   This covers several new common letters.

   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

   We must avoid N because it's absent.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.

   SALTY: 
      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? 
        C: absent -> not here
        R: absent -> not here
        N: absent -> not here
        E: absent -> not here

   So SALTY is acceptable.

   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don't care if it helps test P? Also, we don't know about P.

   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

   Why SALTY?
      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).
      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.

   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don't know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? 
   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it's present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. 
   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.

   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? 
   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a '-' again? But we already know it's not there? 
   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we'll get a '-'? 
   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.

   Therefore, let's pick SALTY: A in position 2.

   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? 
   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven't tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.

   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.

   So I think SALTY is a good choice.

   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.

   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a '-' meaning A is present but not in that position.

   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it's wrong. We don't gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? 
   Actually, we might if there are two A's? But we don't know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.

   Therefore, I choose SALTY.

   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.

   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.

   This tests:
        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?
        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?
        L at position 3: new letter
        T at position 4: new letter
        Y at position 5: new letter

   And we avoid the known absent letters.

   So let's go with SALTY.

   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it's not in the word.

   So we avoid STAIR.

   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F's and we can test F? But we don't know. However, it has F repeated? 
   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? 

   So SALTY seems better.

   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.

   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.

   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. 

   Therefore, SALTY is better.

   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.

   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.

   So I will guess: SALTY

   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:
- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.
- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y. All letters are untested and avoid the known absent ones.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got '-')
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since in ""salty"", A was in position 2 and we got a checkmark).
- S, L, T, Y are not in the word.

So now we know:
- A is in the secret word and is in position 2. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y. So we can't use those.
- The secret word has 5 letters, one of which is A in the second position.

We now know the second letter is A. Therefore the word structure is: _ A _ _ _

We need to think about what letters are left. We haven't tested many vowels: only A and E (which is absent). So vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but Y is already eliminated). Since Y is eliminated, we focus on I, O, U.

Also, consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: Q, Z, X are less common.

We need to form a word of the form _ A _ _ _

We know the word must contain A in position 2 and must not include C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Now, since in the first guess, we had A in the word (but wrong position) and now we found it in position 2, that suggests that the A might have been moved from its correct position? Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it's in position 2.

We have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

What we can try:
We can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words: 
- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That's not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.

- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.

- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.

- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.

- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.

- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.

- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.

Consider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.

For example:
- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can't use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.

- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _

- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.

Another idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.

Actually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.

Let me think of common words: 
- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.
- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.

We can use:
- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A's? We don't know yet. But N is out so invalid.

- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.

Since vowels are limited, let's try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.

Or GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.

So we need words that don't contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have A fixed at position 2.

List of possible words (from common English words):
- PADAU? Not common.
- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.
- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.
- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn't reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.

How about:
- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.

Another: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.

HABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.

But T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven't tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.

Similarly, Y absent, L absent.

So what words exist? Let me think:

Valid words with pattern _A_ _ _:

- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.
- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don't know.

- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.

Wait, we need to avoid S.

How about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.

I am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.

We must have A in second.

Another: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Perhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _

WORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.

But MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to test new letters? We haven't tried M and G.

However, we know A is already correct in position 2.

But MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don't know about multiple A's? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it's the same A? Or could there be two?

Actually, if there were two A's, the first guess would have shown A as '-' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn't rule out another A elsewhere.

But we don't know.

Similarly, MAGMA: 
- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.

But MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let's be more common.

Another idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.

We are struggling because common letters are eliminated.

Let me try different vowels: Using O.

For example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.

GAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.

But try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.

Another: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.

We need to include I or O or U and new consonants.

Possible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.

No.

Another: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.

We need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.

List of English words with A at position 2:

Common ones: 
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.
- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.
- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.
- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.

So we avoid R.

Let me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.

BAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.

Perhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.

PAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.

I am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it's proper.

HADJI: that's an Arabic term? Valid.

But letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? 
- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.

So HADJI is a word? I think it's acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.

Another common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.

""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.

We haven't used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.

How about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.

GAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.

We have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.

Another idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.

PAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.

It's difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. 

But BADAM is not standard.

Perhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.

GADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.

GADID: letters:
- G: not tested
- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don't have to reuse A? Or not?

Actually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.

But GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

Feedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.

But the word might not have two D's? We'll see.

But is GADID common? Unusual.

Another word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.

We need words without E.

Perhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.

Word: FAUGH

Which is an exclamation, meaning off.

But acceptable? Let's see.

Otherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.

Padma = lotus? But valid.

Now, from the available letters, we can choose among these.

Since we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven't tested: I, O, U.

Let's prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.

Choose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.

Possible words:
- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.
- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.
- ""FAPPS"" no.
- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.

Another: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.

""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.

""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.

""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.

PAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.

But 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.

Position 2 is A.

Letters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: 
- P: not used before
- G: not used
- O: not used
- D: not used

And they are all available.

So PAGOD is acceptable.

Another possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.

Or ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.

Yes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

That covers V, P, I, D.

But PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.

But VAPID has I? Vowel I.

But both appear valid.

Since we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.

But P is common.

Another word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.

We can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.

The secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.

We haven't tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.

VAPID: V, P, I, D.

Note that both include P and D? Not a problem.

But VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.

The word is _A_ _ _

We have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.

In PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.

Both untested.

For commonality, I think both words are valid.

Let's choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.

Another common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.

So not.

""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.

""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.

Perhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.

We are limited.

So I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.

Let me choose VAPID? Because at least it's more common English word.

VAPID is a bit negative, but valid.

Or ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.

So VAPID seems reasonable.

Another option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.

So we go with VAPID.

We risk but it's one of the few words.

Perhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.

Yes, so guess: VAPID.

But VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> 
- We haven't tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.

And A in position 2 which is correct.

So we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.

If not in the word, that will eliminate them.

So let's go with ""vapid"".
</think>
From the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  
  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).
- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  
3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  
4. **Word selection criteria**:  
   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  
   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  
   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  
5. **Brainstorm options**:  
   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  
   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  
6. **Optimization**:  
   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  
     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  
     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  
     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  
   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  
7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.

Chosen guess: **vapid**.

<guess>vapid</guess>",vapid,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got '-')
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since in ""salty"", A was in position 2 and we got a checkmark).
- S, L, T, Y are not in the word.

So now we know:
- A is in the secret word and is in position 2. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y. So we can't use those.
- The secret word has 5 letters, one of which is A in the second position.

We now know the second letter is A. Therefore the word structure is: _ A _ _ _

We need to think about what letters are left. We haven't tested many vowels: only A and E (which is absent). So vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but Y is already eliminated). Since Y is eliminated, we focus on I, O, U.

Also, consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: Q, Z, X are less common.

We need to form a word of the form _ A _ _ _

We know the word must contain A in position 2 and must not include C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Now, since in the first guess, we had A in the word (but wrong position) and now we found it in position 2, that suggests that the A might have been moved from its correct position? Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it's in position 2.

We have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

What we can try:
We can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words: 
- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That's not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.

- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.

- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.

- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.

- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.

- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.

- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.

Consider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.

For example:
- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can't use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.

- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _

- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.

Another idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.

Actually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.

Let me think of common words: 
- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.
- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.

We can use:
- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A's? We don't know yet. But N is out so invalid.

- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.

Since vowels are limited, let's try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.

Or GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.

So we need words that don't contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have A fixed at position 2.

List of possible words (from common English words):
- PADAU? Not common.
- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.
- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.
- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn't reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.

How about:
- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.

Another: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.

HABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.

But T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven't tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.

Similarly, Y absent, L absent.

So what words exist? Let me think:

Valid words with pattern _A_ _ _:

- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.
- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don't know.

- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.

Wait, we need to avoid S.

How about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.

I am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.

We must have A in second.

Another: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Perhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _

WORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.

But MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to test new letters? We haven't tried M and G.

However, we know A is already correct in position 2.

But MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don't know about multiple A's? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it's the same A? Or could there be two?

Actually, if there were two A's, the first guess would have shown A as '-' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn't rule out another A elsewhere.

But we don't know.

Similarly, MAGMA: 
- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.

But MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let's be more common.

Another idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.

We are struggling because common letters are eliminated.

Let me try different vowels: Using O.

For example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.

GAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.

But try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.

Another: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.

We need to include I or O or U and new consonants.

Possible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.

No.

Another: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.

We need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.

List of English words with A at position 2:

Common ones: 
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.
- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.
- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.
- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.

So we avoid R.

Let me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.

BAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.

Perhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.

PAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.

I am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it's proper.

HADJI: that's an Arabic term? Valid.

But letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? 
- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.

So HADJI is a word? I think it's acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.

Another common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.

""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.

We haven't used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.

How about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.

GAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.

We have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.

Another idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.

PAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.

It's difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. 

But BADAM is not standard.

Perhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.

GADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.

GADID: letters:
- G: not tested
- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don't have to reuse A? Or not?

Actually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.

But GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

Feedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.

But the word might not have two D's? We'll see.

But is GADID common? Unusual.

Another word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.

We need words without E.

Perhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.

Word: FAUGH

Which is an exclamation, meaning off.

But acceptable? Let's see.

Otherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.

Padma = lotus? But valid.

Now, from the available letters, we can choose among these.

Since we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven't tested: I, O, U.

Let's prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.

Choose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.

Possible words:
- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.
- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.
- ""FAPPS"" no.
- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.

Another: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.

""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.

""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.

""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.

PAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.

But 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.

Position 2 is A.

Letters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: 
- P: not used before
- G: not used
- O: not used
- D: not used

And they are all available.

So PAGOD is acceptable.

Another possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.

Or ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.

Yes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

That covers V, P, I, D.

But PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.

But VAPID has I? Vowel I.

But both appear valid.

Since we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.

But P is common.

Another word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.

We can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.

The secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.

We haven't tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.

VAPID: V, P, I, D.

Note that both include P and D? Not a problem.

But VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.

The word is _A_ _ _

We have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.

In PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.

Both untested.

For commonality, I think both words are valid.

Let's choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.

Another common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.

So not.

""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.

""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.

Perhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.

We are limited.

So I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.

Let me choose VAPID? Because at least it's more common English word.

VAPID is a bit negative, but valid.

Or ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.

So VAPID seems reasonable.

Another option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.

So we go with VAPID.

We risk but it's one of the few words.

Perhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.

Yes, so guess: VAPID.

But VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> 
- We haven't tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.

And A in position 2 which is correct.

So we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.

If not in the word, that will eliminate them.

So let's go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  
  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).
- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  
3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  
4. **Word selection criteria**:  
   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  
   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  
   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  
5. **Brainstorm options**:  
   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  
   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  
6. **Optimization**:  
   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  
     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  
     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  
     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  
   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  
7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters (C, R, A, N, E).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the secret word but not in the position it was guessed (so not the third position).
   - C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3 (since the guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning wrong position).

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent, so we should avoid using them in the next guess.

 For the next guess, we want to try to include A (but in a different position) and test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 We also want to avoid repeating the absent letters (C, R, N, E).

 Common consonants and vowels to consider: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A (but not in the third position) and use other common letters.

 Since A was in position 3 and now we know it's not there, let's try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Position 2: _ A _ _ _
   Position 4: _ _ _ A _
   Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

 We also note that we have not tested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses as many of these unused common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has A in a new position and includes S and T.

 Example words:
   If A is in position 1: ALERT, ABLED, etc. But avoid R (already absent) and E (absent) -> so ALERT is bad because of E and R.

   Let's find words without C, R, N, E.

   Words with A in position 1: 
        SALAD? -> but L and D are new, but S is common. However, we can use also T.
        We want distinct letters to maximize information.

   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn't use E. So we must avoid E.

   Let's try A in position 2: 
        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.

   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don't know if A appears multiple times.

   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.

   Let's consider: 

   Option: Place A in position 4: 
        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A's. And Z is uncommon.

   Option: Place A in position 5: 
        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A's.

   Alternatively, let's try A in position 2.

   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S's. But S is common and we haven't tried S.

   Actually, without E and R, here's a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.

   SALTY: 
        S: not tested
        A: we know is present (but we'll put it in position 2, not 3)
        L, T, Y: not tested

   This covers several new common letters.

   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

   We must avoid N because it's absent.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.

   SALTY: 
      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? 
        C: absent -> not here
        R: absent -> not here
        N: absent -> not here
        E: absent -> not here

   So SALTY is acceptable.

   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don't care if it helps test P? Also, we don't know about P.

   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

   Why SALTY?
      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).
      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.

   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don't know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? 
   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it's present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. 
   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.

   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? 
   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a '-' again? But we already know it's not there? 
   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we'll get a '-'? 
   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.

   Therefore, let's pick SALTY: A in position 2.

   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? 
   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven't tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.

   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.

   So I think SALTY is a good choice.

   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.

   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a '-' meaning A is present but not in that position.

   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it's wrong. We don't gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? 
   Actually, we might if there are two A's? But we don't know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.

   Therefore, I choose SALTY.

   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.

   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.

   This tests:
        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?
        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?
        L at position 3: new letter
        T at position 4: new letter
        Y at position 5: new letter

   And we avoid the known absent letters.

   So let's go with SALTY.

   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it's not in the word.

   So we avoid STAIR.

   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F's and we can test F? But we don't know. However, it has F repeated? 
   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? 

   So SALTY seems better.

   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.

   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.

   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. 

   Therefore, SALTY is better.

   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.

   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.

   So I will guess: SALTY

   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:
- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.
- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y. All letters are untested and avoid the known absent ones.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got '-')
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since in ""salty"", A was in position 2 and we got a checkmark).
- S, L, T, Y are not in the word.

So now we know:
- A is in the secret word and is in position 2. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y. So we can't use those.
- The secret word has 5 letters, one of which is A in the second position.

We now know the second letter is A. Therefore the word structure is: _ A _ _ _

We need to think about what letters are left. We haven't tested many vowels: only A and E (which is absent). So vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but Y is already eliminated). Since Y is eliminated, we focus on I, O, U.

Also, consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: Q, Z, X are less common.

We need to form a word of the form _ A _ _ _

We know the word must contain A in position 2 and must not include C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Now, since in the first guess, we had A in the word (but wrong position) and now we found it in position 2, that suggests that the A might have been moved from its correct position? Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it's in position 2.

We have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

What we can try:
We can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words: 
- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That's not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.

- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.

- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.

- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.

- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.

- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.

- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.

Consider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.

For example:
- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can't use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.

- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _

- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.

Another idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.

Actually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.

Let me think of common words: 
- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.
- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.

We can use:
- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A's? We don't know yet. But N is out so invalid.

- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.

Since vowels are limited, let's try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.

Or GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.

So we need words that don't contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have A fixed at position 2.

List of possible words (from common English words):
- PADAU? Not common.
- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.
- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.
- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn't reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.

How about:
- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.

Another: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.

HABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.

But T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven't tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.

Similarly, Y absent, L absent.

So what words exist? Let me think:

Valid words with pattern _A_ _ _:

- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.
- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don't know.

- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.

Wait, we need to avoid S.

How about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.

I am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.

We must have A in second.

Another: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Perhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _

WORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.

But MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to test new letters? We haven't tried M and G.

However, we know A is already correct in position 2.

But MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don't know about multiple A's? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it's the same A? Or could there be two?

Actually, if there were two A's, the first guess would have shown A as '-' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn't rule out another A elsewhere.

But we don't know.

Similarly, MAGMA: 
- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.

But MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let's be more common.

Another idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.

We are struggling because common letters are eliminated.

Let me try different vowels: Using O.

For example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.

GAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.

But try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.

Another: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.

We need to include I or O or U and new consonants.

Possible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.

No.

Another: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.

We need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.

List of English words with A at position 2:

Common ones: 
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.
- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.
- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.
- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.

So we avoid R.

Let me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.

BAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.

Perhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.

PAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.

I am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it's proper.

HADJI: that's an Arabic term? Valid.

But letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? 
- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.

So HADJI is a word? I think it's acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.

Another common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.

""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.

We haven't used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.

How about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.

GAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.

We have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.

Another idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.

PAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.

It's difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. 

But BADAM is not standard.

Perhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.

GADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.

GADID: letters:
- G: not tested
- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don't have to reuse A? Or not?

Actually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.

But GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

Feedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.

But the word might not have two D's? We'll see.

But is GADID common? Unusual.

Another word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.

We need words without E.

Perhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.

Word: FAUGH

Which is an exclamation, meaning off.

But acceptable? Let's see.

Otherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.

Padma = lotus? But valid.

Now, from the available letters, we can choose among these.

Since we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven't tested: I, O, U.

Let's prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.

Choose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.

Possible words:
- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.
- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.
- ""FAPPS"" no.
- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.

Another: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.

""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.

""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.

""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.

PAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.

But 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.

Position 2 is A.

Letters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: 
- P: not used before
- G: not used
- O: not used
- D: not used

And they are all available.

So PAGOD is acceptable.

Another possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.

Or ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.

Yes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

That covers V, P, I, D.

But PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.

But VAPID has I? Vowel I.

But both appear valid.

Since we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.

But P is common.

Another word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.

We can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.

The secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.

We haven't tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.

VAPID: V, P, I, D.

Note that both include P and D? Not a problem.

But VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.

The word is _A_ _ _

We have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.

In PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.

Both untested.

For commonality, I think both words are valid.

Let's choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.

Another common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.

So not.

""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.

""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.

Perhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.

We are limited.

So I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.

Let me choose VAPID? Because at least it's more common English word.

VAPID is a bit negative, but valid.

Or ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.

So VAPID seems reasonable.

Another option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.

So we go with VAPID.

We risk but it's one of the few words.

Perhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.

Yes, so guess: VAPID.

But VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> 
- We haven't tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.

And A in position 2 which is correct.

So we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.

If not in the word, that will eliminate them.

So let's go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  
  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).
- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  
3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  
4. **Word selection criteria**:  
   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  
   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  
   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  
5. **Brainstorm options**:  
   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  
   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  
6. **Optimization**:  
   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  
     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  
     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  
     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  
   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  
7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.

Chosen guess: **vapid**.

However, we can use also T.\n        We want distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn\'t use E. So we must avoid E.\n\n   Let\'s try A in position 2: \n        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.\n\n   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don\'t know if A appears multiple times.\n\n   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.\n\n   Let\'s consider: \n\n   Option: Place A in position 4: \n        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A\'s. And Z is uncommon.\n\n   Option: Place A in position 5: \n        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A\'s.\n\n   Alternatively, let\'s try A in position 2.\n\n   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S\'s. But S is common and we haven\'t tried S.\n\n   Actually, without E and R, here\'s a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.\n\n   SALTY: \n        S: not tested\n        A: we know is present (but we\'ll put it in position 2, not 3)\n        L, T, Y: not tested\n\n   This covers several new common letters.\n\n   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n   We must avoid N because it\'s absent.\n\n   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n   SALTY: \n      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? \n        C: absent -> not here\n        R: absent -> not here\n        N: absent -> not here\n        E: absent -> not here\n\n   So SALTY is acceptable.\n\n   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don\'t care if it helps test P? Also, we don\'t know about P.\n\n   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\n   Why SALTY?\n      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).\n      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.\n\n   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don\'t know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? \n   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it\'s present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. \n   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.\n\n   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? \n   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a \'-\' again? But we already know it\'s not there? \n   So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we\'ll get a \'-\'? \n   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s pick SALTY: A in position 2.\n\n   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? \n   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven\'t tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.\n\n   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.\n\n   So I think SALTY is a good choice.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.\n\n   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a \'-\' meaning A is present but not in that position.\n\n   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it\'s wrong. We don\'t gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? \n   Actually, we might if there are two A\'s? But we don\'t know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.\n\n   Therefore, I choose SALTY.\n\n   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.\n\n   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n\n   This tests:\n        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?\n        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?\n        L at position 3: new letter\n        T at position 4: new letter\n        Y at position 5: new letter\n\n   And we avoid the known absent letters.\n\n   So let\'s go with SALTY.\n\n   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it\'s not in the word.\n\n   So we avoid STAIR.\n\n   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F\'s and we can test F? But we don\'t know. However, it has F repeated? \n   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? \n\n   So SALTY seems better.\n\n   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.\n\n   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.\n\n   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. \n\n   Therefore, SALTY is better.\n\n   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.\n\n   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.\n\n   So I will guess: SALTY\n\n   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:\n- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.\n- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y.

O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent?

G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.\n\nWe have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.\n\nAnother idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.\n\nPAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.\n\nIt\'s difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. \n\nBut BADAM is not standard.\n\nPerhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.\n\nGADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.\n\nGADID: letters:\n- G: not tested\n- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don\'t have to reuse A? Or not?\n\nActually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.\n\nBut GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.\n\nFeedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.\n\nBut the word might not have two D\'s? We\'ll see.\n\nBut is GADID common? Unusual.\n\nAnother word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.\n\nWe need words without E.\n\nPerhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.\n\nWord: FAUGH\n\nWhich is an exclamation, meaning off.\n\nBut acceptable? Let\'s see.\n\nOtherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.\n\nPadma = lotus? But valid.\n\nNow, from the available letters, we can choose among these.\n\nSince we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven\'t tested: I, O, U.\n\nLet\'s prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.\n\nChoose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.\n- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.\n- ""FAPPS"" no.\n- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.\n\nAnother: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.\n\n""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.\n\n""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.\n\n""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.\n\nPAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.\n\nBut 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.\n\nPosition 2 is A.\n\nLetters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: \n- P: not used before\n- G: not used\n- O: not used\n- D: not used\n\nAnd they are all available.\n\nSo PAGOD is acceptable.\n\nAnother possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.\n\nOr ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.\n\nYes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.\n\nThat covers V, P, I, D.\n\nBut PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.\n\nBut VAPID has I? Vowel I.\n\nBut both appear valid.\n\nSince we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.\n\nBut P is common.\n\nAnother word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.\n\nWe can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.\n\nThe secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.\n\nVAPID: V, P, I, D.\n\nNote that both include P and D? Not a problem.\n\nBut VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.\n\nThe word is _A_ _ _\n\nWe have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.\n\nIn PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.\n\nBoth untested.\n\nFor commonality, I think both words are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.\n\nSo not.\n\n""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.\n\n""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.\n\nWe are limited.\n\nSo I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.\n\nLet me choose VAPID? Because at least it\'s more common English word.\n\nVAPID is a bit negative, but valid.\n\nOr ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.\n\nSo VAPID seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.\n\nSo we go with VAPID.\n\nWe risk but it\'s one of the few words.\n\nPerhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.\n\nYes, so guess: VAPID.\n\nBut VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> \n- We haven\'t tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.\n\nAnd A in position 2 which is correct.\n\nSo we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.\n\nIf not in the word, that will eliminate them.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  \n  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  \n  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.\n- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).\n- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  \n2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  \n3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  \n4. **Word selection criteria**:  \n   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  \n   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  \n   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  \n5. **Brainstorm options**:  \n   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  \n   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  \n6. **Optimization**:  \n   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  \n     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  \n     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  \n     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  \n   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  \n7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.\n\nChosen guess: **vapid**.\n\n<guess>vapid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: vapid -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Meaning: A is correct and at position 2. S, L, T, Y are absent.

Guess 3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
Meaning: A is again correct (position 2). V, P, I, D are absent.

Summary:
- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _
- Letters absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D
- Therefore, the remaining possible letters are: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z
- The word must not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Let's list the available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z

Considering the pattern: ?A??? 

Possible words:
- Using common letters: We haven't tested B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, etc.

Options:
- BAUKS? (a weight) Not common.
- FAUGH? But F and U and G used? But FAUGH has F, A, U, G, H -> all available? But FAUGH was considered earlier? However, in guess 3, we didn't test F? F is available.

FAUGH: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: U (vowel)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: H

But FAUGH is interjection meaning 'begone'. Valid.

- KAGU? Only 4 letters? Not 5.

- GAWKY? G, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? From guess 2 Y is absent? So no.

- HAUGH? H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? HAUCH/Haugh is a word meaning river meadow? But spelled HAUGH? Yes, 5 letters: HAUGH.

Letters: H, A, U, G, H -> so H is repeated? But we haven't tested H? It's available.

But HAUGH is a valid word.

- MAUGH? Not common.

- WAUGH? Not common.

Another option: BAGHS? B, A, G, H, S -> S is absent? Not allowed.

- GAUMS? G, A, U, M, S -> S absent? No.

We avoid S? S is absent.

Possible words: BAFFY? But Y is absent? No.

Or GAUMY? G, A, U, M, Y -> Y absent? No.

We notice that Y is absent so we must not use Y.

Now, let's look for words without the eliminated letters and with available vowels Vowels available: O, U? We have I absent? I was tested in VAPID and absent? Yes? So A is the only vowel confirmed? But no: A is fixed? We may need other vowels.

Vowels: O, U available? I is absent? So U is a possibility? And O.

But in English, words with A in position 2 and using U or O.

Another word: ""FAZED"" -> Z, E, D? E and D absent? Not.

Alternative: ""MAWMY"" -> M, A, W, M, Y -> Y absent? No.

But we have few options: FAUGH or HAUGH? 

FAUGH: F, A, U, G, H -> letters not eliminated? So it is valid.

HAUGH: H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? But acceptable? Yes.

Also, WAUGH: W, A, U, G, H -> same.

But WAUGH is a surname? Valid.

Also GAUFF? Not common.

Another possibility: BAFFS is invalid due to S? Not.

Thus, we can choose among FAUGH, HAUGH, WAUGH? Or GAUCH? G, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.

GAUCH is not a word? Gauch is not standard.

Let me confirm commonality? But Wordle accepts less common words? Maybe.

But FAUGH and HAUGH are listed in Scrabble dictionaries.

But notice: the feedback must use valid English words? So I think we can choose FAUGH? But WAUGH might be better? Or HAUGH.

Another word: ""BAHU"" only 4 letters? No.

Or ""KABAB"" but K, A, B, A, B -> repeated A and B? But positions:1:K,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:B? Actually KABAB might be accepted? But KABAB is spelt with variations? But valid? Kabob would be with O? So not.

We should focus on FAUGH? Or perhaps ""MAUMA"" M, A, U, M, A? Repeated M? But MAUMA meaning mom? Valid informal? Might not be accepted.

But let's be safe: HAUGH is a word? Yes? For example, ""haugh"" is a Scottish term for low-lying meadow.

Similarly, FAUGH is an exclamation.

WAUGH might be less common.

We also haven't tested B and M? B and M are available.

So another option: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not allowed.

Or ""MAHUA"" M, A, H, U, A -> repeated A? MAHUA is a tree? Valid? 5 letters.

Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:H, 4:U, 5:A? But pattern is ?A??? so position 2 is A? Correct? But positions 1 and 5 will be tested.

MAHUA: M, A, H, U, A -> all letters available? M, H, U, A? But A is repeated? We don't know if the word has two A's? Possible? But letters M, H, U, A? H is present? But we haven't tested H.

However, MAHUA has two A's.

Similarly, BAUKS? B, A, U, K, S -> S is absent? No.

GAWK not 5.

Let me choose HAUGH: 
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: H

So letters: H, U, G? But H repeated? We are testing H and U and G.

This covers: H at positions 1 and 5? U at position 3? G at position 4.

If HAUGH is the answer, we will get feedback accordingly.

But if not, we eliminate H, U, G? Or any of them.

Another word: FAUNA -> F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? Not allowed? Since N is eliminated? So FAUNA is invalid because of N.

Similarly not.

Therefore, I think HAUGH is a reasonable guess? Or FAUGH.

How about BAUCH? B, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.

So after all, let's pick HAUGH? But WAUGH is also valid? Let's use WAUGH to combine W? But W is untested.

But HAUGH is simpler.

Perhaps ""OAKUM"" -> but O, A, K, U, M? Position 1: O? Position 2: A? Yes? But OAKUM: O, A, K, U, M? 
- O: not tested? 
- A: position 2 correct? 
- K: not tested?
- U: not tested?
- M: not tested?

And it doesn't contain any eliminated letter? Letters: O, K, U, M? And A.

But OAKUM is a word? Yes, oakum. Used in ship building? Valid.

Therefore, OAKUM:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: M

And letters: O, K, U, M are all new? And available: not in eliminated list.

Compared to HAUGH which has repeated H? OAKUM doesn't have repeats? And covers more varied letters? So OAKUM is better.

OAKUM: 
- O: vowel
- K: consonant
- U: vowel
- M: consonant

All distinct? So we test all four with one guess.

So preferred over HAUGH? Yes.

Therefore, we guess OAKUM.

But OAKUM has O? Position 1? And M? Position 5.

If not, we eliminate O, K, U, M.

So let's go with OAKUM.From the accumulated feedback:

- **Absent letters (confirmed not in secret word)**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D  
- **Present and fixed**: A at position 2  
- **Remaining letters available** (not previously guessed or eliminated): B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z  
- **Pattern constraint**: Secret word is `? A ? ? ?`  

### Objective:
Guess a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 2, using only remaining letters.  

### Evaluation:
- Prioritize common words first to avoid obscurity.  
- Maximize information gain with distinct new letters.  
- Eliminated words:  
  - Excluded if containing absent letters (e.g., ""baggy"" invalid due to Y).  
  - Excluded if not matching pattern (e.g., ""audio"" lacks A at position 2).  

### Selected Guess: ""oakum""
Rationale:  
- **Letters tested**: O (position 1), A (fixed/position 2), K (position 3), U (position 4), M (position 5).  
- **Validity**: ""Oakum"" is a recognized English word (material used in shipbuilding), accepted by Wordle dictionaries.  
- **Coverage**: Tests 4 new letters (O, K, U, M), all from remaining set.  
- **Distinctness**: No repeated letters, maximizing potential feedback.

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

- **Guess 3: vapid** → Feedback: V(x), A(✓), P(x), I(x), D(x)  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Fixed letter**: A is confirmed correct and in position 2 (secret word pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D (17 eliminated, leaving 9 possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z).
3. **Goal for next guess**: Use a word that:
   - Includes A in position 2.
   - Uses only the remaining letters.
   - Tests new common letters to gather information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

### Selected Guess:
""**OAKUM**"" is chosen because:
- **Pattern**: Fits `? A ? ? ?` (position 2: A).
- **Letters tested**: 
  - O (position 1: untested vowel).
  - K (position 3: untested consonant).
  - U (position 4: untested vowel).
  - M (position 5: untested consonant).
- **Validity**: Recognized English word (meaning fiber used in shipbuilding).  
- **Information gain**: Tests 4 distinct new letters (not repeated), maximizing feedback for remaining possibilities.  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""haugh"" or ""fauch"" were discarded due to obscurity or duplicate letters.

1. **Fixed letter**: A is confirmed correct and in position 2 (secret word pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D (17 eliminated, leaving 9 possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z).
3. **Goal for next guess**: Use a word that:
   - Includes A in position 2.
   - Uses only the remaining letters.
   - Tests new common letters to gather information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

### Selected Guess:
""**OAKUM**"" is chosen because:
- **Pattern**: Fits `? A ? ? ?` (position 2: A).
- **Letters tested**: 
  - O (position 1: untested vowel).
  - K (position 3: untested consonant).
  - U (position 4: untested vowel).
  - M (position 5: untested consonant).
- **Validity**: Recognized English word (meaning fiber used in shipbuilding).  
- **Information gain**: Tests 4 distinct new letters (not repeated), maximizing feedback for remaining possibilities.  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""haugh"" or ""fauch"" were discarded due to obscurity or duplicate letters.",Guess 4: oakum -> FEEDBACK: O(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) M(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters (C, R, A, N, E).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the secret word but not in the position it was guessed (so not the third position).
   - C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3 (since the guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning wrong position).

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent, so we should avoid using them in the next guess.

 For the next guess, we want to try to include A (but in a different position) and test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 We also want to avoid repeating the absent letters (C, R, N, E).

 Common consonants and vowels to consider: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A (but not in the third position) and use other common letters.

 Since A was in position 3 and now we know it's not there, let's try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Position 2: _ A _ _ _
   Position 4: _ _ _ A _
   Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

 We also note that we have not tested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses as many of these unused common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has A in a new position and includes S and T.

 Example words:
   If A is in position 1: ALERT, ABLED, etc. But avoid R (already absent) and E (absent) -> so ALERT is bad because of E and R.

   Let's find words without C, R, N, E.

   Words with A in position 1: 
        SALAD? -> but L and D are new, but S is common. However, we can use also T.
        We want distinct letters to maximize information.

   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn't use E. So we must avoid E.

   Let's try A in position 2: 
        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.

   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don't know if A appears multiple times.

   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.

   Let's consider: 

   Option: Place A in position 4: 
        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A's. And Z is uncommon.

   Option: Place A in position 5: 
        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A's.

   Alternatively, let's try A in position 2.

   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S's. But S is common and we haven't tried S.

   Actually, without E and R, here's a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.

   SALTY: 
        S: not tested
        A: we know is present (but we'll put it in position 2, not 3)
        L, T, Y: not tested

   This covers several new common letters.

   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

   We must avoid N because it's absent.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.

   SALTY: 
      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? 
        C: absent -> not here
        R: absent -> not here
        N: absent -> not here
        E: absent -> not here

   So SALTY is acceptable.

   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don't care if it helps test P? Also, we don't know about P.

   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

   Why SALTY?
      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).
      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.

   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don't know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? 
   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it's present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. 
   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.

   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? 
   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a '-' again? But we already know it's not there? 
   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we'll get a '-'? 
   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.

   Therefore, let's pick SALTY: A in position 2.

   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? 
   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven't tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.

   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.

   So I think SALTY is a good choice.

   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.

   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a '-' meaning A is present but not in that position.

   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it's wrong. We don't gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? 
   Actually, we might if there are two A's? But we don't know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.

   Therefore, I choose SALTY.

   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.

   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.

   This tests:
        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?
        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?
        L at position 3: new letter
        T at position 4: new letter
        Y at position 5: new letter

   And we avoid the known absent letters.

   So let's go with SALTY.

   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it's not in the word.

   So we avoid STAIR.

   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F's and we can test F? But we don't know. However, it has F repeated? 
   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? 

   So SALTY seems better.

   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.

   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.

   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. 

   Therefore, SALTY is better.

   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.

   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.

   So I will guess: SALTY

   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:
- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.
- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y. All letters are untested and avoid the known absent ones.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got '-')
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since in ""salty"", A was in position 2 and we got a checkmark).
- S, L, T, Y are not in the word.

So now we know:
- A is in the secret word and is in position 2. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y. So we can't use those.
- The secret word has 5 letters, one of which is A in the second position.

We now know the second letter is A. Therefore the word structure is: _ A _ _ _

We need to think about what letters are left. We haven't tested many vowels: only A and E (which is absent). So vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but Y is already eliminated). Since Y is eliminated, we focus on I, O, U.

Also, consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: Q, Z, X are less common.

We need to form a word of the form _ A _ _ _

We know the word must contain A in position 2 and must not include C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Now, since in the first guess, we had A in the word (but wrong position) and now we found it in position 2, that suggests that the A might have been moved from its correct position? Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it's in position 2.

We have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

What we can try:
We can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words: 
- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That's not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.

- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.

- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.

- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.

- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.

- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.

- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.

Consider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.

For example:
- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can't use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.

- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _

- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.

Another idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.

Actually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.

Let me think of common words: 
- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.
- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.

We can use:
- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A's? We don't know yet. But N is out so invalid.

- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.

Since vowels are limited, let's try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.

Or GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.

So we need words that don't contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have A fixed at position 2.

List of possible words (from common English words):
- PADAU? Not common.
- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.
- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.
- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn't reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.

How about:
- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.

Another: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.

HABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.

But T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven't tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.

Similarly, Y absent, L absent.

So what words exist? Let me think:

Valid words with pattern _A_ _ _:

- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.
- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don't know.

- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.

Wait, we need to avoid S.

How about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.

I am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.

We must have A in second.

Another: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Perhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _

WORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.

But MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to test new letters? We haven't tried M and G.

However, we know A is already correct in position 2.

But MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don't know about multiple A's? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it's the same A? Or could there be two?

Actually, if there were two A's, the first guess would have shown A as '-' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn't rule out another A elsewhere.

But we don't know.

Similarly, MAGMA: 
- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.

But MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let's be more common.

Another idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.

We are struggling because common letters are eliminated.

Let me try different vowels: Using O.

For example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.

GAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.

But try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.

Another: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.

We need to include I or O or U and new consonants.

Possible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.

No.

Another: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.

We need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.

List of English words with A at position 2:

Common ones: 
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.
- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.
- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.
- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.

So we avoid R.

Let me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.

BAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.

Perhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.

PAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.

I am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it's proper.

HADJI: that's an Arabic term? Valid.

But letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? 
- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.

So HADJI is a word? I think it's acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.

Another common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.

""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.

We haven't used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.

How about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.

GAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.

We have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.

Another idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.

PAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.

It's difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. 

But BADAM is not standard.

Perhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.

GADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.

GADID: letters:
- G: not tested
- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don't have to reuse A? Or not?

Actually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.

But GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

Feedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.

But the word might not have two D's? We'll see.

But is GADID common? Unusual.

Another word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.

We need words without E.

Perhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.

Word: FAUGH

Which is an exclamation, meaning off.

But acceptable? Let's see.

Otherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.

Padma = lotus? But valid.

Now, from the available letters, we can choose among these.

Since we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven't tested: I, O, U.

Let's prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.

Choose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.

Possible words:
- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.
- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.
- ""FAPPS"" no.
- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.

Another: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.

""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.

""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.

""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.

PAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.

But 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.

Position 2 is A.

Letters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: 
- P: not used before
- G: not used
- O: not used
- D: not used

And they are all available.

So PAGOD is acceptable.

Another possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.

Or ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.

Yes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

That covers V, P, I, D.

But PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.

But VAPID has I? Vowel I.

But both appear valid.

Since we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.

But P is common.

Another word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.

We can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.

The secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.

We haven't tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.

VAPID: V, P, I, D.

Note that both include P and D? Not a problem.

But VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.

The word is _A_ _ _

We have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.

In PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.

Both untested.

For commonality, I think both words are valid.

Let's choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.

Another common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.

So not.

""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.

""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.

Perhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.

We are limited.

So I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.

Let me choose VAPID? Because at least it's more common English word.

VAPID is a bit negative, but valid.

Or ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.

So VAPID seems reasonable.

Another option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.

So we go with VAPID.

We risk but it's one of the few words.

Perhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.

Yes, so guess: VAPID.

But VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> 
- We haven't tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.

And A in position 2 which is correct.

So we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.

If not in the word, that will eliminate them.

So let's go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  
  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).
- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  
3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  
4. **Word selection criteria**:  
   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  
   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  
   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  
5. **Brainstorm options**:  
   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  
   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  
6. **Optimization**:  
   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  
     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  
     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  
     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  
   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  
7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.

Chosen guess: **vapid**.

<guess>vapid</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: vapid -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Meaning: A is correct and at position 2. S, L, T, Y are absent.

Guess 3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
Meaning: A is again correct (position 2). V, P, I, D are absent.

Summary:
- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _
- Letters absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D
- Therefore, the remaining possible letters are: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z
- The word must not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Let's list the available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z

Considering the pattern: ?A??? 

Possible words:
- Using common letters: We haven't tested B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, etc.

Options:
- BAUKS? (a weight) Not common.
- FAUGH? But F and U and G used? But FAUGH has F, A, U, G, H -> all available? But FAUGH was considered earlier? However, in guess 3, we didn't test F? F is available.

FAUGH: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: U (vowel)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: H

But FAUGH is interjection meaning 'begone'. Valid.

- KAGU? Only 4 letters? Not 5.

- GAWKY? G, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? From guess 2 Y is absent? So no.

- HAUGH? H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? HAUCH/Haugh is a word meaning river meadow? But spelled HAUGH? Yes, 5 letters: HAUGH.

Letters: H, A, U, G, H -> so H is repeated? But we haven't tested H? It's available.

But HAUGH is a valid word.

- MAUGH? Not common.

- WAUGH? Not common.

Another option: BAGHS? B, A, G, H, S -> S is absent? Not allowed.

- GAUMS? G, A, U, M, S -> S absent? No.

We avoid S? S is absent.

Possible words: BAFFY? But Y is absent? No.

Or GAUMY? G, A, U, M, Y -> Y absent? No.

We notice that Y is absent so we must not use Y.

Now, let's look for words without the eliminated letters and with available vowels Vowels available: O, U? We have I absent? I was tested in VAPID and absent? Yes? So A is the only vowel confirmed? But no: A is fixed? We may need other vowels.

Vowels: O, U available? I is absent? So U is a possibility? And O.

But in English, words with A in position 2 and using U or O.

Another word: ""FAZED"" -> Z, E, D? E and D absent? Not.

Alternative: ""MAWMY"" -> M, A, W, M, Y -> Y absent? No.

But we have few options: FAUGH or HAUGH? 

FAUGH: F, A, U, G, H -> letters not eliminated? So it is valid.

HAUGH: H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? But acceptable? Yes.

Also, WAUGH: W, A, U, G, H -> same.

But WAUGH is a surname? Valid.

Also GAUFF? Not common.

Another possibility: BAFFS is invalid due to S? Not.

Thus, we can choose among FAUGH, HAUGH, WAUGH? Or GAUCH? G, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.

GAUCH is not a word? Gauch is not standard.

Let me confirm commonality? But Wordle accepts less common words? Maybe.

But FAUGH and HAUGH are listed in Scrabble dictionaries.

But notice: the feedback must use valid English words? So I think we can choose FAUGH? But WAUGH might be better? Or HAUGH.

Another word: ""BAHU"" only 4 letters? No.

Or ""KABAB"" but K, A, B, A, B -> repeated A and B? But positions:1:K,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:B? Actually KABAB might be accepted? But KABAB is spelt with variations? But valid? Kabob would be with O? So not.

We should focus on FAUGH? Or perhaps ""MAUMA"" M, A, U, M, A? Repeated M? But MAUMA meaning mom? Valid informal? Might not be accepted.

But let's be safe: HAUGH is a word? Yes? For example, ""haugh"" is a Scottish term for low-lying meadow.

Similarly, FAUGH is an exclamation.

WAUGH might be less common.

We also haven't tested B and M? B and M are available.

So another option: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not allowed.

Or ""MAHUA"" M, A, H, U, A -> repeated A? MAHUA is a tree? Valid? 5 letters.

Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:H, 4:U, 5:A? But pattern is ?A??? so position 2 is A? Correct? But positions 1 and 5 will be tested.

MAHUA: M, A, H, U, A -> all letters available? M, H, U, A? But A is repeated? We don't know if the word has two A's? Possible? But letters M, H, U, A? H is present? But we haven't tested H.

However, MAHUA has two A's.

Similarly, BAUKS? B, A, U, K, S -> S is absent? No.

GAWK not 5.

Let me choose HAUGH: 
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: H

So letters: H, U, G? But H repeated? We are testing H and U and G.

This covers: H at positions 1 and 5? U at position 3? G at position 4.

If HAUGH is the answer, we will get feedback accordingly.

But if not, we eliminate H, U, G? Or any of them.

Another word: FAUNA -> F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? Not allowed? Since N is eliminated? So FAUNA is invalid because of N.

Similarly not.

Therefore, I think HAUGH is a reasonable guess? Or FAUGH.

How about BAUCH? B, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.

So after all, let's pick HAUGH? But WAUGH is also valid? Let's use WAUGH to combine W? But W is untested.

But HAUGH is simpler.

Perhaps ""OAKUM"" -> but O, A, K, U, M? Position 1: O? Position 2: A? Yes? But OAKUM: O, A, K, U, M? 
- O: not tested? 
- A: position 2 correct? 
- K: not tested?
- U: not tested?
- M: not tested?

And it doesn't contain any eliminated letter? Letters: O, K, U, M? And A.

But OAKUM is a word? Yes, oakum. Used in ship building? Valid.

Therefore, OAKUM:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: M

And letters: O, K, U, M are all new? And available: not in eliminated list.

Compared to HAUGH which has repeated H? OAKUM doesn't have repeats? And covers more varied letters? So OAKUM is better.

OAKUM: 
- O: vowel
- K: consonant
- U: vowel
- M: consonant

All distinct? So we test all four with one guess.

So preferred over HAUGH? Yes.

Therefore, we guess OAKUM.

But OAKUM has O? Position 1? And M? Position 5.

If not, we eliminate O, K, U, M.

So let's go with OAKUM.From the accumulated feedback:

- **Absent letters (confirmed not in secret word)**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D  
- **Present and fixed**: A at position 2  
- **Remaining letters available** (not previously guessed or eliminated): B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z  
- **Pattern constraint**: Secret word is `? A ? ? ?`  

### Objective:
Guess a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 2, using only remaining letters.  

### Evaluation:
- Prioritize common words first to avoid obscurity.  
- Maximize information gain with distinct new letters.  
- Eliminated words:  
  - Excluded if containing absent letters (e.g., ""baggy"" invalid due to Y).  
  - Excluded if not matching pattern (e.g., ""audio"" lacks A at position 2).  

### Selected Guess: ""oakum""
Rationale:  
- **Letters tested**: O (position 1), A (fixed/position 2), K (position 3), U (position 4), M (position 5).  
- **Validity**: ""Oakum"" is a recognized English word (material used in shipbuilding), accepted by Wordle dictionaries.  
- **Coverage**: Tests 4 new letters (O, K, U, M), all from remaining set.  
- **Distinctness**: No repeated letters, maximizing potential feedback.  

<guess>oakum</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
- **Guess 3: vapid** → Feedback: V(x), A(✓), P(x), I(x), D(x)  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Fixed letter**: A is confirmed correct and in position 2 (secret word pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D (17 eliminated, leaving 9 possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z).
3. **Goal for next guess**: Use a word that:
   - Includes A in position 2.
   - Uses only the remaining letters.
   - Tests new common letters to gather information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

### Selected Guess:
""**OAKUM**"" is chosen because:
- **Pattern**: Fits `? A ? ? ?` (position 2: A).
- **Letters tested**: 
  - O (position 1: untested vowel).
  - K (position 3: untested consonant).
  - U (position 4: untested vowel).
  - M (position 5: untested consonant).
- **Validity**: Recognized English word (meaning fiber used in shipbuilding).  
- **Information gain**: Tests 4 distinct new letters (not repeated), maximizing feedback for remaining possibilities.  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""haugh"" or ""fauch"" were discarded due to obscurity or duplicate letters.

We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.\n\n   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don\'t know if A appears multiple times.\n\n   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.\n\n   Let\'s consider: \n\n   Option: Place A in position 4: \n        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A\'s. And Z is uncommon.\n\n   Option: Place A in position 5: \n        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A\'s.\n\n   Alternatively, let\'s try A in position 2.\n\n   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S\'s. But S is common and we haven\'t tried S.\n\n   Actually, without E and R, here\'s a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.\n\n   SALTY: \n        S: not tested\n        A: we know is present (but we\'ll put it in position 2, not 3)\n        L, T, Y: not tested\n\n   This covers several new common letters.\n\n   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n   We must avoid N because it\'s absent.\n\n   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n   SALTY: \n      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? \n        C: absent -> not here\n        R: absent -> not here\n        N: absent -> not here\n        E: absent -> not here\n\n   So SALTY is acceptable.\n\n   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don\'t care if it helps test P? Also, we don\'t know about P.\n\n   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\n   Why SALTY?\n      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).\n      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.\n\n   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don\'t know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? \n   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it\'s present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. \n   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.\n\n   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? \n   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a \'-\' again? But we already know it\'s not there? \n   So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we\'ll get a \'-\'? \n   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s pick SALTY: A in position 2.\n\n   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? \n   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven\'t tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.\n\n   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.\n\n   So I think SALTY is a good choice.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.\n\n   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a \'-\' meaning A is present but not in that position.\n\n   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it\'s wrong. We don\'t gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? \n   Actually, we might if there are two A\'s? But we don\'t know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.\n\n   Therefore, I choose SALTY.\n\n   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.\n\n   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n\n   This tests:\n        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?\n        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?\n        L at position 3: new letter\n        T at position 4: new letter\n        Y at position 5: new letter\n\n   And we avoid the known absent letters.\n\n   So let\'s go with SALTY.\n\n   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it\'s not in the word.\n\n   So we avoid STAIR.\n\n   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F\'s and we can test F? But we don\'t know. However, it has F repeated? \n   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? \n\n   So SALTY seems better.\n\n   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.\n\n   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.\n\n   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. \n\n   Therefore, SALTY is better.\n\n   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.\n\n   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.\n\n   So I will guess: SALTY\n\n   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:\n- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.\n- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y.

Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it\'s in position 2.\n\nWe have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWhat we can try:\nWe can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible words: \n- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That\'s not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.\n\n- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.\n\n- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.\n\n- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.\n\n- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.\n\n- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.\n\n- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.\n\nConsider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.\n\nFor example:\n- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can\'t use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.\n\n- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _\n\n- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.\n\nAnother idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.\n\nActually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.\n\nLet me think of common words: \n- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.\n- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.\n\nWe can use:\n- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A\'s? We don\'t know yet. But N is out so invalid.\n\n- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.\n\nSince vowels are limited, let\'s try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.\n\nOr GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.\n\nSo we need words that don\'t contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.\n\nPossible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we have A fixed at position 2.\n\nList of possible words (from common English words):\n- PADAU? Not common.\n- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.\n- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.\n- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn\'t reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.\n\nHow about:\n- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.\n\nAnother: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.\n\nHABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.\n\nBut T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven\'t tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, Y absent, L absent.\n\nSo what words exist? Let me think:\n\nValid words with pattern _A_ _ _:\n\n- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.\n- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don\'t know.\n\n- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.\n\nWait, we need to avoid S.\n\nHow about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.\n\nI am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.\n\nWe must have A in second.\n\nAnother: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _\n\nWORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.\n\nBut MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.\n\nBut we have to test new letters? We haven\'t tried M and G.\n\nHowever, we know A is already correct in position 2.\n\nBut MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don\'t know about multiple A\'s? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it\'s the same A? Or could there be two?\n\nActually, if there were two A\'s, the first guess would have shown A as \'-\' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn\'t rule out another A elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, MAGMA: \n- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.\n\nBut MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let\'s be more common.\n\nAnother idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.\n\nWe are struggling because common letters are eliminated.\n\nLet me try different vowels: Using O.\n\nFor example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.\n\nGAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.\n\nBut try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.\n\nAnother: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.\n\nWe need to include I or O or U and new consonants.\n\nPossible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.\n\nWe need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.\n\nList of English words with A at position 2:\n\nCommon ones: \n- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.\n- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.\n- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.\n- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.\n\nSo we avoid R.\n\nLet me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.\n\nBAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.\n\nPerhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.\n\nPAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.\n\nI am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it\'s proper.\n\nHADJI: that\'s an Arabic term? Valid.\n\nBut letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? \n- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.\n\nSo HADJI is a word? I think it\'s acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.\n\nAnother common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.\n\n""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.\n\nWe haven\'t used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.\n\nHow about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.\n\nGAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.\n\nWe have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.\n\nAnother idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.\n\nPAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.\n\nIt\'s difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. \n\nBut BADAM is not standard.\n\nPerhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.\n\nGADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.\n\nGADID: letters:\n- G: not tested\n- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don\'t have to reuse A? Or not?\n\nActually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.\n\nBut GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.\n\nFeedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.\n\nBut the word might not have two D\'s? We\'ll see.\n\nBut is GADID common? Unusual.\n\nAnother word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.\n\nWe need words without E.\n\nPerhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.\n\nWord: FAUGH\n\nWhich is an exclamation, meaning off.\n\nBut acceptable? Let\'s see.\n\nOtherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.\n\nPadma = lotus? But valid.\n\nNow, from the available letters, we can choose among these.\n\nSince we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven\'t tested: I, O, U.\n\nLet\'s prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.\n\nChoose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.\n- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.\n- ""FAPPS"" no.\n- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.\n\nAnother: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.\n\n""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.\n\n""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.\n\n""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.\n\nPAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.\n\nBut 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.\n\nPosition 2 is A.\n\nLetters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: \n- P: not used before\n- G: not used\n- O: not used\n- D: not used\n\nAnd they are all available.\n\nSo PAGOD is acceptable.\n\nAnother possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.\n\nOr ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.\n\nYes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.\n\nThat covers V, P, I, D.\n\nBut PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.\n\nBut VAPID has I? Vowel I.\n\nBut both appear valid.\n\nSince we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.\n\nBut P is common.\n\nAnother word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.\n\nWe can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.\n\nThe secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.\n\nVAPID: V, P, I, D.\n\nNote that both include P and D? Not a problem.\n\nBut VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.\n\nThe word is _A_ _ _\n\nWe have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.\n\nIn PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.\n\nBoth untested.\n\nFor commonality, I think both words are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.\n\nSo not.\n\n""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.\n\n""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.\n\nWe are limited.\n\nSo I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.\n\nLet me choose VAPID? Because at least it\'s more common English word.\n\nVAPID is a bit negative, but valid.\n\nOr ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.\n\nSo VAPID seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.\n\nSo we go with VAPID.\n\nWe risk but it\'s one of the few words.\n\nPerhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.\n\nYes, so guess: VAPID.\n\nBut VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> \n- We haven\'t tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.\n\nAnd A in position 2 which is correct.\n\nSo we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.\n\nIf not in the word, that will eliminate them.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  \n  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  \n  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.\n- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).\n- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  \n2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  \n3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  \n4. **Word selection criteria**:  \n   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  \n   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  \n   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  \n5. **Brainstorm options**:  \n   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  \n   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  \n6. **Optimization**:  \n   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  \n     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  \n     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  \n     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  \n   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  \n7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.\n\nChosen guess: **vapid**.\n\n<guess>vapid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: vapid -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning: A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: salty -> S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nMeaning: A is correct and at position 2. S, L, T, Y are absent.\n\nGuess 3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)\nMeaning: A is again correct (position 2). V, P, I, D are absent.\n\nSummary:\n- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _\n- Letters absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D\n- Therefore, the remaining possible letters are: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that:\n- Has A in position 2\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z\n- The word must not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z\n\nConsidering the pattern: ?A??? \n\nPossible words:\n- Using common letters: We haven\'t tested B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, etc.\n\nOptions:\n- BAUKS? (a weight) Not common.\n- FAUGH? But F and U and G used? But FAUGH has F, A, U, G, H -> all available? But FAUGH was considered earlier? However, in guess 3, we didn\'t test F? F is available.\n\nFAUGH: \n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: A (correct)\n- Position 3: U (vowel)\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: H\n\nBut FAUGH is interjection meaning \'begone\'. Valid.\n\n- KAGU? Only 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n- GAWKY? G, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? From guess 2 Y is absent? So no.\n\n- HAUGH? H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? HAUCH/Haugh is a word meaning river meadow? But spelled HAUGH? Yes, 5 letters: HAUGH.\n\nLetters: H, A, U, G, H -> so H is repeated? But we haven\'t tested H? It\'s available.\n\nBut HAUGH is a valid word.\n\n- MAUGH? Not common.\n\n- WAUGH? Not common.\n\nAnother option: BAGHS? B, A, G, H, S -> S is absent? Not allowed.\n\n- GAUMS? G, A, U, M, S -> S absent? No.\n\nWe avoid S? S is absent.\n\nPossible words: BAFFY? But Y is absent? No.\n\nOr GAUMY? G, A, U, M, Y -> Y absent? No.\n\nWe notice that Y is absent so we must not use Y.\n\nNow, let\'s look for words without the eliminated letters and with available vowels Vowels available: O, U? We have I absent? I was tested in VAPID and absent? Yes? So A is the only vowel confirmed? But no: A is fixed? We may need other vowels.\n\nVowels: O, U available? I is absent? So U is a possibility? And O.\n\nBut in English, words with A in position 2 and using U or O.\n\nAnother word: ""FAZED"" -> Z, E, D? E and D absent? Not.\n\nAlternative: ""MAWMY"" -> M, A, W, M, Y -> Y absent? No.\n\nBut we have few options: FAUGH or HAUGH? \n\nFAUGH: F, A, U, G, H -> letters not eliminated? So it is valid.\n\nHAUGH: H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? But acceptable? Yes.\n\nAlso, WAUGH: W, A, U, G, H -> same.\n\nBut WAUGH is a surname? Valid.\n\nAlso GAUFF? Not common.\n\nAnother possibility: BAFFS is invalid due to S? Not.\n\nThus, we can choose among FAUGH, HAUGH, WAUGH? Or GAUCH? G, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.\n\nGAUCH is not a word? Gauch is not standard.\n\nLet me confirm commonality? But Wordle accepts less common words? Maybe.\n\nBut FAUGH and HAUGH are listed in Scrabble dictionaries.\n\nBut notice: the feedback must use valid English words? So I think we can choose FAUGH? But WAUGH might be better? Or HAUGH.\n\nAnother word: ""BAHU"" only 4 letters? No.\n\nOr ""KABAB"" but K, A, B, A, B -> repeated A and B? But positions:1:K,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:B? Actually KABAB might be accepted? But KABAB is spelt with variations? But valid? Kabob would be with O? So not.\n\nWe should focus on FAUGH? Or perhaps ""MAUMA"" M, A, U, M, A? Repeated M? But MAUMA meaning mom? Valid informal? Might not be accepted.\n\nBut let\'s be safe: HAUGH is a word? Yes? For example, ""haugh"" is a Scottish term for low-lying meadow.\n\nSimilarly, FAUGH is an exclamation.\n\nWAUGH might be less common.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested B and M? B and M are available.\n\nSo another option: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not allowed.\n\nOr ""MAHUA"" M, A, H, U, A -> repeated A? MAHUA is a tree? Valid? 5 letters.\n\nPositions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:H, 4:U, 5:A? But pattern is ?A??? so position 2 is A? Correct? But positions 1 and 5 will be tested.\n\nMAHUA: M, A, H, U, A -> all letters available? M, H, U, A? But A is repeated? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? Possible? But letters M, H, U, A? H is present? But we haven\'t tested H.\n\nHowever, MAHUA has two A\'s.\n\nSimilarly, BAUKS? B, A, U, K, S -> S is absent? No.\n\nGAWK not 5.\n\nLet me choose HAUGH: \n- Position 1: H\n- Position 2: A (correct)\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: H\n\nSo letters: H, U, G? But H repeated? We are testing H and U and G.\n\nThis covers: H at positions 1 and 5? U at position 3? G at position 4.\n\nIf HAUGH is the answer, we will get feedback accordingly.\n\nBut if not, we eliminate H, U, G? Or any of them.\n\nAnother word: FAUNA -> F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? Not allowed? Since N is eliminated? So FAUNA is invalid because of N.\n\nSimilarly not.\n\nTherefore, I think HAUGH is a reasonable guess? Or FAUGH.\n\nHow about BAUCH? B, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.\n\nSo after all, let\'s pick HAUGH? But WAUGH is also valid? Let\'s use WAUGH to combine W? But W is untested.\n\nBut HAUGH is simpler.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKUM"" -> but O, A, K, U, M? Position 1: O? Position 2: A? Yes? But OAKUM: O, A, K, U, M? \n- O: not tested? \n- A: position 2 correct? \n- K: not tested?\n- U: not tested?\n- M: not tested?\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain any eliminated letter? Letters: O, K, U, M? And A.\n\nBut OAKUM is a word? Yes, oakum. Used in ship building? Valid.\n\nTherefore, OAKUM:\n- Position 1: O\n- Position 2: A (correct)\n- Position 3: K\n- Position 4: U\n- Position 5: M\n\nAnd letters: O, K, U, M are all new? And available: not in eliminated list.\n\nCompared to HAUGH which has repeated H? OAKUM doesn\'t have repeats? And covers more varied letters? So OAKUM is better.\n\nOAKUM: \n- O: vowel\n- K: consonant\n- U: vowel\n- M: consonant\n\nAll distinct? So we test all four with one guess.\n\nSo preferred over HAUGH?

We have feedback from Guess 4: oakum -> FEEDBACK: O(x), A(✓), K(x), U(x), M(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- O(x): O is not in the secret word.
- A(✓): A is correct and in position 2 (as we knew).
- K(x): K is not in the secret word.
- U(x): U is not in the secret word.
- M(-): M is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and got '-', meaning wrong position).

Therefore, new information:
- M is in the word, but not at position 5.
- O, K, U are absent (add them to the eliminated list).

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Fixed: Position 2 is A -> ? A ? ? ?
2. Present letters: 
   - We know A (position 2) and M (somewhere, but not position 5).
   - From guess 1, A was present (now fixed) and no other present letters except M now?
   - We have only these two confirmed present letters? But wait, could there be more?

But note: in all guesses, only A and M have shown as present (A with a '-' in guess1 and check in guess2, M with '-' in guess4).

3. Absent letters: From all guesses: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (and M is present but position unknown).

Note: We have only 7 letters left: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z, and M is present.

So the secret word contains A (position 2) and M (not position 5), and two other letters from the available set? Actually, three other letters? Because word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: one of B, F, G, H, W, X, Z?
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: one of the available letters (B, F, G, H, W, X, Z) or M? But M might be here? Not at position 5? So could be in position 1, 3, or 4?
Position 4: similarly.
Position 5: one of the available letters, but not M? Since M is not in position 5.

The word must have exactly one M? Or could there be multiples? We don't know? But M was guessed once? So feedback was only for one M? So there might be one M.

Also, the word may have other letters? We have 4 positions to fill (1,3,4,5) with 7 available letters? But one of them must be M? So:

- The secret word has:
   Position 2: A
   One M in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).
   And three other letters from the set: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? But the total letters are 7 available? But we need only three letters (since one of the positions is M).

Actually, the word might have more than the letters we have? But the letters must be from the available set? Since we eliminated the rest.

Total available letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (7 letters) and M is present? But not counted? Or M is exactly one occurrence? So:

The word must contain: A, M, and three distinct other letters? Or not distinct? We don't know? But let's assume distinct for now? But we might have repeated letters? Possible.

But note: in the available set, we have only 7 letters? So we might get duplicated letters? But we don't know.

Now, we know M is in the word but not in position 5? So possibilities: M in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we have to find a word that:

- Has A in position 2.
- Has M in one of position 1, 3, or 4? But not 5.
- Uses letters only from the available set? And avoids all absent letters.

Available letters for positions: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? But M is already one letter? So the other letters must be chosen from B, F, G, H, W, X, Z.

But we need three more letters? So one position is M? And three others from the 7.

We also note that M cannot be in position 5? So:

Case:
- Position 1 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 3 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 4 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 5 must be from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}? But not M.

Also, since M is one letter? But it could be duplicated? But we don't know? However, we haven't encountered it before? So likely one M? But possible.

Now, let's try to think of words: pattern: [M or _] A [M or _] [M or _] [_ but not M]

Possible words:

If M in position 1: M A _ _ _

Possible words: MAFIA? But F? And A? Position 3? But MAFIA: M, A, F, I, A -> I is absent? Not allowed? And A duplicated? But A is fixed? I absent.

Not.

MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> but we have G? and M? But A present? But positions: 
Position 1: M? But M in position 1 and 4? Also, letter A we know? But the feedback: if MAGMA, but M at position 1 and 4? We got M absent? No: we got M present? And available? 
But MAGMA uses M? Position 1: M? But we guessed M at 5 and got it present but wrong position? So if M is at position 1? And 4? Then in guess 4, M was at position 5? So M is not at 5? Which matches? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So OK? However, I? No, MAGMA: M, A, G, M, A -> letters: M, A, G. But we haven't tested G? But in MAHUA? Not.

But MAGMA: 
Position 1: M
Position 2: A
Position 3: G
Position 4: M
Position 5: A

But A is repeated? We know A is in the word? But we have A only at position 2? Or could there be another A? We don't know? So possible? 

But let's see: the word MAGMA: 
If secret word is MAGMA, then:
- A at position 2: correct (we have A(✓) in guesses where we guessed A at 2? So A is fixed? But position 5: A? Still, position 2 is A? 
However, our feedback in guess4: for oakum we had M? At position 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So if secret MAGMA, then M not at 5? So our guess oakum M at 5 would be absent? But we got M(-) meaning present but not at 5? So consistent? 

But wait: in guess4, oakum: O A K U M -> 
If secret MAGMA, then:
- O: not in MAGMA -> O(x) correct
- A: position 2: A(✓) correct
- K: not in MAGMA -> K(x) correct
- U: not in MAGMA -> U(x) correct
- M: guess at position 5? But real M is at positions 1 and 4? So M is in the wrong position? Thus M(-) correct? 

So MAGMA is a candidate? But the letters: M, A, G? and A again? But we haven't tested G? And M? So MAGMA is possible? 

But problem: MAGMA has two M's and two A's? We don't know? So it's allowed? Yes.

But MAGMA uses G? Which is available? So valid? Because absent letters: not eliminated? G is available? Yes.

Also M? Already in word? And A? Fixed.

Now, another possibility: if M in position 3: _ A M ? ?

Then words: could be HAMMY? But H, M, Y? But Y is absent? Not allowed.

Or BAMMY? Y absent? Not.

Or JAMMY? J? Have we tested? J not? But J is not in eliminated letters? But our available set includes B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? We don't have J? Why? Because from the feedback, we eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U. So J is not eliminated? We haven't tested J? 

Wait: the eliminated letters are those that were marked absent? Any letter not tested? So available letters should include all not marked absent plus the present ones? But we only have:

Available now: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? And J? And Q? So we forgot? 

Eliminated letters: 
- From guess 1: C, R, N, E
- From guess 2: S, L, T, Y
- From guess 3: V, P, I, D
- From guess 4: O, K, U

So absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,L,T,Y,V,P,I,D,O,K,U. -> total 15.

Alphabet: 26 letters? So remaining: A, B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But A is known? So letters not absent: A, M (which are the ones we know are present? Or might be?) Actually, M we know present? Any other? Only A and M.

So letters we can use: all letters not absent? So: A (fixed), M (present), and: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z. 

So 9 letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We also include J and Q and possibly others? We never guessed them? So they are available? We have:

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? And M? And A? But A is fixed? We don't need to guess A? So for the three other positions, we can choose from B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But M must appear exactly once? And we have to put it in position 1, 3, or 4.

Position 5: cannot be M? So must be one from: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Now, back to pattern:

If M in position 1: M A _ _ _

Then we need: position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ? (from set excluding M? But M in 1? Then others from available? Including M? But M already used? Or word might have multiple M? Possible? So we cannot rule out? But we don't know.

Similarly, if M not position 1? Then position 1 from available without M? But we don't know? So we have to allow duplicate? So many possible? 

But in practice, we need to think of a word.

Possible words:

- MAGMA: M A G M A -> 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: M
  Position 5: A -> uses G? And M repeated? And A repeated? 
  However, if we choose this, we get:
    Position 5: A? But we have position 2: A? So two A's? 
  But in feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane had A at 3? So if MAGMA has A at 2 and 5? Then at guess1, A at 3? Which we got '-' meaning present but not 3? Correct? 
    And guess2? Had A at 2? Correct? 
  Also, guess4: M at 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? Not 5? So M( - ) for position 5? Correct? 
  And letters: G is available? J, Q not used? 
  So MAGMA is possible.

- Another word: M? With no duplicate? For example, MAWGH? Not a word? 

- Or HAWKM? But K eliminated? Not? 

Since M must be in position 1,3,or4? 

Let me list possible positions for M:

Case 1: M at position 1: words: 
  MABIG? Not word? 
  MAGUS? U? Not available? 

Case 2: M at position 3: words: 
  We have pattern: ? A M ? ?
  Position 1: must be from available? B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? 
  Position 4: similarly? 
  Position 5: similarly? 

  Words: 
    JAMBU? J, A, M, B, U? But U eliminated? Not?
    HAMZA? H, A, M, Z, A -> repeated A? And Z? And H? 
    Position 5: A? So if HAMZA: _ A M? ? -> H A M Z A.

    Letters: H, Z? Available? And A fixed? 
    So HAMZA is possible? Word: Hamza is a name? Valid? 

  Similarly, BAFFY? But F repeated? And Y absent? No? 

  GAWKY? Not? 

Case 3: M at position 4: pattern: ? A ? M? 

  Words: MAGMA? But M at 4? And at 1? 

  Or separately: for example, FAHMA? F, A, H, M, A? 
    FAHMA: is that a word? Not? 

  WAHAB? W, A, H, A, B? Position 5: B? 
    W A H A B -> no M? But we need M? 

  Or JARMA? J, A, R, M, A? R absent? Not? 

Now, considering MAGMA and HAMZA and others? But we are limited.

Also, with the available letters, we have FAWMA? But not word? 

We must search for valid words.

Option 1: MAGMA
Option 2: HAMZA 

HAMZA: 
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: A

But two A's? Possible? If the secret word is HAMZA, then in guess1: crane guessed A at position 3? But in secret, A in positions 2 and 5? So A at guess1 position 3: should be absent? Or present? It was '-' meaning present? But in secret, A at 3? No? Secret has A only at 2 and 5? So position 3? Crane? Position 3 was A? Secret no A at position 3? So '-' because A is present elsewhere? Correct? 

Also, in guess3: vapid guessed A at 2? Correct? And others: V,P,I,D absent? Correct.

And guess4: oakumn? O,A,K,U,M at 5? Secret: H A M Z A? Then 
- O: absent -> O(x) correct
- A: position 2: ✓ correct
- K: not in secret? K(x) correct
- U: not? U(x) correct
- M: guessed at position 5? Secret: M at position 4? So M not at 5? And present? So M(-) meaning present but not 5? Correct? 

So HAMZA is also possible.

But we have to choose a guess? We need to test.

Another word: MAGIC? But I absent? And C absent? Not? 

JAMB? Only 4? No.

So basically two real options: MAGMA or HAMZA.

But let's see which one matches available letters? Both use letters not absent? For MAGMA: M, G? Available? HAMZA: H, Z? Available.

We can try to use a word that disambiguates this? But we have to guess the word? 

Or we can guess MAGMA to test? Because if MAGMA is the word? Then we get it? Or if not, we eliminate? Or HAMZA.

But we have limited guesses: we are at guess 5? So we have two tries? But we must choose.

Because M is not at position 5? And we don't know where? So we need to test M in other positions? Or we can test letters.

But how? We can guess a word that has M in a different position? But we don't know where? And also we need to include available letters.

We can choose MAGMA because it's more common? But HAMZA is a name? Actually MAGMA is a geology term? More common? So let's guess MAGMA? 

But note: MAGMA uses G? Which we haven't tested? Similarly, HAMZA uses Z? Both untested? And if we guess MAGMA and it's wrong? Then G might be eliminated? Which helps.

But let's decide.

Because M is present? And not at 5? And must be at 1,3,4.

If we want to cover multiple positions? We can try MAXX? Not 5.

But guess: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not.

So here is an idea: guess a word that has M at position 1? For example: MAFIA? But F? And I? I is absent? No? 

So not.

Another guess: MAWHM? Not word.

So it's hard? So I think MAGMA is a valid possibility? So we guess MAGMA.

But also, is there a word like WAFFM? Not? 

So we go with MAGMA.

Or to test more letters? How about a word that uses F, G, H, etc? 

For example, if we guess FAWGH? Not valid? 

Another valid word: WHAM! only 4 letters? Or WHAMM: 5? WHAMM: W H A M M? 
Position 1: W
Position 2: H? No? Position 2 is A? So must have A at 2? WHAMM is W H A M M? Positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:A? But we need position 2: A? So no? Pattern is ?A??? so position 2 A? WHAMM has A at position 3? So not.

So we are stuck? So choose MAGMA.

So guess: MAGMA.

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(not in word), R(not), A(in word but wrong position), N(not), E(not).  
- **Guess 2: salty** → S(not), A(correct position), L(not), T(not), Y(not).  
  - Confirms A is at position 2 (secret pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).  
- **Guess 3: vapid** → V(not), A(correct), P(not), I(not), D(not).  
- **Guess 4: oakum** → O(not), A(correct), K(not), U(not), M(in word but wrong position).  
  - **Key insight**: M is present but not at position 5.  

### Inferred Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `? A ? ? ?`.  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - A (position 2).  
   - M (present, must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U (19 eliminated).  
4. **Remaining letters**: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z + M.  
5. M's position: Cannot be position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.  
6. Position 5 must be one of B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Goal**: Guess a valid 5-letter word fitting `? A ? ? ?` that includes M (in position 1, 3, or 4) and allows testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., G, H, W).  
- **Word selection**:  
  - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z (M is already required).  
  - Prioritize common words: ""magma"" was considered (M at position 1 and 4, A at 2 and 5) but is valid and tests G (untested).  
  - Alternate options (e.g., ""hamza"") were evaluated but discarded for obscurity; ""magma"" is more common (geology term).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle; if wrong, feedback eliminates G and checks M placement.  
- **Why ""magma"" fits**:  
  - Pattern: M A G M A → `M A _ _ _` with A at position 2.  
  - Uses M (required), G (untested), and avoids absent letters.  
  - Consistent with feeedback: In previous guesses, A received mixed feedback (position 3 wrong) but fits here at position 2 and 5.  

Chosen guess: **MAGMA**.  

<guess>magma</guess>",magma,"We have feedback from Guess 4: oakum -> FEEDBACK: O(x), A(✓), K(x), U(x), M(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- O(x): O is not in the secret word.
- A(✓): A is correct and in position 2 (as we knew).
- K(x): K is not in the secret word.
- U(x): U is not in the secret word.
- M(-): M is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and got '-', meaning wrong position).

Therefore, new information:
- M is in the word, but not at position 5.
- O, K, U are absent (add them to the eliminated list).

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Fixed: Position 2 is A -> ? A ? ? ?
2. Present letters: 
   - We know A (position 2) and M (somewhere, but not position 5).
   - From guess 1, A was present (now fixed) and no other present letters except M now?
   - We have only these two confirmed present letters? But wait, could there be more?

But note: in all guesses, only A and M have shown as present (A with a '-' in guess1 and check in guess2, M with '-' in guess4).

3. Absent letters: From all guesses: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (and M is present but position unknown).

Note: We have only 7 letters left: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z, and M is present.

So the secret word contains A (position 2) and M (not position 5), and two other letters from the available set? Actually, three other letters? Because word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: one of B, F, G, H, W, X, Z?
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: one of the available letters (B, F, G, H, W, X, Z) or M? But M might be here? Not at position 5? So could be in position 1, 3, or 4?
Position 4: similarly.
Position 5: one of the available letters, but not M? Since M is not in position 5.

The word must have exactly one M? Or could there be multiples? We don't know? But M was guessed once? So feedback was only for one M? So there might be one M.

Also, the word may have other letters? We have 4 positions to fill (1,3,4,5) with 7 available letters? But one of them must be M? So:

- The secret word has:
   Position 2: A
   One M in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).
   And three other letters from the set: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? But the total letters are 7 available? But we need only three letters (since one of the positions is M).

Actually, the word might have more than the letters we have? But the letters must be from the available set? Since we eliminated the rest.

Total available letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (7 letters) and M is present? But not counted? Or M is exactly one occurrence? So:

The word must contain: A, M, and three distinct other letters? Or not distinct? We don't know? But let's assume distinct for now? But we might have repeated letters? Possible.

But note: in the available set, we have only 7 letters? So we might get duplicated letters? But we don't know.

Now, we know M is in the word but not in position 5? So possibilities: M in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we have to find a word that:

- Has A in position 2.
- Has M in one of position 1, 3, or 4? But not 5.
- Uses letters only from the available set? And avoids all absent letters.

Available letters for positions: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? But M is already one letter? So the other letters must be chosen from B, F, G, H, W, X, Z.

But we need three more letters? So one position is M? And three others from the 7.

We also note that M cannot be in position 5? So:

Case:
- Position 1 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 3 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 4 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 5 must be from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}? But not M.

Also, since M is one letter? But it could be duplicated? But we don't know? However, we haven't encountered it before? So likely one M? But possible.

Now, let's try to think of words: pattern: [M or _] A [M or _] [M or _] [_ but not M]

Possible words:

If M in position 1: M A _ _ _

Possible words: MAFIA? But F? And A? Position 3? But MAFIA: M, A, F, I, A -> I is absent? Not allowed? And A duplicated? But A is fixed? I absent.

Not.

MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> but we have G? and M? But A present? But positions: 
Position 1: M? But M in position 1 and 4? Also, letter A we know? But the feedback: if MAGMA, but M at position 1 and 4? We got M absent? No: we got M present? And available? 
But MAGMA uses M? Position 1: M? But we guessed M at 5 and got it present but wrong position? So if M is at position 1? And 4? Then in guess 4, M was at position 5? So M is not at 5? Which matches? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So OK? However, I? No, MAGMA: M, A, G, M, A -> letters: M, A, G. But we haven't tested G? But in MAHUA? Not.

But MAGMA: 
Position 1: M
Position 2: A
Position 3: G
Position 4: M
Position 5: A

But A is repeated? We know A is in the word? But we have A only at position 2? Or could there be another A? We don't know? So possible? 

But let's see: the word MAGMA: 
If secret word is MAGMA, then:
- A at position 2: correct (we have A(✓) in guesses where we guessed A at 2? So A is fixed? But position 5: A? Still, position 2 is A? 
However, our feedback in guess4: for oakum we had M? At position 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So if secret MAGMA, then M not at 5? So our guess oakum M at 5 would be absent? But we got M(-) meaning present but not at 5? So consistent? 

But wait: in guess4, oakum: O A K U M -> 
If secret MAGMA, then:
- O: not in MAGMA -> O(x) correct
- A: position 2: A(✓) correct
- K: not in MAGMA -> K(x) correct
- U: not in MAGMA -> U(x) correct
- M: guess at position 5? But real M is at positions 1 and 4? So M is in the wrong position? Thus M(-) correct? 

So MAGMA is a candidate? But the letters: M, A, G? and A again? But we haven't tested G? And M? So MAGMA is possible? 

But problem: MAGMA has two M's and two A's? We don't know? So it's allowed? Yes.

But MAGMA uses G? Which is available? So valid? Because absent letters: not eliminated? G is available? Yes.

Also M? Already in word? And A? Fixed.

Now, another possibility: if M in position 3: _ A M ? ?

Then words: could be HAMMY? But H, M, Y? But Y is absent? Not allowed.

Or BAMMY? Y absent? Not.

Or JAMMY? J? Have we tested? J not? But J is not in eliminated letters? But our available set includes B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? We don't have J? Why? Because from the feedback, we eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U. So J is not eliminated? We haven't tested J? 

Wait: the eliminated letters are those that were marked absent? Any letter not tested? So available letters should include all not marked absent plus the present ones? But we only have:

Available now: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? And J? And Q? So we forgot? 

Eliminated letters: 
- From guess 1: C, R, N, E
- From guess 2: S, L, T, Y
- From guess 3: V, P, I, D
- From guess 4: O, K, U

So absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,L,T,Y,V,P,I,D,O,K,U. -> total 15.

Alphabet: 26 letters? So remaining: A, B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But A is known? So letters not absent: A, M (which are the ones we know are present? Or might be?) Actually, M we know present? Any other? Only A and M.

So letters we can use: all letters not absent? So: A (fixed), M (present), and: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z. 

So 9 letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We also include J and Q and possibly others? We never guessed them? So they are available? We have:

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? And M? And A? But A is fixed? We don't need to guess A? So for the three other positions, we can choose from B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But M must appear exactly once? And we have to put it in position 1, 3, or 4.

Position 5: cannot be M? So must be one from: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Now, back to pattern:

If M in position 1: M A _ _ _

Then we need: position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ? (from set excluding M? But M in 1? Then others from available? Including M? But M already used? Or word might have multiple M? Possible? So we cannot rule out? But we don't know.

Similarly, if M not position 1? Then position 1 from available without M? But we don't know? So we have to allow duplicate? So many possible? 

But in practice, we need to think of a word.

Possible words:

- MAGMA: M A G M A -> 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: M
  Position 5: A -> uses G? And M repeated? And A repeated? 
  However, if we choose this, we get:
    Position 5: A? But we have position 2: A? So two A's? 
  But in feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane had A at 3? So if MAGMA has A at 2 and 5? Then at guess1, A at 3? Which we got '-' meaning present but not 3? Correct? 
    And guess2? Had A at 2? Correct? 
  Also, guess4: M at 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? Not 5? So M( - ) for position 5? Correct? 
  And letters: G is available? J, Q not used? 
  So MAGMA is possible.

- Another word: M? With no duplicate? For example, MAWGH? Not a word? 

- Or HAWKM? But K eliminated? Not? 

Since M must be in position 1,3,or4? 

Let me list possible positions for M:

Case 1: M at position 1: words: 
  MABIG? Not word? 
  MAGUS? U? Not available? 

Case 2: M at position 3: words: 
  We have pattern: ? A M ? ?
  Position 1: must be from available? B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? 
  Position 4: similarly? 
  Position 5: similarly? 

  Words: 
    JAMBU? J, A, M, B, U? But U eliminated? Not?
    HAMZA? H, A, M, Z, A -> repeated A? And Z? And H? 
    Position 5: A? So if HAMZA: _ A M? ? -> H A M Z A.

    Letters: H, Z? Available? And A fixed? 
    So HAMZA is possible? Word: Hamza is a name? Valid? 

  Similarly, BAFFY? But F repeated? And Y absent? No? 

  GAWKY? Not? 

Case 3: M at position 4: pattern: ? A ? M? 

  Words: MAGMA? But M at 4? And at 1? 

  Or separately: for example, FAHMA? F, A, H, M, A? 
    FAHMA: is that a word? Not? 

  WAHAB? W, A, H, A, B? Position 5: B? 
    W A H A B -> no M? But we need M? 

  Or JARMA? J, A, R, M, A? R absent? Not? 

Now, considering MAGMA and HAMZA and others? But we are limited.

Also, with the available letters, we have FAWMA? But not word? 

We must search for valid words.

Option 1: MAGMA
Option 2: HAMZA 

HAMZA: 
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: A

But two A's? Possible? If the secret word is HAMZA, then in guess1: crane guessed A at position 3? But in secret, A in positions 2 and 5? So A at guess1 position 3: should be absent? Or present? It was '-' meaning present? But in secret, A at 3? No? Secret has A only at 2 and 5? So position 3? Crane? Position 3 was A? Secret no A at position 3? So '-' because A is present elsewhere? Correct? 

Also, in guess3: vapid guessed A at 2? Correct? And others: V,P,I,D absent? Correct.

And guess4: oakumn? O,A,K,U,M at 5? Secret: H A M Z A? Then 
- O: absent -> O(x) correct
- A: position 2: ✓ correct
- K: not in secret? K(x) correct
- U: not? U(x) correct
- M: guessed at position 5? Secret: M at position 4? So M not at 5? And present? So M(-) meaning present but not 5? Correct? 

So HAMZA is also possible.

But we have to choose a guess? We need to test.

Another word: MAGIC? But I absent? And C absent? Not? 

JAMB? Only 4? No.

So basically two real options: MAGMA or HAMZA.

But let's see which one matches available letters? Both use letters not absent? For MAGMA: M, G? Available? HAMZA: H, Z? Available.

We can try to use a word that disambiguates this? But we have to guess the word? 

Or we can guess MAGMA to test? Because if MAGMA is the word? Then we get it? Or if not, we eliminate? Or HAMZA.

But we have limited guesses: we are at guess 5? So we have two tries? But we must choose.

Because M is not at position 5? And we don't know where? So we need to test M in other positions? Or we can test letters.

But how? We can guess a word that has M in a different position? But we don't know where? And also we need to include available letters.

We can choose MAGMA because it's more common? But HAMZA is a name? Actually MAGMA is a geology term? More common? So let's guess MAGMA? 

But note: MAGMA uses G? Which we haven't tested? Similarly, HAMZA uses Z? Both untested? And if we guess MAGMA and it's wrong? Then G might be eliminated? Which helps.

But let's decide.

Because M is present? And not at 5? And must be at 1,3,4.

If we want to cover multiple positions? We can try MAXX? Not 5.

But guess: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not.

So here is an idea: guess a word that has M at position 1? For example: MAFIA? But F? And I? I is absent? No? 

So not.

Another guess: MAWHM? Not word.

So it's hard? So I think MAGMA is a valid possibility? So we guess MAGMA.

But also, is there a word like WAFFM? Not? 

So we go with MAGMA.

Or to test more letters? How about a word that uses F, G, H, etc? 

For example, if we guess FAWGH? Not valid? 

Another valid word: WHAM! only 4 letters? Or WHAMM: 5? WHAMM: W H A M M? 
Position 1: W
Position 2: H? No? Position 2 is A? So must have A at 2? WHAMM is W H A M M? Positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:A? But we need position 2: A? So no? Pattern is ?A??? so position 2 A? WHAMM has A at position 3? So not.

So we are stuck? So choose MAGMA.

So guess: MAGMA.

<guess>magma</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(not in word), R(not), A(in word but wrong position), N(not), E(not).  
- **Guess 2: salty** → S(not), A(correct position), L(not), T(not), Y(not).  
  - Confirms A is at position 2 (secret pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).  
- **Guess 3: vapid** → V(not), A(correct), P(not), I(not), D(not).  
- **Guess 4: oakum** → O(not), A(correct), K(not), U(not), M(in word but wrong position).  
  - **Key insight**: M is present but not at position 5.  

### Inferred Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `? A ? ? ?`.  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - A (position 2).  
   - M (present, must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U (19 eliminated).  
4. **Remaining letters**: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z + M.  
5. M's position: Cannot be position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.  
6. Position 5 must be one of B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Goal**: Guess a valid 5-letter word fitting `? A ? ? ?` that includes M (in position 1, 3, or 4) and allows testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., G, H, W).  
- **Word selection**:  
  - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z (M is already required).  
  - Prioritize common words: ""magma"" was considered (M at position 1 and 4, A at 2 and 5) but is valid and tests G (untested).  
  - Alternate options (e.g., ""hamza"") were evaluated but discarded for obscurity; ""magma"" is more common (geology term).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle; if wrong, feedback eliminates G and checks M placement.  
- **Why ""magma"" fits**:  
  - Pattern: M A G M A → `M A _ _ _` with A at position 2.  
  - Uses M (required), G (untested), and avoids absent letters.  
  - Consistent with feeedback: In previous guesses, A received mixed feedback (position 3 wrong) but fits here at position 2 and 5.  

Chosen guess: **MAGMA**.",Guess 5: magma -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) G(x) M(✓) A(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters (C, R, A, N, E).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - A is in the secret word but not in the position it was guessed (so not the third position).
   - C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3 (since the guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning wrong position).

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent, so we should avoid using them in the next guess.

 For the next guess, we want to try to include A (but in a different position) and test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 We also want to avoid repeating the absent letters (C, R, N, E).

 Common consonants and vowels to consider: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A (but not in the third position) and use other common letters.

 Since A was in position 3 and now we know it's not there, let's try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possible positions for A:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Position 2: _ A _ _ _
   Position 4: _ _ _ A _
   Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

 We also note that we have not tested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses as many of these unused common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has A in a new position and includes S and T.

 Example words:
   If A is in position 1: ALERT, ABLED, etc. But avoid R (already absent) and E (absent) -> so ALERT is bad because of E and R.

   Let's find words without C, R, N, E.

   Words with A in position 1: 
        SALAD? -> but L and D are new, but S is common. However, we can use also T.
        We want distinct letters to maximize information.

   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn't use E. So we must avoid E.

   Let's try A in position 2: 
        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.

   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don't know if A appears multiple times.

   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.

   Let's consider: 

   Option: Place A in position 4: 
        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A's. And Z is uncommon.

   Option: Place A in position 5: 
        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A's.

   Alternatively, let's try A in position 2.

   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S's. But S is common and we haven't tried S.

   Actually, without E and R, here's a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.

   SALTY: 
        S: not tested
        A: we know is present (but we'll put it in position 2, not 3)
        L, T, Y: not tested

   This covers several new common letters.

   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

   We must avoid N because it's absent.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.

   SALTY: 
      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? 
        C: absent -> not here
        R: absent -> not here
        N: absent -> not here
        E: absent -> not here

   So SALTY is acceptable.

   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don't care if it helps test P? Also, we don't know about P.

   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

   Why SALTY?
      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).
      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.

   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don't know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? 
   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it's present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. 
   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.

   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? 
   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a '-' again? But we already know it's not there? 
   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we'll get a '-'? 
   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.

   Therefore, let's pick SALTY: A in position 2.

   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? 
   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven't tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.

   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.

   So I think SALTY is a good choice.

   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.

   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a '-' meaning A is present but not in that position.

   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it's wrong. We don't gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? 
   Actually, we might if there are two A's? But we don't know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.

   Therefore, I choose SALTY.

   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.

   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.

   This tests:
        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?
        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?
        L at position 3: new letter
        T at position 4: new letter
        Y at position 5: new letter

   And we avoid the known absent letters.

   So let's go with SALTY.

   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it's not in the word.

   So we avoid STAIR.

   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F's and we can test F? But we don't know. However, it has F repeated? 
   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? 

   So SALTY seems better.

   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.

   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.

   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. 

   Therefore, SALTY is better.

   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.

   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.

   So I will guess: SALTY

   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:
- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.
- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y. All letters are untested and avoid the known absent ones.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got '-')
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since in ""salty"", A was in position 2 and we got a checkmark).
- S, L, T, Y are not in the word.

So now we know:
- A is in the secret word and is in position 2. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y. So we can't use those.
- The secret word has 5 letters, one of which is A in the second position.

We now know the second letter is A. Therefore the word structure is: _ A _ _ _

We need to think about what letters are left. We haven't tested many vowels: only A and E (which is absent). So vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but Y is already eliminated). Since Y is eliminated, we focus on I, O, U.

Also, consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: Q, Z, X are less common.

We need to form a word of the form _ A _ _ _

We know the word must contain A in position 2 and must not include C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Now, since in the first guess, we had A in the word (but wrong position) and now we found it in position 2, that suggests that the A might have been moved from its correct position? Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it's in position 2.

We have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

What we can try:
We can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words: 
- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That's not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.

- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.

- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.

- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.

- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.

- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.

- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.

Consider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.

For example:
- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can't use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.

- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _

- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.

Another idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.

Actually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.

Let me think of common words: 
- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.
- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.

We can use:
- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A's? We don't know yet. But N is out so invalid.

- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.

Since vowels are limited, let's try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.

Or GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.

So we need words that don't contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have A fixed at position 2.

List of possible words (from common English words):
- PADAU? Not common.
- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.
- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.
- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn't reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.

How about:
- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.

Another: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.

HABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.

But T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven't tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.

Similarly, Y absent, L absent.

So what words exist? Let me think:

Valid words with pattern _A_ _ _:

- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.
- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don't know.

- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.

Wait, we need to avoid S.

How about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.

I am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.

We must have A in second.

Another: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Perhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _

WORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.

But MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to test new letters? We haven't tried M and G.

However, we know A is already correct in position 2.

But MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don't know about multiple A's? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it's the same A? Or could there be two?

Actually, if there were two A's, the first guess would have shown A as '-' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn't rule out another A elsewhere.

But we don't know.

Similarly, MAGMA: 
- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.

But MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let's be more common.

Another idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.

We are struggling because common letters are eliminated.

Let me try different vowels: Using O.

For example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.

GAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.

But try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.

Another: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.

We need to include I or O or U and new consonants.

Possible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.

No.

Another: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.

We need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.

List of English words with A at position 2:

Common ones: 
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.
- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.
- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.
- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.

So we avoid R.

Let me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.

BAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.

Perhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.

PAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.

I am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it's proper.

HADJI: that's an Arabic term? Valid.

But letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? 
- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.

So HADJI is a word? I think it's acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.

Another common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.

""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.

We haven't used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.

How about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.

GAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.

We have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.

Another idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.

PAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.

It's difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. 

But BADAM is not standard.

Perhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.

GADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.

GADID: letters:
- G: not tested
- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don't have to reuse A? Or not?

Actually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.

But GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

Feedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.

But the word might not have two D's? We'll see.

But is GADID common? Unusual.

Another word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.

We need words without E.

Perhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.

Word: FAUGH

Which is an exclamation, meaning off.

But acceptable? Let's see.

Otherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.

Padma = lotus? But valid.

Now, from the available letters, we can choose among these.

Since we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven't tested: I, O, U.

Let's prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.

Choose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.

Possible words:
- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.
- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.
- ""FAPPS"" no.
- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.

Another: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.

""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.

""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.

""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.

PAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.

But 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.

Position 2 is A.

Letters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: 
- P: not used before
- G: not used
- O: not used
- D: not used

And they are all available.

So PAGOD is acceptable.

Another possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.

Or ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.

Yes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

That covers V, P, I, D.

But PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.

But VAPID has I? Vowel I.

But both appear valid.

Since we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.

But P is common.

Another word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.

We can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.

The secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.

We haven't tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.

VAPID: V, P, I, D.

Note that both include P and D? Not a problem.

But VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.

The word is _A_ _ _

We have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.

In PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.

Both untested.

For commonality, I think both words are valid.

Let's choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.

Another common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.

So not.

""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.

""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.

Perhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.

We are limited.

So I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.

Let me choose VAPID? Because at least it's more common English word.

VAPID is a bit negative, but valid.

Or ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.

So VAPID seems reasonable.

Another option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.

So we go with VAPID.

We risk but it's one of the few words.

Perhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.

Yes, so guess: VAPID.

But VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> 
- We haven't tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.

And A in position 2 which is correct.

So we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.

If not in the word, that will eliminate them.

So let's go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  
  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).
- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  
3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  
4. **Word selection criteria**:  
   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  
   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  
   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  
5. **Brainstorm options**:  
   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  
   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  
6. **Optimization**:  
   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  
     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  
     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  
     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  
   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  
7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.

Chosen guess: **vapid**.

<guess>vapid</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: vapid -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Meaning: A is correct and at position 2. S, L, T, Y are absent.

Guess 3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
Meaning: A is again correct (position 2). V, P, I, D are absent.

Summary:
- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _
- Letters absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D
- Therefore, the remaining possible letters are: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z
- The word must not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Let's list the available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z

Considering the pattern: ?A??? 

Possible words:
- Using common letters: We haven't tested B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, etc.

Options:
- BAUKS? (a weight) Not common.
- FAUGH? But F and U and G used? But FAUGH has F, A, U, G, H -> all available? But FAUGH was considered earlier? However, in guess 3, we didn't test F? F is available.

FAUGH: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: U (vowel)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: H

But FAUGH is interjection meaning 'begone'. Valid.

- KAGU? Only 4 letters? Not 5.

- GAWKY? G, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? From guess 2 Y is absent? So no.

- HAUGH? H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? HAUCH/Haugh is a word meaning river meadow? But spelled HAUGH? Yes, 5 letters: HAUGH.

Letters: H, A, U, G, H -> so H is repeated? But we haven't tested H? It's available.

But HAUGH is a valid word.

- MAUGH? Not common.

- WAUGH? Not common.

Another option: BAGHS? B, A, G, H, S -> S is absent? Not allowed.

- GAUMS? G, A, U, M, S -> S absent? No.

We avoid S? S is absent.

Possible words: BAFFY? But Y is absent? No.

Or GAUMY? G, A, U, M, Y -> Y absent? No.

We notice that Y is absent so we must not use Y.

Now, let's look for words without the eliminated letters and with available vowels Vowels available: O, U? We have I absent? I was tested in VAPID and absent? Yes? So A is the only vowel confirmed? But no: A is fixed? We may need other vowels.

Vowels: O, U available? I is absent? So U is a possibility? And O.

But in English, words with A in position 2 and using U or O.

Another word: ""FAZED"" -> Z, E, D? E and D absent? Not.

Alternative: ""MAWMY"" -> M, A, W, M, Y -> Y absent? No.

But we have few options: FAUGH or HAUGH? 

FAUGH: F, A, U, G, H -> letters not eliminated? So it is valid.

HAUGH: H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? But acceptable? Yes.

Also, WAUGH: W, A, U, G, H -> same.

But WAUGH is a surname? Valid.

Also GAUFF? Not common.

Another possibility: BAFFS is invalid due to S? Not.

Thus, we can choose among FAUGH, HAUGH, WAUGH? Or GAUCH? G, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.

GAUCH is not a word? Gauch is not standard.

Let me confirm commonality? But Wordle accepts less common words? Maybe.

But FAUGH and HAUGH are listed in Scrabble dictionaries.

But notice: the feedback must use valid English words? So I think we can choose FAUGH? But WAUGH might be better? Or HAUGH.

Another word: ""BAHU"" only 4 letters? No.

Or ""KABAB"" but K, A, B, A, B -> repeated A and B? But positions:1:K,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:B? Actually KABAB might be accepted? But KABAB is spelt with variations? But valid? Kabob would be with O? So not.

We should focus on FAUGH? Or perhaps ""MAUMA"" M, A, U, M, A? Repeated M? But MAUMA meaning mom? Valid informal? Might not be accepted.

But let's be safe: HAUGH is a word? Yes? For example, ""haugh"" is a Scottish term for low-lying meadow.

Similarly, FAUGH is an exclamation.

WAUGH might be less common.

We also haven't tested B and M? B and M are available.

So another option: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not allowed.

Or ""MAHUA"" M, A, H, U, A -> repeated A? MAHUA is a tree? Valid? 5 letters.

Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:H, 4:U, 5:A? But pattern is ?A??? so position 2 is A? Correct? But positions 1 and 5 will be tested.

MAHUA: M, A, H, U, A -> all letters available? M, H, U, A? But A is repeated? We don't know if the word has two A's? Possible? But letters M, H, U, A? H is present? But we haven't tested H.

However, MAHUA has two A's.

Similarly, BAUKS? B, A, U, K, S -> S is absent? No.

GAWK not 5.

Let me choose HAUGH: 
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: H

So letters: H, U, G? But H repeated? We are testing H and U and G.

This covers: H at positions 1 and 5? U at position 3? G at position 4.

If HAUGH is the answer, we will get feedback accordingly.

But if not, we eliminate H, U, G? Or any of them.

Another word: FAUNA -> F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? Not allowed? Since N is eliminated? So FAUNA is invalid because of N.

Similarly not.

Therefore, I think HAUGH is a reasonable guess? Or FAUGH.

How about BAUCH? B, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.

So after all, let's pick HAUGH? But WAUGH is also valid? Let's use WAUGH to combine W? But W is untested.

But HAUGH is simpler.

Perhaps ""OAKUM"" -> but O, A, K, U, M? Position 1: O? Position 2: A? Yes? But OAKUM: O, A, K, U, M? 
- O: not tested? 
- A: position 2 correct? 
- K: not tested?
- U: not tested?
- M: not tested?

And it doesn't contain any eliminated letter? Letters: O, K, U, M? And A.

But OAKUM is a word? Yes, oakum. Used in ship building? Valid.

Therefore, OAKUM:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: M

And letters: O, K, U, M are all new? And available: not in eliminated list.

Compared to HAUGH which has repeated H? OAKUM doesn't have repeats? And covers more varied letters? So OAKUM is better.

OAKUM: 
- O: vowel
- K: consonant
- U: vowel
- M: consonant

All distinct? So we test all four with one guess.

So preferred over HAUGH? Yes.

Therefore, we guess OAKUM.

But OAKUM has O? Position 1? And M? Position 5.

If not, we eliminate O, K, U, M.

So let's go with OAKUM.From the accumulated feedback:

- **Absent letters (confirmed not in secret word)**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D  
- **Present and fixed**: A at position 2  
- **Remaining letters available** (not previously guessed or eliminated): B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z  
- **Pattern constraint**: Secret word is `? A ? ? ?`  

### Objective:
Guess a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 2, using only remaining letters.  

### Evaluation:
- Prioritize common words first to avoid obscurity.  
- Maximize information gain with distinct new letters.  
- Eliminated words:  
  - Excluded if containing absent letters (e.g., ""baggy"" invalid due to Y).  
  - Excluded if not matching pattern (e.g., ""audio"" lacks A at position 2).  

### Selected Guess: ""oakum""
Rationale:  
- **Letters tested**: O (position 1), A (fixed/position 2), K (position 3), U (position 4), M (position 5).  
- **Validity**: ""Oakum"" is a recognized English word (material used in shipbuilding), accepted by Wordle dictionaries.  
- **Coverage**: Tests 4 new letters (O, K, U, M), all from remaining set.  
- **Distinctness**: No repeated letters, maximizing potential feedback.  

<guess>oakum</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  
- **Guess 3: vapid** → Feedback: V(x), A(✓), P(x), I(x), D(x)  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Fixed letter**: A is confirmed correct and in position 2 (secret word pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D (17 eliminated, leaving 9 possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z).
3. **Goal for next guess**: Use a word that:
   - Includes A in position 2.
   - Uses only the remaining letters.
   - Tests new common letters to gather information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

### Selected Guess:
""**OAKUM**"" is chosen because:
- **Pattern**: Fits `? A ? ? ?` (position 2: A).
- **Letters tested**: 
  - O (position 1: untested vowel).
  - K (position 3: untested consonant).
  - U (position 4: untested vowel).
  - M (position 5: untested consonant).
- **Validity**: Recognized English word (meaning fiber used in shipbuilding).  
- **Information gain**: Tests 4 distinct new letters (not repeated), maximizing feedback for remaining possibilities.  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""haugh"" or ""fauch"" were discarded due to obscurity or duplicate letters.

<guess>oakum</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: vapid -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
Guess 4: oakum -> FEEDBACK: O(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) M(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 4: oakum -> FEEDBACK: O(x), A(✓), K(x), U(x), M(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- O(x): O is not in the secret word.
- A(✓): A is correct and in position 2 (as we knew).
- K(x): K is not in the secret word.
- U(x): U is not in the secret word.
- M(-): M is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and got '-', meaning wrong position).

Therefore, new information:
- M is in the word, but not at position 5.
- O, K, U are absent (add them to the eliminated list).

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Fixed: Position 2 is A -> ? A ? ? ?
2. Present letters: 
   - We know A (position 2) and M (somewhere, but not position 5).
   - From guess 1, A was present (now fixed) and no other present letters except M now?
   - We have only these two confirmed present letters? But wait, could there be more?

But note: in all guesses, only A and M have shown as present (A with a '-' in guess1 and check in guess2, M with '-' in guess4).

3. Absent letters: From all guesses: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (and M is present but position unknown).

Note: We have only 7 letters left: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z, and M is present.

So the secret word contains A (position 2) and M (not position 5), and two other letters from the available set? Actually, three other letters? Because word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: one of B, F, G, H, W, X, Z?
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: one of the available letters (B, F, G, H, W, X, Z) or M? But M might be here? Not at position 5? So could be in position 1, 3, or 4?
Position 4: similarly.
Position 5: one of the available letters, but not M? Since M is not in position 5.

The word must have exactly one M? Or could there be multiples? We don't know? But M was guessed once? So feedback was only for one M? So there might be one M.

Also, the word may have other letters? We have 4 positions to fill (1,3,4,5) with 7 available letters? But one of them must be M? So:

- The secret word has:
   Position 2: A
   One M in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).
   And three other letters from the set: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? But the total letters are 7 available? But we need only three letters (since one of the positions is M).

Actually, the word might have more than the letters we have? But the letters must be from the available set? Since we eliminated the rest.

Total available letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (7 letters) and M is present? But not counted? Or M is exactly one occurrence? So:

The word must contain: A, M, and three distinct other letters? Or not distinct? We don't know? But let's assume distinct for now? But we might have repeated letters? Possible.

But note: in the available set, we have only 7 letters? So we might get duplicated letters? But we don't know.

Now, we know M is in the word but not in position 5? So possibilities: M in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we have to find a word that:

- Has A in position 2.
- Has M in one of position 1, 3, or 4? But not 5.
- Uses letters only from the available set? And avoids all absent letters.

Available letters for positions: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? But M is already one letter? So the other letters must be chosen from B, F, G, H, W, X, Z.

But we need three more letters? So one position is M? And three others from the 7.

We also note that M cannot be in position 5? So:

Case:
- Position 1 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 3 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 4 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}
- Position 5 must be from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}? But not M.

Also, since M is one letter? But it could be duplicated? But we don't know? However, we haven't encountered it before? So likely one M? But possible.

Now, let's try to think of words: pattern: [M or _] A [M or _] [M or _] [_ but not M]

Possible words:

If M in position 1: M A _ _ _

Possible words: MAFIA? But F? And A? Position 3? But MAFIA: M, A, F, I, A -> I is absent? Not allowed? And A duplicated? But A is fixed? I absent.

Not.

MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> but we have G? and M? But A present? But positions: 
Position 1: M? But M in position 1 and 4? Also, letter A we know? But the feedback: if MAGMA, but M at position 1 and 4? We got M absent? No: we got M present? And available? 
But MAGMA uses M? Position 1: M? But we guessed M at 5 and got it present but wrong position? So if M is at position 1? And 4? Then in guess 4, M was at position 5? So M is not at 5? Which matches? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So OK? However, I? No, MAGMA: M, A, G, M, A -> letters: M, A, G. But we haven't tested G? But in MAHUA? Not.

But MAGMA: 
Position 1: M
Position 2: A
Position 3: G
Position 4: M
Position 5: A

But A is repeated? We know A is in the word? But we have A only at position 2? Or could there be another A? We don't know? So possible? 

But let's see: the word MAGMA: 
If secret word is MAGMA, then:
- A at position 2: correct (we have A(✓) in guesses where we guessed A at 2? So A is fixed? But position 5: A? Still, position 2 is A? 
However, our feedback in guess4: for oakum we had M? At position 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So if secret MAGMA, then M not at 5? So our guess oakum M at 5 would be absent? But we got M(-) meaning present but not at 5? So consistent? 

But wait: in guess4, oakum: O A K U M -> 
If secret MAGMA, then:
- O: not in MAGMA -> O(x) correct
- A: position 2: A(✓) correct
- K: not in MAGMA -> K(x) correct
- U: not in MAGMA -> U(x) correct
- M: guess at position 5? But real M is at positions 1 and 4? So M is in the wrong position? Thus M(-) correct? 

So MAGMA is a candidate? But the letters: M, A, G? and A again? But we haven't tested G? And M? So MAGMA is possible? 

But problem: MAGMA has two M's and two A's? We don't know? So it's allowed? Yes.

But MAGMA uses G? Which is available? So valid? Because absent letters: not eliminated? G is available? Yes.

Also M? Already in word? And A? Fixed.

Now, another possibility: if M in position 3: _ A M ? ?

Then words: could be HAMMY? But H, M, Y? But Y is absent? Not allowed.

Or BAMMY? Y absent? Not.

Or JAMMY? J? Have we tested? J not? But J is not in eliminated letters? But our available set includes B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? We don't have J? Why? Because from the feedback, we eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U. So J is not eliminated? We haven't tested J? 

Wait: the eliminated letters are those that were marked absent? Any letter not tested? So available letters should include all not marked absent plus the present ones? But we only have:

Available now: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? And J? And Q? So we forgot? 

Eliminated letters: 
- From guess 1: C, R, N, E
- From guess 2: S, L, T, Y
- From guess 3: V, P, I, D
- From guess 4: O, K, U

So absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,L,T,Y,V,P,I,D,O,K,U. -> total 15.

Alphabet: 26 letters? So remaining: A, B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But A is known? So letters not absent: A, M (which are the ones we know are present? Or might be?) Actually, M we know present? Any other? Only A and M.

So letters we can use: all letters not absent? So: A (fixed), M (present), and: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z. 

So 9 letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We also include J and Q and possibly others? We never guessed them? So they are available? We have:

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? And M? And A? But A is fixed? We don't need to guess A? So for the three other positions, we can choose from B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But M must appear exactly once? And we have to put it in position 1, 3, or 4.

Position 5: cannot be M? So must be one from: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Now, back to pattern:

If M in position 1: M A _ _ _

Then we need: position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ? (from set excluding M? But M in 1? Then others from available? Including M? But M already used? Or word might have multiple M? Possible? So we cannot rule out? But we don't know.

Similarly, if M not position 1? Then position 1 from available without M? But we don't know? So we have to allow duplicate? So many possible? 

But in practice, we need to think of a word.

Possible words:

- MAGMA: M A G M A -> 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: M
  Position 5: A -> uses G? And M repeated? And A repeated? 
  However, if we choose this, we get:
    Position 5: A? But we have position 2: A? So two A's? 
  But in feedback: 
    Guess 1: crane had A at 3? So if MAGMA has A at 2 and 5? Then at guess1, A at 3? Which we got '-' meaning present but not 3? Correct? 
    And guess2? Had A at 2? Correct? 
  Also, guess4: M at 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? Not 5? So M( - ) for position 5? Correct? 
  And letters: G is available? J, Q not used? 
  So MAGMA is possible.

- Another word: M? With no duplicate? For example, MAWGH? Not a word? 

- Or HAWKM? But K eliminated? Not? 

Since M must be in position 1,3,or4? 

Let me list possible positions for M:

Case 1: M at position 1: words: 
  MABIG? Not word? 
  MAGUS? U? Not available? 

Case 2: M at position 3: words: 
  We have pattern: ? A M ? ?
  Position 1: must be from available? B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? 
  Position 4: similarly? 
  Position 5: similarly? 

  Words: 
    JAMBU? J, A, M, B, U? But U eliminated? Not?
    HAMZA? H, A, M, Z, A -> repeated A? And Z? And H? 
    Position 5: A? So if HAMZA: _ A M? ? -> H A M Z A.

    Letters: H, Z? Available? And A fixed? 
    So HAMZA is possible? Word: Hamza is a name? Valid? 

  Similarly, BAFFY? But F repeated? And Y absent? No? 

  GAWKY? Not? 

Case 3: M at position 4: pattern: ? A ? M? 

  Words: MAGMA? But M at 4? And at 1? 

  Or separately: for example, FAHMA? F, A, H, M, A? 
    FAHMA: is that a word? Not? 

  WAHAB? W, A, H, A, B? Position 5: B? 
    W A H A B -> no M? But we need M? 

  Or JARMA? J, A, R, M, A? R absent? Not? 

Now, considering MAGMA and HAMZA and others? But we are limited.

Also, with the available letters, we have FAWMA? But not word? 

We must search for valid words.

Option 1: MAGMA
Option 2: HAMZA 

HAMZA: 
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: A

But two A's? Possible? If the secret word is HAMZA, then in guess1: crane guessed A at position 3? But in secret, A in positions 2 and 5? So A at guess1 position 3: should be absent? Or present? It was '-' meaning present? But in secret, A at 3? No? Secret has A only at 2 and 5? So position 3? Crane? Position 3 was A? Secret no A at position 3? So '-' because A is present elsewhere? Correct? 

Also, in guess3: vapid guessed A at 2? Correct? And others: V,P,I,D absent? Correct.

And guess4: oakumn? O,A,K,U,M at 5? Secret: H A M Z A? Then 
- O: absent -> O(x) correct
- A: position 2: ✓ correct
- K: not in secret? K(x) correct
- U: not? U(x) correct
- M: guessed at position 5? Secret: M at position 4? So M not at 5? And present? So M(-) meaning present but not 5? Correct? 

So HAMZA is also possible.

But we have to choose a guess? We need to test.

Another word: MAGIC? But I absent? And C absent? Not? 

JAMB? Only 4? No.

So basically two real options: MAGMA or HAMZA.

But let's see which one matches available letters? Both use letters not absent? For MAGMA: M, G? Available? HAMZA: H, Z? Available.

We can try to use a word that disambiguates this? But we have to guess the word? 

Or we can guess MAGMA to test? Because if MAGMA is the word? Then we get it? Or if not, we eliminate? Or HAMZA.

But we have limited guesses: we are at guess 5? So we have two tries? But we must choose.

Because M is not at position 5? And we don't know where? So we need to test M in other positions? Or we can test letters.

But how? We can guess a word that has M in a different position? But we don't know where? And also we need to include available letters.

We can choose MAGMA because it's more common? But HAMZA is a name? Actually MAGMA is a geology term? More common? So let's guess MAGMA? 

But note: MAGMA uses G? Which we haven't tested? Similarly, HAMZA uses Z? Both untested? And if we guess MAGMA and it's wrong? Then G might be eliminated? Which helps.

But let's decide.

Because M is present? And not at 5? And must be at 1,3,4.

If we want to cover multiple positions? We can try MAXX? Not 5.

But guess: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not.

So here is an idea: guess a word that has M at position 1? For example: MAFIA? But F? And I? I is absent? No? 

So not.

Another guess: MAWHM? Not word.

So it's hard? So I think MAGMA is a valid possibility? So we guess MAGMA.

But also, is there a word like WAFFM? Not? 

So we go with MAGMA.

Or to test more letters? How about a word that uses F, G, H, etc? 

For example, if we guess FAWGH? Not valid? 

Another valid word: WHAM! only 4 letters? Or WHAMM: 5? WHAMM: W H A M M? 
Position 1: W
Position 2: H? No? Position 2 is A? So must have A at 2? WHAMM is W H A M M? Positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:A? But we need position 2: A? So no? Pattern is ?A??? so position 2 A? WHAMM has A at position 3? So not.

So we are stuck? So choose MAGMA.

So guess: MAGMA.

<guess>magma</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(not in word), R(not), A(in word but wrong position), N(not), E(not).  
- **Guess 2: salty** → S(not), A(correct position), L(not), T(not), Y(not).  
  - Confirms A is at position 2 (secret pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).  
- **Guess 3: vapid** → V(not), A(correct), P(not), I(not), D(not).  
- **Guess 4: oakum** → O(not), A(correct), K(not), U(not), M(in word but wrong position).  
  - **Key insight**: M is present but not at position 5.  

### Inferred Constraints:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `? A ? ? ?`.  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - A (position 2).  
   - M (present, must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U (19 eliminated).  
4. **Remaining letters**: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z + M.  
5. M's position: Cannot be position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.  
6. Position 5 must be one of B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Goal**: Guess a valid 5-letter word fitting `? A ? ? ?` that includes M (in position 1, 3, or 4) and allows testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., G, H, W).  
- **Word selection**:  
  - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z (M is already required).  
  - Prioritize common words: ""magma"" was considered (M at position 1 and 4, A at 2 and 5) but is valid and tests G (untested).  
  - Alternate options (e.g., ""hamza"") were evaluated but discarded for obscurity; ""magma"" is more common (geology term).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle; if wrong, feedback eliminates G and checks M placement.  
- **Why ""magma"" fits**:  
  - Pattern: M A G M A → `M A _ _ _` with A at position 2.  
  - Uses M (required), G (untested), and avoids absent letters.  
  - Consistent with feeedback: In previous guesses, A received mixed feedback (position 3 wrong) but fits here at position 2 and 5.  

Chosen guess: **MAGMA**.

However, we can use also T.\n        We want distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n   Another: SAUTE -> S, A, U, T, E -> but E is absent so we shouldn\'t use E. So we must avoid E.\n\n   Let\'s try A in position 2: \n        PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is repeated? Actually, the word has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, but we can try.\n\n   But note: the feedback only tells us about each instance. We don\'t know if A appears multiple times.\n\n   However, we should avoid repeating absent letters? Yes. So avoid E.\n\n   Let\'s consider: \n\n   Option: Place A in position 4: \n        Words: PLAZA? -> P, L, A, Z, A -> again two A\'s. And Z is uncommon.\n\n   Option: Place A in position 5: \n        Words: PIZZA? -> again Z and two A\'s.\n\n   Alternatively, let\'s try A in position 2.\n\n   Word: SALTS? -> S, A, L, T, S -> two S\'s. But S is common and we haven\'t tried S.\n\n   Actually, without E and R, here\'s a word: SALTY -> S, A, L, T, Y -> all new letters.\n\n   SALTY: \n        S: not tested\n        A: we know is present (but we\'ll put it in position 2, not 3)\n        L, T, Y: not tested\n\n   This covers several new common letters.\n\n   Another option is PAINT, but we avoided because of I and T? Actually PAINT is P, A, I, N, T -> but N is absent (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n   We must avoid N because it\'s absent.\n\n   Similarly, avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n   SALTY: \n      S, A, L, T, Y -> none of these are in the absent list? \n        C: absent -> not here\n        R: absent -> not here\n        N: absent -> not here\n        E: absent -> not here\n\n   So SALTY is acceptable.\n\n   Another word: SAPPY? -> S, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P? but we don\'t care if it helps test P? Also, we don\'t know about P.\n\n   But SALTY uses distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\n   Why SALTY?\n      - It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess position 3).\n      - It uses three common consonants: S, L, T, and a vowel if we count Y? Actually we have only one vowel A.\n\n   Another common word: PASTA -> P, A, S, T, A -> but A is twice. We don\'t know if A is repeated? But we can test A again? \n   Actually, in the first guess we had only one A and we know it\'s present. If we use PASTA, we are putting A in positions 2 and 5. \n   But we might get feedback on both. However, SALTY has unique letters so we get more information.\n\n   We could also consider: SHAFT -> S, H, A, F, T -> A in position 3? Wait, we want to move A from position 3? \n   Actually we know A is not in position 3? So if we put it in position 3 again, we expect a \'-\' again? But we already know it\'s not there? \n   So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n   SHAFT has A in position 3 -> same position as before? We know A is not in position 3, so if we put it there, we already know we\'ll get a \'-\'? \n   So that might be redundant. We want to test new positions.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s pick SALTY: A in position 2.\n\n   Another idea: We know that A is in the word somewhere. We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other vowels? \n   But vowels: we have A already, and we haven\'t tried O, I, U. Y can sometimes be a vowel.\n\n   But SALTY has A and Y (which can be a vowel). We also test S, L, T which are common.\n\n   So I think SALTY is a good choice.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S -> A in position 3? Again, we know A is not in position 3? So avoid position 3.\n\n   Let me confirm: the guess had A in position 3 (crane: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E) and got a \'-\' meaning A is present but not in that position.\n\n   So in the next guess, we should not put A in position 3 because we already know it\'s wrong. We don\'t gain new information by putting A in position 3 again? \n   Actually, we might if there are two A\'s? But we don\'t know. However, we have limited guesses so testing new positions is better.\n\n   Therefore, I choose SALTY.\n\n   However, note: the word SALTY has A in position 2.\n\n   Guess: SALTY -> S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n\n   This tests:\n        S at position 1: could be correct? or if not, maybe elsewhere?\n        A at position 2: we know A is in the word, but maybe here?\n        L at position 3: new letter\n        T at position 4: new letter\n        Y at position 5: new letter\n\n   And we avoid the known absent letters.\n\n   So let\'s go with SALTY.\n\n   Alternatively, what about STAIR? -> S, T, A, I, R -> but R is absent! We must not use R because it\'s not in the word.\n\n   So we avoid STAIR.\n\n   Or STAFF? -> but F is not tested? But STAFF: STAFF has two F\'s and we can test F? But we don\'t know. However, it has F repeated? \n   And also A in position 3 -> which we know is wrong? \n\n   So SALTY seems better.\n\n   Another word: DAILY -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? And avoids E, R, N, C? Yes. But note we have D and L and I and Y.\n\n   But S and T are more common than D? We should test the most common consonants: S and T.\n\n   So SALTY uses S and T which are more common than D. \n\n   Therefore, SALTY is better.\n\n   Conclusion: Guess SALTY.\n\n   But note: we have to make sure SALTY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it is.\n\n   So I will guess: SALTY\n\n   Format: <guess>salty</guess>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked x), while A is present but not in position 3 (marked -). Therefore:\n- The secret word contains A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Test A in a new position (not 3) to probe its location.\n- Use common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- ""salty"" places A in position 2 (new location), uses S/T (high-frequency consonants), and introduces L/Y. All letters are untested and avoid the known absent ones.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got \'-\')\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: salty -> S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since in ""salty"", A was in position 2 and we got a checkmark).\n- S, L, T, Y are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- A is in the secret word and is in position 2. So the word is _ A _ _ _\n- We have eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y. So we can\'t use those.\n- The secret word has 5 letters, one of which is A in the second position.\n\nWe now know the second letter is A. Therefore the word structure is: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to think about what letters are left. We haven\'t tested many vowels: only A and E (which is absent). So vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but Y is already eliminated). Since Y is eliminated, we focus on I, O, U.\n\nAlso, consonants we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: Q, Z, X are less common.\n\nWe need to form a word of the form _ A _ _ _\n\nWe know the word must contain A in position 2 and must not include C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.\n\nNow, since in the first guess, we had A in the word (but wrong position) and now we found it in position 2, that suggests that the A might have been moved from its correct position? Actually, in the first guess we had it in position 3 and it was wrong, now we know it\'s in position 2.\n\nWe have two other positions to figure out: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWhat we can try:\nWe can try a word that includes common letters from the remaining set.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels: I, O, U.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible words: \n- Starting with B: BA_ _ _ -> e.g., BADAM? That\'s not 5 letters. Valid words: BAGEL? but E is out. BAWDY? but Y is out. BAILS? but S and L are out. Not easy.\n\n- D: DA_ _ _ -> DAVIT? V and I? But using D and then V and I.\n\n- F: FA_ _ _ -> FABLE? B, L, E -> L and E are out. Not possible. FAUNA? N is out. FAKIR? K and I? Valid word? FAKIR is acceptable.\n\n- G: GA_ _ _ -> GAUDY? U, D, Y -> Y is out. So no. GAMUT? M, U, T -> T is out. T is eliminated.\n\n- H: HA_ _ _ -> HAVOC? V, O, C -> C is out. Not possible. HABIT? B, I, T -> T is out.\n\n- M: MA_ _ _ -> MAJOR? J, O, R -> R is out? Or MAVI? Not valid. MAIZE? I, Z, E -> E is out.\n\n- P: PA_ _ _ -> PANSY? N, S, Y -> all out. PAGAN? G, A, N -> N out. So we need a word without eliminated letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, and vowels I, O, U.\n\nConsider words without E, S, L, T, Y, C, R, N.\n\nFor example:\n- F: FA_ _ _ -> FAVOR? But V, O, R -> R is eliminated? R is absent so we can\'t use R. So FAVOR invalid because R is absent.\n\n- How about FIELD? But no, structure must be _A_ _ _\n\n- Wait, the word must be ?A???, so all words must have A in second position.\n\nAnother idea: AUDIO? No, because first letter A? But we need A in position 2, not first.\n\nActually, position 1 can be one of the unused letters.\n\nLet me think of common words: \n- TABLE? -> T is out, and E is out. No.\n- WATER? W, A, T, E, R -> T, E, R out? T, E, R are eliminated. Not possible.\n\nWe can use:\n- Words like: PAGAN? But P, A, G, A, N -> but N is eliminated, and we have two A\'s? We don\'t know yet. But N is out so invalid.\n\n- MANGA? M, A, N, G, A -> N eliminated.\n\nSince vowels are limited, let\'s try U: That might be in words like FAULT? F, A, U, L, T -> L and T are out.\n\nOr GUARD? G, U, A, R, D -> R is out.\n\nSo we need words that don\'t contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.\n\nPossible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we have A fixed at position 2.\n\nList of possible words (from common English words):\n- PADAU? Not common.\n- KAPUT? K, A, P, U, T -> but T is out? T is absent. Not allowed.\n- GAUZE? G, A, U, Z, E -> E out and Z is marginal.\n- DAILY? D, A, I, L, Y -> L and Y are out? Yes, L and Y are absent, so not allowed.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and doesn\'t reuse the same letter multiple times unless necessary, but ideally distinct for max information.\n\nHow about:\n- FAUNA? F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? N is eliminated.\n\nAnother: MAWKY? M, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? Yes, so not.\n\nHABIT? H, A, B, I, T -> T is absent? Yes.\n\nBut T is absent from both feedbacks? Guess 1 had T? No, we haven\'t tried T? Wait, in guess 2: salty had T in position 4 and it was marked x -> T is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, Y absent, L absent.\n\nSo what words exist? Let me think:\n\nValid words with pattern _A_ _ _:\n\n- BAKED: B, A, K, E, D -> E is absent, not allowed.\n- JAZZY: J, A, Z, Z, Y -> Y is absent and repeated Z? But we don\'t know.\n\n- QUASI? Q, U, A, S, I -> S is absent? S was tested in salty and was absent? Yes.\n\nWait, we need to avoid S.\n\nHow about FUGAL? No, G is new? Letters: F, U, G, A, L -> L is absent.\n\nI am considering: HUMID? But no A in second position.\n\nWe must have A in second.\n\nAnother: VAIN? 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps: AUDIO: but that starts with A? First position A, but we need second position A. So AUDIO is not _A_ _ _\n\nWORD: MAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> repeated M? But M and G are new? But MAGMA? Valid, but we can try: M is used twice? We don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? Actually yes, words can have repeats.\n\nBut MAGMA: M and A repeated. M in positions 1 and 4.\n\nBut we have to test new letters? We haven\'t tried M and G.\n\nHowever, we know A is already correct in position 2.\n\nBut MAGMA has A in position 2 and 5? We don\'t know about multiple A\'s? But in feedback from guess 2, we had A only in position 2 and it was correct? The fact that A was present in the first guess (but wrong position) might mean it\'s the same A? Or could there be two?\n\nActually, if there were two A\'s, the first guess would have shown A as \'-\' (which it did) and then the second guess showed A as correct in position 2. That doesn\'t rule out another A elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, MAGMA: \n- If we guess MAGMA, we have M in position 1 and 4, which might be the same letter? But the feedback will tell us.\n\nBut MAGMA is a proper word? Yes, but let\'s be more common.\n\nAnother idea: PIZZA? P, I, Z, Z, A -> A is in position 5? But we need position 2 A? Not.\n\nWe are struggling because common letters are eliminated.\n\nLet me try different vowels: Using O.\n\nFor example: CAMEO? C, A, M, E, O -> C and E are out? Not.\n\nGAMBO? G, A, M, B, O -> all letters new? So GAMBO: is this a word? Gambo is a framework? Also a Scrabble word? Maybe usable.\n\nBut try common words: MANGO? M, A, N, G, O -> N is out? Not allowed.\n\nAnother: RADII? R, A, D, I, I -> R is out? R absent. Not.\n\nWe need to include I or O or U and new consonants.\n\nPossible word: WAIFS? W, A, I, F, S -> S is out.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: FAVID? F, A, V, I, D -> that seems possible? Favid is a skin lesion? Not common.\n\nWe need a word that only uses letters not eliminated and has A at position 2.\n\nList of English words with A at position 2:\n\nCommon ones: \n- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> L and Y are out? L absent in guess 2 and Y absent? So no.\n- CABAL: C, A, B, A, L -> C out? and L out? No.\n- DACHA: D, A, C, H, A -> C out? No.\n- FAKIR: F, A, K, I, R -> R is absent? From guess 1: R is not in the word -> absent. So no.\n\nSo we avoid R.\n\nLet me think of an uncommon word: MAIID? Not really.\n\nBAGGY? B, A, G, G, Y -> Y out? Not.\n\nPerhaps: GAVOT? G, A, V, O, T -> T absent? T is absent? Not allowed.\n\nPAVAN? P, A, V, A, N -> N absent? Not.\n\nI am considering: HADJI -> H, A, D, J, I -> J is not tested? HADJI is an accepted word? But I think it\'s proper.\n\nHADJI: that\'s an Arabic term? Valid.\n\nBut letters: H, A, D, J, I -> none of these are in the eliminated list? \n- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y -> yes, so H, D, J, I are new.\n\nSo HADJI is a word? I think it\'s acceptable for Wordle? We must use valid words.\n\nAnother common word: ""radio"" but R is out? And it has R.\n\n""oasis"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> S is out? And A is at position 2? O A _ _ _: positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? No, position 2 must be A -> ""oasis"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is absent? So not allowed because S is absent.\n\nWe haven\'t used B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W.\n\nHow about: DAISY? D, A, I, S, Y -> S and Y are out? S and Y are eliminated? Not.\n\nGAUDY? G, A, U, D, Y -> Y out? No.\n\nWe have to accept that Y is eliminated? But Y was in guess 2 and marked absent.\n\nAnother idea: VAUNT? V, A, U, N, T -> N and T out? Not allowed.\n\nPAWKY? P, A, W, K, Y -> Y out? Not.\n\nIt\'s difficult. Let me try BADAM? Not English. \n\nBut BADAM is not standard.\n\nPerhaps: FADGE? F, A, D, G, E -> E is out? Not.\n\nGADID? G, A, D, I, D -> valid? Gadid means of the cod family? But repeated D? But okay.\n\nGADID: letters:\n- G: not tested\n- A: known correct in position 2? But we are guessing it again? We can reuse letters? But we know A is in position 2 so it might be correct again? Or we try to use new letters? Well, we don\'t have to reuse A? Or not?\n\nActually, we are guessing to use new letters to test other positions.\n\nBut GADID: G in position 1, A in 2 (correct), D in 3, I in 4, D in 5.\n\nFeedback will tell us about G, D, I, and also D repeated? We are testing G, D, I.\n\nBut the word might not have two D\'s? We\'ll see.\n\nBut is GADID common? Unusual.\n\nAnother word: ""waive"" -> W, A, I, V, E -> E out? Not.\n\nWe need words without E.\n\nPerhaps ""faugh"" -> F, A, U, G, H -> valid interjection? Also, it has ""ugh"" which common? But we can try: letters F, A, U, G, H -> all new.\n\nWord: FAUGH\n\nWhich is an exclamation, meaning off.\n\nBut acceptable? Let\'s see.\n\nOtherwise, ""padma"" -> P, A, D, M, A -> repeated A? But also M and D new.\n\nPadma = lotus? But valid.\n\nNow, from the available letters, we can choose among these.\n\nSince we have limited options, we can choose a word that covers vowels we haven\'t tested: I, O, U.\n\nLet\'s prioritize testing common letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, and vowels O, U, I.\n\nChoose a word that includes common consonants and vowels not used.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BAITH"" which is Scottish, but not common? Not really.\n- ""MAJOR"": J,P O,R -> R out? Not.\n- ""FAPPS"" no.\n- ""GADJO"" which has O? G, A, D, J, O -> O new? Valid? Gadjo means non-Roman? Maybe useable.\n\nAnother: ""HABUS"" -> H, A, B, U, S -> S out? Not.\n\n""GAMIC"" -> G, A, M, I, C -> C out? Not.\n\n""VACUA"" -> V, A, C, U, A -> C out? Not.\n\n""PAGOD"" -> P, A, G, O, D -> all new except A? Letters: P, G, O, D.\n\nPAGOD: is it valid? Pagod, as in historical currency? Or sometimes pagoda, but pagod is a word.\n\nBut 5 letters: P-A-G-O-D.\n\nPosition 2 is A.\n\nLetters: P, A, G, O, D -> none of these are eliminated: \n- P: not used before\n- G: not used\n- O: not used\n- D: not used\n\nAnd they are all available.\n\nSo PAGOD is acceptable.\n\nAnother possibility is ""WAQFS"" -> too obscure.\n\nOr ""VAPID"" -> V, A, P, I, D -> all new? But VAPID: valid word meaning uninteresting.\n\nYes, VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.\n\nThat covers V, P, I, D.\n\nBut PAGOD covers P, G, O, D? Same D.\n\nBut VAPID has I? Vowel I.\n\nBut both appear valid.\n\nSince we need to test more common letters? V vs G? G is more common.\n\nBut P is common.\n\nAnother word: ""HAIKA"" -> Haika is an Indian music form? Or not common.\n\nWe can choose between PAGOD and VAPID.\n\nThe secret word could be any, but we should try to cover different letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, O? PAGOD: P, G, O, D.\n\nVAPID: V, P, I, D.\n\nNote that both include P and D? Not a problem.\n\nBut VAPID has I? Which is a vowel? We need to test vowels? Yes.\n\nThe word is _A_ _ _\n\nWe have used a few vowels: A, and we know E is out, Y is out? So vowels left: I, O, U.\n\nIn PAGOD, we are testing O? And in VAPID, we are testing I.\n\nBoth untested.\n\nFor commonality, I think both words are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose VAPID? But I prefer common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> L is out? L is absent from guess 2.\n\nSo not.\n\n""DANDY"" -> D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y out? No.\n\n""PANDA"" -> P, A, N, D, A -> N out? Not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""GAMED"" -> G, A, M, E, D -> E out? Not.\n\nWe are limited.\n\nSo I think PAGOD or FAUGH, which is less common? Or VAPID.\n\nLet me choose VAPID? Because at least it\'s more common English word.\n\nVAPID is a bit negative, but valid.\n\nOr ""WACKO"" -> W, A, C, K, O -> C out? Not.\n\nSo VAPID seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""HADAL"" -> H, A, D, A, L -> L is out? No.\n\nSo we go with VAPID.\n\nWe risk but it\'s one of the few words.\n\nPerhaps ""GAZOO"" is absurd.\n\nYes, so guess: VAPID.\n\nBut VAPID: V, A, P, I, D -> \n- We haven\'t tried V, P, I, D? V and P are consonants, I is vowel, D consonant.\n\nAnd A in position 2 which is correct.\n\nSo we can get feedback on V, P, I, D.\n\nIf not in the word, that will eliminate them.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""vapid"".From the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - A is present in the secret word but not at position 3.  \n  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - A is confirmed at position 2 (it is in the word and in the correct position).  \n  - S, L, T, Y are absent from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n- The secret word has the format: `_ A _ _ _` (position 2 is A).\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y.\n- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and vowels I, O, U).\n- Goal for the next guess: Focus on testing new common letters to gain information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Avoid reused absent letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n1. **Pattern constraint**: The secret word is `?A???` (5 letters with A in position 2).  \n2. **Eliminated letters**: Cannot use C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y in any guess.  \n3. **Available letters**: Prioritize common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V) and untested vowels (I, O, U), as these are frequent in 5-letter words.  \n4. **Word selection criteria**:  \n   - Must be a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2.  \n   - Should include multiple untested letters to maximize new information.  \n   - Avoid positions/extras that might conflict with prior feedback (e.g., A is fixed at position 2).  \n5. **Brainstorm options**:  \n   - Potential words fitting `?A???`: e.g., ""valid"" (invalid due to L), ""pagan"" (invalid due to N), ""faucet"" (too long).  \n   - Valid options: ""vapid"" (uses V, A, P, I, D), ""pagod"" (uses P, A, G, O, D), or ""gadid"" (obscure, less ideal).  \n6. **Optimization**:  \n   - ""Vapid"" is chosen because:  \n     - Tests 4 new letters: V (position 1), P (position 3), I (position 4), D (position 5).  \n     - Uses a common vowel I and common consonants V, P, D.  \n     - Recognizable English word (meaning ""lacking vigor""), adhering to game rules.  \n   - Alternative words like ""pagod"" or ""fauch"" were considered but discarded for obscurity or less common letters (""fauch"" not valid).  \n7. **Expected information gain**: Feedback on V, P, I, D will help narrow down letters for positions 1, 3–5.\n\nChosen guess: **vapid**.\n\n<guess>vapid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: vapid -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning: A is in the word but not at position 3.

S, L, T, Y are absent.\n\nGuess 3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)\nMeaning: A is again correct (position 2). V, P, I, D are absent.\n\nSummary:\n- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _\n- Letters absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D\n- Therefore, the remaining possible letters are: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that:\n- Has A in position 2\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z\n- The word must not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z\n\nConsidering the pattern: ?A??? \n\nPossible words:\n- Using common letters: We haven\'t tested B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, etc.\n\nOptions:\n- BAUKS? (a weight) Not common.\n- FAUGH? But F and U and G used? But FAUGH has F, A, U, G, H -> all available? But FAUGH was considered earlier? However, in guess 3, we didn\'t test F? F is available.\n\nFAUGH: \n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: A (correct)\n- Position 3: U (vowel)\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: H\n\nBut FAUGH is interjection meaning \'begone\'. Valid.\n\n- KAGU? Only 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n- GAWKY? G, A, W, K, Y -> Y is absent? From guess 2 Y is absent? So no.\n\n- HAUGH? H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? HAUCH/Haugh is a word meaning river meadow? But spelled HAUGH? Yes, 5 letters: HAUGH.\n\nLetters: H, A, U, G, H -> so H is repeated? But we haven\'t tested H? It\'s available.\n\nBut HAUGH is a valid word.\n\n- MAUGH? Not common.\n\n- WAUGH? Not common.\n\nAnother option: BAGHS? B, A, G, H, S -> S is absent? Not allowed.\n\n- GAUMS? G, A, U, M, S -> S absent? No.\n\nWe avoid S? S is absent.\n\nPossible words: BAFFY? But Y is absent? No.\n\nOr GAUMY? G, A, U, M, Y -> Y absent? No.\n\nWe notice that Y is absent so we must not use Y.\n\nNow, let\'s look for words without the eliminated letters and with available vowels Vowels available: O, U? We have I absent? I was tested in VAPID and absent? Yes? So A is the only vowel confirmed? But no: A is fixed? We may need other vowels.\n\nVowels: O, U available? I is absent? So U is a possibility? And O.\n\nBut in English, words with A in position 2 and using U or O.\n\nAnother word: ""FAZED"" -> Z, E, D? E and D absent? Not.\n\nAlternative: ""MAWMY"" -> M, A, W, M, Y -> Y absent? No.\n\nBut we have few options: FAUGH or HAUGH? \n\nFAUGH: F, A, U, G, H -> letters not eliminated? So it is valid.\n\nHAUGH: H, A, U, G, H -> repeated H? But acceptable? Yes.\n\nAlso, WAUGH: W, A, U, G, H -> same.\n\nBut WAUGH is a surname? Valid.\n\nAlso GAUFF? Not common.\n\nAnother possibility: BAFFS is invalid due to S? Not.\n\nThus, we can choose among FAUGH, HAUGH, WAUGH? Or GAUCH? G, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.\n\nGAUCH is not a word? Gauch is not standard.\n\nLet me confirm commonality? But Wordle accepts less common words? Maybe.\n\nBut FAUGH and HAUGH are listed in Scrabble dictionaries.\n\nBut notice: the feedback must use valid English words? So I think we can choose FAUGH? But WAUGH might be better? Or HAUGH.\n\nAnother word: ""BAHU"" only 4 letters? No.\n\nOr ""KABAB"" but K, A, B, A, B -> repeated A and B? But positions:1:K,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:B? Actually KABAB might be accepted? But KABAB is spelt with variations? But valid? Kabob would be with O? So not.\n\nWe should focus on FAUGH? Or perhaps ""MAUMA"" M, A, U, M, A? Repeated M? But MAUMA meaning mom? Valid informal? Might not be accepted.\n\nBut let\'s be safe: HAUGH is a word? Yes? For example, ""haugh"" is a Scottish term for low-lying meadow.\n\nSimilarly, FAUGH is an exclamation.\n\nWAUGH might be less common.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested B and M? B and M are available.\n\nSo another option: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not allowed.\n\nOr ""MAHUA"" M, A, H, U, A -> repeated A? MAHUA is a tree? Valid? 5 letters.\n\nPositions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:H, 4:U, 5:A? But pattern is ?A??? so position 2 is A? Correct? But positions 1 and 5 will be tested.\n\nMAHUA: M, A, H, U, A -> all letters available? M, H, U, A? But A is repeated? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? Possible? But letters M, H, U, A? H is present? But we haven\'t tested H.\n\nHowever, MAHUA has two A\'s.\n\nSimilarly, BAUKS? B, A, U, K, S -> S is absent? No.\n\nGAWK not 5.\n\nLet me choose HAUGH: \n- Position 1: H\n- Position 2: A (correct)\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: H\n\nSo letters: H, U, G? But H repeated? We are testing H and U and G.\n\nThis covers: H at positions 1 and 5? U at position 3? G at position 4.\n\nIf HAUGH is the answer, we will get feedback accordingly.\n\nBut if not, we eliminate H, U, G? Or any of them.\n\nAnother word: FAUNA -> F, A, U, N, A -> N is absent? Not allowed? Since N is eliminated? So FAUNA is invalid because of N.\n\nSimilarly not.\n\nTherefore, I think HAUGH is a reasonable guess? Or FAUGH.\n\nHow about BAUCH? B, A, U, C, H -> C absent? Not.\n\nSo after all, let\'s pick HAUGH? But WAUGH is also valid? Let\'s use WAUGH to combine W? But W is untested.\n\nBut HAUGH is simpler.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKUM"" -> but O, A, K, U, M? Position 1: O? Position 2: A? Yes? But OAKUM: O, A, K, U, M? \n- O: not tested? \n- A: position 2 correct? \n- K: not tested?\n- U: not tested?\n- M: not tested?\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain any eliminated letter? Letters: O, K, U, M? And A.\n\nBut OAKUM is a word? Yes, oakum. Used in ship building? Valid.\n\nTherefore, OAKUM:\n- Position 1: O\n- Position 2: A (correct)\n- Position 3: K\n- Position 4: U\n- Position 5: M\n\nAnd letters: O, K, U, M are all new? And available: not in eliminated list.\n\nCompared to HAUGH which has repeated H? OAKUM doesn\'t have repeats? And covers more varied letters? So OAKUM is better.\n\nOAKUM: \n- O: vowel\n- K: consonant\n- U: vowel\n- M: consonant\n\nAll distinct? So we test all four with one guess.\n\nSo preferred over HAUGH? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we guess OAKUM.\n\nBut OAKUM has O? Position 1? And M? Position 5.\n\nIf not, we eliminate O, K, U, M.\n\nSo let\'s go with OAKUM.From the accumulated feedback:\n\n- **Absent letters (confirmed not in secret word)**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D  \n- **Present and fixed**: A at position 2  \n- **Remaining letters available** (not previously guessed or eliminated): B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z  \n- **Pattern constraint**: Secret word is `? A ? ? ?`  \n\n### Objective:\nGuess a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 2, using only remaining letters.  \n\n### Evaluation:\n- Prioritize common words first to avoid obscurity.  \n- Maximize information gain with distinct new letters.  \n- Eliminated words:  \n  - Excluded if containing absent letters (e.g., ""baggy"" invalid due to Y).  \n  - Excluded if not matching pattern (e.g., ""audio"" lacks A at position 2).  \n\n### Selected Guess: ""oakum""\nRationale:  \n- **Letters tested**: O (position 1), A (fixed/position 2), K (position 3), U (position 4), M (position 5).  \n- **Validity**: ""Oakum"" is a recognized English word (material used in shipbuilding), accepted by Wordle dictionaries.  \n- **Coverage**: Tests 4 new letters (O, K, U, M), all from remaining set.  \n- **Distinctness**: No repeated letters, maximizing potential feedback.  \n\n<guess>oakum</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n- **Guess 2: salty** → Feedback: S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)  \n- **Guess 3: vapid** → Feedback: V(x), A(✓), P(x), I(x), D(x)  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n1. **Fixed letter**: A is confirmed correct and in position 2 (secret word pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).\n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D (17 eliminated, leaving 9 possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, X, Z).\n3. **Goal for next guess**: Use a word that:\n   - Includes A in position 2.\n   - Uses only the remaining letters.\n   - Tests new common letters to gather information on positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n### Selected Guess:\n""**OAKUM**"" is chosen because:\n- **Pattern**: Fits `?

Fixed: Position 2 is A -> ? A ? ? ?\n2. Present letters: \n   - We know A (position 2) and M (somewhere, but not position 5).\n   - From guess 1, A was present (now fixed) and no other present letters except M now?\n   - We have only these two confirmed present letters? But wait, could there be more?\n\nBut note: in all guesses, only A and M have shown as present (A with a \'-\' in guess1 and check in guess2, M with \'-\' in guess4).\n\n3. Absent letters: From all guesses: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.\n\nList of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U.\n\nRemaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (and M is present but position unknown).\n\nNote: We have only 7 letters left: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z, and M is present.\n\nSo the secret word contains A (position 2) and M (not position 5), and two other letters from the available set? Actually, three other letters? Because word has 5 letters: \nPosition 1: one of B, F, G, H, W, X, Z?\nPosition 2: A (fixed)\nPosition 3: one of the available letters (B, F, G, H, W, X, Z) or M? But M might be here? Not at position 5? So could be in position 1, 3, or 4?\nPosition 4: similarly.\nPosition 5: one of the available letters, but not M? Since M is not in position 5.\n\nThe word must have exactly one M? Or could there be multiples? We don\'t know? But M was guessed once? So feedback was only for one M? So there might be one M.\n\nAlso, the word may have other letters? We have 4 positions to fill (1,3,4,5) with 7 available letters? But one of them must be M? So:\n\n- The secret word has:\n   Position 2: A\n   One M in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).\n   And three other letters from the set: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? But the total letters are 7 available? But we need only three letters (since one of the positions is M).\n\nActually, the word might have more than the letters we have? But the letters must be from the available set? Since we eliminated the rest.\n\nTotal available letters: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z (7 letters) and M is present? But not counted? Or M is exactly one occurrence? So:\n\nThe word must contain: A, M, and three distinct other letters? Or not distinct? We don\'t know? But let\'s assume distinct for now? But we might have repeated letters? Possible.\n\nBut note: in the available set, we have only 7 letters? So we might get duplicated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nNow, we know M is in the word but not in position 5? So possibilities: M in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we have to find a word that:\n\n- Has A in position 2.\n- Has M in one of position 1, 3, or 4? But not 5.\n- Uses letters only from the available set? And avoids all absent letters.\n\nAvailable letters for positions: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? But M is already one letter? So the other letters must be chosen from B, F, G, H, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we need three more letters? So one position is M? And three others from the 7.\n\nWe also note that M cannot be in position 5? So:\n\nCase:\n- Position 1 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}\n- Position 3 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}\n- Position 4 may be M or from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}\n- Position 5 must be from {B, F, G, H, W, X, Z}? But not M.\n\nAlso, since M is one letter? But it could be duplicated? But we don\'t know? However, we haven\'t encountered it before? So likely one M? But possible.\n\nNow, let\'s try to think of words: pattern: [M or _] A [M or _] [M or _] [_ but not M]\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf M in position 1: M A _ _ _\n\nPossible words: MAFIA? But F? And A? Position 3? But MAFIA: M, A, F, I, A -> I is absent? Not allowed? And A duplicated? But A is fixed? I absent.\n\nNot.\n\nMAGMA? M, A, G, M, A -> but we have G? and M? But A present? But positions: \nPosition 1: M? But M in position 1 and 4? Also, letter A we know? But the feedback: if MAGMA, but M at position 1 and 4? We got M absent? No: we got M present? And available? \nBut MAGMA uses M? Position 1: M? But we guessed M at 5 and got it present but wrong position? So if M is at position 1? And 4? Then in guess 4, M was at position 5? So M is not at 5? Which matches? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So OK? However, I? No, MAGMA: M, A, G, M, A -> letters: M, A, G. But we haven\'t tested G? But in MAHUA? Not.\n\nBut MAGMA: \nPosition 1: M\nPosition 2: A\nPosition 3: G\nPosition 4: M\nPosition 5: A\n\nBut A is repeated? We know A is in the word? But we have A only at position 2? Or could there be another A? We don\'t know? So possible? \n\nBut let\'s see: the word MAGMA: \nIf secret word is MAGMA, then:\n- A at position 2: correct (we have A(✓) in guesses where we guessed A at 2? So A is fixed? But position 5: A? Still, position 2 is A? \nHowever, our feedback in guess4: for oakum we had M? At position 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? So if secret MAGMA, then M not at 5? So our guess oakum M at 5 would be absent? But we got M(-) meaning present but not at 5? So consistent? \n\nBut wait: in guess4, oakum: O A K U M -> \nIf secret MAGMA, then:\n- O: not in MAGMA -> O(x) correct\n- A: position 2: A(✓) correct\n- K: not in MAGMA -> K(x) correct\n- U: not in MAGMA -> U(x) correct\n- M: guess at position 5? But real M is at positions 1 and 4? So M is in the wrong position? Thus M(-) correct? \n\nSo MAGMA is a candidate? But the letters: M, A, G? and A again? But we haven\'t tested G? And M? So MAGMA is possible? \n\nBut problem: MAGMA has two M\'s and two A\'s? We don\'t know? So it\'s allowed? Yes.\n\nBut MAGMA uses G? Which is available? So valid? Because absent letters: not eliminated? G is available? Yes.\n\nAlso M? Already in word? And A? Fixed.\n\nNow, another possibility: if M in position 3: _ A M ? ?\n\nThen words: could be HAMMY? But H, M, Y? But Y is absent? Not allowed.\n\nOr BAMMY? Y absent? Not.\n\nOr JAMMY? J? Have we tested? J not? But J is not in eliminated letters? But our available set includes B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? We don\'t have J? Why? Because from the feedback, we eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U. So J is not eliminated? We haven\'t tested J? \n\nWait: the eliminated letters are those that were marked absent? Any letter not tested? So available letters should include all not marked absent plus the present ones? But we only have:\n\nAvailable now: B, F, G, H, W, X, Z? And M? And J? And Q? So we forgot? \n\nEliminated letters: \n- From guess 1: C, R, N, E\n- From guess 2: S, L, T, Y\n- From guess 3: V, P, I, D\n- From guess 4: O, K, U\n\nSo absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,L,T,Y,V,P,I,D,O,K,U. -> total 15.\n\nAlphabet: 26 letters? So remaining: A, B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But A is known? So letters not absent: A, M (which are the ones we know are present? Or might be?) Actually, M we know present? Any other? Only A and M.\n\nSo letters we can use: all letters not absent? So: A (fixed), M (present), and: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z. \n\nSo 9 letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.\n\nWe also include J and Q and possibly others? We never guessed them? So they are available? We have:\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? And M? And A? But A is fixed? We don\'t need to guess A? So for the three other positions, we can choose from B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z? But M must appear exactly once? And we have to put it in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 5: cannot be M? So must be one from: B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, back to pattern:\n\nIf M in position 1: M A _ _ _\n\nThen we need: position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ? (from set excluding M? But M in 1? Then others from available? Including M? But M already used? Or word might have multiple M? Possible? So we cannot rule out? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, if M not position 1? Then position 1 from available without M? But we don\'t know? So we have to allow duplicate? So many possible? \n\nBut in practice, we need to think of a word.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- MAGMA: M A G M A -> \n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: G\n  Position 4: M\n  Position 5: A -> uses G? And M repeated? And A repeated? \n  However, if we choose this, we get:\n    Position 5: A? But we have position 2: A? So two A\'s? \n  But in feedback: \n    Guess 1: crane had A at 3? So if MAGMA has A at 2 and 5? Then at guess1, A at 3? Which we got \'-\' meaning present but not 3? Correct? \n    And guess2? Had A at 2? Correct? \n  Also, guess4: M at 5? But MAGMA has M at 1 and 4? Not 5? So M( - ) for position 5? Correct? \n  And letters: G is available? J, Q not used? \n  So MAGMA is possible.\n\n- Another word: M? With no duplicate? For example, MAWGH? Not a word? \n\n- Or HAWKM? But K eliminated? Not? \n\nSince M must be in position 1,3,or4? \n\nLet me list possible positions for M:\n\nCase 1: M at position 1: words: \n  MABIG? Not word? \n  MAGUS? U? Not available? \n\nCase 2: M at position 3: words: \n  We have pattern: ? A M ? ?\n  Position 1: must be from available? B, F, G, H, J, Q, W, X, Z? \n  Position 4: similarly? \n  Position 5: similarly? \n\n  Words: \n    JAMBU? J, A, M, B, U? But U eliminated? Not?\n    HAMZA? H, A, M, Z, A -> repeated A? And Z? And H? \n    Position 5: A? So if HAMZA: _ A M? ? -> H A M Z A.\n\n    Letters: H, Z? Available? And A fixed? \n    So HAMZA is possible? Word: Hamza is a name? Valid? \n\n  Similarly, BAFFY? But F repeated? And Y absent? No? \n\n  GAWKY? Not? \n\nCase 3: M at position 4: pattern: ? A ? M? \n\n  Words: MAGMA? But M at 4? And at 1? \n\n  Or separately: for example, FAHMA? F, A, H, M, A? \n    FAHMA: is that a word? Not? \n\n  WAHAB? W, A, H, A, B? Position 5: B? \n    W A H A B -> no M? But we need M? \n\n  Or JARMA? J, A, R, M, A? R absent? Not? \n\nNow, considering MAGMA and HAMZA and others? But we are limited.\n\nAlso, with the available letters, we have FAWMA? But not word? \n\nWe must search for valid words.\n\nOption 1: MAGMA\nOption 2: HAMZA \n\nHAMZA: \n- Position 1: H\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: Z\n- Position 5: A\n\nBut two A\'s? Possible? If the secret word is HAMZA, then in guess1: crane guessed A at position 3? But in secret, A in positions 2 and 5? So A at guess1 position 3: should be absent? Or present? It was \'-\' meaning present? But in secret, A at 3? No? Secret has A only at 2 and 5? So position 3? Crane? Position 3 was A? Secret no A at position 3? So \'-\' because A is present elsewhere? Correct? \n\nAlso, in guess3: vapid guessed A at 2? Correct? And others: V,P,I,D absent? Correct.\n\nAnd guess4: oakumn? O,A,K,U,M at 5? Secret: H A M Z A? Then \n- O: absent -> O(x) correct\n- A: position 2: ✓ correct\n- K: not in secret? K(x) correct\n- U: not? U(x) correct\n- M: guessed at position 5? Secret: M at position 4? So M not at 5? And present? So M(-) meaning present but not 5? Correct? \n\nSo HAMZA is also possible.\n\nBut we have to choose a guess? We need to test.\n\nAnother word: MAGIC? But I absent? And C absent? Not? \n\nJAMB? Only 4? No.\n\nSo basically two real options: MAGMA or HAMZA.\n\nBut let\'s see which one matches available letters? Both use letters not absent? For MAGMA: M, G? Available? HAMZA: H, Z? Available.\n\nWe can try to use a word that disambiguates this? But we have to guess the word? \n\nOr we can guess MAGMA to test? Because if MAGMA is the word? Then we get it? Or if not, we eliminate? Or HAMZA.\n\nBut we have limited guesses: we are at guess 5? So we have two tries? But we must choose.\n\nBecause M is not at position 5? And we don\'t know where? So we need to test M in other positions? Or we can test letters.\n\nBut how? We can guess a word that has M in a different position? But we don\'t know where? And also we need to include available letters.\n\nWe can choose MAGMA because it\'s more common? But HAMZA is a name? Actually MAGMA is a geology term? More common? So let\'s guess MAGMA? \n\nBut note: MAGMA uses G? Which we haven\'t tested? Similarly, HAMZA uses Z? Both untested? And if we guess MAGMA and it\'s wrong? Then G might be eliminated? Which helps.\n\nBut let\'s decide.\n\nBecause M is present? And not at 5? And must be at 1,3,4.\n\nIf we want to cover multiple positions? We can try MAXX? Not 5.\n\nBut guess: BAGGY? But Y absent? Not.\n\nSo here is an idea: guess a word that has M at position 1? For example: MAFIA? But F? And I? I is absent? No? \n\nSo not.\n\nAnother guess: MAWHM? Not word.\n\nSo it\'s hard? So I think MAGMA is a valid possibility? So we guess MAGMA.\n\nBut also, is there a word like WAFFM? Not? \n\nSo we go with MAGMA.\n\nOr to test more letters? How about a word that uses F, G, H, etc? \n\nFor example, if we guess FAWGH? Not valid? \n\nAnother valid word: WHAM! only 4 letters? Or WHAMM: 5? WHAMM: W H A M M? \nPosition 1: W\nPosition 2: H? No? Position 2 is A? So must have A at 2? WHAMM is W H A M M? Positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:A? But we need position 2: A? So no? Pattern is ?A??? so position 2 A? WHAMM has A at position 3? So not.\n\nSo we are stuck? So choose MAGMA.\n\nSo guess: MAGMA.\n\n<guess>magma</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(not in word), R(not), A(in word but wrong position), N(not), E(not).  \n- **Guess 2: salty** → S(not), A(correct position), L(not), T(not), Y(not).  \n  - Confirms A is at position 2 (secret pattern: `?

M\'s position: Cannot be position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.  \n6.

We have the feedback from Guess 5: magma -> M(✓) A(✓) G(x) M(✓) A(✓)

Breaking down:
- Position 1: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position 1.
- Position 2: A(✓) -> A is correct and in position 2 (as we knew).
- Position 3: G(x) -> G is not in the word.
- Position 4: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position 4? But we have two M's? 
- Position 5: A(✓) -> A is correct and in position 5.

But note: the word ""magma"" has two M's and two A's. The feedback shows:
- The first M (position 1) is correct.
- The second M (position 4) is also correct? But that would mean the secret word has M at positions 1 and 4.
- Similarly, A at positions 2 and 5 are correct.

But the feedback for position 3: G is absent.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ? (but not G, and not any of the previously eliminated letters)
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: A

So the pattern is: M A ? M A

We know the third letter is not G, and also not any of the previously absent letters.

Now, what are the absent letters? From all previous feedback:

- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U, and now G (from guess 5).

So absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U, G.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

The secret word is M A ? M A, and the third letter must be one of: B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form M A _ M A, with the middle letter from the set {B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z}.

Possible words:

- M A H M A? ""mahma"" is not a word.
- M A B M A? ""mabma"" not a word.
- M A F M A? ""mafma"" not a word.
- M A J M A? ""majma"" not a word.
- M A Q M A? ""maqma"" not a word.
- M A W M A? ""mawma"" not a word.
- M A X M A? ""maxma"" not a word.
- M A Z M A? ""mazma"" not a word.

None of these are words? But we must have a valid English word.

Perhaps we missed a letter? The available letters are B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

But is there a word? Let me think: ""mamma"" is a word? But M A M M A? That would be M, A, M, M, A? But we have position 3: M? Then the word would be M A M M A? But that has three M's? And two A's.

But ""mamma"" is a word? Meaning mother? But let's see the spelling: M A M M A? Yes, 5 letters: positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:M, 4:M, 5:A.

But in our pattern, we have position 4: M? And position 3: M? So if the secret word is ""mamma"", then:

- Position 1: M (correct) -> ✓
- Position 2: A (correct) -> ✓
- Position 3: M? In ""mamma"", position 3 is M? But we guessed G? So if secret is ""mamma"", then position 3 is M? But we guessed G? So G is absent? Correct? 
- Position 4: M (correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: A (correct) -> ✓

But in the feedback for guess5: we have M(✓) for position 1, A(✓) for 2, G(x) for 3, M(✓) for 4, A(✓) for 5.

If secret is ""mamma"", then position 3 is M? But we guessed G? So G is not in the word? So G(x) is correct? And the M at position 3? We didn't guess it? But we only guessed one M at position 4? And one at 1? But the secret has M at 1,3,4? So we didn't guess position 3? So we don't get feedback for that? Only for what we guessed.

In the guess ""magma"", we have:
- Position 1: M -> correct? If secret has M at 1, then ✓
- Position 2: A -> ✓
- Position 3: G -> but secret has M? So G is not in the word? So x
- Position 4: M -> correct? ✓
- Position 5: A -> ✓

But the secret has an extra M at position 3? We didn't guess it? So we don't know? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? So it doesn't tell us that there is an M at position 3? Because we didn't put a letter there? We put G? So we only know that G is absent? And the M at position 4 is correct? And M at position 1 is correct? But the secret has M at position 3? We don't know? Because we didn't test position 3 with M? We tested with G.

So ""mamma"" is a possibility? But we need to check if it fits all feedback.

Also, for the first guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
If secret is ""mamma"", then:
- A is present? But not at position 3? Secret has A at 2 and 5? So A at position 3 in guess1? Should be '-' meaning present but not here? Correct.

Guess2: salty -> S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x) -> A at position 2: correct? ✓

Guess3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x) -> A at 2: correct? ✓

Guess4: oakum -> O(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) M(-) 
- M at position 5? But secret ""mamma"" has M at 1,3,4? Not 5? So M is present but not at 5? So M(-) correct? 

Guess5: as above.

So ""mamma"" fits all feedback? But we didn't guess it? And it is a valid word.

But in guess5, we guessed ""magma"" and got M(✓) A(✓) G(x) M(✓) A(✓)? And if secret is ""mamma"", then position 3 is M? But we didn't guess M at position 3? We guessed G? So we don't get feedback for M at position 3? Only that G is absent? So the feedback is consistent.

Therefore, the secret word could be ""mamma"".

But we need to guess it? Or is there another possibility?

Another word? Is there a word like ""mamba""? M A M B A? But B is available? And ""mamba"" is a word? Snake.

M A M B A: 
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: A

But in our pattern, we have position 4: M? But in ""mamba"", position 4 is B? Not M? So if we guessed ""magma"" for secret ""mamba"", then:

- Position 1: M -> ✓
- Position 2: A -> ✓
- Position 3: G -> not in word? x
- Position 4: M -> but secret has B? So M? If secret has M at position 3? But we are guessing M at position 4? So if secret has M at position 3? Then M at position 4 is not present? Or is it? 

In ""mamba"", M is at positions 1 and 3? Not 4? So when we guess M at position 4? It should be absent? But we got M(✓) for position 4? That means M is at position 4? So ""mamba"" cannot be? Because we have M(✓) at position 4? So secret must have M at position 4.

Similarly, in ""mamma"", M is at position 4? So it matches.

Another possibility: ""mamma"" is the only common word? Or ""mamta""? Not English.

So we should guess ""mamma"".

But let's confirm the available letters: for position 3, in ""mamma"" it is M? But M is not in the available set? Because we know M is present? But we can use it? Because we are allowed to reuse letters? And we know M is present? So we can guess M at position 3? But we didn't in guess5? But now we can.

So the next guess should be ""mamma"".

But we have to make a new guess? So <guess>mamma</guess>

But is there any other word? For example, ""mamga""? Not word? Or ""mamza""? Not.

So ""mamma"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""mamma"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  
- **Guess 2: salty** → S(absent), A(correct position), L(absent), T(absent), Y(absent).  
  - Confirmed: A is at position 2 (secret pattern: `? A ? ? ?`).  
- **Guess 3: vapid** → V(absent), A(correct), P(absent), I(absent), D(absent).  
- **Guess 4: oakum** → O(absent), A(correct), K(absent), U(absent), M(present but wrong position).  
  - Revealed: M is in the word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 5: magma** → M(correct position), A(correct), G(absent), M(correct position), A(correct).  
  - **Critical insights**:  
    - M is at **position 1** and **position 4**.  
    - A is at **position 2** and **position 5**.  
    - G is absent.  
    - Secret word pattern: **M A ? M A**.  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Secret word structure**: `M A _ M A` (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 confirmed as M, A, M, A).  
2. **Position 3**: Must be a letter from the remaining untested set:  
   - **Absent letters** (eliminated from all guesses): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U, G.  
   - **Remaining possible letters for position 3**: B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.  
3. **Word validation**: The only valid English word fitting `M A _ M A` is **MAMMA** (meaning ""mother"" in informal English).  
   - Position 3 = M (not in the absent list, and M is confirmed present).  
   - ""Mamma"" is accepted in Wordle dictionaries.  

### Why ""mamma""?
- **Fits all feedback**:  
  - Position 1: M (correct, per Guess 5).  
  - Position 2: A (correct, consistent across guesses).  
  - Position 3: M (untested in position 3; absence of feedback for M here is consistent).  
  - Position 4: M (correct, per Guess 5).  
  - Position 5: A (correct, per Guess 5).  
- **Eliminated letters**: G (from Guess 5) and others are avoided.  
- **No alternatives**: Words like ""mamba"" (M A M B A) fail because position 4 would be B, not M (contradicting Guess 5's M✓ at position 4).  

### Next Guess:
Given the pattern `M A _ M A` and the only valid word, we guess **MAMMA**.

<guess>mamma</guess>",mamma,"We have the feedback from Guess 5: magma -> M(✓) A(✓) G(x) M(✓) A(✓)

Breaking down:
- Position 1: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position 1.
- Position 2: A(✓) -> A is correct and in position 2 (as we knew).
- Position 3: G(x) -> G is not in the word.
- Position 4: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position 4? But we have two M's? 
- Position 5: A(✓) -> A is correct and in position 5.

But note: the word ""magma"" has two M's and two A's. The feedback shows:
- The first M (position 1) is correct.
- The second M (position 4) is also correct? But that would mean the secret word has M at positions 1 and 4.
- Similarly, A at positions 2 and 5 are correct.

But the feedback for position 3: G is absent.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ? (but not G, and not any of the previously eliminated letters)
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: A

So the pattern is: M A ? M A

We know the third letter is not G, and also not any of the previously absent letters.

Now, what are the absent letters? From all previous feedback:

- Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U, and now G (from guess 5).

So absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, V, P, I, D, O, K, U, G.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

The secret word is M A ? M A, and the third letter must be one of: B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form M A _ M A, with the middle letter from the set {B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z}.

Possible words:

- M A H M A? ""mahma"" is not a word.
- M A B M A? ""mabma"" not a word.
- M A F M A? ""mafma"" not a word.
- M A J M A? ""majma"" not a word.
- M A Q M A? ""maqma"" not a word.
- M A W M A? ""mawma"" not a word.
- M A X M A? ""maxma"" not a word.
- M A Z M A? ""mazma"" not a word.

None of these are words? But we must have a valid English word.

Perhaps we missed a letter? The available letters are B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

But is there a word? Let me think: ""mamma"" is a word? But M A M M A? That would be M, A, M, M, A? But we have position 3: M? Then the word would be M A M M A? But that has three M's? And two A's.

But ""mamma"" is a word? Meaning mother? But let's see the spelling: M A M M A? Yes, 5 letters: positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:M, 4:M, 5:A.

But in our pattern, we have position 4: M? And position 3: M? So if the secret word is ""mamma"", then:

- Position 1: M (correct) -> ✓
- Position 2: A (correct) -> ✓
- Position 3: M? In ""mamma"", position 3 is M? But we guessed G? So if secret is ""mamma"", then position 3 is M? But we guessed G? So G is absent? Correct? 
- Position 4: M (correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: A (correct) -> ✓

But in the feedback for guess5: we have M(✓) for position 1, A(✓) for 2, G(x) for 3, M(✓) for 4, A(✓) for 5.

If secret is ""mamma"", then position 3 is M? But we guessed G? So G is not in the word? So G(x) is correct? And the M at position 3? We didn't guess it? But we only guessed one M at position 4? And one at 1? But the secret has M at 1,3,4? So we didn't guess position 3? So we don't get feedback for that? Only for what we guessed.

In the guess ""magma"", we have:
- Position 1: M -> correct? If secret has M at 1, then ✓
- Position 2: A -> ✓
- Position 3: G -> but secret has M? So G is not in the word? So x
- Position 4: M -> correct? ✓
- Position 5: A -> ✓

But the secret has an extra M at position 3? We didn't guess it? So we don't know? But the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? So it doesn't tell us that there is an M at position 3? Because we didn't put a letter there? We put G? So we only know that G is absent? And the M at position 4 is correct? And M at position 1 is correct? But the secret has M at position 3? We don't know? Because we didn't test position 3 with M? We tested with G.

So ""mamma"" is a possibility? But we need to check if it fits all feedback.

Also, for the first guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
If secret is ""mamma"", then:
- A is present? But not at position 3? Secret has A at 2 and 5? So A at position 3 in guess1? Should be '-' meaning present but not here? Correct.

Guess2: salty -> S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x) -> A at position 2: correct? ✓

Guess3: vapid -> V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x) -> A at 2: correct? ✓

Guess4: oakum -> O(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) M(-) 
- M at position 5? But secret ""mamma"" has M at 1,3,4? Not 5? So M is present but not at 5? So M(-) correct? 

Guess5: as above.

So ""mamma"" fits all feedback? But we didn't guess it? And it is a valid word.

But in guess5, we guessed ""magma"" and got M(✓) A(✓) G(x) M(✓) A(✓)? And if secret is ""mamma"", then position 3 is M? But we didn't guess M at position 3? We guessed G? So we don't get feedback for M at position 3? Only that G is absent? So the feedback is consistent.

Therefore, the secret word could be ""mamma"".

But we need to guess it? Or is there another possibility?

Another word? Is there a word like ""mamba""? M A M B A? But B is available? And ""mamba"" is a word? Snake.

M A M B A: 
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: A

But in our pattern, we have position 4: M? But in ""mamba"", position 4 is B? Not M? So if we guessed ""magma"" for secret ""mamba"", then:

- Position 1: M -> ✓
- Position 2: A -> ✓
- Position 3: G -> not in word? x
- Position 4: M -> but secret has B? So M? If secret has M at position 3? But we are guessing M at position 4? So if secret has M at position 3? Then M at position 4 is not present? Or is it? 

In ""mamba"", M is at positions 1 and 3? Not 4? So when we guess M at position 4? It should be absent? But we got M(✓) for position 4? That means M is at position 4? So ""mamba"" cannot be? Because we have M(✓) at position 4? So secret must have M at position 4.

Similarly, in ""mamma"", M is at position 4? So it matches.

Another possibility: ""mamma"" is the only common word? Or ""mamta""? Not English.

So we should guess ""mamma"".

But let's confirm the available letters: for position 3, in ""mamma"" it is M? But M is not in the available set? Because we know M is present? But we can use it? Because we are allowed to reuse letters? And we know M is present? So we can guess M at position 3? But we didn't in guess5? But now we can.

So the next guess should be ""mamma"".

But we have to make a new guess? So <guess>mamma</guess>

But is there any other word? For example, ""mamga""? Not word? Or ""mamza""? Not.

So ""mamma"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""mamma"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
