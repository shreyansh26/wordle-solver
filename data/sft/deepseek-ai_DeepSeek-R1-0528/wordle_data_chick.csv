We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can provide a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's see the feedback we get and then plan the next steps.

I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common letters to increase hit probability
- Has no repeating letters to cover more ground
- Includes both vowels and consonants for balanced coverage

Common effective starters include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"". Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are high-frequency in English
- It covers the 1st/2nd most common vowel (E/A) and top consonants
- No letter repeats

This choice should provide clear feedback patterns to build on in subsequent guesses. After this, I'll use the ✓/-/x symbols to refine the next guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct and in position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word has the letter 'C' in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The word starts with 'C'.
- The word does not contain R, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses. We need to choose a word that:
- Starts with 'C'
- Does not contain R, A, N, E
- Uses other common letters to get more information.

Since the first letter is fixed as 'C', we can focus on the remaining four letters. We should avoid the letters that are already excluded (R, A, N, E).

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

A good candidate might be ""CHIMP"" but note that we have to avoid A, R, N, E. However, let's think of words starting with C and without R, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- CLOUD: uses C, L, O, U, D -> but we don't know if these are in the word.
- CHILL: has double L, which might not be ideal for information (since we get less information from repeated letters).
- COULD: 5 letters? Actually, COULD is 5 letters: C, O, U, L, D. But note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E, which we are.

But we can also consider words that have common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. The vowels we haven't tried are I, O, U (since A and E are out). We also haven't tried Y.

Let's list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:
- CLOUD: C, L, O, U, D
- COULD: same as above? Actually, COULD is C, O, U, L, D -> same letters.
- CHIPS: C, H, I, P, S
- CIVIC: has two C's and two I's, but we already know the first letter is C, so the other C might be redundant? Also, we don't know if C appears again, but it's possible. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for maximum information.
- CURLY: but R is excluded, so no.
- Since R is excluded, we cannot use any word with R.

So, we must avoid R, A, N, E.

Another idea: ""COULD"" is 5 letters: C-O-U-L-D. But we can also try ""COILS"" or ""CHILL"", but let's pick one that has a good mix.

Alternatively, ""CHIPS"" is a good candidate: C, H, I, P, S. All distinct and common letters.

We could also consider ""CLOMP"", but that might be less common.

Another common word: ""COULD"" is valid, but let's see the letters: C, O, U, L, D.

We might also consider ""BUMPY"" but it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

So, let's choose a word that has new letters and is common.

I think ""CHIPS"" is a good choice because:
- It starts with C.
- It uses H, I, P, S which are common and we haven't tested.
- All letters are distinct.

Alternatively, ""CHOPS"" is similar but with O instead of I. But we don't know which vowel might be present. Since we have two vowels to test (I and O, and U), we might get more information by including one of them.

But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We can test multiple vowels in subsequent guesses if needed.

Another candidate: ""CUBIC"" but has two C's. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C would be a repeat. But the feedback for the first C is already correct, so if we put a C in another position and it's not in the word, we get an 'x', which is information. However, it might be better to use distinct letters.

But in this case, since we are avoiding R, A, N, E, and we have to start with C, we can try ""CHIPS"".

Let me check if ""CHIPS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""CHIPS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but for now, we are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another word: ""CLOTH"" - C, L, O, T, H. Also good.

But I think ""CHIPS"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels. Since we have only tested E and A (which are out) and we haven't tested I, O, U, we might want to test one of them. ""CHIPS"" has I, which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""CLOPS"" (if it exists) but not common.

I think ""CHIPS"" is a reasonable choice.

So, the next guess: CHIPS.

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, without R, A, N, E, and starting with C.

Yes, CHIPS: C-H-I-P-S.

We'll get feedback on H, I, P, S.

If we get a correct in position for any, that will help. If not, we know they are either absent or misplaced.

So, I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C is correct and in position 1** (so the secret word starts with C).
- **R, A, N, E are absent** from the secret word (so they can be excluded from future guesses).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It must avoid the letters **R, A, N, E**.
- To maximize information, I'll prioritize common, distinct letters not yet tested (e.g., H, I, P, S, O, L, T, U).

A strong candidate is **""CHIPS""** because:
- It starts with C.
- It uses new, high-frequency letters (H, I, P, S).
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities at once.
- If any letter matches (✓ or -), it will significantly narrow down options for subsequent guesses.

<thought>
- Confirmed constraints: First letter fixed as C; excluded letters R, A, N, E.
- ""CHIPS"" tests 4 new letters (H, I, P, S) and avoids repeats/exclusions.
- Alternatives considered: ""CLOUD"" (tests O, U, L, D) or ""CHOMP"" (tests O, M, P, H), but ""CHIPS"" uses more common consonants and a vowel (I) for broader coverage.
- Goal: Identify if H, I, P, or S are in the word and their positions.

Another idea: ""COULD"" is 5 letters: C-O-U-L-D. But we can also try ""COILS"" or ""CHILL"", but let's pick one that has a good mix.

Alternatively, ""CHIPS"" is a good candidate: C, H, I, P, S. All distinct and common letters.

We could also consider ""CLOMP"", but that might be less common.

Another common word: ""COULD"" is valid, but let's see the letters: C, O, U, L, D.

We might also consider ""BUMPY"" but it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

So, let's choose a word that has new letters and is common.

I think ""CHIPS"" is a good choice because:
- It starts with C.
- It uses H, I, P, S which are common and we haven't tested.
- All letters are distinct.

Alternatively, ""CHOPS"" is similar but with O instead of I. But we don't know which vowel might be present. Since we have two vowels to test (I and O, and U), we might get more information by including one of them.

But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We can test multiple vowels in subsequent guesses if needed.

Another candidate: ""CUBIC"" but has two C's. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C would be a repeat. But the feedback for the first C is already correct, so if we put a C in another position and it's not in the word, we get an 'x', which is information. However, it might be better to use distinct letters.

But in this case, since we are avoiding R, A, N, E, and we have to start with C, we can try ""CHIPS"".

Let me check if ""CHIPS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""CHIPS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but for now, we are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another word: ""CLOTH"" - C, L, O, T, H. Also good.

But I think ""CHIPS"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels. Since we have only tested E and A (which are out) and we haven't tested I, O, U, we might want to test one of them. ""CHIPS"" has I, which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""CLOPS"" (if it exists) but not common.

I think ""CHIPS"" is a reasonable choice.

So, the next guess: CHIPS.

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, without R, A, N, E, and starting with C.

Yes, CHIPS: C-H-I-P-S.

We'll get feedback on H, I, P, S.

If we get a correct in position for any, that will help. If not, we know they are either absent or misplaced.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C is correct and in position 1** (so the secret word starts with C).
- **R, A, N, E are absent** from the secret word (so they can be excluded from future guesses).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It must avoid the letters **R, A, N, E**.
- To maximize information, I'll prioritize common, distinct letters not yet tested (e.g., H, I, P, S, O, L, T, U).

A strong candidate is **""CHIPS""** because:
- It starts with C.
- It uses new, high-frequency letters (H, I, P, S).
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities at once.
- If any letter matches (✓ or -), it will significantly narrow down options for subsequent guesses.

<thought>
- Confirmed constraints: First letter fixed as C; excluded letters R, A, N, E.
- ""CHIPS"" tests 4 new letters (H, I, P, S) and avoids repeats/exclusions.
- Alternatives considered: ""CLOUD"" (tests O, U, L, D) or ""CHOMP"" (tests O, M, P, H), but ""CHIPS"" uses more common consonants and a vowel (I) for broader coverage.
- Goal: Identify if H, I, P, or S are in the word and their positions.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: CHIPS
- C: ✓ (correct and in position 1, which we already knew)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- I: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- P: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word is C H I _ _ 
- The first three letters are C, H, I in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Additionally, we know that P and S are not in the word.
- Also, from the first guess, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

So the word is of the form: C H I _ _

We need to find the last two letters. The letters that are excluded so far: R, A, N, E, P, S.

We must choose a word that starts with ""CHI"" and then two letters that are not in the excluded list.

The word must be a valid English word.

We also know that the last two letters cannot be any of the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word that begins with ""CHI"" and has two more letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the bad letters.

Let's think of words that start with ""CHI"":

- CHILD: C H I L D -> L and D are not excluded. But we have to check if L and D are allowed. Yes, they are not in the excluded list.
- CHIME: but E is excluded, so no.
- CHINK: N is excluded, so no.
- CHIRP: R and P are excluded, so no.
- CHIVE: E is excluded, so no.
- CHILL: double L, so C H I L L. But we don't know if L is in the word, and it has two L's. But it's a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. So let's list possible words:

- CHILD: L and D are available.
- CHILL: L and L (so two L's) but we can use it, though it has repeated letters. But we are trying to find the secret word, so if it fits, it's okay.
- CHICK: C is already in position 1, but we don't know if there is another C. However, C is not excluded because we only know the first C is present. But in the feedback, for ""CRANE"", C was correct, but that doesn't say anything about additional C's. Similarly, in ""CHIPS"", C was correct. But we haven't tested for duplicate C's. However, in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 1 and 5? Actually, ""CHICK"" is C-H-I-C-K. But we have C at position 1 and 4? Let's spell: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K. So we have two C's. But we don't know if the word has two C's. Also, K is not excluded.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S. So K is allowed.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that yet.

Another word: CHIMP: but P is excluded, so no.

CHIEF: E and F? But E is excluded.

CHORD: but R is excluded.

CHOSE: S and E are excluded.

So, let's list possible words that start with ""CHI"" and have the last two letters from the available set.

Available letters: all except A, E, R, N, P, S.

So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we already have C, H, I in the word, so they can appear again? But we don't know.

But for the last two positions, we need to choose from the available letters.

Now, common words:

- CHILD: L, D
- CHILL: L, L
- CHICK: C, K
- CHINK: but N is excluded, no.
- CHIVE: E excluded, no.
- CHIME: E excluded, no.
- CHIEF: E excluded, no.
- CHIRP: R and P excluded, no.
- CHORD: R excluded, no.
- CHOSE: S and E excluded, no.
- CHUGS: U, G, S? S excluded, no.
- CHUMP: U, M, P? P excluded, no.
- CHAPT: A and P excluded, no.

So, what about CHILI? But that has I at the end, and we already have I at position 3. But ""CHILI"" is C-H-I-L-I. So positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I. But we have I at position 3 and 5. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two I's. Also, L is available.

But in our case, the word must be 5 letters and start with CHI.

Another word: CHINA, but N and A excluded.

CHINO, N and O? N excluded.

CHIAS, A and S excluded.

So, let's think of less common words? Or did I miss some?

What about CHIDE? D and E? E excluded.

CHILE: E excluded.

CHIMB? Not a word.

CHIMP: P excluded.

CHIRK: R and K? R excluded.

CHIRM: R and M? R excluded.

CHIRO: R and O? R excluded.

CHIRT: R and T? R excluded.

CHIVY: V and Y? But E is not in it? ""CHIVY"" is C-H-I-V-Y. V and Y are available. Is ""CHIVY"" a word? It means to tease or annoy, yes.

Similarly, CHIZZ? Not common.

CHIBA? A excluded.

So possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, etc.

But we need to choose one that can give us information or directly solve.

Since we know the first three are fixed, we can try to guess the last two.

But we have to make a full word.

We can choose ""CHILD"" as a guess.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and D.

Similarly, we can try ""CHICK"" to test for C and K.

But note: in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 4. We don't know if there is another C. If we get a ✓ for the last C, that means there is a C at position 4. If we get a -, it means C is in the word but not at position 4, but we already have C at position 1, so it would be a duplicate. If x, then no duplicate C.

Similarly for K.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.

Since we have only two positions left, we can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.

But the possible words are limited.

List of possible words that start with ""CHI"" and avoid excluded letters:

- CHILD: C H I L D
- CHILL: C H I L L
- CHICK: C H I C K
- CHIVY: C H I V Y
- CHIMO: C H I M O (if it's a word? I think ""chimo"" is not common, but it might be accepted in some dictionaries? Let's avoid for now)
- CHIRL: R excluded, no.
- CHIRT: R excluded, no.
- CHIRU: R excluded, no.
- CHIEF: E excluded, no.
- CHIEL: E and L? E excluded.
- CHIAO: A excluded.
- CHIAS: A and S excluded.
- CHIKS: K and S? S excluded, no.
- CHIMP: P excluded, no.
- CHINA: A and N excluded, no.
- CHINE: E and N excluded, no.
- CHINK: N and K? N excluded, no.
- CHINS: N and S excluded, no.
- CHIPS: we already tried, and P and S are out.
- CHIVS: S excluded, and ""chivs"" is not common, and S is out.
- CHIZZ: not a word.

Another one: CHIRP, but R and P out.

What about CHIRO, but R out.

CHIRU, R out.

So, I think the common ones are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Also, CHIFF: F and F? ""Chiff"" might not be a word. ""Chiff"" is not standard.

CHIGO? Not common.

CHOLA? But that doesn't start with CHI.

We need to stick to CHI at the beginning.

Another word: CHIDE, but E excluded.

CHIME, E excluded.

So, let's consider CHILL or CHILD.

But there's also CHIRL, but R excluded.

Perhaps CHIOT, but O and T? ""Chiot"" is not common; it might refer to something from Chios, but let's see.

I think for practical purposes, we can consider:

- CHILD
- CHILL
- CHICK
- CHIVY

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

Since we have three possibilities (and maybe more), we can pick one that might be more common or that tests letters that are in multiple options.

For example, L appears in CHILD and CHILL, so if we guess a word with L, we can see if L is in the word.

Similarly, D is only in CHILD, V in CHIVY, C in CHICK, K in CHICK, etc.

But we can also consider that the word might not be any of these? Are there other words?

What about CHIRO, but R excluded.

CHIRM, R excluded.

CHIFFON? Too long.

5-letter words only.

Another one: CHIASM, but A and S excluded.

CHITIN: T, I, N? N excluded, and it has I at position 3 and 4? ""CHITIN"" is C-H-I-T-I-N, 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

CHITIN is 6 letters.

CHITS: S and T? S excluded, and ""CHITS"" is C-H-I-T-S, but S excluded.

CHIDE, E excluded.

So, I think the main candidates are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Now, we can also think of CHIMO, but I'm not sure. Let's assume it's not.

Another one: CHIRK, R excluded.

CHIZZ: not a word.

So, let's go with the four: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Now, to choose, we might pick CHILD because it's a common word and tests L and D.

If we guess CHILD and it's not correct, we get feedback:

- C: ✓ (position 1)
- H: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- L: ? 
- D: ?

If L is correct, then we know L is in position 4, and D might be in position 5 or not.

But if L is not in the word, then CHILL is eliminated, and CHILD is eliminated, so we have CHICK or CHIVY left.

Similarly, if D is not in the word, CHILD is eliminated.

But we can also choose a word that has letters from multiple possibilities.

But since we have to start with CHI, we cannot change the first three.

We must use CHI at the beginning.

So, we have to choose one of these.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has the same first three but different last two to test more letters.

But we are constrained to words starting with CHI.

So, I think we should guess CHILD.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters or something.

Another idea: we know the word is C H I _ _, so we can try to think of all 5-letter words starting with CHI and not containing excluded letters.

Excluded: A, E, R, N, P, S.

So, using the available letters, what words are there?

- With L: CHILD, CHILL, CHILI (but CHILI is C-H-I-L-I, which has two I's, and I is already at position 3, so if we have I at position 5, it's possible). But we haven't excluded I, so it could be.

CHILI: C H I L I

Is that a word? Yes, like the food.

And L and I are available.

Similarly, CHIRL not.

CHIZZ not.

CHIVY.

Also, CHIFF not.

CHIKO? Not common.

CHIMO: I found that ""chimo"" is an informal Canadian greeting, but it might not be in the word list.

Similarly, CHIRT not.

So, let's add CHILI to the list.

So possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, CHILI.

Now, CHILI has I at the end, which is a duplicate I.

We can test for that.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has letters that are in few words to reduce possibilities.

But let's just pick one.

I think CHILD is a good guess because it's very common.

If it's not, we get feedback on L and D.

So, I'll go with CHILD.

But in the feedback, if we get L correct and D wrong, then we know position 4 is L, and position 5 is not D, so it might be CHILL or CHILI.

Similarly, if L is wrong, then CHILL and CHILD are out, so CHICK or CHIVY.

If both wrong, then CHILD out, and we look at others.

But we have to make a guess.

Another word: CHIRP not.

CHIOT not.

I think CHILD is fine.

But let's see the previous feedback: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

We can also consider that the word might be ""CHIME"" but E is excluded, so no.

Or ""CHINE"", E and N excluded.

So, I think CHILD is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHILD"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - This means:  
    - C is correct and in position 1.  
    - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: CHIPS** → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)  
  - This means:  
    - C is confirmed in position 1 (redundant with Guess 1).  
    - H is correct and in position 2.  
    - I is correct and in position 3.  
    - P and S are absent from the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **CHI** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are C, H, I respectively).  
- **Excluded letters**: A, E, R, N, P, S (cannot appear anywhere in the word).  
- **Remaining positions**: Only positions 4 and 5 are unknown.  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: Any letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.).  

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- The word structure is **C H I _ _**.
- We need to test plausible 5-letter words starting with ""CHI"" that avoid excluded letters. Common options include:  
  - **CHILD** (tests L and D)  
  - **CHILL** (tests L and L, but repeated letters are possible)  
  - **CHICK** (tests C and K; C could be a duplicate)  
  - **CHIVY** (tests V and Y)  
  - **CHILI** (tests L and I; I could be a duplicate)  
- **Strategy**:  
  - Prioritize **CHILD** because it is a high-frequency word and tests two new, distinct letters (L and D).  
  - If CHILD is incorrect, the feedback on L and D will significantly narrow the possibilities:  
    - If L is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILL or CHILI.  
    - If L is absent (x), it points to CHICK or CHIVY.  
    - If D is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILD.  
    - If D is absent (x), it eliminates CHILD.  
- This guess maximizes information gain with common letters and avoids wasting letters (e.g., no duplicates unless necessary).

<guess>CHILD</guess>",CHILD,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: CHIPS
- C: ✓ (correct and in position 1, which we already knew)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- I: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- P: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word is C H I _ _ 
- The first three letters are C, H, I in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Additionally, we know that P and S are not in the word.
- Also, from the first guess, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

So the word is of the form: C H I _ _

We need to find the last two letters. The letters that are excluded so far: R, A, N, E, P, S.

We must choose a word that starts with ""CHI"" and then two letters that are not in the excluded list.

The word must be a valid English word.

We also know that the last two letters cannot be any of the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word that begins with ""CHI"" and has two more letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the bad letters.

Let's think of words that start with ""CHI"":

- CHILD: C H I L D -> L and D are not excluded. But we have to check if L and D are allowed. Yes, they are not in the excluded list.
- CHIME: but E is excluded, so no.
- CHINK: N is excluded, so no.
- CHIRP: R and P are excluded, so no.
- CHIVE: E is excluded, so no.
- CHILL: double L, so C H I L L. But we don't know if L is in the word, and it has two L's. But it's a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. So let's list possible words:

- CHILD: L and D are available.
- CHILL: L and L (so two L's) but we can use it, though it has repeated letters. But we are trying to find the secret word, so if it fits, it's okay.
- CHICK: C is already in position 1, but we don't know if there is another C. However, C is not excluded because we only know the first C is present. But in the feedback, for ""CRANE"", C was correct, but that doesn't say anything about additional C's. Similarly, in ""CHIPS"", C was correct. But we haven't tested for duplicate C's. However, in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 1 and 5? Actually, ""CHICK"" is C-H-I-C-K. But we have C at position 1 and 4? Let's spell: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K. So we have two C's. But we don't know if the word has two C's. Also, K is not excluded.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S. So K is allowed.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that yet.

Another word: CHIMP: but P is excluded, so no.

CHIEF: E and F? But E is excluded.

CHORD: but R is excluded.

CHOSE: S and E are excluded.

So, let's list possible words that start with ""CHI"" and have the last two letters from the available set.

Available letters: all except A, E, R, N, P, S.

So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we already have C, H, I in the word, so they can appear again? But we don't know.

But for the last two positions, we need to choose from the available letters.

Now, common words:

- CHILD: L, D
- CHILL: L, L
- CHICK: C, K
- CHINK: but N is excluded, no.
- CHIVE: E excluded, no.
- CHIME: E excluded, no.
- CHIEF: E excluded, no.
- CHIRP: R and P excluded, no.
- CHORD: R excluded, no.
- CHOSE: S and E excluded, no.
- CHUGS: U, G, S? S excluded, no.
- CHUMP: U, M, P? P excluded, no.
- CHAPT: A and P excluded, no.

So, what about CHILI? But that has I at the end, and we already have I at position 3. But ""CHILI"" is C-H-I-L-I. So positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I. But we have I at position 3 and 5. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two I's. Also, L is available.

But in our case, the word must be 5 letters and start with CHI.

Another word: CHINA, but N and A excluded.

CHINO, N and O? N excluded.

CHIAS, A and S excluded.

So, let's think of less common words? Or did I miss some?

What about CHIDE? D and E? E excluded.

CHILE: E excluded.

CHIMB? Not a word.

CHIMP: P excluded.

CHIRK: R and K? R excluded.

CHIRM: R and M? R excluded.

CHIRO: R and O? R excluded.

CHIRT: R and T? R excluded.

CHIVY: V and Y? But E is not in it? ""CHIVY"" is C-H-I-V-Y. V and Y are available. Is ""CHIVY"" a word? It means to tease or annoy, yes.

Similarly, CHIZZ? Not common.

CHIBA? A excluded.

So possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, etc.

But we need to choose one that can give us information or directly solve.

Since we know the first three are fixed, we can try to guess the last two.

But we have to make a full word.

We can choose ""CHILD"" as a guess.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and D.

Similarly, we can try ""CHICK"" to test for C and K.

But note: in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 4. We don't know if there is another C. If we get a ✓ for the last C, that means there is a C at position 4. If we get a -, it means C is in the word but not at position 4, but we already have C at position 1, so it would be a duplicate. If x, then no duplicate C.

Similarly for K.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.

Since we have only two positions left, we can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.

But the possible words are limited.

List of possible words that start with ""CHI"" and avoid excluded letters:

- CHILD: C H I L D
- CHILL: C H I L L
- CHICK: C H I C K
- CHIVY: C H I V Y
- CHIMO: C H I M O (if it's a word? I think ""chimo"" is not common, but it might be accepted in some dictionaries? Let's avoid for now)
- CHIRL: R excluded, no.
- CHIRT: R excluded, no.
- CHIRU: R excluded, no.
- CHIEF: E excluded, no.
- CHIEL: E and L? E excluded.
- CHIAO: A excluded.
- CHIAS: A and S excluded.
- CHIKS: K and S? S excluded, no.
- CHIMP: P excluded, no.
- CHINA: A and N excluded, no.
- CHINE: E and N excluded, no.
- CHINK: N and K? N excluded, no.
- CHINS: N and S excluded, no.
- CHIPS: we already tried, and P and S are out.
- CHIVS: S excluded, and ""chivs"" is not common, and S is out.
- CHIZZ: not a word.

Another one: CHIRP, but R and P out.

What about CHIRO, but R out.

CHIRU, R out.

So, I think the common ones are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Also, CHIFF: F and F? ""Chiff"" might not be a word. ""Chiff"" is not standard.

CHIGO? Not common.

CHOLA? But that doesn't start with CHI.

We need to stick to CHI at the beginning.

Another word: CHIDE, but E excluded.

CHIME, E excluded.

So, let's consider CHILL or CHILD.

But there's also CHIRL, but R excluded.

Perhaps CHIOT, but O and T? ""Chiot"" is not common; it might refer to something from Chios, but let's see.

I think for practical purposes, we can consider:

- CHILD
- CHILL
- CHICK
- CHIVY

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

Since we have three possibilities (and maybe more), we can pick one that might be more common or that tests letters that are in multiple options.

For example, L appears in CHILD and CHILL, so if we guess a word with L, we can see if L is in the word.

Similarly, D is only in CHILD, V in CHIVY, C in CHICK, K in CHICK, etc.

But we can also consider that the word might not be any of these? Are there other words?

What about CHIRO, but R excluded.

CHIRM, R excluded.

CHIFFON? Too long.

5-letter words only.

Another one: CHIASM, but A and S excluded.

CHITIN: T, I, N? N excluded, and it has I at position 3 and 4? ""CHITIN"" is C-H-I-T-I-N, 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

CHITIN is 6 letters.

CHITS: S and T? S excluded, and ""CHITS"" is C-H-I-T-S, but S excluded.

CHIDE, E excluded.

So, I think the main candidates are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Now, we can also think of CHIMO, but I'm not sure. Let's assume it's not.

Another one: CHIRK, R excluded.

CHIZZ: not a word.

So, let's go with the four: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Now, to choose, we might pick CHILD because it's a common word and tests L and D.

If we guess CHILD and it's not correct, we get feedback:

- C: ✓ (position 1)
- H: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- L: ? 
- D: ?

If L is correct, then we know L is in position 4, and D might be in position 5 or not.

But if L is not in the word, then CHILL is eliminated, and CHILD is eliminated, so we have CHICK or CHIVY left.

Similarly, if D is not in the word, CHILD is eliminated.

But we can also choose a word that has letters from multiple possibilities.

But since we have to start with CHI, we cannot change the first three.

We must use CHI at the beginning.

So, we have to choose one of these.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has the same first three but different last two to test more letters.

But we are constrained to words starting with CHI.

So, I think we should guess CHILD.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters or something.

Another idea: we know the word is C H I _ _, so we can try to think of all 5-letter words starting with CHI and not containing excluded letters.

Excluded: A, E, R, N, P, S.

So, using the available letters, what words are there?

- With L: CHILD, CHILL, CHILI (but CHILI is C-H-I-L-I, which has two I's, and I is already at position 3, so if we have I at position 5, it's possible). But we haven't excluded I, so it could be.

CHILI: C H I L I

Is that a word? Yes, like the food.

And L and I are available.

Similarly, CHIRL not.

CHIZZ not.

CHIVY.

Also, CHIFF not.

CHIKO? Not common.

CHIMO: I found that ""chimo"" is an informal Canadian greeting, but it might not be in the word list.

Similarly, CHIRT not.

So, let's add CHILI to the list.

So possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, CHILI.

Now, CHILI has I at the end, which is a duplicate I.

We can test for that.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has letters that are in few words to reduce possibilities.

But let's just pick one.

I think CHILD is a good guess because it's very common.

If it's not, we get feedback on L and D.

So, I'll go with CHILD.

But in the feedback, if we get L correct and D wrong, then we know position 4 is L, and position 5 is not D, so it might be CHILL or CHILI.

Similarly, if L is wrong, then CHILL and CHILD are out, so CHICK or CHIVY.

If both wrong, then CHILD out, and we look at others.

But we have to make a guess.

Another word: CHIRP not.

CHIOT not.

I think CHILD is fine.

But let's see the previous feedback: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

We can also consider that the word might be ""CHIME"" but E is excluded, so no.

Or ""CHINE"", E and N excluded.

So, I think CHILD is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHILD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - This means:  
    - C is correct and in position 1.  
    - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: CHIPS** → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)  
  - This means:  
    - C is confirmed in position 1 (redundant with Guess 1).  
    - H is correct and in position 2.  
    - I is correct and in position 3.  
    - P and S are absent from the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **CHI** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are C, H, I respectively).  
- **Excluded letters**: A, E, R, N, P, S (cannot appear anywhere in the word).  
- **Remaining positions**: Only positions 4 and 5 are unknown.  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: Any letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.).  

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- The word structure is **C H I _ _**.
- We need to test plausible 5-letter words starting with ""CHI"" that avoid excluded letters. Common options include:  
  - **CHILD** (tests L and D)  
  - **CHILL** (tests L and L, but repeated letters are possible)  
  - **CHICK** (tests C and K; C could be a duplicate)  
  - **CHIVY** (tests V and Y)  
  - **CHILI** (tests L and I; I could be a duplicate)  
- **Strategy**:  
  - Prioritize **CHILD** because it is a high-frequency word and tests two new, distinct letters (L and D).  
  - If CHILD is incorrect, the feedback on L and D will significantly narrow the possibilities:  
    - If L is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILL or CHILI.  
    - If L is absent (x), it points to CHICK or CHIVY.  
    - If D is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILD.  
    - If D is absent (x), it eliminates CHILD.  
- This guess maximizes information gain with common letters and avoids wasting letters (e.g., no duplicates unless necessary).",Guess 3: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(x) D(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can provide a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's see the feedback we get and then plan the next steps.

 However, note: the problem requires only the first guess. So we just output the guess.

 Format: <guess>CRANE</guess><thought>
I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common letters to increase hit probability
- Has no repeating letters to cover more ground
- Includes both vowels and consonants for balanced coverage

Common effective starters include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"". Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are high-frequency in English
- It covers the 1st/2nd most common vowel (E/A) and top consonants
- No letter repeats

This choice should provide clear feedback patterns to build on in subsequent guesses. After this, I'll use the ✓/-/x symbols to refine the next guess.
</thought>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct and in position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word has the letter 'C' in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The word starts with 'C'.
- The word does not contain R, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses. We need to choose a word that:
- Starts with 'C'
- Does not contain R, A, N, E
- Uses other common letters to get more information.

Since the first letter is fixed as 'C', we can focus on the remaining four letters. We should avoid the letters that are already excluded (R, A, N, E).

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

A good candidate might be ""CHIMP"" but note that we have to avoid A, R, N, E. However, let's think of words starting with C and without R, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- CLOUD: uses C, L, O, U, D -> but we don't know if these are in the word.
- CHILL: has double L, which might not be ideal for information (since we get less information from repeated letters).
- COULD: 5 letters? Actually, COULD is 5 letters: C, O, U, L, D. But note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E, which we are.

But we can also consider words that have common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. The vowels we haven't tried are I, O, U (since A and E are out). We also haven't tried Y.

Let's list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:
- CLOUD: C, L, O, U, D
- COULD: same as above? Actually, COULD is C, O, U, L, D -> same letters.
- CHIPS: C, H, I, P, S
- CIVIC: has two C's and two I's, but we already know the first letter is C, so the other C might be redundant? Also, we don't know if C appears again, but it's possible. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for maximum information.
- CURLY: but R is excluded, so no.
- Since R is excluded, we cannot use any word with R.

So, we must avoid R, A, N, E.

Another idea: ""COULD"" is 5 letters: C-O-U-L-D. But we can also try ""COILS"" or ""CHILL"", but let's pick one that has a good mix.

Alternatively, ""CHIPS"" is a good candidate: C, H, I, P, S. All distinct and common letters.

We could also consider ""CLOMP"", but that might be less common.

Another common word: ""COULD"" is valid, but let's see the letters: C, O, U, L, D.

We might also consider ""BUMPY"" but it doesn't start with C.

We must start with C.

So, let's choose a word that has new letters and is common.

I think ""CHIPS"" is a good choice because:
- It starts with C.
- It uses H, I, P, S which are common and we haven't tested.
- All letters are distinct.

Alternatively, ""CHOPS"" is similar but with O instead of I. But we don't know which vowel might be present. Since we have two vowels to test (I and O, and U), we might get more information by including one of them.

But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We can test multiple vowels in subsequent guesses if needed.

Another candidate: ""CUBIC"" but has two C's. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C would be a repeat. But the feedback for the first C is already correct, so if we put a C in another position and it's not in the word, we get an 'x', which is information. However, it might be better to use distinct letters.

But in this case, since we are avoiding R, A, N, E, and we have to start with C, we can try ""CHIPS"".

Let me check if ""CHIPS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""CHIPS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but for now, we are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another word: ""CLOTH"" - C, L, O, T, H. Also good.

But I think ""CHIPS"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels. Since we have only tested E and A (which are out) and we haven't tested I, O, U, we might want to test one of them. ""CHIPS"" has I, which is a vowel.

Similarly, ""CLOPS"" (if it exists) but not common.

I think ""CHIPS"" is a reasonable choice.

So, the next guess: CHIPS.

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, without R, A, N, E, and starting with C.

Yes, CHIPS: C-H-I-P-S.

We'll get feedback on H, I, P, S.

If we get a correct in position for any, that will help. If not, we know they are either absent or misplaced.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C is correct and in position 1** (so the secret word starts with C).
- **R, A, N, E are absent** from the secret word (so they can be excluded from future guesses).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with **C**.
- It must avoid the letters **R, A, N, E**.
- To maximize information, I'll prioritize common, distinct letters not yet tested (e.g., H, I, P, S, O, L, T, U).

A strong candidate is **""CHIPS""** because:
- It starts with C.
- It uses new, high-frequency letters (H, I, P, S).
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities at once.
- If any letter matches (✓ or -), it will significantly narrow down options for subsequent guesses.

<thought>
- Confirmed constraints: First letter fixed as C; excluded letters R, A, N, E.
- ""CHIPS"" tests 4 new letters (H, I, P, S) and avoids repeats/exclusions.
- Alternatives considered: ""CLOUD"" (tests O, U, L, D) or ""CHOMP"" (tests O, M, P, H), but ""CHIPS"" uses more common consonants and a vowel (I) for broader coverage.
- Goal: Identify if H, I, P, or S are in the word and their positions.
</thought>

<guess>CHIPS</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: CHIPS
- C: ✓ (correct and in position 1, which we already knew)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- I: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- P: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word is C H I _ _ 
- The first three letters are C, H, I in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Additionally, we know that P and S are not in the word.
- Also, from the first guess, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

So the word is of the form: C H I _ _

We need to find the last two letters. The letters that are excluded so far: R, A, N, E, P, S.

We must choose a word that starts with ""CHI"" and then two letters that are not in the excluded list.

The word must be a valid English word.

We also know that the last two letters cannot be any of the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word that begins with ""CHI"" and has two more letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the bad letters.

Let's think of words that start with ""CHI"":

- CHILD: C H I L D -> L and D are not excluded. But we have to check if L and D are allowed. Yes, they are not in the excluded list.
- CHIME: but E is excluded, so no.
- CHINK: N is excluded, so no.
- CHIRP: R and P are excluded, so no.
- CHIVE: E is excluded, so no.
- CHILL: double L, so C H I L L. But we don't know if L is in the word, and it has two L's. But it's a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. So let's list possible words:

- CHILD: L and D are available.
- CHILL: L and L (so two L's) but we can use it, though it has repeated letters. But we are trying to find the secret word, so if it fits, it's okay.
- CHICK: C is already in position 1, but we don't know if there is another C. However, C is not excluded because we only know the first C is present. But in the feedback, for ""CRANE"", C was correct, but that doesn't say anything about additional C's. Similarly, in ""CHIPS"", C was correct. But we haven't tested for duplicate C's. However, in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 1 and 5? Actually, ""CHICK"" is C-H-I-C-K. But we have C at position 1 and 4? Let's spell: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K. So we have two C's. But we don't know if the word has two C's. Also, K is not excluded.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S. So K is allowed.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that yet.

Another word: CHIMP: but P is excluded, so no.

CHIEF: E and F? But E is excluded.

CHORD: but R is excluded.

CHOSE: S and E are excluded.

So, let's list possible words that start with ""CHI"" and have the last two letters from the available set.

Available letters: all except A, E, R, N, P, S.

So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we already have C, H, I in the word, so they can appear again? But we don't know.

But for the last two positions, we need to choose from the available letters.

Now, common words:

- CHILD: L, D
- CHILL: L, L
- CHICK: C, K
- CHINK: but N is excluded, no.
- CHIVE: E excluded, no.
- CHIME: E excluded, no.
- CHIEF: E excluded, no.
- CHIRP: R and P excluded, no.
- CHORD: R excluded, no.
- CHOSE: S and E excluded, no.
- CHUGS: U, G, S? S excluded, no.
- CHUMP: U, M, P? P excluded, no.
- CHAPT: A and P excluded, no.

So, what about CHILI? But that has I at the end, and we already have I at position 3. But ""CHILI"" is C-H-I-L-I. So positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I. But we have I at position 3 and 5. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two I's. Also, L is available.

But in our case, the word must be 5 letters and start with CHI.

Another word: CHINA, but N and A excluded.

CHINO, N and O? N excluded.

CHIAS, A and S excluded.

So, let's think of less common words? Or did I miss some?

What about CHIDE? D and E? E excluded.

CHILE: E excluded.

CHIMB? Not a word.

CHIMP: P excluded.

CHIRK: R and K? R excluded.

CHIRM: R and M? R excluded.

CHIRO: R and O? R excluded.

CHIRT: R and T? R excluded.

CHIVY: V and Y? But E is not in it? ""CHIVY"" is C-H-I-V-Y. V and Y are available. Is ""CHIVY"" a word? It means to tease or annoy, yes.

Similarly, CHIZZ? Not common.

CHIBA? A excluded.

So possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, etc.

But we need to choose one that can give us information or directly solve.

Since we know the first three are fixed, we can try to guess the last two.

But we have to make a full word.

We can choose ""CHILD"" as a guess.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and D.

Similarly, we can try ""CHICK"" to test for C and K.

But note: in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 4. We don't know if there is another C. If we get a ✓ for the last C, that means there is a C at position 4. If we get a -, it means C is in the word but not at position 4, but we already have C at position 1, so it would be a duplicate. If x, then no duplicate C.

Similarly for K.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.

Since we have only two positions left, we can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.

But the possible words are limited.

List of possible words that start with ""CHI"" and avoid excluded letters:

- CHILD: C H I L D
- CHILL: C H I L L
- CHICK: C H I C K
- CHIVY: C H I V Y
- CHIMO: C H I M O (if it's a word? I think ""chimo"" is not common, but it might be accepted in some dictionaries? Let's avoid for now)
- CHIRL: R excluded, no.
- CHIRT: R excluded, no.
- CHIRU: R excluded, no.
- CHIEF: E excluded, no.
- CHIEL: E and L? E excluded.
- CHIAO: A excluded.
- CHIAS: A and S excluded.
- CHIKS: K and S? S excluded, no.
- CHIMP: P excluded, no.
- CHINA: A and N excluded, no.
- CHINE: E and N excluded, no.
- CHINK: N and K? N excluded, no.
- CHINS: N and S excluded, no.
- CHIPS: we already tried, and P and S are out.
- CHIVS: S excluded, and ""chivs"" is not common, and S is out.
- CHIZZ: not a word.

Another one: CHIRP, but R and P out.

What about CHIRO, but R out.

CHIRU, R out.

So, I think the common ones are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Also, CHIFF: F and F? ""Chiff"" might not be a word. ""Chiff"" is not standard.

CHIGO? Not common.

CHOLA? But that doesn't start with CHI.

We need to stick to CHI at the beginning.

Another word: CHIDE, but E excluded.

CHIME, E excluded.

So, let's consider CHILL or CHILD.

But there's also CHIRL, but R excluded.

Perhaps CHIOT, but O and T? ""Chiot"" is not common; it might refer to something from Chios, but let's see.

I think for practical purposes, we can consider:

- CHILD
- CHILL
- CHICK
- CHIVY

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

Since we have three possibilities (and maybe more), we can pick one that might be more common or that tests letters that are in multiple options.

For example, L appears in CHILD and CHILL, so if we guess a word with L, we can see if L is in the word.

Similarly, D is only in CHILD, V in CHIVY, C in CHICK, K in CHICK, etc.

But we can also consider that the word might not be any of these? Are there other words?

What about CHIRO, but R excluded.

CHIRM, R excluded.

CHIFFON? Too long.

5-letter words only.

Another one: CHIASM, but A and S excluded.

CHITIN: T, I, N? N excluded, and it has I at position 3 and 4? ""CHITIN"" is C-H-I-T-I-N, 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

CHITIN is 6 letters.

CHITS: S and T? S excluded, and ""CHITS"" is C-H-I-T-S, but S excluded.

CHIDE, E excluded.

So, I think the main candidates are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Now, we can also think of CHIMO, but I'm not sure. Let's assume it's not.

Another one: CHIRK, R excluded.

CHIZZ: not a word.

So, let's go with the four: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.

Now, to choose, we might pick CHILD because it's a common word and tests L and D.

If we guess CHILD and it's not correct, we get feedback:

- C: ✓ (position 1)
- H: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- L: ? 
- D: ?

If L is correct, then we know L is in position 4, and D might be in position 5 or not.

But if L is not in the word, then CHILL is eliminated, and CHILD is eliminated, so we have CHICK or CHIVY left.

Similarly, if D is not in the word, CHILD is eliminated.

But we can also choose a word that has letters from multiple possibilities.

But since we have to start with CHI, we cannot change the first three.

We must use CHI at the beginning.

So, we have to choose one of these.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has the same first three but different last two to test more letters.

But we are constrained to words starting with CHI.

So, I think we should guess CHILD.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters or something.

Another idea: we know the word is C H I _ _, so we can try to think of all 5-letter words starting with CHI and not containing excluded letters.

Excluded: A, E, R, N, P, S.

So, using the available letters, what words are there?

- With L: CHILD, CHILL, CHILI (but CHILI is C-H-I-L-I, which has two I's, and I is already at position 3, so if we have I at position 5, it's possible). But we haven't excluded I, so it could be.

CHILI: C H I L I

Is that a word? Yes, like the food.

And L and I are available.

Similarly, CHIRL not.

CHIZZ not.

CHIVY.

Also, CHIFF not.

CHIKO? Not common.

CHIMO: I found that ""chimo"" is an informal Canadian greeting, but it might not be in the word list.

Similarly, CHIRT not.

So, let's add CHILI to the list.

So possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, CHILI.

Now, CHILI has I at the end, which is a duplicate I.

We can test for that.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has letters that are in few words to reduce possibilities.

But let's just pick one.

I think CHILD is a good guess because it's very common.

If it's not, we get feedback on L and D.

So, I'll go with CHILD.

But in the feedback, if we get L correct and D wrong, then we know position 4 is L, and position 5 is not D, so it might be CHILL or CHILI.

Similarly, if L is wrong, then CHILL and CHILD are out, so CHICK or CHIVY.

If both wrong, then CHILD out, and we look at others.

But we have to make a guess.

Another word: CHIRP not.

CHIOT not.

I think CHILD is fine.

But let's see the previous feedback: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

We can also consider that the word might be ""CHIME"" but E is excluded, so no.

Or ""CHINE"", E and N excluded.

So, I think CHILD is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHILD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - This means:  
    - C is correct and in position 1.  
    - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: CHIPS** → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)  
  - This means:  
    - C is confirmed in position 1 (redundant with Guess 1).  
    - H is correct and in position 2.  
    - I is correct and in position 3.  
    - P and S are absent from the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **CHI** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are C, H, I respectively).  
- **Excluded letters**: A, E, R, N, P, S (cannot appear anywhere in the word).  
- **Remaining positions**: Only positions 4 and 5 are unknown.  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: Any letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.).  

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- The word structure is **C H I _ _**.
- We need to test plausible 5-letter words starting with ""CHI"" that avoid excluded letters. Common options include:  
  - **CHILD** (tests L and D)  
  - **CHILL** (tests L and L, but repeated letters are possible)  
  - **CHICK** (tests C and K; C could be a duplicate)  
  - **CHIVY** (tests V and Y)  
  - **CHILI** (tests L and I; I could be a duplicate)  
- **Strategy**:  
  - Prioritize **CHILD** because it is a high-frequency word and tests two new, distinct letters (L and D).  
  - If CHILD is incorrect, the feedback on L and D will significantly narrow the possibilities:  
    - If L is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILL or CHILI.  
    - If L is absent (x), it points to CHICK or CHIVY.  
    - If D is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILD.  
    - If D is absent (x), it eliminates CHILD.  
- This guess maximizes information gain with common letters and avoids wasting letters (e.g., no duplicates unless necessary).

However, let\'s think of words starting with C and without R, A, N, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- CLOUD: uses C, L, O, U, D -> but we don\'t know if these are in the word.\n- CHILL: has double L, which might not be ideal for information (since we get less information from repeated letters).\n- COULD: 5 letters? Actually, COULD is 5 letters: C, O, U, L, D. But note that we have to avoid R, A, N, E, which we are.\n\nBut we can also consider words that have common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried. The vowels we haven\'t tried are I, O, U (since A and E are out). We also haven\'t tried Y.\n\nLet\'s list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:\n- CLOUD: C, L, O, U, D\n- COULD: same as above? Actually, COULD is C, O, U, L, D -> same letters.\n- CHIPS: C, H, I, P, S\n- CIVIC: has two C\'s and two I\'s, but we already know the first letter is C, so the other C might be redundant? Also, we don\'t know if C appears again, but it\'s possible. However, we want to avoid repeated letters if possible for maximum information.\n- CURLY: but R is excluded, so no.\n- Since R is excluded, we cannot use any word with R.\n\nSo, we must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nAnother idea: ""COULD"" is 5 letters: C-O-U-L-D. But we can also try ""COILS"" or ""CHILL"", but let\'s pick one that has a good mix.\n\nAlternatively, ""CHIPS"" is a good candidate: C, H, I, P, S. All distinct and common letters.\n\nWe could also consider ""CLOMP"", but that might be less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""COULD"" is valid, but let\'s see the letters: C, O, U, L, D.\n\nWe might also consider ""BUMPY"" but it doesn\'t start with C.\n\nWe must start with C.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that has new letters and is common.\n\nI think ""CHIPS"" is a good choice because:\n- It starts with C.\n- It uses H, I, P, S which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n- All letters are distinct.\n\nAlternatively, ""CHOPS"" is similar but with O instead of I. But we don\'t know which vowel might be present. Since we have two vowels to test (I and O, and U), we might get more information by including one of them.\n\nBut note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We can test multiple vowels in subsequent guesses if needed.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CUBIC"" but has two C\'s. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C would be a repeat. But the feedback for the first C is already correct, so if we put a C in another position and it\'s not in the word, we get an \'x\', which is information. However, it might be better to use distinct letters.\n\nBut in this case, since we are avoiding R, A, N, E, and we have to start with C, we can try ""CHIPS"".\n\nLet me check if ""CHIPS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""CHIPS"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but for now, we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""CLOTH"" - C, L, O, T, H. Also good.\n\nBut I think ""CHIPS"" is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels. Since we have only tested E and A (which are out) and we haven\'t tested I, O, U, we might want to test one of them. ""CHIPS"" has I, which is a vowel.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLOPS"" (if it exists) but not common.\n\nI think ""CHIPS"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nSo, the next guess: CHIPS.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word must be 5 letters, without R, A, N, E, and starting with C.\n\nYes, CHIPS: C-H-I-P-S.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on H, I, P, S.\n\nIf we get a correct in position for any, that will help.

But we have to check if L and D are allowed. Yes, they are not in the excluded list.\n- CHIME: but E is excluded, so no.\n- CHINK: N is excluded, so no.\n- CHIRP: R and P are excluded, so no.\n- CHIVE: E is excluded, so no.\n- CHILL: double L, so C H I L L. But we don\'t know if L is in the word, and it has two L\'s. But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. So let\'s list possible words:\n\n- CHILD: L and D are available.\n- CHILL: L and L (so two L\'s) but we can use it, though it has repeated letters. But we are trying to find the secret word, so if it fits, it\'s okay.\n- CHICK: C is already in position 1, but we don\'t know if there is another C. However, C is not excluded because we only know the first C is present. But in the feedback, for ""CRANE"", C was correct, but that doesn\'t say anything about additional C\'s. Similarly, in ""CHIPS"", C was correct. But we haven\'t tested for duplicate C\'s. However, in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 1 and 5? Actually, ""CHICK"" is C-H-I-C-K. But we have C at position 1 and 4? Let\'s spell: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K. So we have two C\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two C\'s. Also, K is not excluded.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: A, E, R, N, P, S. So K is allowed.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don\'t have evidence for that yet.\n\nAnother word: CHIMP: but P is excluded, so no.\n\nCHIEF: E and F? But E is excluded.\n\nCHORD: but R is excluded.\n\nCHOSE: S and E are excluded.\n\nSo, let\'s list possible words that start with ""CHI"" and have the last two letters from the available set.\n\nAvailable letters: all except A, E, R, N, P, S.\n\nSo available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we already have C, H, I in the word, so they can appear again? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut for the last two positions, we need to choose from the available letters.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- CHILD: L, D\n- CHILL: L, L\n- CHICK: C, K\n- CHINK: but N is excluded, no.\n- CHIVE: E excluded, no.\n- CHIME: E excluded, no.\n- CHIEF: E excluded, no.\n- CHIRP: R and P excluded, no.\n- CHORD: R excluded, no.\n- CHOSE: S and E excluded, no.\n- CHUGS: U, G, S? S excluded, no.\n- CHUMP: U, M, P? P excluded, no.\n- CHAPT: A and P excluded, no.\n\nSo, what about CHILI? But that has I at the end, and we already have I at position 3. But ""CHILI"" is C-H-I-L-I. So positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I. But we have I at position 3 and 5. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don\'t know if the word has two I\'s. Also, L is available.\n\nBut in our case, the word must be 5 letters and start with CHI.\n\nAnother word: CHINA, but N and A excluded.\n\nCHINO, N and O? N excluded.\n\nCHIAS, A and S excluded.\n\nSo, let\'s think of less common words? Or did I miss some?\n\nWhat about CHIDE? D and E? E excluded.\n\nCHILE: E excluded.\n\nCHIMB? Not a word.\n\nCHIMP: P excluded.\n\nCHIRK: R and K? R excluded.\n\nCHIRM: R and M? R excluded.\n\nCHIRO: R and O? R excluded.\n\nCHIRT: R and T? R excluded.\n\nCHIVY: V and Y? But E is not in it? ""CHIVY"" is C-H-I-V-Y. V and Y are available. Is ""CHIVY"" a word? It means to tease or annoy, yes.\n\nSimilarly, CHIZZ? Not common.\n\nCHIBA? A excluded.\n\nSo possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, etc.\n\nBut we need to choose one that can give us information or directly solve.\n\nSince we know the first three are fixed, we can try to guess the last two.\n\nBut we have to make a full word.\n\nWe can choose ""CHILD"" as a guess.\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L and D.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""CHICK"" to test for C and K.\n\nBut note: in ""CHICK"", we have C at position 4. We don\'t know if there is another C. If we get a ✓ for the last C, that means there is a C at position 4. If we get a -, it means C is in the word but not at position 4, but we already have C at position 1, so it would be a duplicate. If x, then no duplicate C.\n\nSimilarly for K.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.\n\nSince we have only two positions left, we can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.\n\nBut the possible words are limited.\n\nList of possible words that start with ""CHI"" and avoid excluded letters:\n\n- CHILD: C H I L D\n- CHILL: C H I L L\n- CHICK: C H I C K\n- CHIVY: C H I V Y\n- CHIMO: C H I M O (if it\'s a word? I think ""chimo"" is not common, but it might be accepted in some dictionaries? Let\'s avoid for now)\n- CHIRL: R excluded, no.\n- CHIRT: R excluded, no.\n- CHIRU: R excluded, no.\n- CHIEF: E excluded, no.\n- CHIEL: E and L? E excluded.\n- CHIAO: A excluded.\n- CHIAS: A and S excluded.\n- CHIKS: K and S? S excluded, no.\n- CHIMP: P excluded, no.\n- CHINA: A and N excluded, no.\n- CHINE: E and N excluded, no.\n- CHINK: N and K? N excluded, no.\n- CHINS: N and S excluded, no.\n- CHIPS: we already tried, and P and S are out.\n- CHIVS: S excluded, and ""chivs"" is not common, and S is out.\n- CHIZZ: not a word.\n\nAnother one: CHIRP, but R and P out.\n\nWhat about CHIRO, but R out.\n\nCHIRU, R out.\n\nSo, I think the common ones are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.\n\nAlso, CHIFF: F and F? ""Chiff"" might not be a word. ""Chiff"" is not standard.\n\nCHIGO? Not common.\n\nCHOLA? But that doesn\'t start with CHI.\n\nWe need to stick to CHI at the beginning.\n\nAnother word: CHIDE, but E excluded.\n\nCHIME, E excluded.\n\nSo, let\'s consider CHILL or CHILD.\n\nBut there\'s also CHIRL, but R excluded.\n\nPerhaps CHIOT, but O and T? ""Chiot"" is not common; it might refer to something from Chios, but let\'s see.\n\nI think for practical purposes, we can consider:\n\n- CHILD\n- CHILL\n- CHICK\n- CHIVY\n\nNow, we need to choose one to guess.\n\nSince we have three possibilities (and maybe more), we can pick one that might be more common or that tests letters that are in multiple options.\n\nFor example, L appears in CHILD and CHILL, so if we guess a word with L, we can see if L is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, D is only in CHILD, V in CHIVY, C in CHICK, K in CHICK, etc.\n\nBut we can also consider that the word might not be any of these? Are there other words?\n\nWhat about CHIRO, but R excluded.\n\nCHIRM, R excluded.\n\nCHIFFON? Too long.\n\n5-letter words only.\n\nAnother one: CHIASM, but A and S excluded.\n\nCHITIN: T, I, N? N excluded, and it has I at position 3 and 4? ""CHITIN"" is C-H-I-T-I-N, 6 letters? No, 6 letters.\n\nCHITIN is 6 letters.\n\nCHITS: S and T? S excluded, and ""CHITS"" is C-H-I-T-S, but S excluded.\n\nCHIDE, E excluded.\n\nSo, I think the main candidates are CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.\n\nNow, we can also think of CHIMO, but I\'m not sure. Let\'s assume it\'s not.\n\nAnother one: CHIRK, R excluded.\n\nCHIZZ: not a word.\n\nSo, let\'s go with the four: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY.\n\nNow, to choose, we might pick CHILD because it\'s a common word and tests L and D.\n\nIf we guess CHILD and it\'s not correct, we get feedback:\n\n- C: ✓ (position 1)\n- H: ✓ (position 2)\n- I: ✓ (position 3)\n- L: ? \n- D: ?\n\nIf L is correct, then we know L is in position 4, and D might be in position 5 or not.\n\nBut if L is not in the word, then CHILL is eliminated, and CHILD is eliminated, so we have CHICK or CHIVY left.\n\nSimilarly, if D is not in the word, CHILD is eliminated.\n\nBut we can also choose a word that has letters from multiple possibilities.\n\nBut since we have to start with CHI, we cannot change the first three.\n\nWe must use CHI at the beginning.\n\nSo, we have to choose one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has the same first three but different last two to test more letters.\n\nBut we are constrained to words starting with CHI.\n\nSo, I think we should guess CHILD.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses more common letters or something.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word is C H I _ _, so we can try to think of all 5-letter words starting with CHI and not containing excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: A, E, R, N, P, S.\n\nSo, using the available letters, what words are there?\n\n- With L: CHILD, CHILL, CHILI (but CHILI is C-H-I-L-I, which has two I\'s, and I is already at position 3, so if we have I at position 5, it\'s possible). But we haven\'t excluded I, so it could be.\n\nCHILI: C H I L I\n\nIs that a word? Yes, like the food.\n\nAnd L and I are available.\n\nSimilarly, CHIRL not.\n\nCHIZZ not.\n\nCHIVY.\n\nAlso, CHIFF not.\n\nCHIKO? Not common.\n\nCHIMO: I found that ""chimo"" is an informal Canadian greeting, but it might not be in the word list.\n\nSimilarly, CHIRT not.\n\nSo, let\'s add CHILI to the list.\n\nSo possible words: CHILD, CHILL, CHICK, CHIVY, CHILI.\n\nNow, CHILI has I at the end, which is a duplicate I.\n\nWe can test for that.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might choose a word that has letters that are in few words to reduce possibilities.\n\nBut let\'s just pick one.\n\nI think CHILD is a good guess because it\'s very common.\n\nIf it\'s not, we get feedback on L and D.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with CHILD.\n\nBut in the feedback, if we get L correct and D wrong, then we know position 4 is L, and position 5 is not D, so it might be CHILL or CHILI.\n\nSimilarly, if L is wrong, then CHILL and CHILD are out, so CHICK or CHIVY.\n\nIf both wrong, then CHILD out, and we look at others.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAnother word: CHIRP not.\n\nCHIOT not.\n\nI think CHILD is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the previous feedback: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might be ""CHIME"" but E is excluded, so no.\n\nOr ""CHINE"", E and N excluded.\n\nSo, I think CHILD is a reasonable guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""CHILD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - This means:  \n    - C is correct and in position 1.  \n    - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: CHIPS** → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)  \n  - This means:  \n    - C is confirmed in position 1 (redundant with Guess 1).  \n    - H is correct and in position 2.  \n    - I is correct and in position 3.  \n    - P and S are absent from the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **CHI** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are C, H, I respectively).  \n- **Excluded letters**: A, E, R, N, P, S (cannot appear anywhere in the word).  \n- **Remaining positions**: Only positions 4 and 5 are unknown.  \n- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: Any letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, G, K, L, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.).  \n\n### Thought Process for Next Guess:\n- The word structure is **C H I _ _**.\n- We need to test plausible 5-letter words starting with ""CHI"" that avoid excluded letters. Common options include:  \n  - **CHILD** (tests L and D)  \n  - **CHILL** (tests L and L, but repeated letters are possible)  \n  - **CHICK** (tests C and K; C could be a duplicate)  \n  - **CHIVY** (tests V and Y)  \n  - **CHILI** (tests L and I; I could be a duplicate)  \n- **Strategy**:  \n  - Prioritize **CHILD** because it is a high-frequency word and tests two new, distinct letters (L and D).  \n  - If CHILD is incorrect, the feedback on L and D will significantly narrow the possibilities:  \n    - If L is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILL or CHILI.  \n    - If L is absent (x), it points to CHICK or CHIVY.  \n    - If D is correct (✓ or -), it supports CHILD.  \n    - If D is absent (x), it eliminates CHILD.  \n- This guess maximizes information gain with common letters and avoids wasting letters (e.g., no duplicates unless necessary).\n\n<guess>CHILD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 3: CHILD -> C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(x) D(x)

This tells us:
- C, H, I are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3 (as before).
- L is not in the word at all (x).
- D is not in the word at all (x).

Therefore, we now know:
- The word is C H I _ _ (positions 1,2,3 fixed).
- Additional excluded letters: L and D (added to the existing exclusions: A, E, R, N, P, S).

So the full set of excluded letters is: A, E, R, N, P, S, L, D.

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CHI"" (first three letters fixed) that does not contain any of the excluded letters and uses only available letters for positions 4 and 5.

Available letters: any letter not in {A, E, R, N, P, S, L, D}. This includes: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, we must consider that:
- C, H, I are already in the word, so duplicates are possible but not confirmed.

From prior guesses, we know:
- In ""CHIPS"", S and P were absent (excluded).
- In ""CHILD"", L and D were absent (excluded).

Now, we have to guess the last two letters.

Recall the possible words we considered earlier:
- CHILD (eliminated by feedback: L and D absent)
- CHILL (eliminated because L is absent)
- CHICK (C, H, I, C, K) — now we test if C and K are possible.
- CHIVY (C, H, I, V, Y) — V and Y are still available.

But note CHICK has a duplicate C. Since the first C is fixed, if we put C in position 4, it might be a duplicate. But C could appear again? We don't know yet.

Other possibilities? Earlier we considered CHILI, but that has L (excluded) and duplicate I.

CHILI is eliminated because L is excluded.

What about CHIVY? Still possible.

Are there other words starting with CHI without the excluded letters?

For example:
- CHIMB — not a common word.
- CHIMP — P excluded.
- CHINK — N excluded.
- CHIVE — E excluded.
- CHIRO — R excluded.

Look for words like:
- CHIVY (as above)
- CHICK (as above)
- CHIT? Too short.

5 letters: 
- CHIFF — F is available, but ""chiff"" might not be a word? Possibly not standard.
- CHIGO — G and O? ""Chigo"" is a word (a type of attendant in Japanese court), but not common. Let's consider it: C H I G O.
- CHIMO — M and O? ""Chimo"" is an informal greeting in Canada. Letters: C H I M O. M and O are available.

So possible words from our list:
- CHICK: C H I C K
- CHIVY: C H I V Y
- CHIMO: C H I M O
- CHIGO: C H I G O

We need to choose one.

Strategy: Since we have limited guesses, we want to test as many new letters as possible. CHIVY tests V and Y, both new. CHICK tests C (duplicate) and K. CHIMO tests M and O. CHIGO tests G and O.

Among these, CHIVY and CHIMO seem good because they introduce letters not tested before.

CHIVY uses V and Y, which are less common, but still possible.

Given the exclusions, let's list all plausible English words starting with ""CHI"" that avoid excluded letters:

- CHICK (C, K)
- CHIVY (V, Y)
- CHIMO (M, O)
- CHIGO (G, O)
- CHIFF (F, F) — doubtful, and duplicate F? ""Chiff"" is not commonly recognized.
- CHOWK? Not starting with CHI.
- CHIBS — B and S? S excluded.

Another one: CHIBA — A excluded.

CHIVVY? But that's 6 letters? ""Chivy"" is 5 letters (alternative spelling of chivy or chivvy), so ""CHIVY"" is valid.

Also: CHIR? Not 5.

So the main options are CHICK, CHIVY, CHIMO, CHIGO.

Now, we can choose CHIVY because it has distinct letters (V and Y) that haven't been tested, maximizing new information. CHIMO also tests M and O, which are common.

But note, O appears in CHIMO and CHIGO, so if we use a word with O, it might cover multiple possibilities.

But CHICK is also common.

To decide: if we guess CHIVY and it is wrong, we learn if V and Y are present. Similarly for others.

Since the word might be CHICK, which is common, or CHIVY less common, but let's pick one.

I think CHICK is a good candidate because:
- It tests for duplicate C: if we get a ✓ for the second C (position 4), that means duplicate C is present and correct. If not, we learn it's not.
- K is tested.

If we guess CHICK:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback on C at position 4 and K at position 5.

If the second C is not in the word (x), then duplicates are not present, and position 4 is not C. And if K is absent, then we try CHIMO or CHIGO.

Similarly, if C is correct at position 4, then the word is CHICK? But we have to see the feedback.

If C is correct at position 4, then it would be C H I C K, so if K is also correct, then it's CHICK and we win.

If C is correct but K is wrong, then position 4 is C but position 5 is not K, which might be another word? But words starting with CHIC? Like CHICO, but O at the end? ""CHICO"" is C H I C O, but then we have CHICO, which doesn't start with CHI? Wait, ""CHICO"" is C-H-I-C-O, so positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:C, 5:O. That's possible, but in our feedback, position 3 is I, so in ""CHICO"", position 3 is I, which matches. And O is not excluded.

Similarly, ""CHICS"" would have S, which is excluded.

So, if we guess CHICK and get C at position 4 correct but K wrong, then we know position 4 is C, position 5 is not K, and we might try CHICO next? But we haven't excluded O.

But O is still available.

Therefore, guessing CHICK can give us information about duplicate C and K.

If we guess CHIVY, we test V and Y.

Similarly, CHIMO tests M and O.

But I think CHICK is a common word, so I'll go with that.

Alternatively, we can notice that in the available letters, we have O, M, G, V, Y, K, etc.

But to choose, I will select CHICK.

So, the next guess is CHICK.

But let's confirm: CHICK: C H I C K.

We expect:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: C (we get feedback: ✓ if correct, x if not present, but since C is already in the word, a '-' might be confusing? But let's think about the rules.

The rules say:
- ✓ : letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- - : letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x : letter is not in the word.

So for position 4: if we put C and there is a C in the word but not at position 4, it would be '-'. But we already know there is a C at position 1, so if there is another C, it would be in addition to the first one. So if we put C at position 4 and it is correct, we get ✓. If there is another C somewhere else, putting C at position 4 would be ✓ if it matches, or if wrong position, '-'. But since the first C is fixed at position 1, position 4 might be another instance.

But in this case, we are testing position 4 specifically.

So, we can learn if position 4 is C and if K is in the word.

Therefore, I'll go with CHICK.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
     - C is correct and in position 1.
     - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.
   - **Guess 2: CHIPS → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)**  
     - H is correct and in position 2.
     - I is correct and in position 3.
     - P and S are absent.
   - **Guess 3: CHILD → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(x) D(x)**  
     - L and D are absent.
     - Confirms the first three letters are **C, H, I** (positions 1, 2, 3 fixed).
   
2. **Current Exclusions**:
   - Letters absent from the word: **R, A, N, E, P, S, L, D** (all marked ""x"" in feedback). These cannot appear anywhere.
   - Available letters: Any letter not excluded (e.g., **B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**). Duplicates of C, H, or I are possible but unconfirmed.

3. **Word Structure**:
   - The secret word is **C H I _ _**.
   - Only positions 4 and 5 are unknown.
   - Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""CHI"" that avoids excluded letters.

4. **Plausible Remaining Words**:
   - Based on word patterns and exclusions:
     - **CHICK**: Tests for a duplicate C and K.
     - **CHIVY**: Tests for V and Y.
     - **CHIMO**: Tests for M and O.
     - **CHIGO**: Tests for G and O.
   - **CHILL** and **CHILD** are eliminated (L and D absent).
   - Less common words (e.g., CHIFF, CHIRT) were considered but discarded due to validity concerns.

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize **CHICK** because:
     - It is a high-frequency English word.
     - Tests for **duplicate C** (in position 4) and **K** (in position 5), both new and untested letters.
     - Feedback will efficiently narrow possibilities:
       - If C is ✓ in position 4 and K is ✓, the word is solved (CHICK).
       - If C is ✓ but K is absent (x), options like **CHICO** (O untested) become candidates.
       - If C is absent (x) or misplaced (-), it eliminates duplicate C and shifts focus to **CHIVY**, **CHIMO**, or **CHIGO**.
     - Avoids rarer letters (V, Y in CHIVY) unless necessary, maximizing information from common consonants.

This tells us:
- C, H, I are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3 (as before).

Therefore, we now know:
- The word is C H I _ _ (positions 1,2,3 fixed).

But note CHICK has a duplicate C. Since the first C is fixed, if we put C in position 4, it might be a duplicate. But C could appear again? We don't know yet.

Other possibilities? Earlier we considered CHILI, but that has L (excluded) and duplicate I.

CHILI is eliminated because L is excluded.

What about CHIVY? Still possible.

Are there other words starting with CHI without the excluded letters?

For example:
- CHIMB — not a common word.
- CHIMP — P excluded.
- CHINK — N excluded.
- CHIVE — E excluded.
- CHIRO — R excluded.

Look for words like:

""CHICO"" is C H I C O, but then we have CHICO, which doesn't start with CHI? Wait, ""CHICO"" is C-H-I-C-O, so positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:C, 5:O. That's possible, but in our feedback, position 3 is I, so in ""CHICO"", position 3 is I, which matches. And O is not excluded.

Similarly, ""CHICS"" would have S, which is excluded.

So, if we guess CHICK and get C at position 4 correct but K wrong, then we know position 4 is C, position 5 is not K, and we might try CHICO next? But we haven't excluded O.

But O is still available.

Therefore, guessing CHICK can give us information about duplicate C and K.

- Position 4: C (we get feedback: ✓ if correct, x if not present, but since C is already in the word, a '-' might be confusing? But let's think about the rules.

- - : letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x : letter is not in the word.

So for position 4: if we put C and there is a C in the word but not at position 4, it would be '-'. But we already know there is a C at position 1, so if there is another C, it would be in addition to the first one. So if we put C at position 4 and it is correct, we get ✓. If there is another C somewhere else, putting C at position 4 would be ✓ if it matches, or if wrong position, '-'. But since the first C is fixed at position 1, position 4 might be another instance.

But in this case, we are testing position 4 specifically.

So, we can learn if position 4 is C and if K is in the word.

Therefore, I'll go with CHICK.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
     - C is correct and in position 1.
     - R, A, N, E are absent from the word.
   - **Guess 2: CHIPS → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(x)**  
     - H is correct and in position 2.
     - I is correct and in position 3.
     - P and S are absent.
   - **Guess 3: CHILD → C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(x) D(x)**  
     - L and D are absent.
     - Confirms the first three letters are **C, H, I** (positions 1, 2, 3 fixed).
   
2. **Current Exclusions**:
   - Letters absent from the word: **R, A, N, E, P, S, L, D** (all marked ""x"" in feedback). These cannot appear anywhere.
   - Available letters: Any letter not excluded (e.g., **B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**). Duplicates of C, H, or I are possible but unconfirmed.

3. **Word Structure**:
   - The secret word is **C H I _ _**.
   - Only positions 4 and 5 are unknown.
   - Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""CHI"" that avoids excluded letters.

4. **Plausible Remaining Words**:
   - Based on word patterns and exclusions:
     - **CHICK**: Tests for a duplicate C and K.
     - **CHIVY**: Tests for V and Y.
     - **CHIMO**: Tests for M and O.
     - **CHIGO**: Tests for G and O.
   - **CHILL** and **CHILD** are eliminated (L and D absent).
   - Less common words (e.g., CHIFF, CHIRT) were considered but discarded due to validity concerns.

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize **CHICK** because:
     - It is a high-frequency English word.
     - Tests for **duplicate C** (in position 4) and **K** (in position 5), both new and untested letters.
     - Feedback will efficiently narrow possibilities:
       - If C is ✓ in position 4 and K is ✓, the word is solved (CHICK).
       - If C is ✓ but K is absent (x), options like **CHICO** (O untested) become candidates.
       - If C is absent (x) or misplaced (-), it eliminates duplicate C and shifts focus to **CHIVY**, **CHIMO**, or **CHIGO**.
     - Avoids rarer letters (V, Y in CHIVY) unless necessary, maximizing information from common consonants.",Guess 4: CHICK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
