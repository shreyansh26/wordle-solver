We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3, index 2? Let's note: positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example, they showed the word as a sequence. Let me index: 
   c (index0) -> position 1? But in feedback, they wrote C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓). So for ""crane"":
   Position 1: C -> x
   Position 2: R -> x
   Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 3)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> ✓

 So the secret word has:
   - E at the fifth position.
   - The letter A is present, but not at position 3.

 Also, we know that C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (because E is fixed at position 5).
   - Must contain the letter A, but not at position 3 (index 2).
   - Must not contain C, R, or N.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 Example words: 
   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is at position 2 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not at position 3) and E at the end.
   - ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3. So that's invalid for this guess? Actually, we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word, but in our guess we can put A anywhere? Actually, we can, but we have to avoid putting A at position 3 because we know it's not there in the secret word? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test.

 However, note: we are allowed to guess any valid word. But to maximize information, we should avoid known absent letters and try to cover new letters.

 Let me list some words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N:

 Options:
   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for A? Actually, A is at position 2, which is fine. And we test S, A, U, T.
   - ""PLACE"": but has C -> not allowed (C is absent).
   - ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? That's the position we know A is not in the secret word. So if we put A at position 3, we know it will be marked as not correct, but we can still use it? However, it might be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3. So better to put A in a different position to see if it is at that position.

 But note: we don't know where A is, only that it is not at position 3. So we can try to put A in a new position to test.

 However, we have only 5 positions and we know position 5 is E. So A can be at position 1, 2, or 4.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me consider ""SAUTE"": 
   - It has S, A, U, T, E. 
   - We avoid C, R, N (good).
   - We test S, U, T (new) and A (which we know is present) and E (known).

 Another option: ""PASTE"" -> but has S, T, E, and A at position 2? But also has P. However, note that we don't know if P is in the word. But ""PASTE"" has an issue: it contains S and T, which are common. But also, we have to avoid R, C, N? ""PASTE"" does not have R, C, N. But wait, we have E at the end and A at position 2.

 However, we must note that the feedback for A was that it is present but not at position 3. So in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2, which is a position we haven't tested.

 But we also have the letter P and S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"": but S, L, A, T, E -> but L is new. However, we have A at position 3? That's the position we know A is not in the secret word. So we would be putting A in a position we know it's not. That might be inefficient because we know the feedback for A at position 3 will be '-'? Actually, no: the feedback for A in the secret word is that it is present, but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, the feedback will show that it is still not at position 3 (so we get a '-' again) but that doesn't give new information about other positions. So it's better to put A in a position we haven't ruled out.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""SLATE"" is not good because A is at position 3.

 Let me think of words with A at position 1, 2, or 4.

 Words with A at position 1: 
   - ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> ends with E, and has A at position 1. Also tests B, U, S.

 Words with A at position 2:
   - ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   - ""PLATE"": but A is at position 3? Actually, in ""PLATE"": P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> so A is at position 3, which we don't want. 
   - How about ""LATTE""? But ""LATTE"" has two T's and ends with E? Actually, ""LATTE"" is L, A, T, T, E -> but that's 5 letters? And A is at position 2. But we have two T's. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it might be handled specially. But we haven't encountered that.

 But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. So we can use words with duplicate letters? But to be safe, let's avoid for now if possible.

 Another word with A at position 4: 
   - ""OPALE""? Not common. 
   - ""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? Again, position 3.

 Actually, it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that end with E. Let me think: 
   - ""PHASE"": P, H, A, S, E -> A at position 3? 
   - ""GRACE"": has R and C -> not allowed.

 How about ""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> but has two E's? And A at position 3? Also, we have E at position 2, which we don't know about.

 But we know the secret word has E at the end, but we don't know if it has another E. So ""LEAVE"" is a valid word? Yes. But A is at position 3, which we want to avoid.

 So perhaps it's easier to try A at position 1 or 2.

 Let me choose between ""ABUSE"" and ""PASTE"".

 We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 ""ABUSE"": tests A (known to be present, but at a new position 1), B (new), U (new), S (new), E (known at position 5).

 ""PASTE"": tests P (new), A (known, at position 2), S (new), T (new), E (known).

 Both are good. But ""PASTE"" has the advantage that it tests two very common letters: S and T.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SAUTE"" as I thought earlier: S, A, U, T, E -> which tests S, A, U, T, E. This tests four new letters (S, U, T) and one known (A and E). And A is at position 2.

 So ""SAUTE"" is also a good candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N. All these words avoid them.

 Let me compare:

   ""ABUSE"": letters: A, B, U, S, E -> new letters: B, U, S.
   ""PASTE"": letters: P, A, S, T, E -> new letters: P, S, T.
   ""SAUTE"": letters: S, A, U, T, E -> new letters: S, U, T.

 The most common consonants in English are S, T, L, N (but N is out), R (out), so S and T are very common.

 Therefore, ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"" are better because they include S and T.

 Between ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"", which one? 
   - ""PASTE"" has P and S, T.
   - ""SAUTE"" has S, U, T.

 U is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than U.

 But we don't have a strong preference. Let me pick ""SAUTE"" because it has U which is a vowel and might be useful.

 However, note that we already have A and E, so the word might have other vowels? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes L, which is common. But we don't have L in any of these.

 How about ""SLATE""? But we cannot because A is at position 3. So that's out.

 Another word: ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> but A is at position 3? Same problem.

 So let's stick with ""SAUTE"".

 But wait, in ""SAUTE"", the A is at position 2. We know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about position 2. So we are testing position 2 for A.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at position 1 or 4). And if we get an 'x'? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 Similarly, we test S at position 1, U at position 3, T at position 4.

 This seems good.

 Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"" as the next guess.

 But note: we must ensure that ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. I believe it is (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat).

 So, second guess: ""SAUTE""

<guess>saute</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **absent** from the secret word.
- **A** is **present** but **not in position 3** (index 2).
- **E** is **correct and in position 5** (so the secret word ends with E).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E**.
- It must include **A** in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- It must avoid **C, R, N**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, U, L, P**) and test new positions for **A**.

Selected **""saute""** because:
- Ends with **E**.
- **A** is in position 2 (a new, untested position).
- Tests new common letters: **S** (position 1), **U** (position 3), **T** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of **A** and reveal if **S, U, T** are present.

<guess>saute</guess>",saute,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)

 - The secret word ends with E.

   Position 2: R -> x
   Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 3)
   Position 4: N -> x

 So the secret word has:
   - E at the fifth position.
   - The letter A is present, but not at position 3.

 Also, we know that C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (because E is fixed at position 5).
   - Must contain the letter A, but not at position 3 (index 2).
   - Must not contain C, R, or N.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 Example words:

   - We avoid C, R, N (good).
   - We test S, U, T (new) and A (which we know is present) and E (known).

 So perhaps it's easier to try A at position 1 or 2.

 Let me choose between ""ABUSE"" and ""PASTE"".

 We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 ""ABUSE"": tests A (known to be present, but at a new position 1), B (new), U (new), S (new), E (known at position 5).

 ""PASTE"": tests P (new), A (known, at position 2), S (new), T (new), E (known).

 So, second guess: ""SAUTE""

<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **absent** from the secret word.
- **A** is **present** but **not in position 3** (index 2).
- **E** is **correct and in position 5** (so the secret word ends with E).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E**.
- It must include **A** in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- It must avoid **C, R, N**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, U, L, P**) and test new positions for **A**.

Selected **""saute""** because:
- Ends with **E**.
- **A** is in position 2 (a new, untested position).
- Tests new common letters: **S** (position 1), **U** (position 3), **T** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,EAGLE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3, index 2? Let's note: positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example, they showed the word as a sequence. Let me index: 
   c (index0) -> position 1? But in feedback, they wrote C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓). So for ""crane"":
   Position 1: C -> x
   Position 2: R -> x
   Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 3)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> ✓

 So the secret word has:
   - E at the fifth position.
   - The letter A is present, but not at position 3.

 Also, we know that C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (because E is fixed at position 5).
   - Must contain the letter A, but not at position 3 (index 2).
   - Must not contain C, R, or N.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 Example words: 
   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is at position 2 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not at position 3) and E at the end.
   - ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3. So that's invalid for this guess? Actually, we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word, but in our guess we can put A anywhere? Actually, we can, but we have to avoid putting A at position 3 because we know it's not there in the secret word? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test.

 However, note: we are allowed to guess any valid word. But to maximize information, we should avoid known absent letters and try to cover new letters.

 Let me list some words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N:

 Options:
   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for A? Actually, A is at position 2, which is fine. And we test S, A, U, T.
   - ""PLACE"": but has C -> not allowed (C is absent).
   - ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? That's the position we know A is not in the secret word. So if we put A at position 3, we know it will be marked as not correct, but we can still use it? However, it might be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3. So better to put A in a different position to see if it is at that position.

 But note: we don't know where A is, only that it is not at position 3. So we can try to put A in a new position to test.

 However, we have only 5 positions and we know position 5 is E. So A can be at position 1, 2, or 4.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me consider ""SAUTE"": 
   - It has S, A, U, T, E. 
   - We avoid C, R, N (good).
   - We test S, U, T (new) and A (which we know is present) and E (known).

 Another option: ""PASTE"" -> but has S, T, E, and A at position 2? But also has P. However, note that we don't know if P is in the word. But ""PASTE"" has an issue: it contains S and T, which are common. But also, we have to avoid R, C, N? ""PASTE"" does not have R, C, N. But wait, we have E at the end and A at position 2.

 However, we must note that the feedback for A was that it is present but not at position 3. So in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2, which is a position we haven't tested.

 But we also have the letter P and S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"": but S, L, A, T, E -> but L is new. However, we have A at position 3? That's the position we know A is not in the secret word. So we would be putting A in a position we know it's not. That might be inefficient because we know the feedback for A at position 3 will be '-'? Actually, no: the feedback for A in the secret word is that it is present, but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, the feedback will show that it is still not at position 3 (so we get a '-' again) but that doesn't give new information about other positions. So it's better to put A in a position we haven't ruled out.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""SLATE"" is not good because A is at position 3.

 Let me think of words with A at position 1, 2, or 4.

 Words with A at position 1: 
   - ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> ends with E, and has A at position 1. Also tests B, U, S.

 Words with A at position 2:
   - ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   - ""PLATE"": but A is at position 3? Actually, in ""PLATE"": P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> so A is at position 3, which we don't want. 
   - How about ""LATTE""? But ""LATTE"" has two T's and ends with E? Actually, ""LATTE"" is L, A, T, T, E -> but that's 5 letters? And A is at position 2. But we have two T's. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it might be handled specially. But we haven't encountered that.

 But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. So we can use words with duplicate letters? But to be safe, let's avoid for now if possible.

 Another word with A at position 4: 
   - ""OPALE""? Not common. 
   - ""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? Again, position 3.

 Actually, it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that end with E. Let me think: 
   - ""PHASE"": P, H, A, S, E -> A at position 3? 
   - ""GRACE"": has R and C -> not allowed.

 How about ""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> but has two E's? And A at position 3? Also, we have E at position 2, which we don't know about.

 But we know the secret word has E at the end, but we don't know if it has another E. So ""LEAVE"" is a valid word? Yes. But A is at position 3, which we want to avoid.

 So perhaps it's easier to try A at position 1 or 2.

 Let me choose between ""ABUSE"" and ""PASTE"".

 We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 ""ABUSE"": tests A (known to be present, but at a new position 1), B (new), U (new), S (new), E (known at position 5).

 ""PASTE"": tests P (new), A (known, at position 2), S (new), T (new), E (known).

 Both are good. But ""PASTE"" has the advantage that it tests two very common letters: S and T.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SAUTE"" as I thought earlier: S, A, U, T, E -> which tests S, A, U, T, E. This tests four new letters (S, U, T) and one known (A and E). And A is at position 2.

 So ""SAUTE"" is also a good candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N. All these words avoid them.

 Let me compare:

   ""ABUSE"": letters: A, B, U, S, E -> new letters: B, U, S.
   ""PASTE"": letters: P, A, S, T, E -> new letters: P, S, T.
   ""SAUTE"": letters: S, A, U, T, E -> new letters: S, U, T.

 The most common consonants in English are S, T, L, N (but N is out), R (out), so S and T are very common.

 Therefore, ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"" are better because they include S and T.

 Between ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"", which one? 
   - ""PASTE"" has P and S, T.
   - ""SAUTE"" has S, U, T.

 U is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than U.

 But we don't have a strong preference. Let me pick ""SAUTE"" because it has U which is a vowel and might be useful.

 However, note that we already have A and E, so the word might have other vowels? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes L, which is common. But we don't have L in any of these.

 How about ""SLATE""? But we cannot because A is at position 3. So that's out.

 Another word: ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> but A is at position 3? Same problem.

 So let's stick with ""SAUTE"".

 But wait, in ""SAUTE"", the A is at position 2. We know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about position 2. So we are testing position 2 for A.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at position 1 or 4). And if we get an 'x'? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 Similarly, we test S at position 1, U at position 3, T at position 4.

 This seems good.

 Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"" as the next guess.

 But note: we must ensure that ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. I believe it is (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat).

 So, second guess: ""SAUTE""

- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [since in ""saute"", A is at position 2]
- U: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has E in position 5 and A in position 2.
   - Therefore, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E

2. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
   - So, we must avoid these letters.

3. We also know that A is in the word and in position 2 (from the second guess).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word must:
- Have A in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Avoid the letters C, R, N, S, U, T.
- We need to fill the first, third, and fourth positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

Available letters: We have to use letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

The pattern: _ A _ _ E

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not in the absent list.

Let's think of words that have the form ?A??E.

Examples:
- ""MAPLE"": M, A, P, L, E -> but we have to check the absent letters: M, P, L are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,U,T. So M, P, L are allowed. However, let's see the positions: 
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 3: P
  - Position 4: L
  - Position 5: E (fixed)
  This seems valid.

- ""DANCE"": but D, A, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.

- ""GABLE"": G, A, B, L, E -> G, B, L are not absent? So valid.

- ""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> but R is absent, so invalid.

- ""LATHE"": L, A, T, H, E -> but T is absent, so invalid.

- ""PAGE"": only 4 letters? We need 5. ""PAGED""? But that ends with D, not E? No, we need E at the end.

- ""MAIZE"": M, A, I, Z, E -> Z is less common, but valid? And I is a vowel.

- ""BAIZE"": B, A, I, Z, E -> similar.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We know the word must be of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We have to avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Let's list possible words:

- ""MAPLE"": letters M, P, L, E (and A). Tests M, P, L.
- ""GABLE"": G, B, L, E -> tests G, B, L.
- ""MAYBE"": M, A, Y, B, E -> tests M, Y, B.
- ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> but ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""WAVED"" is W,A,V,E,D -> so the last letter is D, not E. So invalid.
- ""WAVE"" is 4 letters.
- ""MAUVE"": but U is absent, so invalid.
- ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> ends with D, not E. Invalid.
- ""HARVE"": not a word.

Another one: ""ALIVE"": but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. So ""ALIVE"" is A,L,I,V,E -> pattern A _ _ _ E, but we need _ A _ _ E. So not matching.

""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E -> but no A? We must have A at position 2. So invalid.

We need the second letter to be A.

More words:
- ""DANCE"": invalid (C and N absent)
- ""FABLE"": F, A, B, L, E -> F is not absent? Absent are C,R,N,S,U,T. So F is allowed. Tests F, B, L.
- ""GAMED"": G, A, M, E, D -> ends with D? No, we need E at the end. So invalid.
- ""GAMME"": not a word? 
- ""GAFFE"": G, A, F, F, E -> has two F's. But F is allowed? And it ends with E. So ""GAFFE"" is a word? Yes, meaning an embarrassing mistake. Pattern: G A F F E -> so position 1: G, 2: A, 3: F, 4: F, 5: E. But we have duplicate F. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. So it's acceptable.

But we are trying to get information. With ""GAFFE"", we test G and F, but F appears twice. If we get feedback, it might be less informative because of the duplicate.

Similarly, ""MAPLE"" and ""GABLE"" are good.

Another word: ""MAYBE"" is M,A,Y,B,E -> so M at 1, A at 2, Y at 3, B at 4, E at 5. This tests M, Y, B.

""MAYBE"" is a valid word.

We also have ""BAYLE"" - not common.

""OAKED"" - not a word? We need E at the end.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> but N is absent, so invalid.

""PLAGE"": P, L, A, G, E -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So invalid.

So among the options, we have:
- ""MAPLE"": tests M, P, L
- ""GABLE"": tests G, B, L
- ""MAYBE"": tests M, Y, B
- ""FABLE"": tests F, B, L

We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance to hit present letters.

But we don't have much information about the remaining letters. So we should choose a word that covers a set of common letters.

Let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words (common ones): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

But we have already ruled out C, R, N, S, U, T. So the most common remaining are: L, P, M, D, G, B, F, etc.

We haven't tested L, P, M, D, G, B, F, Y, etc.

""MAPLE"" has M, P, L: which are three common letters.
""GABLE"" has G, B, L: G and B are less common than M and P? 
According to frequency: 
- L is high, M and P are medium, B and G are lower.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to include a vowel in the remaining positions? We have A and E already, but maybe there is another vowel? The word might have I or O.

For example, ""MAIZE"": M, A, I, Z, E -> but Z is very uncommon. But it tests I, which is a vowel.

""MAJOR"": but no E at the end.

""MAILE"": not common.

""PAIRE"": not a word.

""DAISE"": not common.

""HAIRE"": not common.

""RAILE"": not common.

""VAINE"": not common.

""ALIKE"": A at position 1? We need A at position 2.

""OPAHE"": not a word.

So perhaps ""MAPLE"" is a good choice because it's a common word and tests three new letters.

But note: we have to avoid T, and ""MAPLE"" does.

Another word: ""AMPLE"" -> A, M, P, L, E? But that has A at position 1, not 2. We need the second letter to be A. So ""AMPLE"" is A _ _ _ E, but we need _ A _ _ E. So not.

""MAPLE"" is M,A,P,L,E -> correct pattern.

Similarly, ""TABLE"": T,A,B,L,E -> but T is absent! So invalid.

So ""MAPLE"" seems good.

But let's check if M, P, L are allowed: yes, not in the absent list.

Therefore, I choose ""MAPLE"" as the third guess.

So, <guess>maple</guess>

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correct and in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C/R/N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: A is correct and in position 2, E is correct in position 5, and S/U/T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E` (A in position 2, E in position 5).
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, S, U, T**.
- Present letters: **A** (fixed in position 2) and **E** (fixed in position 5).
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Use a word that fits `_ A _ _ E` and avoids absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **M, P, L, B, G, D**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters to maximize feedback.

### Selected Guess: ""MAPLE""
- **M** in position 1 (tests a new common consonant).
- **A** in position 2 (confirmed correct).
- **P** in position 3 (tests a new common consonant).
- **L** in position 4 (tests a new common consonant).
- **E** in position 5 (confirmed correct).

This guess tests three new letters (M, P, L) and adheres to the known constraints. If any of these letters are present, their positions will be revealed, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>maple</guess>",maple,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [since in ""saute"", A is at position 2]
- U: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has E in position 5 and A in position 2.
   - Therefore, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E

2. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
   - So, we must avoid these letters.

3. We also know that A is in the word and in position 2 (from the second guess).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word must:

- ""BAIZE"": B, A, I, Z, E -> similar.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We know the word must be of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We have to avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Let's list possible words:

- ""MAPLE"": letters M, P, L, E (and A). Tests M, P, L.
- ""GABLE"": G, B, L, E -> tests G, B, L.
- ""MAYBE"": M, A, Y, B, E -> tests M, Y, B.

We need the second letter to be A.

More words:

Similarly, ""MAPLE"" and ""GABLE"" are good.

Another word: ""MAYBE"" is M,A,Y,B,E -> so M at 1, A at 2, Y at 3, B at 4, E at 5. This tests M, Y, B.

""MAYBE"" is a valid word.

We also have ""BAYLE"" - not common.

""OAKED"" - not a word? We need E at the end.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> but N is absent, so invalid.

""PLAGE"": P, L, A, G, E -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So invalid.

So among the options, we have:
- ""MAPLE"": tests M, P, L
- ""GABLE"": tests G, B, L
- ""MAYBE"": tests M, Y, B
- ""FABLE"": tests F, B, L

We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance to hit present letters.

But we don't have much information about the remaining letters. So we should choose a word that covers a set of common letters.

Let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words (common ones): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

But we have already ruled out C, R, N, S, U, T. So the most common remaining are: L, P, M, D, G, B, F, etc.

We haven't tested L, P, M, D, G, B, F, Y, etc.

""MAPLE"" has M, P, L: which are three common letters.
""GABLE"" has G, B, L: G and B are less common than M and P?

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3, index 2? Let's note: positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example, they showed the word as a sequence. Let me index: 
   c (index0) -> position 1? But in feedback, they wrote C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓). So for ""crane"":
   Position 1: C -> x
   Position 2: R -> x
   Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not at position 3)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> ✓

 So the secret word has:
   - E at the fifth position.
   - The letter A is present, but not at position 3.

 Also, we know that C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending with E (because E is fixed at position 5).
   - Must contain the letter A, but not at position 3 (index 2).
   - Must not contain C, R, or N.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 Example words: 
   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is at position 2 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not at position 3) and E at the end.
   - ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3. So that's invalid for this guess? Actually, we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word, but in our guess we can put A anywhere? Actually, we can, but we have to avoid putting A at position 3 because we know it's not there in the secret word? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test.

 However, note: we are allowed to guess any valid word. But to maximize information, we should avoid known absent letters and try to cover new letters.

 Let me list some words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N:

 Options:
   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for A? Actually, A is at position 2, which is fine. And we test S, A, U, T.
   - ""PLACE"": but has C -> not allowed (C is absent).
   - ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? That's the position we know A is not in the secret word. So if we put A at position 3, we know it will be marked as not correct, but we can still use it? However, it might be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3. So better to put A in a different position to see if it is at that position.

 But note: we don't know where A is, only that it is not at position 3. So we can try to put A in a new position to test.

 However, we have only 5 positions and we know position 5 is E. So A can be at position 1, 2, or 4.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me consider ""SAUTE"": 
   - It has S, A, U, T, E. 
   - We avoid C, R, N (good).
   - We test S, U, T (new) and A (which we know is present) and E (known).

 Another option: ""PASTE"" -> but has S, T, E, and A at position 2? But also has P. However, note that we don't know if P is in the word. But ""PASTE"" has an issue: it contains S and T, which are common. But also, we have to avoid R, C, N? ""PASTE"" does not have R, C, N. But wait, we have E at the end and A at position 2.

 However, we must note that the feedback for A was that it is present but not at position 3. So in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2, which is a position we haven't tested.

 But we also have the letter P and S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"": but S, L, A, T, E -> but L is new. However, we have A at position 3? That's the position we know A is not in the secret word. So we would be putting A in a position we know it's not. That might be inefficient because we know the feedback for A at position 3 will be '-'? Actually, no: the feedback for A in the secret word is that it is present, but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, the feedback will show that it is still not at position 3 (so we get a '-' again) but that doesn't give new information about other positions. So it's better to put A in a position we haven't ruled out.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""SLATE"" is not good because A is at position 3.

 Let me think of words with A at position 1, 2, or 4.

 Words with A at position 1: 
   - ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> ends with E, and has A at position 1. Also tests B, U, S.

 Words with A at position 2:
   - ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   - ""PLATE"": but A is at position 3? Actually, in ""PLATE"": P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> so A is at position 3, which we don't want. 
   - How about ""LATTE""? But ""LATTE"" has two T's and ends with E? Actually, ""LATTE"" is L, A, T, T, E -> but that's 5 letters? And A is at position 2. But we have two T's. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it might be handled specially. But we haven't encountered that.

 But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. So we can use words with duplicate letters? But to be safe, let's avoid for now if possible.

 Another word with A at position 4: 
   - ""OPALE""? Not common. 
   - ""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? Again, position 3.

 Actually, it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that end with E. Let me think: 
   - ""PHASE"": P, H, A, S, E -> A at position 3? 
   - ""GRACE"": has R and C -> not allowed.

 How about ""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> but has two E's? And A at position 3? Also, we have E at position 2, which we don't know about.

 But we know the secret word has E at the end, but we don't know if it has another E. So ""LEAVE"" is a valid word? Yes. But A is at position 3, which we want to avoid.

 So perhaps it's easier to try A at position 1 or 2.

 Let me choose between ""ABUSE"" and ""PASTE"".

 We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 ""ABUSE"": tests A (known to be present, but at a new position 1), B (new), U (new), S (new), E (known at position 5).

 ""PASTE"": tests P (new), A (known, at position 2), S (new), T (new), E (known).

 Both are good. But ""PASTE"" has the advantage that it tests two very common letters: S and T.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SAUTE"" as I thought earlier: S, A, U, T, E -> which tests S, A, U, T, E. This tests four new letters (S, U, T) and one known (A and E). And A is at position 2.

 So ""SAUTE"" is also a good candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N. All these words avoid them.

 Let me compare:

   ""ABUSE"": letters: A, B, U, S, E -> new letters: B, U, S.
   ""PASTE"": letters: P, A, S, T, E -> new letters: P, S, T.
   ""SAUTE"": letters: S, A, U, T, E -> new letters: S, U, T.

 The most common consonants in English are S, T, L, N (but N is out), R (out), so S and T are very common.

 Therefore, ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"" are better because they include S and T.

 Between ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"", which one? 
   - ""PASTE"" has P and S, T.
   - ""SAUTE"" has S, U, T.

 U is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than U.

 But we don't have a strong preference. Let me pick ""SAUTE"" because it has U which is a vowel and might be useful.

 However, note that we already have A and E, so the word might have other vowels? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes L, which is common. But we don't have L in any of these.

 How about ""SLATE""? But we cannot because A is at position 3. So that's out.

 Another word: ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> but A is at position 3? Same problem.

 So let's stick with ""SAUTE"".

 But wait, in ""SAUTE"", the A is at position 2. We know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about position 2. So we are testing position 2 for A.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at position 1 or 4). And if we get an 'x'? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 Similarly, we test S at position 1, U at position 3, T at position 4.

 This seems good.

 Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"" as the next guess.

 But note: we must ensure that ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. I believe it is (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat).

 So, second guess: ""SAUTE""

<guess>saute</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **absent** from the secret word.
- **A** is **present** but **not in position 3** (index 2).
- **E** is **correct and in position 5** (so the secret word ends with E).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E**.
- It must include **A** in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- It must avoid **C, R, N**.
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, U, L, P**) and test new positions for **A**.

Selected **""saute""** because:
- Ends with **E**.
- **A** is in position 2 (a new, untested position).
- Tests new common letters: **S** (position 1), **U** (position 3), **T** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of **A** and reveal if **S, U, T** are present.

<guess>saute</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [since in ""saute"", A is at position 2]
- U: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has E in position 5 and A in position 2.
   - Therefore, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E

2. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
   - So, we must avoid these letters.

3. We also know that A is in the word and in position 2 (from the second guess).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word must:
- Have A in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Avoid the letters C, R, N, S, U, T.
- We need to fill the first, third, and fourth positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

Available letters: We have to use letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

The pattern: _ A _ _ E

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not in the absent list.

Let's think of words that have the form ?A??E.

Examples:
- ""MAPLE"": M, A, P, L, E -> but we have to check the absent letters: M, P, L are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,U,T. So M, P, L are allowed. However, let's see the positions: 
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 3: P
  - Position 4: L
  - Position 5: E (fixed)
  This seems valid.

- ""DANCE"": but D, A, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.

- ""GABLE"": G, A, B, L, E -> G, B, L are not absent? So valid.

- ""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> but R is absent, so invalid.

- ""LATHE"": L, A, T, H, E -> but T is absent, so invalid.

- ""PAGE"": only 4 letters? We need 5. ""PAGED""? But that ends with D, not E? No, we need E at the end.

- ""MAIZE"": M, A, I, Z, E -> Z is less common, but valid? And I is a vowel.

- ""BAIZE"": B, A, I, Z, E -> similar.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 4.

We know the word must be of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We have to avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Let's list possible words:

- ""MAPLE"": letters M, P, L, E (and A). Tests M, P, L.
- ""GABLE"": G, B, L, E -> tests G, B, L.
- ""MAYBE"": M, A, Y, B, E -> tests M, Y, B.
- ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> but ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""WAVED"" is W,A,V,E,D -> so the last letter is D, not E. So invalid.
- ""WAVE"" is 4 letters.
- ""MAUVE"": but U is absent, so invalid.
- ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> ends with D, not E. Invalid.
- ""HARVE"": not a word.

Another one: ""ALIVE"": but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. So ""ALIVE"" is A,L,I,V,E -> pattern A _ _ _ E, but we need _ A _ _ E. So not matching.

""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E -> but no A? We must have A at position 2. So invalid.

We need the second letter to be A.

More words:
- ""DANCE"": invalid (C and N absent)
- ""FABLE"": F, A, B, L, E -> F is not absent? Absent are C,R,N,S,U,T. So F is allowed. Tests F, B, L.
- ""GAMED"": G, A, M, E, D -> ends with D? No, we need E at the end. So invalid.
- ""GAMME"": not a word? 
- ""GAFFE"": G, A, F, F, E -> has two F's. But F is allowed? And it ends with E. So ""GAFFE"" is a word? Yes, meaning an embarrassing mistake. Pattern: G A F F E -> so position 1: G, 2: A, 3: F, 4: F, 5: E. But we have duplicate F. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. So it's acceptable.

But we are trying to get information. With ""GAFFE"", we test G and F, but F appears twice. If we get feedback, it might be less informative because of the duplicate.

Similarly, ""MAPLE"" and ""GABLE"" are good.

Another word: ""MAYBE"" is M,A,Y,B,E -> so M at 1, A at 2, Y at 3, B at 4, E at 5. This tests M, Y, B.

""MAYBE"" is a valid word.

We also have ""BAYLE"" - not common.

""OAKED"" - not a word? We need E at the end.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> but N is absent, so invalid.

""PLAGE"": P, L, A, G, E -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So invalid.

So among the options, we have:
- ""MAPLE"": tests M, P, L
- ""GABLE"": tests G, B, L
- ""MAYBE"": tests M, Y, B
- ""FABLE"": tests F, B, L

We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance to hit present letters.

But we don't have much information about the remaining letters. So we should choose a word that covers a set of common letters.

Let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words (common ones): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

But we have already ruled out C, R, N, S, U, T. So the most common remaining are: L, P, M, D, G, B, F, etc.

We haven't tested L, P, M, D, G, B, F, Y, etc.

""MAPLE"" has M, P, L: which are three common letters.
""GABLE"" has G, B, L: G and B are less common than M and P? 
According to frequency: 
- L is high, M and P are medium, B and G are lower.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to include a vowel in the remaining positions? We have A and E already, but maybe there is another vowel? The word might have I or O.

For example, ""MAIZE"": M, A, I, Z, E -> but Z is very uncommon. But it tests I, which is a vowel.

""MAJOR"": but no E at the end.

""MAILE"": not common.

""PAIRE"": not a word.

""DAISE"": not common.

""HAIRE"": not common.

""RAILE"": not common.

""VAINE"": not common.

""ALIKE"": A at position 1? We need A at position 2.

""OPAHE"": not a word.

So perhaps ""MAPLE"" is a good choice because it's a common word and tests three new letters.

But note: we have to avoid T, and ""MAPLE"" does.

Another word: ""AMPLE"" -> A, M, P, L, E? But that has A at position 1, not 2. We need the second letter to be A. So ""AMPLE"" is A _ _ _ E, but we need _ A _ _ E. So not.

""MAPLE"" is M,A,P,L,E -> correct pattern.

Similarly, ""TABLE"": T,A,B,L,E -> but T is absent! So invalid.

So ""MAPLE"" seems good.

But let's check if M, P, L are allowed: yes, not in the absent list.

Therefore, I choose ""MAPLE"" as the third guess.

So, <guess>maple</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correct and in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C/R/N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: A is correct and in position 2, E is correct in position 5, and S/U/T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E` (A in position 2, E in position 5).
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, S, U, T**.
- Present letters: **A** (fixed in position 2) and **E** (fixed in position 5).
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Use a word that fits `_ A _ _ E` and avoids absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **M, P, L, B, G, D**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters to maximize feedback.

### Selected Guess: ""MAPLE""
- **M** in position 1 (tests a new common consonant).
- **A** in position 2 (confirmed correct).
- **P** in position 3 (tests a new common consonant).
- **L** in position 4 (tests a new common consonant).
- **E** in position 5 (confirmed correct).

This guess tests three new letters (M, P, L) and adheres to the known constraints. If any of these letters are present, their positions will be revealed, bringing us closer to the solution.

But we cannot have A at position 3. So that\'s invalid for this guess? Actually, we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word, but in our guess we can put A anywhere? Actually, we can, but we have to avoid putting A at position 3 because we know it\'s not there in the secret word? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to guess any valid word. But to maximize information, we should avoid known absent letters and try to cover new letters.\n\n Let me list some words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N:\n\n Options:\n   - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for A? Actually, A is at position 2, which is fine. And we test S, A, U, T.\n   - ""PLACE"": but has C -> not allowed (C is absent).\n   - ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? That\'s the position we know A is not in the secret word. So if we put A at position 3, we know it will be marked as not correct, but we can still use it? However, it might be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3. So better to put A in a different position to see if it is at that position.\n\n But note: we don\'t know where A is, only that it is not at position 3. So we can try to put A in a new position to test.\n\n However, we have only 5 positions and we know position 5 is E. So A can be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me consider ""SAUTE"": \n   - It has S, A, U, T, E. \n   - We avoid C, R, N (good).\n   - We test S, U, T (new) and A (which we know is present) and E (known).\n\n Another option: ""PASTE"" -> but has S, T, E, and A at position 2? But also has P. However, note that we don\'t know if P is in the word. But ""PASTE"" has an issue: it contains S and T, which are common. But also, we have to avoid R, C, N? ""PASTE"" does not have R, C, N. But wait, we have E at the end and A at position 2.\n\n However, we must note that the feedback for A was that it is present but not at position 3. So in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2, which is a position we haven\'t tested.\n\n But we also have the letter P and S and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"": but S, L, A, T, E -> but L is new. However, we have A at position 3? That\'s the position we know A is not in the secret word. So we would be putting A in a position we know it\'s not. That might be inefficient because we know the feedback for A at position 3 will be \'-\'? Actually, no: the feedback for A in the secret word is that it is present, but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 in a new guess, the feedback will show that it is still not at position 3 (so we get a \'-\' again) but that doesn\'t give new information about other positions. So it\'s better to put A in a position we haven\'t ruled out.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So ""SLATE"" is not good because A is at position 3.\n\n Let me think of words with A at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\n Words with A at position 1: \n   - ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> ends with E, and has A at position 1. Also tests B, U, S.\n\n Words with A at position 2:\n   - ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at position 2.\n\n Words with A at position 4:\n   - ""PLATE"": but A is at position 3? Actually, in ""PLATE"": P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> so A is at position 3, which we don\'t want. \n   - How about ""LATTE""? But ""LATTE"" has two T\'s and ends with E? Actually, ""LATTE"" is L, A, T, T, E -> but that\'s 5 letters? And A is at position 2. But we have two T\'s. Also, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it might be handled specially. But we haven\'t encountered that.\n\n But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. So we can use words with duplicate letters? But to be safe, let\'s avoid for now if possible.\n\n Another word with A at position 4: \n   - ""OPALE""? Not common. \n   - ""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? Again, position 3.\n\n Actually, it\'s hard to find words with A at position 4 that end with E. Let me think: \n   - ""PHASE"": P, H, A, S, E -> A at position 3? \n   - ""GRACE"": has R and C -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> but has two E\'s? And A at position 3? Also, we have E at position 2, which we don\'t know about.\n\n But we know the secret word has E at the end, but we don\'t know if it has another E. So ""LEAVE"" is a valid word? Yes. But A is at position 3, which we want to avoid.\n\n So perhaps it\'s easier to try A at position 1 or 2.\n\n Let me choose between ""ABUSE"" and ""PASTE"".\n\n We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n ""ABUSE"": tests A (known to be present, but at a new position 1), B (new), U (new), S (new), E (known at position 5).\n\n ""PASTE"": tests P (new), A (known, at position 2), S (new), T (new), E (known).\n\n Both are good. But ""PASTE"" has the advantage that it tests two very common letters: S and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SAUTE"" as I thought earlier: S, A, U, T, E -> which tests S, A, U, T, E. This tests four new letters (S, U, T) and one known (A and E). And A is at position 2.\n\n So ""SAUTE"" is also a good candidate.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N. All these words avoid them.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n   ""ABUSE"": letters: A, B, U, S, E -> new letters: B, U, S.\n   ""PASTE"": letters: P, A, S, T, E -> new letters: P, S, T.\n   ""SAUTE"": letters: S, A, U, T, E -> new letters: S, U, T.\n\n The most common consonants in English are S, T, L, N (but N is out), R (out), so S and T are very common.\n\n Therefore, ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"" are better because they include S and T.\n\n Between ""PASTE"" and ""SAUTE"", which one? \n   - ""PASTE"" has P and S, T.\n   - ""SAUTE"" has S, U, T.\n\n U is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than U.\n\n But we don\'t have a strong preference. Let me pick ""SAUTE"" because it has U which is a vowel and might be useful.\n\n However, note that we already have A and E, so the word might have other vowels? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that includes L, which is common. But we don\'t have L in any of these.\n\n How about ""SLATE""? But we cannot because A is at position 3. So that\'s out.\n\n Another word: ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> but A is at position 3? Same problem.\n\n So let\'s stick with ""SAUTE"".\n\n But wait, in ""SAUTE"", the A is at position 2. We know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don\'t know about position 2. So we are testing position 2 for A.\n\n If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is at position 2. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at position 1 or 4). And if we get an \'x\'? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we expect either ✓ or \'-\'.\n\n Similarly, we test S at position 1, U at position 3, T at position 4.\n\n This seems good.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"" as the next guess.\n\n But note: we must ensure that ""SAUTE"" is a valid word.

Invalid.\n- ""HARVE"": not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""ALIVE"": but A is at position 1? We need A at position 2. So ""ALIVE"" is A,L,I,V,E -> pattern A _ _ _ E, but we need _ A _ _ E. So not matching.\n\n""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E -> but no A? We must have A at position 2. So invalid.\n\nWe need the second letter to be A.\n\nMore words:\n- ""DANCE"": invalid (C and N absent)\n- ""FABLE"": F, A, B, L, E -> F is not absent? Absent are C,R,N,S,U,T. So F is allowed. Tests F, B, L.\n- ""GAMED"": G, A, M, E, D -> ends with D? No, we need E at the end. So invalid.\n- ""GAMME"": not a word? \n- ""GAFFE"": G, A, F, F, E -> has two F\'s. But F is allowed?

We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. So it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. With ""GAFFE"", we test G and F, but F appears twice. If we get feedback, it might be less informative because of the duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, ""MAPLE"" and ""GABLE"" are good.\n\nAnother word: ""MAYBE"" is M,A,Y,B,E -> so M at 1, A at 2, Y at 3, B at 4, E at 5. This tests M, Y, B.\n\n""MAYBE"" is a valid word.\n\nWe also have ""BAYLE"" - not common.\n\n""OAKED"" - not a word? We need E at the end.\n\n""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> but N is absent, so invalid.\n\n""PLAGE"": P, L, A, G, E -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2.

So we should choose a word that covers a set of common letters.\n\nLet\'s see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words (common ones): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.\n\nBut we have already ruled out C, R, N, S, U, T. So the most common remaining are: L, P, M, D, G, B, F, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested L, P, M, D, G, B, F, Y, etc.\n\n""MAPLE"" has M, P, L: which are three common letters.\n""GABLE"" has G, B, L: G and B are less common than M and P? \nAccording to frequency: \n- L is high, M and P are medium, B and G are lower.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to include a vowel in the remaining positions? We have A and E already, but maybe there is another vowel? The word might have I or O.\n\nFor example, ""MAIZE"": M, A, I, Z, E -> but Z is very uncommon. But it tests I, which is a vowel.\n\n""MAJOR"": but no E at the end.\n\n""MAILE"": not common.\n\n""PAIRE"": not a word.\n\n""DAISE"": not common.\n\n""HAIRE"": not common.\n\n""RAILE"": not common.\n\n""VAINE"": not common.\n\n""ALIKE"": A at position 1? We need A at position 2.\n\n""OPAHE"": not a word.\n\nSo perhaps ""MAPLE"" is a good choice because it\'s a common word and tests three new letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T, and ""MAPLE"" does.\n\nAnother word: ""AMPLE"" -> A, M, P, L, E? But that has A at position 1, not 2. We need the second letter to be A. So ""AMPLE"" is A _ _ _ E, but we need _ A _ _ E. So not.\n\n""MAPLE"" is M,A,P,L,E -> correct pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""TABLE"": T,A,B,L,E -> but T is absent! So invalid.\n\nSo ""MAPLE"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s check if M, P, L are allowed: yes, not in the absent list.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""MAPLE"" as the third guess.\n\nSo, <guess>maple</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correct and in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C/R/N are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (saute)**: A is correct and in position 2, E is correct in position 5, and S/U/T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E` (A in position 2, E in position 5).\n- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, S, U, T**.\n- Present letters: **A** (fixed in position 2) and **E** (fixed in position 5).\n- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 4.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Use a word that fits `_ A _ _ E` and avoids absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **M, P, L, B, G, D**) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters to maximize feedback.\n\n### Selected Guess: ""MAPLE""\n- **M** in position 1 (tests a new common consonant).\n- **A** in position 2 (confirmed correct).\n- **P** in position 3 (tests a new common consonant).\n- **L** in position 4 (tests a new common consonant).\n- **E** in position 5 (confirmed correct).\n\nThis guess tests three new letters (M, P, L) and adheres to the known constraints.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: absent
- A: present but wrong position (not position 3)
- N: absent
- E: correct and in position 5

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: absent
- A: correct and in position 2
- U: absent
- T: absent
- E: correct and in position 5

Guess 3: ""maple""
- M: absent
- A: correct and in position 2
- P: absent
- L: correct and in position 4 (since it's marked correct, and in ""maple"", L is at position 4)
- E: correct and in position 5

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 5: E

   So the pattern is: _ A _ L E

2. We also know that the letter A is in the word and in position 2 (so the previous feedback about A being present but not in position 3 is consistent).

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P

   So the absent letters are: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P.

4. We know that the secret word must have one more letter in position 1 and one in position 3.

   Also, from the first guess, we know that A was present but not in position 3, which is now satisfied because A is fixed at position 2.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ L E and does not use any of the absent letters.

The available letters are those not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P.

So available letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A, L, E are already in the word, but we are missing positions 1 and 3. Also, the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far, but it's possible.

However, since we have three positions fixed (2,4,5) and two unknown (1 and 3), and we know the word must be 5 letters.

We can list possible words that match _ A _ L E.

Common words with this pattern:

- ""BALLE"" is not an English word.
- ""DALE"" is 4 letters.
- ""GALE"": G A _ L E -> but we need a letter in position 3? ""GALE"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Actually, the pattern is: position1: ?, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: L, position5: E.

So the word must be: ?A?LE

Possible words:

- ""TABLE"": but T is absent, and also A is at position 2? ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T is absent, so invalid.
- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> this fits. And G and B are not absent? Absent: C,R,N,S,U,T,M,P. So G and B are allowed.
- ""HABLE"": not a word.
- ""SABLE"": but S is absent.
- ""CABLE"": C is absent.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> F and B are allowed? F is not in absent list. So valid.
- ""MABLE"": not a word.
- ""RABLE"": R is absent.
- ""WABLE"": not common, but ""wable"" is not a word? 
- ""VABLE"": not a word.

Other options:

- ""BAYLE"": not common.
- ""DAILE"": not a word.
- ""GAFFE"": but that ends with E, but pattern is ?A?LE? No, we need L at position 4 and E at 5, so ?A?LE.

Another word: ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> but this has E at position 1 and 5, and G at position 3. Pattern: E A G L E. This fits ?A?LE? Actually, position1: E, position2: A, position3: G, position4: L, position5: E. So yes, ""EAGLE"".

And E is already known to be at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. Also, G is allowed (not absent).

But note: we have E at position 5, and if we put E at position 1, that's allowed? Yes, because the secret word might have duplicate E.

Similarly, ""BELLE"": B E L L E -> but this has E at position 2? No, position2 is A, fixed. So not.

""IDLE"": too short.

""OAKLE"": not a word.

""PAGLE"": not a word.

""RAGLE"": not a word.

So the common words I can think of are: ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

But we also have ""HALLE"": but that's a proper noun? Or ""halve"" is not matching.

""VALLE"": not common.

""WALLE"": like Wall-E? Not a common word.

So let's consider:

- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> tests G and B.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> tests F and B.
- ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> tests E at position 1 and G at position 3.

We need to choose one that maximizes information. But note, we have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.

But we want to get the word if possible, or at least narrow down.

We know the pattern is _ A _ L E, and we have two positions to fill.

We can also consider if there are other words. What about ""AXLE""? A X L E -> but that's 4 letters? ""AXLE"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""AXLES"" is 5 but ends with S, not E.

""ANKLE"": A N K L E -> but N is absent.

""APPLE"": A P P L E -> but P is absent.

""AMPLE"": A M P L E -> M and P absent.

So back to the three: ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, which one to choose?

We can think about the feedback from the first guess: A was present but not in position 3. That is already satisfied because A is at position 2.

We don't have any other constraints.

But note: in ""EAGLE"", we are putting E at position 1. We know E is in the word at position 5, but we don't know if it is at position 1. If we guess ""EAGLE"", and if the secret word does not have E at position 1, then we might get feedback that E is present but wrong position? But we already have E at position 5, so if there is another E, it would be marked accordingly.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate E.

Similarly, for ""GABLE"" and ""FABLE"", they don't have duplicate letters.

To get more information, we might prefer a word that doesn't reuse E, so that we can test two new letters.

But we are running out of guesses, so we might want to guess a word that could be the answer.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

Possible letters for position 1: any except absent (C,R,N,S,U,T,M,P) and also not A,L,E (but they can be duplicated? We don't know). But since we have no duplicate indication, we should consider the possibility.

But to be safe, we can assume no duplicates until we have evidence. However, we don't have evidence against duplicates.

But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a duplicate, so maybe the word has no duplicates.

But let's not assume.

Available letters for position 1: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (but A, E, L are already in the word, so if we avoid duplicates, we wouldn't use them again, but we don't have to).

Similarly for position 3.

But to maximize the chance of being correct, we should consider common words.

Common words: 
- ""GABLE"": a triangular part of a wall.
- ""FABLE"": a short story.
- ""EAGLE"": a bird.

Also, ""HABLE"" is not a word, but ""HALLE"" is not English.

Another one: ""BAYLE"" is obsolete.

""KALLE"" not a word.

""GAZLE"" not a word.

So the only common words are ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, we have to choose one.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and A was present but not in position 3. That doesn't give more information now.

We also have the feedback that in ""maple"", L was correct at position 4, and A at 2, E at 5, and M and P absent.

So no new information about position 1 and 3.

We need to test one of these.

But we have three options, and we can only guess one.

If we guess ""EAGLE"", and it's not correct, we might learn about E at position 1 and G at position 3.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"", we learn about G and B.

But we are on the fourth guess, and we have two more after this.

But to be efficient, we might want to guess a word that covers more possibilities.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses letters that are more common to increase the chance of being correct.

Letter frequency: in English, the most common letters left are D, G, B, F, etc.

But in the context of the pattern ?A?LE, the common words are the ones we have.

We can also consider ""DIALE"" not a word.

""GAFFE"" is G A F F E, which is G at 1, A at 2, F at 3, F at 4, E at 5. But we need L at position 4, not F. So ""GAFFE"" has F at position 4, but we need L at position 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

Similarly, ""GAMME"" not a word.

So I think the only reasonable options are ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, let's look at the feedback from the second guess: ""saute"" had A correct at position 2 and E at 5, and S,U,T absent. No information about position 1 and 3.

Perhaps we can look for a word that tests two new letters that are common.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we know that the secret word has at least three distinct letters: A, L, E, and two more.

We can try to guess ""EAGLE"" because it uses a vowel in position 3 (G is not a vowel, but E at position 1 is a vowel).

But let's count the possibilities. There are not many words, so we can list them all.

Possible words:

- With no duplicates: 
  - ""GABLE"": G at 1, B at 3
  - ""FABLE"": F at 1, B at 3
  - ""EAGLE"": E at 1, G at 3
  - ""BAYLE"": B at 1, Y at 3 (if we consider it, but not common)
  - ""WALLE"": not common
  - ""HALLE"": not common
  - ""YELPE"": Y at 1, P at 3? But P is absent. Invalid.

With duplicates:
  - If we allow duplicate E, then ""EAGLE"" is one.
  - Also, ""EAGLE"" has two E's, which is allowed.
  - What about ""DEALE""? Not a word.
  - ""HEALE"": not common.
  - ""LEALE"": not a word.

So practically, the only common words are ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, to decide, we can consider that ""EAGLE"" has the advantage that if the secret word is ""EAGLE"", we win. If not, we get feedback on E at position 1 and G at position 3.

Similarly for the others.

But we have no information to favor one over the other.

Perhaps we can look at the first guess: the word ""crane"" had A in it, and we now know A is at position 2. But no other constraints.

Another thought: in the first guess, when we guessed ""crane"", the A was marked as present but not at position 3. That means that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, which is consistent with our pattern because position 3 is not A in any of our candidates.

So no help.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has a letter that is more common in position 1 or 3.

But I think it's arbitrary.

Since we have three possibilities, and we have to guess one, I'll go with ""EAGLE"" because it's a very common word.

But let's see the feedback we would get if the word is not ""EAGLE"".

For example, if the secret word is ""GABLE"", and we guess ""EAGLE"", the feedback would be:
- E at position 1: since ""GABLE"" has no E at position 1, but has E at position 5, so E is present but not at position 1? But we already know E is at position 5, so the feedback for position 1 E might be '-' if there is another E, but ""GABLE"" has only one E at position 5, so E at position 1 in ""EAGLE"" would be absent? No.

Let's simulate:

Secret word: ""GABLE"" (G,A,B,L,E)
Guess: ""EAGLE"" (E,A,G,L,E)

Feedback:
- Position 1: E -> in ""GABLE"", there is no E at position 1, but there is an E at position 5. Since it's the same letter, and it's already used at position 5, but in Wordle rules, if there is only one E in the secret word, then the extra E in guess would be marked absent. But ""GABLE"" has only one E, so:
  - E at position 1: not in the word? But there is an E at position 5, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first E might be marked as present (if not in position) and the second as correct, but if the secret has only one, then one of the E's in the guess will be marked as present (if in wrong position) or correct, and the other as absent.

Specifically for ""EAGLE"" vs ""GABLE"":
- Position 1: E -> secret has E only at position 5, so this E is present but not at position 1? But it's the same letter, so it should be marked as present (yellow) because there is an E in the word, but not at this position.
- Position 2: A -> correct (green)
- Position 3: G -> in secret, G is at position 1, so present but not at position 3 (yellow)
- Position 4: L -> correct (green)
- Position 5: E -> correct (green)

So feedback: E(-), A(✓), G(-), L(✓), E(✓)

But this would tell us that G is present but not at position 3, and E is present but not at position 1.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"" and the secret is ""EAGLE"", then:
- G at position 1: in secret, G is at position 3, so present but not at position 1 (yellow)
- A at position 2: correct
- B at position 3: absent (since secret has G at 3, not B)
- L at position 4: correct
- E at position 5: correct

Feedback: G(-), A(✓), B(x), L(✓), E(✓)

So we would know B is absent.

In either case, we get information.

But if we guess ""EAGLE"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get information about E and G.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"" and it's not correct, we get information about G and B.

But we have only two more guesses, so it's okay.

Since ""EAGLE"" is a common word, I'll go with that.

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple possibilities.

For example, is there a word that has the pattern ?A?LE and uses letters that are in multiple candidates? Not really.

Another idea: guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests the missing positions with letters that are in the candidate words.

For example, the candidate words have for position 1: G, F, E and for position 3: B, B, G.

So the letters to test for position 1 are G, F, E and for position 3 are B, G.

We could guess a word that has, say, E in position 1 and B in position 3, but is there a word ""EABLE""? Not a word.

Or ""EAGLE"" has E and G.

""FABLE"" has F and B.

""GABLE"" has G and B.

So no word has, for example, F and G or E and B in the required positions.

So we have to choose one.

Perhaps we can guess ""BAGLE"" but that's not a word (bagel is 5 letters but spelled B,A,G,E,L - which is B at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, L at 5? That doesn't fit because we need L at 4 and E at 5, so ""BAGEL"" is B,A,G,E,L -> positions: 1:B,2:A,3:G,4:E,5:L -> but we need 4:L and 5:E, so not.

So no.

Therefore, I think we should guess ""EAGLE"".

So fourth guess: ""EAGLE""

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  
  - Position 2: **A**  
  - Position 4: **L**  
  - Position 5: **E**  
  - Pattern: `_ A _ L E`  
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P.  
- **Remaining positions to solve**:  
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (must be from available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, O, W, Y, etc.).  
  - Position 3: Unknown letter (same available letters).  
- **Possible words** fitting `_ A _ L E` and avoiding absent letters include:  
  - **EAGLE** (E in position 1, G in position 3)  
  - **GABLE** (G in position 1, B in position 3)  
  - **FABLE** (F in position 1, B in position 3)  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test high-likelihood letters for positions 1 and 3 while covering multiple possibilities.  
- **Why ""EAGLE""?**  
  - Tests **E** in position 1 (possible duplicate, as E is confirmed at position 5) and **G** in position 3.  
  - If correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will:  
    - Confirm if **E** is present/absent in position 1.  
    - Confirm if **G** is present/absent in position 3.  
    - Narrow down to **GABLE** or **FABLE** for subsequent guesses.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""GABLE"" or ""FABLE"" were options but test fewer new letters (e.g., ""GABLE"" only tests G/B, ""FABLE"" only tests F/B).  
  - ""EAGLE"" maximizes new information by testing two distinct letters (E and G) in untested positions.  

<guess>eagle</guess>",eagle,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: absent
- A: present but wrong position (not position 3)
- N: absent
- E: correct and in position 5

Guess 2: ""saute""
- S: absent
- A: correct and in position 2
- U: absent
- T: absent
- E: correct and in position 5

Guess 3: ""maple""
- M: absent
- A: correct and in position 2
- P: absent
- L: correct and in position 4 (since it's marked correct, and in ""maple"", L is at position 4)
- E: correct and in position 5

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 5: E

   So the pattern is: _ A _ L E

2. We also know that the letter A is in the word and in position 2 (so the previous feedback about A being present but not in position 3 is consistent).

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P

   So the absent letters are: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P.

4. We know that the secret word must have one more letter in position 1 and one in position 3.

   Also, from the first guess, we know that A was present but not in position 3, which is now satisfied because A is fixed at position 2.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ L E and does not use any of the absent letters.

The available letters are those not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, R, N, S, U, T, M, P.

So available letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A, L, E are already in the word, but we are missing positions 1 and 3. Also, the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far, but it's possible.

However, since we have three positions fixed (2,4,5) and two unknown (1 and 3), and we know the word must be 5 letters.

We can list possible words that match _ A _ L E.

Common words with this pattern:

- ""BALLE"" is not an English word.
- ""DALE"" is 4 letters.
- ""GALE"": G A _ L E -> but we need a letter in position 3? ""GALE"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Actually, the pattern is: position1: ?, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: L, position5: E.

So the word must be: ?A?LE

Possible words:

- ""TABLE"": but T is absent, and also A is at position 2? ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T is absent, so invalid.
- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> this fits. And G and B are not absent? Absent: C,R,N,S,U,T,M,P. So G and B are allowed.
- ""HABLE"": not a word.
- ""SABLE"": but S is absent.
- ""CABLE"": C is absent.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> F and B are allowed? F is not in absent list. So valid.
- ""MABLE"": not a word.
- ""RABLE"": R is absent.
- ""WABLE"": not common, but ""wable"" is not a word? 
- ""VABLE"": not a word.

Other options:

- ""BAYLE"": not common.
- ""DAILE"": not a word.
- ""GAFFE"": but that ends with E, but pattern is ?A?LE? No, we need L at position 4 and E at 5, so ?A?LE.

Another word: ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> but this has E at position 1 and 5, and G at position 3. Pattern: E A G L E. This fits ?A?LE? Actually, position1: E, position2: A, position3: G, position4: L, position5: E. So yes, ""EAGLE"".

And E is already known to be at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. Also, G is allowed (not absent).

But note: we have E at position 5, and if we put E at position 1, that's allowed? Yes, because the secret word might have duplicate E.

Similarly, ""BELLE"": B E L L E -> but this has E at position 2? No, position2 is A, fixed. So not.

""IDLE"": too short.

""OAKLE"": not a word.

""PAGLE"": not a word.

""RAGLE"": not a word.

So the common words I can think of are: ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

But we also have ""HALLE"": but that's a proper noun? Or ""halve"" is not matching.

""VALLE"": not common.

""WALLE"": like Wall-E? Not a common word.

So let's consider:

- ""GABLE"": G A B L E -> tests G and B.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> tests F and B.
- ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> tests E at position 1 and G at position 3.

We need to choose one that maximizes information. But note, we have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.

But we want to get the word if possible, or at least narrow down.

We know the pattern is _ A _ L E, and we have two positions to fill.

We can also consider if there are other words. What about ""AXLE""? A X L E -> but that's 4 letters? ""AXLE"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""AXLES"" is 5 but ends with S, not E.

""ANKLE"": A N K L E -> but N is absent.

""APPLE"": A P P L E -> but P is absent.

""AMPLE"": A M P L E -> M and P absent.

So back to the three: ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, which one to choose?

We can think about the feedback from the first guess: A was present but not in position 3. That is already satisfied because A is at position 2.

We don't have any other constraints.

But note: in ""EAGLE"", we are putting E at position 1. We know E is in the word at position 5, but we don't know if it is at position 1. If we guess ""EAGLE"", and if the secret word does not have E at position 1, then we might get feedback that E is present but wrong position? But we already have E at position 5, so if there is another E, it would be marked accordingly.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate E.

Similarly, for ""GABLE"" and ""FABLE"", they don't have duplicate letters.

To get more information, we might prefer a word that doesn't reuse E, so that we can test two new letters.

But we are running out of guesses, so we might want to guess a word that could be the answer.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

Possible letters for position 1: any except absent (C,R,N,S,U,T,M,P) and also not A,L,E (but they can be duplicated? We don't know). But since we have no duplicate indication, we should consider the possibility.

But to be safe, we can assume no duplicates until we have evidence. However, we don't have evidence against duplicates.

But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a duplicate, so maybe the word has no duplicates.

But let's not assume.

Available letters for position 1: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (but A, E, L are already in the word, so if we avoid duplicates, we wouldn't use them again, but we don't have to).

Similarly for position 3.

But to maximize the chance of being correct, we should consider common words.

Common words: 
- ""GABLE"": a triangular part of a wall.
- ""FABLE"": a short story.
- ""EAGLE"": a bird.

Also, ""HABLE"" is not a word, but ""HALLE"" is not English.

Another one: ""BAYLE"" is obsolete.

""KALLE"" not a word.

""GAZLE"" not a word.

So the only common words are ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, we have to choose one.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and A was present but not in position 3. That doesn't give more information now.

We also have the feedback that in ""maple"", L was correct at position 4, and A at 2, E at 5, and M and P absent.

So no new information about position 1 and 3.

We need to test one of these.

But we have three options, and we can only guess one.

If we guess ""EAGLE"", and it's not correct, we might learn about E at position 1 and G at position 3.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"", we learn about G and B.

But we are on the fourth guess, and we have two more after this.

But to be efficient, we might want to guess a word that covers more possibilities.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses letters that are more common to increase the chance of being correct.

Letter frequency: in English, the most common letters left are D, G, B, F, etc.

But in the context of the pattern ?A?LE, the common words are the ones we have.

We can also consider ""DIALE"" not a word.

""GAFFE"" is G A F F E, which is G at 1, A at 2, F at 3, F at 4, E at 5. But we need L at position 4, not F. So ""GAFFE"" has F at position 4, but we need L at position 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

Similarly, ""GAMME"" not a word.

So I think the only reasonable options are ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, let's look at the feedback from the second guess: ""saute"" had A correct at position 2 and E at 5, and S,U,T absent. No information about position 1 and 3.

Perhaps we can look for a word that tests two new letters that are common.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we know that the secret word has at least three distinct letters: A, L, E, and two more.

We can try to guess ""EAGLE"" because it uses a vowel in position 3 (G is not a vowel, but E at position 1 is a vowel).

But let's count the possibilities. There are not many words, so we can list them all.

Possible words:

- With no duplicates: 
  - ""GABLE"": G at 1, B at 3
  - ""FABLE"": F at 1, B at 3
  - ""EAGLE"": E at 1, G at 3
  - ""BAYLE"": B at 1, Y at 3 (if we consider it, but not common)
  - ""WALLE"": not common
  - ""HALLE"": not common
  - ""YELPE"": Y at 1, P at 3? But P is absent. Invalid.

With duplicates:
  - If we allow duplicate E, then ""EAGLE"" is one.
  - Also, ""EAGLE"" has two E's, which is allowed.
  - What about ""DEALE""? Not a word.
  - ""HEALE"": not common.
  - ""LEALE"": not a word.

So practically, the only common words are ""GABLE"", ""FABLE"", ""EAGLE"".

Now, to decide, we can consider that ""EAGLE"" has the advantage that if the secret word is ""EAGLE"", we win. If not, we get feedback on E at position 1 and G at position 3.

Similarly for the others.

But we have no information to favor one over the other.

Perhaps we can look at the first guess: the word ""crane"" had A in it, and we now know A is at position 2. But no other constraints.

Another thought: in the first guess, when we guessed ""crane"", the A was marked as present but not at position 3. That means that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, which is consistent with our pattern because position 3 is not A in any of our candidates.

So no help.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has a letter that is more common in position 1 or 3.

But I think it's arbitrary.

Since we have three possibilities, and we have to guess one, I'll go with ""EAGLE"" because it's a very common word.

But let's see the feedback we would get if the word is not ""EAGLE"".

For example, if the secret word is ""GABLE"", and we guess ""EAGLE"", the feedback would be:
- E at position 1: since ""GABLE"" has no E at position 1, but has E at position 5, so E is present but not at position 1? But we already know E is at position 5, so the feedback for position 1 E might be '-' if there is another E, but ""GABLE"" has only one E at position 5, so E at position 1 in ""EAGLE"" would be absent? No.

Let's simulate:

Secret word: ""GABLE"" (G,A,B,L,E)
Guess: ""EAGLE"" (E,A,G,L,E)

Feedback:
- Position 1: E -> in ""GABLE"", there is no E at position 1, but there is an E at position 5. Since it's the same letter, and it's already used at position 5, but in Wordle rules, if there is only one E in the secret word, then the extra E in guess would be marked absent. But ""GABLE"" has only one E, so:
  - E at position 1: not in the word? But there is an E at position 5, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first E might be marked as present (if not in position) and the second as correct, but if the secret has only one, then one of the E's in the guess will be marked as present (if in wrong position) or correct, and the other as absent.

Specifically for ""EAGLE"" vs ""GABLE"":
- Position 1: E -> secret has E only at position 5, so this E is present but not at position 1? But it's the same letter, so it should be marked as present (yellow) because there is an E in the word, but not at this position.
- Position 2: A -> correct (green)
- Position 3: G -> in secret, G is at position 1, so present but not at position 3 (yellow)
- Position 4: L -> correct (green)
- Position 5: E -> correct (green)

So feedback: E(-), A(✓), G(-), L(✓), E(✓)

But this would tell us that G is present but not at position 3, and E is present but not at position 1.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"" and the secret is ""EAGLE"", then:
- G at position 1: in secret, G is at position 3, so present but not at position 1 (yellow)
- A at position 2: correct
- B at position 3: absent (since secret has G at 3, not B)
- L at position 4: correct
- E at position 5: correct

Feedback: G(-), A(✓), B(x), L(✓), E(✓)

So we would know B is absent.

In either case, we get information.

But if we guess ""EAGLE"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get information about E and G.

Similarly, if we guess ""GABLE"" and it's not correct, we get information about G and B.

But we have only two more guesses, so it's okay.

Since ""EAGLE"" is a common word, I'll go with that.

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple possibilities.

For example, is there a word that has the pattern ?A?LE and uses letters that are in multiple candidates? Not really.

Another idea: guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests the missing positions with letters that are in the candidate words.

For example, the candidate words have for position 1: G, F, E and for position 3: B, B, G.

So the letters to test for position 1 are G, F, E and for position 3 are B, G.

We could guess a word that has, say, E in position 1 and B in position 3, but is there a word ""EABLE""? Not a word.

Or ""EAGLE"" has E and G.

""FABLE"" has F and B.

""GABLE"" has G and B.

So no word has, for example, F and G or E and B in the required positions.

So we have to choose one.

Perhaps we can guess ""BAGLE"" but that's not a word (bagel is 5 letters but spelled B,A,G,E,L - which is B at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, L at 5? That doesn't fit because we need L at 4 and E at 5, so ""BAGEL"" is B,A,G,E,L -> positions: 1:B,2:A,3:G,4:E,5:L -> but we need 4:L and 5:E, so not.

So no.

Therefore, I think we should guess ""EAGLE"".

So fourth guess: ""EAGLE""
