We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes R and A, but in different positions than in the first guess (since in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were wrong positions).
- We can try to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"" and was wrong, so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, it can be in any position except 2. But note: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3 in our next guess.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and must include R and A.

Let's consider possible words. We can try to use a word that has R and A, and also some other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.), but avoiding C, N, E.

One common starting word is ""roast"", but let's check:
- ""roast"" has R in position 1, which is different from position 2. It has A in position 3? But in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was marked as wrong position. So in the secret word, A cannot be in position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""roast"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So, we need a word that has:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 3

And without C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and are 5 letters.

Possible words: 
- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is in position 3? We don't know if that's allowed. And A is in position 2? We don't have information about position 2 for A? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 3. So A can be in position 1,2,4,5.

But note: we also have to consider that we have only one R? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters. So we have to be cautious.

Another word: ""trial"" -> T, R, I, A, L. 
- R is in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, no: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong, but we might get more information? However, it's better to try a different position to see if we can get a correct position.

But note: we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a new position and A in a new position, and also includes other new letters.

Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

For example:
- ""ratio"": R in position 1, A in position 2 -> that's okay because A was not in position 3, but we don't know about position 2 for A. And R is in position 1, which is new.

But ""ratio"" has T, I, O which we haven't tried.

Another word: ""pairs"" -> P, A, I, R, S. Here, A is in position 2 and R is in position 4. So that avoids position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters. ""pairs"" doesn't have C, N, E.

Another common word: ""stare"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's try to come up with a word that has R and A, and uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, S, L, etc.) without E, C, N.

Possible words:
- ""ratio"" -> R, A, T, I, O -> no E, C, N. R is in 1, A in 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- ""paint"" -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""paint"" is invalid because of N.
- ""trail"" -> T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? We must avoid R in position 2? Actually, we can try it? But we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""trail"", R is in position 2, so we avoid that.

How about ""fairy""? F, A, I, R, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 4. That's okay.

But let's choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

Another idea: ""radio"" -> R, A, D, I, O. R in 1, A in 2. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word.

Alternatively, ""oasis"" -> but no R? We must include R and A? Actually, we don't have to include them, but we know they are in the word so we should use them to get position information.

But we can also use other letters to test. However, since we know R and A are in the word, it's efficient to use them again to try to find their correct positions.

So, I think ""ratio"" is a good candidate because:
- It has R in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- It introduces T, I, O which are common.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see.

Another candidate: ""stair"" -> S, T, A, I, R. A in position 3? But we must avoid A in position 3? Because in the first guess, A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong again. So to avoid wasting a position, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1,2,4,5.

In ""stair"", A is in position 3? Let me check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

How about ""straw"": S, T, R, A, W. R in position 3? And A in position 4? That's okay. But we have W, which is less common.

I think ""ratio"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""ratio"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""ratio"".

We are going to guess ""ratio"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we'll see from the feedback.

So, the next guess is ""ratio"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, N, E.
- Include R and A, but place R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, I, O) to gather more information.

The word ""ratio"" meets these criteria:
- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
- Uses new letters T, I, O.
- Avoids C, N, E.

But ""ratio"" has T, I, O which we haven't tried.

Another word: ""pairs"" -> P, A, I, R, S. Here, A is in position 2 and R is in position 4. So that avoids position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters. ""pairs"" doesn't have C, N, E.

Another common word: ""stare"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's try to come up with a word that has R and A, and uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, S, L, etc.) without E, C, N.

Possible words:
- ""ratio"" -> R, A, T, I, O -> no E, C, N. R is in 1, A in 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- ""paint"" -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""paint"" is invalid because of N.
- ""trail"" -> T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? We must avoid R in position 2? Actually, we can try it? But we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""trail"", R is in position 2, so we avoid that.

How about ""fairy""? F, A, I, R, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 4. That's okay.

But let's choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

Another idea: ""radio"" -> R, A, D, I, O. R in 1, A in 2. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word.

Alternatively, ""oasis"" -> but no R? We must include R and A? Actually, we don't have to include them, but we know they are in the word so we should use them to get position information.

But we can also use other letters to test. However, since we know R and A are in the word, it's efficient to use them again to try to find their correct positions.

So, I think ""ratio"" is a good candidate because:
- It has R in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- It introduces T, I, O which are common.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see.

Another candidate: ""stair"" -> S, T, A, I, R. A in position 3? But we must avoid A in position 3? Because in the first guess, A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong again. So to avoid wasting a position, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1,2,4,5.

In ""stair"", A is in position 3? Let me check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

How about ""straw"": S, T, R, A, W. R in position 3? And A in position 4? That's okay. But we have W, which is less common.

I think ""ratio"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""ratio"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""ratio"".

We are going to guess ""ratio"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we'll see from the feedback.

So, the next guess is ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, N, E.
- Include R and A, but place R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, I, O) to gather more information.

The word ""ratio"" meets these criteria:
- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
- Uses new letters T, I, O.
- Avoids C, N, E.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains R and A (from first guess), and now A is in the correct position (second guess). In ""ratio"", A is in the second position, so the second letter of A is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the secret word has A as its second letter.

2. R is in the word but not in the correct position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (which we now know is A), so that was wrong. In ""ratio"", R was in position 1, and it was marked wrong position. So R is not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.

3. We know the secret word does not contain C, N, E (from first guess), and now T, I, O (from second guess) are also not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have A in the second position: _ A _ _ _

And R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2.

Also, we need to find other letters that are in the word.

From ""crane"", we had R and A, meaning there are at least two letters we know. But there might be more.

Since we have A fixed at position 2, and R somewhere in 3-5, we need to choose a word that:
- Has A in the second position (fixed)
- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but avoid position 1 and 2, which we already know are wrong for R)
- Uses only letters that haven't been excluded: so avoid C, N, E, T, I, O.
- We can include new letters to get more information.

The excluded letters are: C, E, I, N, O, T. So avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word must have R in one of the last three positions.

We should try a word that puts R in a different position each time until we find it, but also test other common letters.

Since there are three positions for R (3,4,5) and we have limited guesses, we might try to cover more than one possibility.

But let's think of common words with A as second letter and R in the word.

Possible words with A in second position: 
- S A L A D? But we haven't tested S, L, D.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

Also, R must be in the word.

So, we need words like:
- _ A _ R _ : R in fourth position
- _ A R _ _ : but R in position 3? However, we haven't tried that yet? We know R is not in position 1 or 2, but position 3 is possible.

In fact, we can try to place R in position 3, 4, or 5 in this guess.

Also, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

Consider the word ""parka"", but we have K and A again? Also, we have to avoid A being duplicated? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the word ""parka"", A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is in the word, but we don't know how many times. Also, ""parka"" has P, A, R, K, A.

But K is not excluded? And P?

But we must avoid the excluded letters. ""parka"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let's check: P, A, R, K, A — excluded are C,E,I,N,O,T — none in ""parka"". So it's valid.

But also, we have two A's? The feedback might be affected if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to simplify.

But let's proceed.

In ""parka"", R is in position 3? P-A-R-K-A → R at position 3.

If the secret word has R at position 3, then we might get a ✓ for R? Or if not, we get - or x? We know R is in the word, so it won't be x.

But we need to get information.

Another word: ""marsh"" → M-A-R-S-H → A at 2, R at 3.

But we haven't excluded M,S,H.

Another word: ""lapse"" → but E is excluded, so not.

Since A is fixed at position 2, we should try R in position 3, next position we haven't tested.

Possible: use a word with R in position 3 to test if it's there.

Similarly, we can test other letters.

But note: we only have one R? The feedback doesn't specify, so we don't know.

We'll know from the feedback.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me list some words with pattern _ A _ _ _ that include R and avoid excluded letters.

For example:
- ""bards"": B-A-R-D-S → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), S(5). Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,I,N,O,T.
- ""fault"": but T is excluded? T is in excluded because from second guess T was x. So avoid T.
- ""valid"" has D and L? V-A-L-I-D → but I is excluded? from second guess I was x, so avoid I. So ""valid"" has I and excluded.

Another: ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S → R in position 3.

""wards"": W-A-R-D-S → R in 3.

""harms"": H-A-R-M-S → R in 3.

""barks"": B-A-R-K-S → R in 3.

But all have R in position 3.

We could place R in position 4: like _ A _ R _

Examples: ""fairy"" → F-A-I-R-Y → but I is excluded, so not.

""march"" → M-A-R-C-H → but C excluded.

""hardy"": H-A-R-D-Y → R in position 3? H(1)-A(2)-R(3)-D(4)-Y(5), so R at 3.

For R at position 4: try ""wafer"" → but E excluded.

""gaper"" → E excluded.

""paper"" → but P,A,P,E,R — E excluded.

It's hard to find words with R at position 4 and A at 2 without excluded letters.

Similarly, for R at position 5: _ A _ _ R

Examples: ""gator"" → but O is excluded? G-A-T-O-R → T and O excluded.

""labor"" → but O excluded.

""saber"" → S-A-B-E-R → E excluded.

We see that words with R in position 4 or 5 often include E, I, O, T which are excluded.

Perhaps there are words like ""sadly"" but without R? But we must include R because it's in the word.

So, it might be that R is in position 3 because position 4 and 5 are rare with the constraints.

Therefore, let's try a word with R in position 3 and A fixed at position 2.

We also want to include new letters.

For example: ""barks"" → letters: B, A, R, K, S.

B, K, S are new.

Since we don't know about duplicates, but we'll see.

Another word: ""parks"" → P, A, R, K, S.

I think both are good.

But let me pick ""barks"" to use B.

So, possible guess: ""barks"".

In ""barks"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (fixed correct, so we expect ✓)
- Position 3: R (which we are testing: if it's correct, ✓; else, - because R is in the word)
- Position 4: K (new)
- Position 5: S (new)

Even if R at position 3 is not correct, we will know from feedback.

Also, we get information on B, K, S.

We might choose a word with more vowels? But we have A already, and the only vowel we can use is U? because others are excluded? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y. E,I,O excluded, so we have U and Y? But we don't know if they are in the word.

""barks"" has no U/Y, but that's fine.

Alternatives: ""warms"" → W,A,R,M,S.

""darks"" → D,A,R,K,S.

But I think ""barks"" is fine.

We could try ""marsh"" → M,A,R,S,H.

But S is a common letter.

Since A is fixed and R is to be tested at position 3, and we want new letters, I'll go with ""barks"".

So, the guess is ""barks"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T.

We choose a word that:
- Places A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (we test position 3).
- Uses new, common letters (B, K, S) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters.

""barks"" fits these criteria.

<guess>barks</guess>
</think>
We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
   - R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not in position 2, A not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (new information).  
   - T, I, O are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- **A** is confirmed in position 2: the secret word has the pattern `_ A _ _ _`.  
- **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): C, E, I, N, O, T.  
- **Valid letters to use**: All other letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Since A is fixed at position 2, we need to place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, D, B, K, M) and avoid excluded letters.  
- Prioritize testing R in position 3, as it is common and positions 4/5 are harder with excluded vowels.  
- Choose a word with A in position 2 and R in position 3 to confirm/deny R's position quickly. Include other letters to test them.  

The word **""barks""** fits well:  
- Places A in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  
- Places R in position 3 (to test this position).  
- Uses new letters B, K, S (common and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicate letters in tested positions and excluded letters.  

<guess>barks</guess>",barks,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains R and A (from first guess), and now A is in the correct position (second guess). In ""ratio"", A is in the second position, so the second letter of A is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the secret word has A as its second letter.

2. R is in the word but not in the correct position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (which we now know is A), so that was wrong. In ""ratio"", R was in position 1, and it was marked wrong position. So R is not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.

3. We know the secret word does not contain C, N, E (from first guess), and now T, I, O (from second guess) are also not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have A in the second position: _ A _ _ _

And R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2.

Also, we need to find other letters that are in the word.

From ""crane"", we had R and A, meaning there are at least two letters we know. But there might be more.

Since we have A fixed at position 2, and R somewhere in 3-5, we need to choose a word that:
- Has A in the second position (fixed)
- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but avoid position 1 and 2, which we already know are wrong for R)
- Uses only letters that haven't been excluded: so avoid C, N, E, T, I, O.
- We can include new letters to get more information.

The excluded letters are: C, E, I, N, O, T. So avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word must have R in one of the last three positions.

We should try a word that puts R in a different position each time until we find it, but also test other common letters.

Since there are three positions for R (3,4,5) and we have limited guesses, we might try to cover more than one possibility.

But let's think of common words with A as second letter and R in the word.

Possible words with A in second position: 
- S A L A D? But we haven't tested S, L, D.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

Also, R must be in the word.

So, we need words like:
- _ A _ R _ : R in fourth position
- _ A R _ _ : but R in position 3? However, we haven't tried that yet? We know R is not in position 1 or 2, but position 3 is possible.

In fact, we can try to place R in position 3, 4, or 5 in this guess.

Also, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

Consider the word ""parka"", but we have K and A again? Also, we have to avoid A being duplicated? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the word ""parka"", A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is in the word, but we don't know how many times. Also, ""parka"" has P, A, R, K, A.

But K is not excluded? And P?

But we must avoid the excluded letters. ""parka"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let's check: P, A, R, K, A — excluded are C,E,I,N,O,T — none in ""parka"". So it's valid.

But also, we have two A's? The feedback might be affected if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to simplify.

But let's proceed.

In ""parka"", R is in position 3? P-A-R-K-A → R at position 3.

If the secret word has R at position 3, then we might get a ✓ for R? Or if not, we get - or x? We know R is in the word, so it won't be x.

But we need to get information.

Another word: ""marsh"" → M-A-R-S-H → A at 2, R at 3.

But we haven't excluded M,S,H.

Another word: ""lapse"" → but E is excluded, so not.

Since A is fixed at position 2, we should try R in position 3, next position we haven't tested.

Possible: use a word with R in position 3 to test if it's there.

Similarly, we can test other letters.

But note: we only have one R? The feedback doesn't specify, so we don't know.

We'll know from the feedback.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me list some words with pattern _ A _ _ _ that include R and avoid excluded letters.

For example:
- ""bards"": B-A-R-D-S → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), S(5). Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,I,N,O,T.
- ""fault"": but T is excluded? T is in excluded because from second guess T was x. So avoid T.
- ""valid"" has D and L? V-A-L-I-D → but I is excluded? from second guess I was x, so avoid I. So ""valid"" has I and excluded.

Another: ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S → R in position 3.

""wards"": W-A-R-D-S → R in 3.

""harms"": H-A-R-M-S → R in 3.

""barks"": B-A-R-K-S → R in 3.

But all have R in position 3.

We could place R in position 4: like _ A _ R _

Examples: ""fairy"" → F-A-I-R-Y → but I is excluded, so not.

""march"" → M-A-R-C-H → but C excluded.

""hardy"": H-A-R-D-Y → R in position 3? H(1)-A(2)-R(3)-D(4)-Y(5), so R at 3.

For R at position 4: try ""wafer"" → but E excluded.

""gaper"" → E excluded.

""paper"" → but P,A,P,E,R — E excluded.

It's hard to find words with R at position 4 and A at 2 without excluded letters.

Similarly, for R at position 5: _ A _ _ R

Examples: ""gator"" → but O is excluded? G-A-T-O-R → T and O excluded.

""labor"" → but O excluded.

""saber"" → S-A-B-E-R → E excluded.

We see that words with R in position 4 or 5 often include E, I, O, T which are excluded.

Perhaps there are words like ""sadly"" but without R? But we must include R because it's in the word.

So, it might be that R is in position 3 because position 4 and 5 are rare with the constraints.

Therefore, let's try a word with R in position 3 and A fixed at position 2.

We also want to include new letters.

For example: ""barks"" → letters: B, A, R, K, S.

B, K, S are new.

Since we don't know about duplicates, but we'll see.

Another word: ""parks"" → P, A, R, K, S.

I think both are good.

But let me pick ""barks"" to use B.

So, possible guess: ""barks"".

In ""barks"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (fixed correct, so we expect ✓)
- Position 3: R (which we are testing: if it's correct, ✓; else, - because R is in the word)
- Position 4: K (new)
- Position 5: S (new)

Even if R at position 3 is not correct, we will know from feedback.

Also, we get information on B, K, S.

We might choose a word with more vowels? But we have A already, and the only vowel we can use is U? because others are excluded? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y. E,I,O excluded, so we have U and Y? But we don't know if they are in the word.

""barks"" has no U/Y, but that's fine.

Alternatives: ""warms"" → W,A,R,M,S.

""darks"" → D,A,R,K,S.

But I think ""barks"" is fine.

We could try ""marsh"" → M,A,R,S,H.

But S is a common letter.

Since A is fixed and R is to be tested at position 3, and we want new letters, I'll go with ""barks"".

So, the guess is ""barks"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T.

We choose a word that:
- Places A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (we test position 3).
- Uses new, common letters (B, K, S) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters.

""barks"" fits these criteria.

<guess>barks</guess>We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
   - R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not in position 2, A not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (new information).  
   - T, I, O are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- **A** is confirmed in position 2: the secret word has the pattern `_ A _ _ _`.  
- **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): C, E, I, N, O, T.  
- **Valid letters to use**: All other letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Since A is fixed at position 2, we need to place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, D, B, K, M) and avoid excluded letters.  
- Prioritize testing R in position 3, as it is common and positions 4/5 are harder with excluded vowels.  
- Choose a word with A in position 2 and R in position 3 to confirm/deny R's position quickly. Include other letters to test them.  

The word **""barks""** fits well:  
- Places A in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  
- Places R in position 3 (to test this position).  
- Uses new letters B, K, S (common and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicate letters in tested positions and excluded letters.",Guess 3: barks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,harsh,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes R and A, but in different positions than in the first guess (since in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were wrong positions).
- We can try to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"" and was wrong, so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, it can be in any position except 2. But note: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3 in our next guess.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and must include R and A.

Let's consider possible words. We can try to use a word that has R and A, and also some other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.), but avoiding C, N, E.

One common starting word is ""roast"", but let's check:
- ""roast"" has R in position 1, which is different from position 2. It has A in position 3? But in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was marked as wrong position. So in the secret word, A cannot be in position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""roast"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So, we need a word that has:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 3

And without C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and are 5 letters.

Possible words: 
- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is in position 3? We don't know if that's allowed. And A is in position 2? We don't have information about position 2 for A? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 3. So A can be in position 1,2,4,5.

But note: we also have to consider that we have only one R? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters. So we have to be cautious.

Another word: ""trial"" -> T, R, I, A, L. 
- R is in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, no: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong, but we might get more information? However, it's better to try a different position to see if we can get a correct position.

But note: we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a new position and A in a new position, and also includes other new letters.

Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

For example:
- ""ratio"": R in position 1, A in position 2 -> that's okay because A was not in position 3, but we don't know about position 2 for A. And R is in position 1, which is new.

But ""ratio"" has T, I, O which we haven't tried.

Another word: ""pairs"" -> P, A, I, R, S. Here, A is in position 2 and R is in position 4. So that avoids position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters. ""pairs"" doesn't have C, N, E.

Another common word: ""stare"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's try to come up with a word that has R and A, and uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, S, L, etc.) without E, C, N.

Possible words:
- ""ratio"" -> R, A, T, I, O -> no E, C, N. R is in 1, A in 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- ""paint"" -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""paint"" is invalid because of N.
- ""trail"" -> T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? We must avoid R in position 2? Actually, we can try it? But we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""trail"", R is in position 2, so we avoid that.

How about ""fairy""? F, A, I, R, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 4. That's okay.

But let's choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

Another idea: ""radio"" -> R, A, D, I, O. R in 1, A in 2. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word.

Alternatively, ""oasis"" -> but no R? We must include R and A? Actually, we don't have to include them, but we know they are in the word so we should use them to get position information.

But we can also use other letters to test. However, since we know R and A are in the word, it's efficient to use them again to try to find their correct positions.

So, I think ""ratio"" is a good candidate because:
- It has R in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- It introduces T, I, O which are common.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see.

Another candidate: ""stair"" -> S, T, A, I, R. A in position 3? But we must avoid A in position 3? Because in the first guess, A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong again. So to avoid wasting a position, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1,2,4,5.

In ""stair"", A is in position 3? Let me check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

How about ""straw"": S, T, R, A, W. R in position 3? And A in position 4? That's okay. But we have W, which is less common.

I think ""ratio"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""ratio"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""ratio"".

We are going to guess ""ratio"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we'll see from the feedback.

So, the next guess is ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, N, E.
- Include R and A, but place R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, I, O) to gather more information.

The word ""ratio"" meets these criteria:
- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
- Uses new letters T, I, O.
- Avoids C, N, E.

<guess>ratio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains R and A (from first guess), and now A is in the correct position (second guess). In ""ratio"", A is in the second position, so the second letter of A is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the secret word has A as its second letter.

2. R is in the word but not in the correct position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (which we now know is A), so that was wrong. In ""ratio"", R was in position 1, and it was marked wrong position. So R is not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.

3. We know the secret word does not contain C, N, E (from first guess), and now T, I, O (from second guess) are also not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have A in the second position: _ A _ _ _

And R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2.

Also, we need to find other letters that are in the word.

From ""crane"", we had R and A, meaning there are at least two letters we know. But there might be more.

Since we have A fixed at position 2, and R somewhere in 3-5, we need to choose a word that:
- Has A in the second position (fixed)
- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but avoid position 1 and 2, which we already know are wrong for R)
- Uses only letters that haven't been excluded: so avoid C, N, E, T, I, O.
- We can include new letters to get more information.

The excluded letters are: C, E, I, N, O, T. So avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word must have R in one of the last three positions.

We should try a word that puts R in a different position each time until we find it, but also test other common letters.

Since there are three positions for R (3,4,5) and we have limited guesses, we might try to cover more than one possibility.

But let's think of common words with A as second letter and R in the word.

Possible words with A in second position: 
- S A L A D? But we haven't tested S, L, D.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

Also, R must be in the word.

So, we need words like:
- _ A _ R _ : R in fourth position
- _ A R _ _ : but R in position 3? However, we haven't tried that yet? We know R is not in position 1 or 2, but position 3 is possible.

In fact, we can try to place R in position 3, 4, or 5 in this guess.

Also, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

Consider the word ""parka"", but we have K and A again? Also, we have to avoid A being duplicated? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the word ""parka"", A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is in the word, but we don't know how many times. Also, ""parka"" has P, A, R, K, A.

But K is not excluded? And P?

But we must avoid the excluded letters. ""parka"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let's check: P, A, R, K, A — excluded are C,E,I,N,O,T — none in ""parka"". So it's valid.

But also, we have two A's? The feedback might be affected if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to simplify.

But let's proceed.

In ""parka"", R is in position 3? P-A-R-K-A → R at position 3.

If the secret word has R at position 3, then we might get a ✓ for R? Or if not, we get - or x? We know R is in the word, so it won't be x.

But we need to get information.

Another word: ""marsh"" → M-A-R-S-H → A at 2, R at 3.

But we haven't excluded M,S,H.

Another word: ""lapse"" → but E is excluded, so not.

Since A is fixed at position 2, we should try R in position 3, next position we haven't tested.

Possible: use a word with R in position 3 to test if it's there.

Similarly, we can test other letters.

But note: we only have one R? The feedback doesn't specify, so we don't know.

We'll know from the feedback.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me list some words with pattern _ A _ _ _ that include R and avoid excluded letters.

For example:
- ""bards"": B-A-R-D-S → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), S(5). Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,I,N,O,T.
- ""fault"": but T is excluded? T is in excluded because from second guess T was x. So avoid T.
- ""valid"" has D and L? V-A-L-I-D → but I is excluded? from second guess I was x, so avoid I. So ""valid"" has I and excluded.

Another: ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S → R in position 3.

""wards"": W-A-R-D-S → R in 3.

""harms"": H-A-R-M-S → R in 3.

""barks"": B-A-R-K-S → R in 3.

But all have R in position 3.

We could place R in position 4: like _ A _ R _

Examples: ""fairy"" → F-A-I-R-Y → but I is excluded, so not.

""march"" → M-A-R-C-H → but C excluded.

""hardy"": H-A-R-D-Y → R in position 3? H(1)-A(2)-R(3)-D(4)-Y(5), so R at 3.

For R at position 4: try ""wafer"" → but E excluded.

""gaper"" → E excluded.

""paper"" → but P,A,P,E,R — E excluded.

It's hard to find words with R at position 4 and A at 2 without excluded letters.

Similarly, for R at position 5: _ A _ _ R

Examples: ""gator"" → but O is excluded? G-A-T-O-R → T and O excluded.

""labor"" → but O excluded.

""saber"" → S-A-B-E-R → E excluded.

We see that words with R in position 4 or 5 often include E, I, O, T which are excluded.

Perhaps there are words like ""sadly"" but without R? But we must include R because it's in the word.

So, it might be that R is in position 3 because position 4 and 5 are rare with the constraints.

Therefore, let's try a word with R in position 3 and A fixed at position 2.

We also want to include new letters.

For example: ""barks"" → letters: B, A, R, K, S.

B, K, S are new.

Since we don't know about duplicates, but we'll see.

Another word: ""parks"" → P, A, R, K, S.

I think both are good.

But let me pick ""barks"" to use B.

So, possible guess: ""barks"".

In ""barks"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (fixed correct, so we expect ✓)
- Position 3: R (which we are testing: if it's correct, ✓; else, - because R is in the word)
- Position 4: K (new)
- Position 5: S (new)

Even if R at position 3 is not correct, we will know from feedback.

Also, we get information on B, K, S.

We might choose a word with more vowels? But we have A already, and the only vowel we can use is U? because others are excluded? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y. E,I,O excluded, so we have U and Y? But we don't know if they are in the word.

""barks"" has no U/Y, but that's fine.

Alternatives: ""warms"" → W,A,R,M,S.

""darks"" → D,A,R,K,S.

But I think ""barks"" is fine.

We could try ""marsh"" → M,A,R,S,H.

But S is a common letter.

Since A is fixed and R is to be tested at position 3, and we want new letters, I'll go with ""barks"".

So, the guess is ""barks"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T.

We choose a word that:
- Places A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (we test position 3).
- Uses new, common letters (B, K, S) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters.

""barks"" fits these criteria.

<guess>barks</guess>We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
   - R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not in position 2, A not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (new information).  
   - T, I, O are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- **A** is confirmed in position 2: the secret word has the pattern `_ A _ _ _`.  
- **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): C, E, I, N, O, T.  
- **Valid letters to use**: All other letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Since A is fixed at position 2, we need to place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, D, B, K, M) and avoid excluded letters.  
- Prioritize testing R in position 3, as it is common and positions 4/5 are harder with excluded vowels.  
- Choose a word with A in position 2 and R in position 3 to confirm/deny R's position quickly. Include other letters to test them.  

The word **""barks""** fits well:  
- Places A in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  
- Places R in position 3 (to test this position).  
- Uses new letters B, K, S (common and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicate letters in tested positions and excluded letters.

We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Includes R and A, but in different positions than in the first guess (since in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were wrong positions).\n- We can try to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think about the positions:\n- R was in position 2 in ""crane"" and was wrong, so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, it can be in any position except 2. But note: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nWe should avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3 in our next guess.\n\nAlso, we know the word has 5 letters and must include R and A.\n\nLet\'s consider possible words. We can try to use a word that has R and A, and also some other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.), but avoiding C, N, E.\n\nOne common starting word is ""roast"", but let\'s check:\n- ""roast"" has R in position 1, which is different from position 2. It has A in position 3? But in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was marked as wrong position. So in the secret word, A cannot be in position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""roast"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nSo, we need a word that has:\n- R not in position 2\n- A not in position 3\n\nAnd without C, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and A, and are 5 letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is in position 3? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. And A is in position 2? We don\'t have information about position 2 for A? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 3. So A can be in position 1,2,4,5.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we have only one R? The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicate letters. So we have to be cautious.\n\nAnother word: ""trial"" -> T, R, I, A, L. \n- R is in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, no: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong, but we might get more information? However, it\'s better to try a different position to see if we can get a correct position.\n\nBut note: we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R in a new position and A in a new position, and also includes other new letters.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\nFor example:\n- ""ratio"": R in position 1, A in position 2 -> that\'s okay because A was not in position 3, but we don\'t know about position 2 for A. And R is in position 1, which is new.\n\nBut ""ratio"" has T, I, O which we haven\'t tried.\n\nAnother word: ""pairs"" -> P, A, I, R, S. Here, A is in position 2 and R is in position 4. So that avoids position 2 for R and position 3 for A.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters. ""pairs"" doesn\'t have C, N, E.\n\nAnother common word: ""stare"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E, so words with E are out.\n\nSo, let\'s try to come up with a word that has R and A, and uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, S, L, etc.) without E, C, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ratio"" -> R, A, T, I, O -> no E, C, N. R is in 1, A in 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).\n- ""paint"" -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""paint"" is invalid because of N.\n- ""trail"" -> T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? We must avoid R in position 2? Actually, we can try it? But we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of R. So it\'s better to try R in a different position.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nIn ""trail"", R is in position 2, so we avoid that.\n\nHow about ""fairy""? F, A, I, R, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 4. That\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.\n\nAnother idea: ""radio"" -> R, A, D, I, O. R in 1, A in 2. But we don\'t know if D, I, O are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""oasis"" -> but no R? We must include R and A? Actually, we don\'t have to include them, but we know they are in the word so we should use them to get position information.\n\nBut we can also use other letters to test. However, since we know R and A are in the word, it\'s efficient to use them again to try to find their correct positions.\n\nSo, I think ""ratio"" is a good candidate because:\n- It has R in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).\n- It introduces T, I, O which are common.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but we\'ll see.\n\nAnother candidate: ""stair"" -> S, T, A, I, R. A in position 3? But we must avoid A in position 3? Because in the first guess, A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong again. So to avoid wasting a position, we should put A in a position we haven\'t tried: 1,2,4,5.\n\nIn ""stair"", A is in position 3? Let me check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\nHow about ""straw"": S, T, R, A, W. R in position 3? And A in position 4? That\'s okay. But we have W, which is less common.\n\nI think ""ratio"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""ratio"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""ratio"".\n\nWe are going to guess ""ratio"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we\'ll see from the feedback.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid using C, N, E.\n- Include R and A, but place R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, I, O) to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""ratio"" meets these criteria:\n- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.\n- Uses new letters T, I, O.\n- Avoids C, N, E.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSecond guess: ""ratio""\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom the feedback, we know:\n\n1. The secret word contains R and A (from first guess), and now A is in the correct position (second guess). In ""ratio"", A is in the second position, so the second letter of A is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the secret word has A as its second letter.\n\n2. R is in the word but not in the correct position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (which we now know is A), so that was wrong. In ""ratio"", R was in position 1, and it was marked wrong position. So R is not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.\n\n3. We know the secret word does not contain C, N, E (from first guess), and now T, I, O (from second guess) are also not in the word.\n\nSo, excluded letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe have A in the second position: _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, we need to find other letters that are in the word.\n\nFrom ""crane"", we had R and A, meaning there are at least two letters we know. But there might be more.\n\nSince we have A fixed at position 2, and R somewhere in 3-5, we need to choose a word that:\n- Has A in the second position (fixed)\n- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but avoid position 1 and 2, which we already know are wrong for R)\n- Uses only letters that haven\'t been excluded: so avoid C, N, E, T, I, O.\n- We can include new letters to get more information.\n\nThe excluded letters are: C, E, I, N, O, T. So avoid these.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know the word must have R in one of the last three positions.\n\nWe should try a word that puts R in a different position each time until we find it, but also test other common letters.\n\nSince there are three positions for R (3,4,5) and we have limited guesses, we might try to cover more than one possibility.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words with A as second letter and R in the word.\n\nPossible words with A in second position: \n- S A L A D? But we haven\'t tested S, L, D.\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nAlso, R must be in the word.\n\nSo, we need words like:\n- _ A _ R _ : R in fourth position\n- _ A R _ _ : but R in position 3? However, we haven\'t tried that yet? We know R is not in position 1 or 2, but position 3 is possible.\n\nIn fact, we can try to place R in position 3, 4, or 5 in this guess.\n\nAlso, we want to use common letters to maximize information.\n\nConsider the word ""parka"", but we have K and A again? Also, we have to avoid A being duplicated? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nHowever, in the word ""parka"", A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know how many times. Also, ""parka"" has P, A, R, K, A.\n\nBut K is not excluded? And P?\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters. ""parka"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let\'s check: P, A, R, K, A — excluded are C,E,I,N,O,T — none in ""parka"". So it\'s valid.\n\nBut also, we have two A\'s? The feedback might be affected if there are duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to simplify.\n\nBut let\'s proceed.\n\nIn ""parka"", R is in position 3? P-A-R-K-A → R at position 3.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 3, then we might get a ✓ for R? Or if not, we get - or x? We know R is in the word, so it won\'t be x.\n\nBut we need to get information.\n\nAnother word: ""marsh"" → M-A-R-S-H → A at 2, R at 3.\n\nBut we haven\'t excluded M,S,H.\n\nAnother word: ""lapse"" → but E is excluded, so not.\n\nSince A is fixed at position 2, we should try R in position 3, next position we haven\'t tested.\n\nPossible: use a word with R in position 3 to test if it\'s there.\n\nSimilarly, we can test other letters.\n\nBut note: we only have one R? The feedback doesn\'t specify, so we don\'t know.\n\nWe\'ll know from the feedback.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nLet me list some words with pattern _ A _ _ _ that include R and avoid excluded letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""bards"": B-A-R-D-S → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), S(5). Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,I,N,O,T.\n- ""fault"": but T is excluded? T is in excluded because from second guess T was x. So avoid T.\n- ""valid"" has D and L? V-A-L-I-D → but I is excluded? from second guess I was x, so avoid I. So ""valid"" has I and excluded.\n\nAnother: ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S → R in position 3.\n\n""wards"": W-A-R-D-S → R in 3.\n\n""harms"": H-A-R-M-S → R in 3.\n\n""barks"": B-A-R-K-S → R in 3.\n\nBut all have R in position 3.\n\nWe could place R in position 4: like _ A _ R _\n\nExamples: ""fairy"" → F-A-I-R-Y → but I is excluded, so not.\n\n""march"" → M-A-R-C-H → but C excluded.\n\n""hardy"": H-A-R-D-Y → R in position 3? H(1)-A(2)-R(3)-D(4)-Y(5), so R at 3.\n\nFor R at position 4: try ""wafer"" → but E excluded.\n\n""gaper"" → E excluded.\n\n""paper"" → but P,A,P,E,R — E excluded.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with R at position 4 and A at 2 without excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, for R at position 5: _ A _ _ R\n\nExamples: ""gator"" → but O is excluded? G-A-T-O-R → T and O excluded.\n\n""labor"" → but O excluded.\n\n""saber"" → S-A-B-E-R → E excluded.\n\nWe see that words with R in position 4 or 5 often include E, I, O, T which are excluded.\n\nPerhaps there are words like ""sadly"" but without R? But we must include R because it\'s in the word.\n\nSo, it might be that R is in position 3 because position 4 and 5 are rare with the constraints.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try a word with R in position 3 and A fixed at position 2.\n\nWe also want to include new letters.\n\nFor example: ""barks"" → letters: B, A, R, K, S.\n\nB, K, S are new.\n\nSince we don\'t know about duplicates, but we\'ll see.\n\nAnother word: ""parks"" → P, A, R, K, S.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut let me pick ""barks"" to use B.\n\nSo, possible guess: ""barks"".\n\nIn ""barks"":\n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: A (fixed correct, so we expect ✓)\n- Position 3: R (which we are testing: if it\'s correct, ✓; else, - because R is in the word)\n- Position 4: K (new)\n- Position 5: S (new)\n\nEven if R at position 3 is not correct, we will know from feedback.\n\nAlso, we get information on B, K, S.\n\nWe might choose a word with more vowels? But we have A already, and the only vowel we can use is U? because others are excluded? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y. E,I,O excluded, so we have U and Y? But we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n""barks"" has no U/Y, but that\'s fine.\n\nAlternatives: ""warms"" → W,A,R,M,S.\n\n""darks"" → D,A,R,K,S.\n\nBut I think ""barks"" is fine.\n\nWe could try ""marsh"" → M,A,R,S,H.\n\nBut S is a common letter.\n\nSince A is fixed and R is to be tested at position 3, and we want new letters, I\'ll go with ""barks"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""barks"".Based on the feedback:\n- A is confirmed in position 2.\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T.\n\nWe choose a word that:\n- Places A in position 2.\n- Places R in a new position (we test position 3).\n- Uses new, common letters (B, K, S) to maximize information.\n- Avoids excluded letters.\n\n""barks"" fits these criteria.\n\n<guess>barks</guess>We have feedback from two previous guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  \n   - R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not in position 2, A not in position 3.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ratio → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  \n   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  \n   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (new information).  \n   - T, I, O are not in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **A** is confirmed in position 2: the secret word has the pattern `_ A _ _ _`.  \n- **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  \n- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): C, E, I, N, O, T.  \n- **Valid letters to use**: All other letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  \n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- Since A is fixed at position 2, we need to place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.  \n- Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, D, B, K, M) and avoid excluded letters.  \n- Prioritize testing R in position 3, as it is common and positions 4/5 are harder with excluded vowels.  \n- Choose a word with A in position 2 and R in position 3 to confirm/deny R\'s position quickly.

We are given feedback for the third guess ""barks"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, which we already knew)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position! So R is in position 3)
- K: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3: so the pattern is _ A R _ _
- S is in the word, but not in position 5 (since ""barks"" has S in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

Also, from previous guesses:
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T, B, K (from this guess: B and K are out). Additionally excluded: from guess1: C, N, E; guess2: T, I, O; guess3: B, K.

So excluded: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.

The word must be in the pattern: _ A R _ _

And S is in the word, but not in position 5. So S could be in position 1 or position 4? But note: the pattern has four blanks, but positions 1 and 4 are open. Position 5 is the last one.

Also, we don't know if S appears multiple times? But we'll see.

Now, S cannot be in position 5 because in ""barks"" it was marked - (wrong position). So S must be in position 1 or 4? Or possibly other positions, but in this word it was at position 5, so if it were at another position that is allowed.

But note: the pattern is position 1: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ?.

We know S is not at position 5, and we don't know about position 1 and 4.

Also, we need to find another letter for position 1 and position 4 and 5? The word is five letters: [1] A (2) R (3) [4] [5]. So positions 1, 4, 5 are unknown.

But we know S is in the word, so one of positions 1,4,5 must be S? Or S might be duplicated? But we don't know.

Also, from the feedback, we know that the letter at position 5 is not S? But it might be that S is in the word but not at position 5, so S could be at position 1 or 4.

Additionally, we need to choose letters not excluded.

Excluded: B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. So available: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And S we know is in the word, so we must use it again? Or is it already covered? We need to include S in the word because it is in the secret word.

Also, we have to guess the word.

Possible words of the pattern _ A R _ _

And must contain S? But not in position 5, so S must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, the letter at position 5 could be another letter.

Now, common words fitting _ A R _ _:

- Let's consider S at position 1: then ""S A R _ _"". Examples: ""sorry"" but O excluded? And two R's? We already have R at position 3. ""sorry"" has O and Y? O excluded.

- ""sarge"" but E excluded? 

- ""start"" but T excluded? T is excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"" 

Words: ""sarky""? S-A-R-K-Y -> K excluded? Yes, K is excluded from guess3.

""safer"": S-A-F-E-R -> E excluded.

""sarin"": S-A-R-I-N -> I and N excluded.

It's difficult.

Now, S at position 4: then the word is _ A R S _ 

Examples: ""marks"" -> M-A-R-K-S -> but K excluded? And S at the end? But we will have S at position 4 and position 5 might be something.

But ""marks"" has K, which is excluded.

""parsnip"" is not 5 letters.

""harsh"": H-A-R-S-H -> letters: H, A, R, S, H. Now, H is allowed? And S is at position 4. This avoids excluded letters? H, A, R, S: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. But it has two H's? But we don't mind.

Position 5 must be H? Or in ""harsh"", it's H-A-R-S-H, so position 5 is H.

But the pattern is position 4 is S and position 5 is H? But S is at position 4? That might be fine if S is at position 4, but we don't know.

In this word, S is at position 4? Let's index: position 1: H, 2: A, 3: R, 4: S, 5: H? But ""harsh"" is spelled H-A-R-S-H? Yes.

But the word has five letters.

Now, S is at position 4? And in our feedback from ""barks"", S was at position 5 and marked as in the word but wrong position. Now if we put S at position 4, it might be correct.

Similarly, position 4 could be S.

But also, position 1 must be H? Or other.

Another word: ""marsh"": M-A-R-S-H -> same as above, but with M. But M not excluded.

But ""marsh"" has S at position 4? Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H.

But we don't know if S can be at position 4.

Similarly, ""garsh"" is not a word.

Or ""darts"" but T excluded? D-A-R-T-S -> T excluded.

Another: ""laure"" not a word.

What about ""parse"": P-A-R-S-E -> but E excluded.

""warns"": W-A-R-N-S -> N excluded? N is excluded.

So, words ending with S at position 4: ""marsh"" is valid? Let me confirm: ""marsh"" is a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""harsh"" is a word.

But ""harsh"" has H at both ends? But that might be allowed.

But we have S at position 4? And the last letter is H.

But in our pattern, position 5 can be H.

Similarly, ""laris"" not a word.

Another: ""paris"" but that's P-A-R-I-S -> but I excluded? I is excluded.

""carts"" C excluded and T.

So, one possibility is ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".

But we also have the feedback that S is in the word but not in position 5. Both ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" have S at position 4? And H at position 5? Or in ""harsh"": letters: position 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H? So S at position 4? Yes.

But is S allowed at position 4? We don't have information against it.

But also, position 1 must be H? Or in ""marsh"": M instead of H.

But we must not use excluded letters.

We could try ""wares"" but E excluded.

Another word: ""darbs"" not a word.

""gars"" not 5 letters.

So, ""marsh"" or ""harsh"" seem possible.

But we also know that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""harsh"" has double H? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate H.

Similarly, ""marsh"" has distinct: M,A,R,S,H.

But we need to guess.

Since S is in the word and not in position 5, position 4 is a candidate.

We could also consider S in position 1? But we couldn't find valid words with S in position 1 without excluded letters.

For example, ""saury"" is not a common word? Or ""sards"" not a word.

""salad"" has L and D, but no R? We need R at position 3.

Pattern must have A at 2, R at 3.

So only possibility is S at position 1 or 4? Or at other positions? But position 2 and 3 are taken by A and R? So only position 1 and 4 and 5.

But S cannot be at position 5? Then S must be at position 1 or 4.

Position 1: S A R _ _

Valid words? ""sarin"" excluded letters.

""saree"" has E.

""sarge"" has E.

""sarsa"" not a word?.

""sarza"" not English.

""sandy"" has N and D? But N excluded.

So, we come back to S in position 4: _ A R S _

Now, what can be position 1 and position 5?

Position 1: any letter except excluded ones, and S? But S might be at position 4, so position 1 cannot be S? Unless duplicate S? But we don't know.

But let's assume no duplicate for now.

So position 1: must be a letter not S? Because S is at position 4.

Then position 5: any letter not excluded.

Possible:
- ""barks"" we tried, but we know B and K out.
- ""marks"" has K? K excluded.
- ""parks"" has P? It was not tested? But in ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S -> K excluded? So not.

Words: 
""larva"" has I? No, L,A,R,V,A? But A duplicate? Pattern: L(1), A(2) fixed, R(3) fixed, then ""v"" position 4? But we want S at position 4? Here we put S at position 4, but if not, it doesn't satisfy.

We need the word to have S at position 4? Or not necessarily? We know S is in the word, but we don't know its position except not position 5? So it could be position 1 or 4.

But for this guess, we need to include S.

But let's go back to the pattern _ A R _ _

We must include S.

So, possible guesses:

- If we put S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"", then we need to fill the last two positions with available letters without excluded ones. For example:
  - ""sarges"" too long.
  - ""sarky"": S,A,R,K,Y -> K excluded.
  - ""sards"": not a word? Sards is not common English.
  - ""saree"": 5 letters? but E excluded.

So no good.

- Put S at position 4: ""x a r s y"", where x and y are available letters.

For example:
  x = D? ""darsy"" not word.
  x = F? ""farsy"" not word.
  x = G? ""gars"" not 5.
  x = H? ""hars"" not 5, but ""harsh"" is 5: H,A,R,S,H -> but we have S at position 4 and H at position 5.

Similarly, ""marsh"": M,A,R,S,H.

""warsh"" not common? But in some dialects.

""pars"" not.

""cars"" not 5.

So ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" are valid.

Also, ""barsh"" not a word.

""yarsh"" not common.

So, likely ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".

We can also consider ""parse"" but E excluded.

Another possibility: perhaps S is at position 1 and the word has S in position 1 and R at 3, but duplicate? For example, ""sassy"" has no R.

Not.

So, let's choose between ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".

We know that B was excluded, and K was excluded, etc.

We can use L? ""lars"" not 5.

Another word: ""aarts"" not starting with _.

Or ""darts"" T excluded.

So, we'll guess ""marsh"" to test M and S and H.

But in ""marsh"", S is at position 4? So if S is at position 4, it might be correct or wrong position? We don't know yet.

Similarly, H at position 5.

In our feedback, from ""barks"", S was marked as ""in word but wrong position"". It was in position 5, so S is in word but position 5 is wrong. This doesn't say anything about position 4.

In ""marsh"", we would test S at position 4.

If the secret word has S at position 4, this will correct, else if at position 1, it would be marked accordingly.

But we have only two possibilities: S at position 1 or S at position 4? But we haven't found a valid word with S at position 1.

So, let's assume S at position 4? Then we expect ""marsh"" or similar.

But wait, position 5 could be another letter.

Another word: ""tarts"" T excluded.

So, I think ""marsh"" is a valid guess.

Also, ""juice"" not.

Alternatively, ""fared"" E excluded.

So, I'll go with ""marsh"".

Guess: ""marsh""

But let's see if it fits the constraints.

Secret word pattern: _ A R _ _

Excluded letters: not used? M, A, R, S, H — A and R are in, M and H not tested, S in. Excluded letters covered: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T.

S is at position 4.

If the secret word has S at position 4, we might get ✓ for S.

Similarly for other.

We are not sure, but we'll see.

The guess is ""marsh"".
</think>
We have feedback from three previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
     - R and A are in the word, but:  
       - R is not in position 2.  
       - A is not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio** → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - A is confirmed in position 2 (secret word pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - T, I, O are not in the word.  
     - Combined exclusions: C, E, I, N, O, T.  

3. **Guess 3: barks** → B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - A and R are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 → secret word pattern: `_ A R _ _`.  
   - R is in position 3 (✓).  
     - B and K are not in the word → add to exclusions: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.  
     - S is in the word but not in position 5 (wrong position).  
   - S must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are taken).  

### Key Constraints for New Guess (Guess 4):
- **Pattern**: `? A R ? ?`  
  - Position 2: A (✓)  
  - Position 3: R (✓)  
- **S is present**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (not 5, as per feedback).  
- **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T → valid letters: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Must be a valid 5-letter English word**.  

### Strategy:
- Test **S in position 4** since position 1 is the only other option for S, but finding common words with S in position 1 and the pattern `S A R ? ?` is difficult due to exclusions (e.g., ""sarge"" invalid for containing E).  
- Prioritize **position 4 for S** with common letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., H, M, P, D, L).  
- The word **""marsh""** fits:  
  - Pattern: `M A R S H`  
  - S in position 4 (testing its position).  
  - Uses new common letters (M, H) not excluded.  
  - Avoids redundant guesses.  
- If correct, this could solve the word; if not, feedback will clarify S's position and other letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
<step-by-step>
- From Guess 3 feedback, S is in the word but not in position 5. Combined with the fixed pattern (_ A R _ _), S must be in position 1 or 4.
- Words with S in position 1 (e.g., ""sards"", ""sarin"") are invalid due to exclusions (I, N) or non-common words.
- Words with S in position 4: _ A R S _ → common options include ""marsh"", ""harsh"", ""parse"", but ""parse"" has E (excluded), leaving ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".
- ""marsh"" (validating: M and H are untested; avoids exclusions) and ""harsh"" (uses H twice, less common) → prefer ""marsh"" to test M and H separately.
- Incorrectly guessing ""marsh"" will confirm if S is in position 4 or guide to position 1 for future guesses (with 3 tries remaining).
- Feedback on M and H will provide new information (e.g., M absence or position).
</step-by-step>

<guess>marsh</guess>",marsh,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""barks"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, which we already knew)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position! So R is in position 3)
- K: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3: so the pattern is _ A R _ _
- S is in the word, but not in position 5 (since ""barks"" has S in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

Also, from previous guesses:
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T, B, K (from this guess: B and K are out). Additionally excluded: from guess1: C, N, E; guess2: T, I, O; guess3: B, K.

So excluded: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.

The word must be in the pattern: _ A R _ _

And S is in the word, but not in position 5. So S could be in position 1 or position 4? But note: the pattern has four blanks, but positions 1 and 4 are open. Position 5 is the last one.

Also, we don't know if S appears multiple times? But we'll see.

Now, S cannot be in position 5 because in ""barks"" it was marked - (wrong position). So S must be in position 1 or 4? Or possibly other positions, but in this word it was at position 5, so if it were at another position that is allowed.

But note: the pattern is position 1: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ?.

We know S is not at position 5, and we don't know about position 1 and 4.

Also, we need to find another letter for position 1 and position 4 and 5? The word is five letters: [1] A (2) R (3) [4] [5]. So positions 1, 4, 5 are unknown.

But we know S is in the word, so one of positions 1,4,5 must be S? Or S might be duplicated? But we don't know.

Also, from the feedback, we know that the letter at position 5 is not S? But it might be that S is in the word but not at position 5, so S could be at position 1 or 4.

Additionally, we need to choose letters not excluded.

Excluded: B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. So available: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And S we know is in the word, so we must use it again? Or is it already covered? We need to include S in the word because it is in the secret word.

Also, we have to guess the word.

Possible words of the pattern _ A R _ _

And must contain S? But not in position 5, so S must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, the letter at position 5 could be another letter.

Now, common words fitting _ A R _ _:

- Let's consider S at position 1: then ""S A R _ _"". Examples: ""sorry"" but O excluded? And two R's? We already have R at position 3. ""sorry"" has O and Y? O excluded.

- ""sarge"" but E excluded? 

- ""start"" but T excluded? T is excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"" 

Words: ""sarky""? S-A-R-K-Y -> K excluded? Yes, K is excluded from guess3.

""safer"": S-A-F-E-R -> E excluded.

""sarin"": S-A-R-I-N -> I and N excluded.

It's difficult.

Now, S at position 4: then the word is _ A R S _ 

Examples: ""marks"" -> M-A-R-K-S -> but K excluded? And S at the end? But we will have S at position 4 and position 5 might be something.

But ""marks"" has K, which is excluded.

""parsnip"" is not 5 letters.

""harsh"": H-A-R-S-H -> letters: H, A, R, S, H. Now, H is allowed? And S is at position 4. This avoids excluded letters? H, A, R, S: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. But it has two H's? But we don't mind.

Position 5 must be H? Or in ""harsh"", it's H-A-R-S-H, so position 5 is H.

But the pattern is position 4 is S and position 5 is H? But S is at position 4? That might be fine if S is at position 4, but we don't know.

In this word, S is at position 4? Let's index: position 1: H, 2: A, 3: R, 4: S, 5: H? But ""harsh"" is spelled H-A-R-S-H? Yes.

But the word has five letters.

Now, S is at position 4? And in our feedback from ""barks"", S was at position 5 and marked as in the word but wrong position. Now if we put S at position 4, it might be correct.

Similarly, position 4 could be S.

But also, position 1 must be H? Or other.

Another word: ""marsh"": M-A-R-S-H -> same as above, but with M. But M not excluded.

But ""marsh"" has S at position 4? Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H.

But we don't know if S can be at position 4.

Similarly, ""garsh"" is not a word.

Or ""darts"" but T excluded? D-A-R-T-S -> T excluded.

Another: ""laure"" not a word.

What about ""parse"": P-A-R-S-E -> but E excluded.

""warns"": W-A-R-N-S -> N excluded? N is excluded.

So, words ending with S at position 4: ""marsh"" is valid? Let me confirm: ""marsh"" is a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""harsh"" is a word.

But ""harsh"" has H at both ends? But that might be allowed.

But we have S at position 4? And the last letter is H.

But in our pattern, position 5 can be H.

Similarly, ""laris"" not a word.

Another: ""paris"" but that's P-A-R-I-S -> but I excluded? I is excluded.

""carts"" C excluded and T.

So, one possibility is ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".

But we also have the feedback that S is in the word but not in position 5. Both ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" have S at position 4? And H at position 5? Or in ""harsh"": letters: position 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H? So S at position 4? Yes.

But is S allowed at position 4? We don't have information against it.

But also, position 1 must be H? Or in ""marsh"": M instead of H.

But we must not use excluded letters.

We could try ""wares"" but E excluded.

Another word: ""darbs"" not a word.

""gars"" not 5 letters.

So, ""marsh"" or ""harsh"" seem possible.

But we also know that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""harsh"" has double H? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate H.

Similarly, ""marsh"" has distinct: M,A,R,S,H.

But we need to guess.

Since S is in the word and not in position 5, position 4 is a candidate.

We could also consider S in position 1? But we couldn't find valid words with S in position 1 without excluded letters.

For example, ""saury"" is not a common word? Or ""sards"" not a word.

""salad"" has L and D, but no R? We need R at position 3.

Pattern must have A at 2, R at 3.

So only possibility is S at position 1 or 4? Or at other positions? But position 2 and 3 are taken by A and R? So only position 1 and 4 and 5.

But S cannot be at position 5? Then S must be at position 1 or 4.

Position 1: S A R _ _

Valid words? ""sarin"" excluded letters.

""saree"" has E.

""sarge"" has E.

""sarsa"" not a word?.

""sarza"" not English.

""sandy"" has N and D? But N excluded.

So, we come back to S in position 4: _ A R S _

Now, what can be position 1 and position 5?

Position 1: any letter except excluded ones, and S? But S might be at position 4, so position 1 cannot be S? Unless duplicate S? But we don't know.

But let's assume no duplicate for now.

So position 1: must be a letter not S? Because S is at position 4.

Then position 5: any letter not excluded.

Possible:
- ""barks"" we tried, but we know B and K out.
- ""marks"" has K? K excluded.
- ""parks"" has P? It was not tested? But in ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S -> K excluded? So not.

Words: 
""larva"" has I? No, L,A,R,V,A? But A duplicate? Pattern: L(1), A(2) fixed, R(3) fixed, then ""v"" position 4? But we want S at position 4? Here we put S at position 4, but if not, it doesn't satisfy.

We need the word to have S at position 4? Or not necessarily? We know S is in the word, but we don't know its position except not position 5? So it could be position 1 or 4.

But for this guess, we need to include S.

But let's go back to the pattern _ A R _ _

We must include S.

So, possible guesses:

- If we put S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"", then we need to fill the last two positions with available letters without excluded ones. For example:
  - ""sarges"" too long.
  - ""sarky"": S,A,R,K,Y -> K excluded.
  - ""sards"": not a word? Sards is not common English.
  - ""saree"": 5 letters? but E excluded.

So no good.

- Put S at position 4: ""x a r s y"", where x and y are available letters.

For example:
  x = D? ""darsy"" not word.
  x = F? ""farsy"" not word.
  x = G? ""gars"" not 5.
  x = H? ""hars"" not 5, but ""harsh"" is 5: H,A,R,S,H -> but we have S at position 4 and H at position 5.

Similarly, ""marsh"": M,A,R,S,H.

""warsh"" not common? But in some dialects.

""pars"" not.

""cars"" not 5.

So ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" are valid.

Also, ""barsh"" not a word.

""yarsh"" not common.

So, likely ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".

We can also consider ""parse"" but E excluded.

Another possibility: perhaps S is at position 1 and the word has S in position 1 and R at 3, but duplicate? For example, ""sassy"" has no R.

Not.

So, let's choose between ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".

We know that B was excluded, and K was excluded, etc.

We can use L? ""lars"" not 5.

Another word: ""aarts"" not starting with _.

Or ""darts"" T excluded.

So, we'll guess ""marsh"" to test M and S and H.

But in ""marsh"", S is at position 4? So if S is at position 4, it might be correct or wrong position? We don't know yet.

Similarly, H at position 5.

In our feedback, from ""barks"", S was marked as ""in word but wrong position"". It was in position 5, so S is in word but position 5 is wrong. This doesn't say anything about position 4.

In ""marsh"", we would test S at position 4.

If the secret word has S at position 4, this will correct, else if at position 1, it would be marked accordingly.

But we have only two possibilities: S at position 1 or S at position 4? But we haven't found a valid word with S at position 1.

So, let's assume S at position 4? Then we expect ""marsh"" or similar.

But wait, position 5 could be another letter.

Another word: ""tarts"" T excluded.

So, I think ""marsh"" is a valid guess.

Also, ""juice"" not.

Alternatively, ""fared"" E excluded.

So, I'll go with ""marsh"".

Guess: ""marsh""

But let's see if it fits the constraints.

Secret word pattern: _ A R _ _

Excluded letters: not used? M, A, R, S, H — A and R are in, M and H not tested, S in. Excluded letters covered: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T.

S is at position 4.

If the secret word has S at position 4, we might get ✓ for S.

Similarly for other.

We are not sure, but we'll see.

The guess is ""marsh"".We have feedback from three previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
     - R and A are in the word, but:  
       - R is not in position 2.  
       - A is not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio** → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - A is confirmed in position 2 (secret word pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - T, I, O are not in the word.  
     - Combined exclusions: C, E, I, N, O, T.  

3. **Guess 3: barks** → B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - A and R are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 → secret word pattern: `_ A R _ _`.  
   - R is in position 3 (✓).  
     - B and K are not in the word → add to exclusions: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.  
     - S is in the word but not in position 5 (wrong position).  
   - S must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are taken).  

### Key Constraints for New Guess (Guess 4):
- **Pattern**: `? A R ? ?`  
  - Position 2: A (✓)  
  - Position 3: R (✓)  
- **S is present**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (not 5, as per feedback).  
- **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T → valid letters: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Must be a valid 5-letter English word**.  

### Strategy:
- Test **S in position 4** since position 1 is the only other option for S, but finding common words with S in position 1 and the pattern `S A R ? ?` is difficult due to exclusions (e.g., ""sarge"" invalid for containing E).  
- Prioritize **position 4 for S** with common letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., H, M, P, D, L).  
- The word **""marsh""** fits:  
  - Pattern: `M A R S H`  
  - S in position 4 (testing its position).  
  - Uses new common letters (M, H) not excluded.  
  - Avoids redundant guesses.  
- If correct, this could solve the word; if not, feedback will clarify S's position and other letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
<step-by-step>
- From Guess 3 feedback, S is in the word but not in position 5. Combined with the fixed pattern (_ A R _ _), S must be in position 1 or 4.
- Words with S in position 1 (e.g., ""sards"", ""sarin"") are invalid due to exclusions (I, N) or non-common words.
- Words with S in position 4: _ A R S _ → common options include ""marsh"", ""harsh"", ""parse"", but ""parse"" has E (excluded), leaving ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".
- ""marsh"" (validating: M and H are untested; avoids exclusions) and ""harsh"" (uses H twice, less common) → prefer ""marsh"" to test M and H separately.
- Incorrectly guessing ""marsh"" will confirm if S is in position 4 or guide to position 1 for future guesses (with 3 tries remaining).
- Feedback on M and H will provide new information (e.g., M absence or position).

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes R and A, but in different positions than in the first guess (since in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were wrong positions).
- We can try to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"" and was wrong, so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, it can be in any position except 2. But note: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3 in our next guess.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and must include R and A.

Let's consider possible words. We can try to use a word that has R and A, and also some other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.), but avoiding C, N, E.

One common starting word is ""roast"", but let's check:
- ""roast"" has R in position 1, which is different from position 2. It has A in position 3? But in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was marked as wrong position. So in the secret word, A cannot be in position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""roast"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So, we need a word that has:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 3

And without C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A, and are 5 letters.

Possible words: 
- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is in position 3? We don't know if that's allowed. And A is in position 2? We don't have information about position 2 for A? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 3. So A can be in position 1,2,4,5.

But note: we also have to consider that we have only one R? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters. So we have to be cautious.

Another word: ""trial"" -> T, R, I, A, L. 
- R is in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, no: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong, but we might get more information? However, it's better to try a different position to see if we can get a correct position.

But note: we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a new position and A in a new position, and also includes other new letters.

Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

For example:
- ""ratio"": R in position 1, A in position 2 -> that's okay because A was not in position 3, but we don't know about position 2 for A. And R is in position 1, which is new.

But ""ratio"" has T, I, O which we haven't tried.

Another word: ""pairs"" -> P, A, I, R, S. Here, A is in position 2 and R is in position 4. So that avoids position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters. ""pairs"" doesn't have C, N, E.

Another common word: ""stare"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's try to come up with a word that has R and A, and uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, S, L, etc.) without E, C, N.

Possible words:
- ""ratio"" -> R, A, T, I, O -> no E, C, N. R is in 1, A in 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- ""paint"" -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""paint"" is invalid because of N.
- ""trail"" -> T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? We must avoid R in position 2? Actually, we can try it? But we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

In ""trail"", R is in position 2, so we avoid that.

How about ""fairy""? F, A, I, R, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 4. That's okay.

But let's choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.

Another idea: ""radio"" -> R, A, D, I, O. R in 1, A in 2. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word.

Alternatively, ""oasis"" -> but no R? We must include R and A? Actually, we don't have to include them, but we know they are in the word so we should use them to get position information.

But we can also use other letters to test. However, since we know R and A are in the word, it's efficient to use them again to try to find their correct positions.

So, I think ""ratio"" is a good candidate because:
- It has R in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).
- It introduces T, I, O which are common.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see.

Another candidate: ""stair"" -> S, T, A, I, R. A in position 3? But we must avoid A in position 3? Because in the first guess, A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong again. So to avoid wasting a position, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1,2,4,5.

In ""stair"", A is in position 3? Let me check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

How about ""straw"": S, T, R, A, W. R in position 3? And A in position 4? That's okay. But we have W, which is less common.

I think ""ratio"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""ratio"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So, I'll go with ""ratio"".

We are going to guess ""ratio"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we'll see from the feedback.

So, the next guess is ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, N, E.
- Include R and A, but place R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, I, O) to gather more information.

The word ""ratio"" meets these criteria:
- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
- Uses new letters T, I, O.
- Avoids C, N, E.

<guess>ratio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains R and A (from first guess), and now A is in the correct position (second guess). In ""ratio"", A is in the second position, so the second letter of A is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the secret word has A as its second letter.

2. R is in the word but not in the correct position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (which we now know is A), so that was wrong. In ""ratio"", R was in position 1, and it was marked wrong position. So R is not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.

3. We know the secret word does not contain C, N, E (from first guess), and now T, I, O (from second guess) are also not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have A in the second position: _ A _ _ _

And R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2.

Also, we need to find other letters that are in the word.

From ""crane"", we had R and A, meaning there are at least two letters we know. But there might be more.

Since we have A fixed at position 2, and R somewhere in 3-5, we need to choose a word that:
- Has A in the second position (fixed)
- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but avoid position 1 and 2, which we already know are wrong for R)
- Uses only letters that haven't been excluded: so avoid C, N, E, T, I, O.
- We can include new letters to get more information.

The excluded letters are: C, E, I, N, O, T. So avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word must have R in one of the last three positions.

We should try a word that puts R in a different position each time until we find it, but also test other common letters.

Since there are three positions for R (3,4,5) and we have limited guesses, we might try to cover more than one possibility.

But let's think of common words with A as second letter and R in the word.

Possible words with A in second position: 
- S A L A D? But we haven't tested S, L, D.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

Also, R must be in the word.

So, we need words like:
- _ A _ R _ : R in fourth position
- _ A R _ _ : but R in position 3? However, we haven't tried that yet? We know R is not in position 1 or 2, but position 3 is possible.

In fact, we can try to place R in position 3, 4, or 5 in this guess.

Also, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

Consider the word ""parka"", but we have K and A again? Also, we have to avoid A being duplicated? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the word ""parka"", A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is in the word, but we don't know how many times. Also, ""parka"" has P, A, R, K, A.

But K is not excluded? And P?

But we must avoid the excluded letters. ""parka"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let's check: P, A, R, K, A — excluded are C,E,I,N,O,T — none in ""parka"". So it's valid.

But also, we have two A's? The feedback might be affected if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to simplify.

But let's proceed.

In ""parka"", R is in position 3? P-A-R-K-A → R at position 3.

If the secret word has R at position 3, then we might get a ✓ for R? Or if not, we get - or x? We know R is in the word, so it won't be x.

But we need to get information.

Another word: ""marsh"" → M-A-R-S-H → A at 2, R at 3.

But we haven't excluded M,S,H.

Another word: ""lapse"" → but E is excluded, so not.

Since A is fixed at position 2, we should try R in position 3, next position we haven't tested.

Possible: use a word with R in position 3 to test if it's there.

Similarly, we can test other letters.

But note: we only have one R? The feedback doesn't specify, so we don't know.

We'll know from the feedback.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me list some words with pattern _ A _ _ _ that include R and avoid excluded letters.

For example:
- ""bards"": B-A-R-D-S → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), S(5). Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,I,N,O,T.
- ""fault"": but T is excluded? T is in excluded because from second guess T was x. So avoid T.
- ""valid"" has D and L? V-A-L-I-D → but I is excluded? from second guess I was x, so avoid I. So ""valid"" has I and excluded.

Another: ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S → R in position 3.

""wards"": W-A-R-D-S → R in 3.

""harms"": H-A-R-M-S → R in 3.

""barks"": B-A-R-K-S → R in 3.

But all have R in position 3.

We could place R in position 4: like _ A _ R _

Examples: ""fairy"" → F-A-I-R-Y → but I is excluded, so not.

""march"" → M-A-R-C-H → but C excluded.

""hardy"": H-A-R-D-Y → R in position 3? H(1)-A(2)-R(3)-D(4)-Y(5), so R at 3.

For R at position 4: try ""wafer"" → but E excluded.

""gaper"" → E excluded.

""paper"" → but P,A,P,E,R — E excluded.

It's hard to find words with R at position 4 and A at 2 without excluded letters.

Similarly, for R at position 5: _ A _ _ R

Examples: ""gator"" → but O is excluded? G-A-T-O-R → T and O excluded.

""labor"" → but O excluded.

""saber"" → S-A-B-E-R → E excluded.

We see that words with R in position 4 or 5 often include E, I, O, T which are excluded.

Perhaps there are words like ""sadly"" but without R? But we must include R because it's in the word.

So, it might be that R is in position 3 because position 4 and 5 are rare with the constraints.

Therefore, let's try a word with R in position 3 and A fixed at position 2.

We also want to include new letters.

For example: ""barks"" → letters: B, A, R, K, S.

B, K, S are new.

Since we don't know about duplicates, but we'll see.

Another word: ""parks"" → P, A, R, K, S.

I think both are good.

But let me pick ""barks"" to use B.

So, possible guess: ""barks"".

In ""barks"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (fixed correct, so we expect ✓)
- Position 3: R (which we are testing: if it's correct, ✓; else, - because R is in the word)
- Position 4: K (new)
- Position 5: S (new)

Even if R at position 3 is not correct, we will know from feedback.

Also, we get information on B, K, S.

We might choose a word with more vowels? But we have A already, and the only vowel we can use is U? because others are excluded? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y. E,I,O excluded, so we have U and Y? But we don't know if they are in the word.

""barks"" has no U/Y, but that's fine.

Alternatives: ""warms"" → W,A,R,M,S.

""darks"" → D,A,R,K,S.

But I think ""barks"" is fine.

We could try ""marsh"" → M,A,R,S,H.

But S is a common letter.

Since A is fixed and R is to be tested at position 3, and we want new letters, I'll go with ""barks"".

So, the guess is ""barks"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T.

We choose a word that:
- Places A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (we test position 3).
- Uses new, common letters (B, K, S) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters.

""barks"" fits these criteria.

<guess>barks</guess>We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
   - R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not in position 2, A not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (new information).  
   - T, I, O are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- **A** is confirmed in position 2: the secret word has the pattern `_ A _ _ _`.  
- **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): C, E, I, N, O, T.  
- **Valid letters to use**: All other letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Since A is fixed at position 2, we need to place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, D, B, K, M) and avoid excluded letters.  
- Prioritize testing R in position 3, as it is common and positions 4/5 are harder with excluded vowels.  
- Choose a word with A in position 2 and R in position 3 to confirm/deny R's position quickly. Include other letters to test them.  

The word **""barks""** fits well:  
- Places A in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  
- Places R in position 3 (to test this position).  
- Uses new letters B, K, S (common and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicate letters in tested positions and excluded letters.

<guess>barks</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: barks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""barks"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, which we already knew)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position! So R is in position 3)
- K: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3: so the pattern is _ A R _ _
- S is in the word, but not in position 5 (since ""barks"" has S in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

Also, from previous guesses:
- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T, B, K (from this guess: B and K are out). Additionally excluded: from guess1: C, N, E; guess2: T, I, O; guess3: B, K.

So excluded: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.

The word must be in the pattern: _ A R _ _

And S is in the word, but not in position 5. So S could be in position 1 or position 4? But note: the pattern has four blanks, but positions 1 and 4 are open. Position 5 is the last one.

Also, we don't know if S appears multiple times? But we'll see.

Now, S cannot be in position 5 because in ""barks"" it was marked - (wrong position). So S must be in position 1 or 4? Or possibly other positions, but in this word it was at position 5, so if it were at another position that is allowed.

But note: the pattern is position 1: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ?.

We know S is not at position 5, and we don't know about position 1 and 4.

Also, we need to find another letter for position 1 and position 4 and 5? The word is five letters: [1] A (2) R (3) [4] [5]. So positions 1, 4, 5 are unknown.

But we know S is in the word, so one of positions 1,4,5 must be S? Or S might be duplicated? But we don't know.

Also, from the feedback, we know that the letter at position 5 is not S? But it might be that S is in the word but not at position 5, so S could be at position 1 or 4.

Additionally, we need to choose letters not excluded.

Excluded: B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. So available: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And S we know is in the word, so we must use it again? Or is it already covered? We need to include S in the word because it is in the secret word.

Also, we have to guess the word.

Possible words of the pattern _ A R _ _

And must contain S? But not in position 5, so S must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, the letter at position 5 could be another letter.

Now, common words fitting _ A R _ _:

- Let's consider S at position 1: then ""S A R _ _"". Examples: ""sorry"" but O excluded? And two R's? We already have R at position 3. ""sorry"" has O and Y? O excluded.

- ""sarge"" but E excluded? 

- ""start"" but T excluded? T is excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"" 

Words: ""sarky""? S-A-R-K-Y -> K excluded? Yes, K is excluded from guess3.

""safer"": S-A-F-E-R -> E excluded.

""sarin"": S-A-R-I-N -> I and N excluded.

It's difficult.

Now, S at position 4: then the word is _ A R S _ 

Examples: ""marks"" -> M-A-R-K-S -> but K excluded? And S at the end? But we will have S at position 4 and position 5 might be something.

But ""marks"" has K, which is excluded.

""parsnip"" is not 5 letters.

""harsh"": H-A-R-S-H -> letters: H, A, R, S, H. Now, H is allowed? And S is at position 4. This avoids excluded letters? H, A, R, S: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. But it has two H's? But we don't mind.

Position 5 must be H? Or in ""harsh"", it's H-A-R-S-H, so position 5 is H.

But the pattern is position 4 is S and position 5 is H? But S is at position 4? That might be fine if S is at position 4, but we don't know.

In this word, S is at position 4? Let's index: position 1: H, 2: A, 3: R, 4: S, 5: H? But ""harsh"" is spelled H-A-R-S-H? Yes.

But the word has five letters.

Now, S is at position 4? And in our feedback from ""barks"", S was at position 5 and marked as in the word but wrong position. Now if we put S at position 4, it might be correct.

Similarly, position 4 could be S.

But also, position 1 must be H? Or other.

Another word: ""marsh"": M-A-R-S-H -> same as above, but with M. But M not excluded.

But ""marsh"" has S at position 4? Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H.

But we don't know if S can be at position 4.

Similarly, ""garsh"" is not a word.

Or ""darts"" but T excluded? D-A-R-T-S -> T excluded.

Another: ""laure"" not a word.

What about ""parse"": P-A-R-S-E -> but E excluded.

""warns"": W-A-R-N-S -> N excluded? N is excluded.

So, words ending with S at position 4: ""marsh"" is valid? Let me confirm: ""marsh"" is a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""harsh"" is a word.

But ""harsh"" has H at both ends? But that might be allowed.

But we have S at position 4? And the last letter is H.

But in our pattern, position 5 can be H.

Similarly, ""laris"" not a word.

Another: ""paris"" but that's P-A-R-I-S -> but I excluded? I is excluded.

""carts"" C excluded and T.

So, one possibility is ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".

But we also have the feedback that S is in the word but not in position 5. Both ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" have S at position 4? And H at position 5? Or in ""harsh"": letters: position 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H? So S at position 4? Yes.

But is S allowed at position 4? We don't have information against it.

But also, position 1 must be H? Or in ""marsh"": M instead of H.

But we must not use excluded letters.

We could try ""wares"" but E excluded.

Another word: ""darbs"" not a word.

""gars"" not 5 letters.

So, ""marsh"" or ""harsh"" seem possible.

But we also know that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""harsh"" has double H? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate H.

Similarly, ""marsh"" has distinct: M,A,R,S,H.

But we need to guess.

Since S is in the word and not in position 5, position 4 is a candidate.

We could also consider S in position 1? But we couldn't find valid words with S in position 1 without excluded letters.

For example, ""saury"" is not a common word? Or ""sards"" not a word.

""salad"" has L and D, but no R? We need R at position 3.

Pattern must have A at 2, R at 3.

So only possibility is S at position 1 or 4? Or at other positions? But position 2 and 3 are taken by A and R? So only position 1 and 4 and 5.

But S cannot be at position 5? Then S must be at position 1 or 4.

Position 1: S A R _ _

Valid words? ""sarin"" excluded letters.

""saree"" has E.

""sarge"" has E.

""sarsa"" not a word?.

""sarza"" not English.

""sandy"" has N and D? But N excluded.

So, we come back to S in position 4: _ A R S _

Now, what can be position 1 and position 5?

Position 1: any letter except excluded ones, and S? But S might be at position 4, so position 1 cannot be S? Unless duplicate S? But we don't know.

But let's assume no duplicate for now.

So position 1: must be a letter not S? Because S is at position 4.

Then position 5: any letter not excluded.

Possible:
- ""barks"" we tried, but we know B and K out.
- ""marks"" has K? K excluded.
- ""parks"" has P? It was not tested? But in ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S -> K excluded? So not.

Words: 
""larva"" has I? No, L,A,R,V,A? But A duplicate? Pattern: L(1), A(2) fixed, R(3) fixed, then ""v"" position 4? But we want S at position 4? Here we put S at position 4, but if not, it doesn't satisfy.

We need the word to have S at position 4? Or not necessarily? We know S is in the word, but we don't know its position except not position 5? So it could be position 1 or 4.

But for this guess, we need to include S.

But let's go back to the pattern _ A R _ _

We must include S.

So, possible guesses:

- If we put S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"", then we need to fill the last two positions with available letters without excluded ones. For example:
  - ""sarges"" too long.
  - ""sarky"": S,A,R,K,Y -> K excluded.
  - ""sards"": not a word? Sards is not common English.
  - ""saree"": 5 letters? but E excluded.

So no good.

- Put S at position 4: ""x a r s y"", where x and y are available letters.

For example:
  x = D? ""darsy"" not word.
  x = F? ""farsy"" not word.
  x = G? ""gars"" not 5.
  x = H? ""hars"" not 5, but ""harsh"" is 5: H,A,R,S,H -> but we have S at position 4 and H at position 5.

Similarly, ""marsh"": M,A,R,S,H.

""warsh"" not common? But in some dialects.

""pars"" not.

""cars"" not 5.

So ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" are valid.

Also, ""barsh"" not a word.

""yarsh"" not common.

So, likely ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".

We can also consider ""parse"" but E excluded.

Another possibility: perhaps S is at position 1 and the word has S in position 1 and R at 3, but duplicate? For example, ""sassy"" has no R.

Not.

So, let's choose between ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".

We know that B was excluded, and K was excluded, etc.

We can use L? ""lars"" not 5.

Another word: ""aarts"" not starting with _.

Or ""darts"" T excluded.

So, we'll guess ""marsh"" to test M and S and H.

But in ""marsh"", S is at position 4? So if S is at position 4, it might be correct or wrong position? We don't know yet.

Similarly, H at position 5.

In our feedback, from ""barks"", S was marked as ""in word but wrong position"". It was in position 5, so S is in word but position 5 is wrong. This doesn't say anything about position 4.

In ""marsh"", we would test S at position 4.

If the secret word has S at position 4, this will correct, else if at position 1, it would be marked accordingly.

But we have only two possibilities: S at position 1 or S at position 4? But we haven't found a valid word with S at position 1.

So, let's assume S at position 4? Then we expect ""marsh"" or similar.

But wait, position 5 could be another letter.

Another word: ""tarts"" T excluded.

So, I think ""marsh"" is a valid guess.

Also, ""juice"" not.

Alternatively, ""fared"" E excluded.

So, I'll go with ""marsh"".

Guess: ""marsh""

But let's see if it fits the constraints.

Secret word pattern: _ A R _ _

Excluded letters: not used? M, A, R, S, H — A and R are in, M and H not tested, S in. Excluded letters covered: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T.

S is at position 4.

If the secret word has S at position 4, we might get ✓ for S.

Similarly for other.

We are not sure, but we'll see.

The guess is ""marsh"".We have feedback from three previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  
     - R and A are in the word, but:  
       - R is not in position 2.  
       - A is not in position 3.  

2. **Guess 2: ratio** → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - A is confirmed in position 2 (secret word pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - T, I, O are not in the word.  
     - Combined exclusions: C, E, I, N, O, T.  

3. **Guess 3: barks** → B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)  
   - **Deductions**:  
     - A and R are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 → secret word pattern: `_ A R _ _`.  
   - R is in position 3 (✓).  
     - B and K are not in the word → add to exclusions: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.  
     - S is in the word but not in position 5 (wrong position).  
   - S must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are taken).  

### Key Constraints for New Guess (Guess 4):
- **Pattern**: `? A R ? ?`  
  - Position 2: A (✓)  
  - Position 3: R (✓)  
- **S is present**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (not 5, as per feedback).  
- **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T → valid letters: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Must be a valid 5-letter English word**.  

### Strategy:
- Test **S in position 4** since position 1 is the only other option for S, but finding common words with S in position 1 and the pattern `S A R ? ?` is difficult due to exclusions (e.g., ""sarge"" invalid for containing E).  
- Prioritize **position 4 for S** with common letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., H, M, P, D, L).  
- The word **""marsh""** fits:  
  - Pattern: `M A R S H`  
  - S in position 4 (testing its position).  
  - Uses new common letters (M, H) not excluded.  
  - Avoids redundant guesses.  
- If correct, this could solve the word; if not, feedback will clarify S's position and other letters.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
<step-by-step>
- From Guess 3 feedback, S is in the word but not in position 5. Combined with the fixed pattern (_ A R _ _), S must be in position 1 or 4.
- Words with S in position 1 (e.g., ""sards"", ""sarin"") are invalid due to exclusions (I, N) or non-common words.
- Words with S in position 4: _ A R S _ → common options include ""marsh"", ""harsh"", ""parse"", but ""parse"" has E (excluded), leaving ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".
- ""marsh"" (validating: M and H are untested; avoids exclusions) and ""harsh"" (uses H twice, less common) → prefer ""marsh"" to test M and H separately.
- Incorrectly guessing ""marsh"" will confirm if S is in position 4 or guide to position 1 for future guesses (with 3 tries remaining).
- Feedback on M and H will provide new information (e.g., M absence or position).

We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Includes R and A, but in different positions than in the first guess (since in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were wrong positions).\n- We can try to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think about the positions:\n- R was in position 2 in ""crane"" and was wrong, so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, it can be in any position except 2. But note: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nWe should avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3 in our next guess.\n\nAlso, we know the word has 5 letters and must include R and A.\n\nLet\'s consider possible words. We can try to use a word that has R and A, and also some other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.), but avoiding C, N, E.\n\nOne common starting word is ""roast"", but let\'s check:\n- ""roast"" has R in position 1, which is different from position 2. It has A in position 3? But in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was marked as wrong position. So in the secret word, A cannot be in position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So in ""roast"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nSo, we need a word that has:\n- R not in position 2\n- A not in position 3\n\nAnd without C, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and A, and are 5 letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""party"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is in position 3? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. And A is in position 2? We don\'t have information about position 2 for A? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 3. So A can be in position 1,2,4,5.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we have only one R? The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicate letters. So we have to be cautious.\n\nAnother word: ""trial"" -> T, R, I, A, L. \n- R is in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, no: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong, but we might get more information? However, it\'s better to try a different position to see if we can get a correct position.\n\nBut note: we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R in a new position and A in a new position, and also includes other new letters.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\nFor example:\n- ""ratio"": R in position 1, A in position 2 -> that\'s okay because A was not in position 3, but we don\'t know about position 2 for A. And R is in position 1, which is new.\n\nBut ""ratio"" has T, I, O which we haven\'t tried.\n\nAnother word: ""pairs"" -> P, A, I, R, S. Here, A is in position 2 and R is in position 4. So that avoids position 2 for R and position 3 for A.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters. ""pairs"" doesn\'t have C, N, E.\n\nAnother common word: ""stare"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E, so words with E are out.\n\nSo, let\'s try to come up with a word that has R and A, and uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, S, L, etc.) without E, C, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ratio"" -> R, A, T, I, O -> no E, C, N. R is in 1, A in 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).\n- ""paint"" -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""paint"" is invalid because of N.\n- ""trail"" -> T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? We must avoid R in position 2? Actually, we can try it? But we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of R. So it\'s better to try R in a different position.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nIn ""trail"", R is in position 2, so we avoid that.\n\nHow about ""fairy""? F, A, I, R, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 4. That\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that has more common letters to get more information.\n\nAnother idea: ""radio"" -> R, A, D, I, O. R in 1, A in 2. But we don\'t know if D, I, O are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""oasis"" -> but no R? We must include R and A? Actually, we don\'t have to include them, but we know they are in the word so we should use them to get position information.\n\nBut we can also use other letters to test. However, since we know R and A are in the word, it\'s efficient to use them again to try to find their correct positions.\n\nSo, I think ""ratio"" is a good candidate because:\n- It has R in position 1 (new position) and A in position 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed).\n- It introduces T, I, O which are common.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but we\'ll see.\n\nAnother candidate: ""stair"" -> S, T, A, I, R. A in position 3? But we must avoid A in position 3? Because in the first guess, A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong again. So to avoid wasting a position, we should put A in a position we haven\'t tried: 1,2,4,5.\n\nIn ""stair"", A is in position 3? Let me check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\nHow about ""straw"": S, T, R, A, W. R in position 3? And A in position 4? That\'s okay. But we have W, which is less common.\n\nI think ""ratio"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""ratio"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""ratio"".\n\nWe are going to guess ""ratio"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we\'ll see from the feedback.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid using C, N, E.\n- Include R and A, but place R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, I, O) to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""ratio"" meets these criteria:\n- Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.\n- Uses new letters T, I, O.\n- Avoids C, N, E.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSecond guess: ""ratio""\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom the feedback, we know:\n\n1. The secret word contains R and A (from first guess), and now A is in the correct position (second guess). In ""ratio"", A is in the second position, so the second letter of A is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the secret word has A as its second letter.\n\n2. R is in the word but not in the correct position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (which we now know is A), so that was wrong. In ""ratio"", R was in position 1, and it was marked wrong position. So R is not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.\n\n3. We know the secret word does not contain C, N, E (from first guess), and now T, I, O (from second guess) are also not in the word.\n\nSo, excluded letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe have A in the second position: _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, we need to find other letters that are in the word.\n\nFrom ""crane"", we had R and A, meaning there are at least two letters we know. But there might be more.\n\nSince we have A fixed at position 2, and R somewhere in 3-5, we need to choose a word that:\n- Has A in the second position (fixed)\n- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but avoid position 1 and 2, which we already know are wrong for R)\n- Uses only letters that haven\'t been excluded: so avoid C, N, E, T, I, O.\n- We can include new letters to get more information.\n\nThe excluded letters are: C, E, I, N, O, T. So avoid these.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know the word must have R in one of the last three positions.\n\nWe should try a word that puts R in a different position each time until we find it, but also test other common letters.\n\nSince there are three positions for R (3,4,5) and we have limited guesses, we might try to cover more than one possibility.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words with A as second letter and R in the word.\n\nPossible words with A in second position: \n- S A L A D? But we haven\'t tested S, L, D.\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nAlso, R must be in the word.\n\nSo, we need words like:\n- _ A _ R _ : R in fourth position\n- _ A R _ _ : but R in position 3? However, we haven\'t tried that yet? We know R is not in position 1 or 2, but position 3 is possible.\n\nIn fact, we can try to place R in position 3, 4, or 5 in this guess.\n\nAlso, we want to use common letters to maximize information.\n\nConsider the word ""parka"", but we have K and A again? Also, we have to avoid A being duplicated? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nHowever, in the word ""parka"", A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know how many times. Also, ""parka"" has P, A, R, K, A.\n\nBut K is not excluded? And P?\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters. ""parka"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let\'s check: P, A, R, K, A — excluded are C,E,I,N,O,T — none in ""parka"". So it\'s valid.\n\nBut also, we have two A\'s? The feedback might be affected if there are duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to simplify.\n\nBut let\'s proceed.\n\nIn ""parka"", R is in position 3? P-A-R-K-A → R at position 3.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 3, then we might get a ✓ for R? Or if not, we get - or x? We know R is in the word, so it won\'t be x.\n\nBut we need to get information.\n\nAnother word: ""marsh"" → M-A-R-S-H → A at 2, R at 3.\n\nBut we haven\'t excluded M,S,H.\n\nAnother word: ""lapse"" → but E is excluded, so not.\n\nSince A is fixed at position 2, we should try R in position 3, next position we haven\'t tested.\n\nPossible: use a word with R in position 3 to test if it\'s there.\n\nSimilarly, we can test other letters.\n\nBut note: we only have one R? The feedback doesn\'t specify, so we don\'t know.\n\nWe\'ll know from the feedback.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nLet me list some words with pattern _ A _ _ _ that include R and avoid excluded letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""bards"": B-A-R-D-S → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), S(5). Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,I,N,O,T.\n- ""fault"": but T is excluded? T is in excluded because from second guess T was x. So avoid T.\n- ""valid"" has D and L? V-A-L-I-D → but I is excluded? from second guess I was x, so avoid I. So ""valid"" has I and excluded.\n\nAnother: ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S → R in position 3.\n\n""wards"": W-A-R-D-S → R in 3.\n\n""harms"": H-A-R-M-S → R in 3.\n\n""barks"": B-A-R-K-S → R in 3.\n\nBut all have R in position 3.\n\nWe could place R in position 4: like _ A _ R _\n\nExamples: ""fairy"" → F-A-I-R-Y → but I is excluded, so not.\n\n""march"" → M-A-R-C-H → but C excluded.\n\n""hardy"": H-A-R-D-Y → R in position 3? H(1)-A(2)-R(3)-D(4)-Y(5), so R at 3.\n\nFor R at position 4: try ""wafer"" → but E excluded.\n\n""gaper"" → E excluded.\n\n""paper"" → but P,A,P,E,R — E excluded.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with R at position 4 and A at 2 without excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, for R at position 5: _ A _ _ R\n\nExamples: ""gator"" → but O is excluded? G-A-T-O-R → T and O excluded.\n\n""labor"" → but O excluded.\n\n""saber"" → S-A-B-E-R → E excluded.\n\nWe see that words with R in position 4 or 5 often include E, I, O, T which are excluded.\n\nPerhaps there are words like ""sadly"" but without R? But we must include R because it\'s in the word.\n\nSo, it might be that R is in position 3 because position 4 and 5 are rare with the constraints.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try a word with R in position 3 and A fixed at position 2.\n\nWe also want to include new letters.\n\nFor example: ""barks"" → letters: B, A, R, K, S.\n\nB, K, S are new.\n\nSince we don\'t know about duplicates, but we\'ll see.\n\nAnother word: ""parks"" → P, A, R, K, S.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut let me pick ""barks"" to use B.\n\nSo, possible guess: ""barks"".\n\nIn ""barks"":\n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: A (fixed correct, so we expect ✓)\n- Position 3: R (which we are testing: if it\'s correct, ✓; else, - because R is in the word)\n- Position 4: K (new)\n- Position 5: S (new)\n\nEven if R at position 3 is not correct, we will know from feedback.\n\nAlso, we get information on B, K, S.\n\nWe might choose a word with more vowels? But we have A already, and the only vowel we can use is U? because others are excluded? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y. E,I,O excluded, so we have U and Y? But we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n""barks"" has no U/Y, but that\'s fine.\n\nAlternatives: ""warms"" → W,A,R,M,S.\n\n""darks"" → D,A,R,K,S.\n\nBut I think ""barks"" is fine.\n\nWe could try ""marsh"" → M,A,R,S,H.\n\nBut S is a common letter.\n\nSince A is fixed and R is to be tested at position 3, and we want new letters, I\'ll go with ""barks"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""barks"".Based on the feedback:\n- A is confirmed in position 2.\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- Excluded letters: C, E, I, N, O, T.\n\nWe choose a word that:\n- Places A in position 2.\n- Places R in a new position (we test position 3).\n- Uses new, common letters (B, K, S) to maximize information.\n- Avoids excluded letters.\n\n""barks"" fits these criteria.\n\n<guess>barks</guess>We have feedback from two previous guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  \n   - R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not in position 2, A not in position 3.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ratio → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  \n   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  \n   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (new information).  \n   - T, I, O are not in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **A** is confirmed in position 2: the secret word has the pattern `_ A _ _ _`.  \n- **R** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  \n- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): C, E, I, N, O, T.  \n- **Valid letters to use**: All other letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  \n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- Since A is fixed at position 2, we need to place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.  \n- Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, L, D, B, K, M) and avoid excluded letters.  \n- Prioritize testing R in position 3, as it is common and positions 4/5 are harder with excluded vowels.  \n- Choose a word with A in position 2 and R in position 3 to confirm/deny R\'s position quickly. Include other letters to test them.  \n\nThe word **""barks""** fits well:  \n- Places A in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  \n- Places R in position 3 (to test this position).  \n- Uses new letters B, K, S (common and not excluded).  \n- Avoids duplicate letters in tested positions and excluded letters.\n\n<guess>barks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: barks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""barks"":\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, which we already knew)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position!

Additionally excluded: from guess1: C, N, E; guess2: T, I, O; guess3: B, K.\n\nSo excluded: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.\n\nThe word must be in the pattern: _ A R _ _\n\nAnd S is in the word, but not in position 5. So S could be in position 1 or position 4? But note: the pattern has four blanks, but positions 1 and 4 are open. Position 5 is the last one.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know if S appears multiple times? But we\'ll see.\n\nNow, S cannot be in position 5 because in ""barks"" it was marked - (wrong position). So S must be in position 1 or 4? Or possibly other positions, but in this word it was at position 5, so if it were at another position that is allowed.\n\nBut note: the pattern is position 1: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ?.\n\nWe know S is not at position 5, and we don\'t know about position 1 and 4.\n\nAlso, we need to find another letter for position 1 and position 4 and 5? The word is five letters: [1] A (2) R (3) [4] [5]. So positions 1, 4, 5 are unknown.\n\nBut we know S is in the word, so one of positions 1,4,5 must be S? Or S might be duplicated? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, from the feedback, we know that the letter at position 5 is not S? But it might be that S is in the word but not at position 5, so S could be at position 1 or 4.\n\nAdditionally, we need to choose letters not excluded.\n\nExcluded: B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. So available: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd S we know is in the word, so we must use it again? Or is it already covered? We need to include S in the word because it is in the secret word.\n\nAlso, we have to guess the word.\n\nPossible words of the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nAnd must contain S? But not in position 5, so S must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nAlso, the letter at position 5 could be another letter.\n\nNow, common words fitting _ A R _ _:\n\n- Let\'s consider S at position 1: then ""S A R _ _"". Examples: ""sorry"" but O excluded? And two R\'s? We already have R at position 3. ""sorry"" has O and Y? O excluded.\n\n- ""sarge"" but E excluded? \n\n- ""start"" but T excluded? T is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid excluded letters.\n\nS at position 1: ""s a r _ _"" \n\nWords: ""sarky""? S-A-R-K-Y -> K excluded? Yes, K is excluded from guess3.\n\n""safer"": S-A-F-E-R -> E excluded.\n\n""sarin"": S-A-R-I-N -> I and N excluded.\n\nIt\'s difficult.\n\nNow, S at position 4: then the word is _ A R S _ \n\nExamples: ""marks"" -> M-A-R-K-S -> but K excluded? And S at the end? But we will have S at position 4 and position 5 might be something.\n\nBut ""marks"" has K, which is excluded.\n\n""parsnip"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""harsh"": H-A-R-S-H -> letters: H, A, R, S, H. Now, H is allowed? And S is at position 4. This avoids excluded letters? H, A, R, S: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T. But it has two H\'s? But we don\'t mind.\n\nPosition 5 must be H? Or in ""harsh"", it\'s H-A-R-S-H, so position 5 is H.\n\nBut the pattern is position 4 is S and position 5 is H? But S is at position 4? That might be fine if S is at position 4, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn this word, S is at position 4? Let\'s index: position 1: H, 2: A, 3: R, 4: S, 5: H? But ""harsh"" is spelled H-A-R-S-H? Yes.\n\nBut the word has five letters.\n\nNow, S is at position 4? And in our feedback from ""barks"", S was at position 5 and marked as in the word but wrong position. Now if we put S at position 4, it might be correct.\n\nSimilarly, position 4 could be S.\n\nBut also, position 1 must be H? Or other.\n\nAnother word: ""marsh"": M-A-R-S-H -> same as above, but with M. But M not excluded.\n\nBut ""marsh"" has S at position 4? Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S can be at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""garsh"" is not a word.\n\nOr ""darts"" but T excluded? D-A-R-T-S -> T excluded.\n\nAnother: ""laure"" not a word.\n\nWhat about ""parse"": P-A-R-S-E -> but E excluded.\n\n""warns"": W-A-R-N-S -> N excluded? N is excluded.\n\nSo, words ending with S at position 4: ""marsh"" is valid? Let me confirm: ""marsh"" is a word? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""harsh"" is a word.\n\nBut ""harsh"" has H at both ends? But that might be allowed.\n\nBut we have S at position 4? And the last letter is H.\n\nBut in our pattern, position 5 can be H.\n\nSimilarly, ""laris"" not a word.\n\nAnother: ""paris"" but that\'s P-A-R-I-S -> but I excluded? I is excluded.\n\n""carts"" C excluded and T.\n\nSo, one possibility is ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".\n\nBut we also have the feedback that S is in the word but not in position 5. Both ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" have S at position 4? And H at position 5? Or in ""harsh"": letters: position 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H? So S at position 4? Yes.\n\nBut is S allowed at position 4? We don\'t have information against it.\n\nBut also, position 1 must be H? Or in ""marsh"": M instead of H.\n\nBut we must not use excluded letters.\n\nWe could try ""wares"" but E excluded.\n\nAnother word: ""darbs"" not a word.\n\n""gars"" not 5 letters.\n\nSo, ""marsh"" or ""harsh"" seem possible.\n\nBut we also know that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""harsh"" has double H? But we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate H.\n\nSimilarly, ""marsh"" has distinct: M,A,R,S,H.\n\nBut we need to guess.\n\nSince S is in the word and not in position 5, position 4 is a candidate.\n\nWe could also consider S in position 1? But we couldn\'t find valid words with S in position 1 without excluded letters.\n\nFor example, ""saury"" is not a common word? Or ""sards"" not a word.\n\n""salad"" has L and D, but no R? We need R at position 3.\n\nPattern must have A at 2, R at 3.\n\nSo only possibility is S at position 1 or 4? Or at other positions? But position 2 and 3 are taken by A and R? So only position 1 and 4 and 5.\n\nBut S cannot be at position 5? Then S must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nPosition 1: S A R _ _\n\nValid words? ""sarin"" excluded letters.\n\n""saree"" has E.\n\n""sarge"" has E.\n\n""sarsa"" not a word?.\n\n""sarza"" not English.\n\n""sandy"" has N and D? But N excluded.\n\nSo, we come back to S in position 4: _ A R S _\n\nNow, what can be position 1 and position 5?\n\nPosition 1: any letter except excluded ones, and S? But S might be at position 4, so position 1 cannot be S? Unless duplicate S? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s assume no duplicate for now.\n\nSo position 1: must be a letter not S? Because S is at position 4.\n\nThen position 5: any letter not excluded.\n\nPossible:\n- ""barks"" we tried, but we know B and K out.\n- ""marks"" has K? K excluded.\n- ""parks"" has P? It was not tested? But in ""parks"": P-A-R-K-S -> K excluded? So not.\n\nWords: \n""larva"" has I? No, L,A,R,V,A? But A duplicate? Pattern: L(1), A(2) fixed, R(3) fixed, then ""v"" position 4? But we want S at position 4? Here we put S at position 4, but if not, it doesn\'t satisfy.\n\nWe need the word to have S at position 4? Or not necessarily? We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know its position except not position 5? So it could be position 1 or 4.\n\nBut for this guess, we need to include S.\n\nBut let\'s go back to the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nWe must include S.\n\nSo, possible guesses:\n\n- If we put S at position 1: ""s a r _ _"", then we need to fill the last two positions with available letters without excluded ones. For example:\n  - ""sarges"" too long.\n  - ""sarky"": S,A,R,K,Y -> K excluded.\n  - ""sards"": not a word? Sards is not common English.\n  - ""saree"": 5 letters? but E excluded.\n\nSo no good.\n\n- Put S at position 4: ""x a r s y"", where x and y are available letters.\n\nFor example:\n  x = D? ""darsy"" not word.\n  x = F? ""farsy"" not word.\n  x = G? ""gars"" not 5.\n  x = H? ""hars"" not 5, but ""harsh"" is 5: H,A,R,S,H -> but we have S at position 4 and H at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""marsh"": M,A,R,S,H.\n\n""warsh"" not common? But in some dialects.\n\n""pars"" not.\n\n""cars"" not 5.\n\nSo ""marsh"" and ""harsh"" are valid.\n\nAlso, ""barsh"" not a word.\n\n""yarsh"" not common.\n\nSo, likely ""marsh"" or ""harsh"".\n\nWe can also consider ""parse"" but E excluded.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps S is at position 1 and the word has S in position 1 and R at 3, but duplicate? For example, ""sassy"" has no R.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".\n\nWe know that B was excluded, and K was excluded, etc.\n\nWe can use L? ""lars"" not 5.\n\nAnother word: ""aarts"" not starting with _.\n\nOr ""darts"" T excluded.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""marsh"" to test M and S and H.\n\nBut in ""marsh"", S is at position 4? So if S is at position 4, it might be correct or wrong position? We don\'t know yet.\n\nSimilarly, H at position 5.\n\nIn our feedback, from ""barks"", S was marked as ""in word but wrong position"". It was in position 5, so S is in word but position 5 is wrong. This doesn\'t say anything about position 4.\n\nIn ""marsh"", we would test S at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has S at position 4, this will correct, else if at position 1, it would be marked accordingly.\n\nBut we have only two possibilities: S at position 1 or S at position 4? But we haven\'t found a valid word with S at position 1.\n\nSo, let\'s assume S at position 4? Then we expect ""marsh"" or similar.\n\nBut wait, position 5 could be another letter.\n\nAnother word: ""tarts"" T excluded.\n\nSo, I think ""marsh"" is a valid guess.\n\nAlso, ""juice"" not.\n\nAlternatively, ""fared"" E excluded.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""marsh"".\n\nGuess: ""marsh""\n\nBut let\'s see if it fits the constraints.\n\nSecret word pattern: _ A R _ _\n\nExcluded letters: not used? M, A, R, S, H — A and R are in, M and H not tested, S in. Excluded letters covered: no B,C,E,I,K,N,O,T.\n\nS is at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has S at position 4, we might get ✓ for S.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nWe are not sure, but we\'ll see.\n\nThe guess is ""marsh"".We have feedback from three previous guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  \n   - **Deductions**:  \n     - C, N, E are not in the secret word.  \n     - R and A are in the word, but:  \n       - R is not in position 2.  \n       - A is not in position 3.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ratio** → R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)  \n   - **Deductions**:  \n     - A is confirmed in position 2 (secret word pattern: `_ A _ _ _`).  \n     - R is in the word but not in position 1 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  \n     - T, I, O are not in the word.  \n     - Combined exclusions: C, E, I, N, O, T.  \n\n3. **Guess 3: barks** → B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)  \n   - **Deductions**:  \n     - A and R are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 → secret word pattern: `_ A R _ _`.  \n   - R is in position 3 (✓).  \n     - B and K are not in the word → add to exclusions: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T.  \n     - S is in the word but not in position 5 (wrong position).  \n   - S must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are taken).  \n\n### Key Constraints for New Guess (Guess 4):\n- **Pattern**: `? A R ? ?`  \n  - Position 2: A (✓)  \n  - Position 3: R (✓)  \n- **S is present**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (not 5, as per feedback).  \n- **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T → valid letters: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n- **Must be a valid 5-letter English word**.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- Test **S in position 4** since position 1 is the only other option for S, but finding common words with S in position 1 and the pattern `S A R ? ?` is difficult due to exclusions (e.g., ""sarge"" invalid for containing E).  \n- Prioritize **position 4 for S** with common letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., H, M, P, D, L).  \n- The word **""marsh""** fits:  \n  - Pattern: `M A R S H`  \n  - S in position 4 (testing its position).  \n  - Uses new common letters (M, H) not excluded.  \n  - Avoids redundant guesses.  \n- If correct, this could solve the word; if not, feedback will clarify S\'s position and other letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n<step-by-step>\n- From Guess 3 feedback, S is in the word but not in position 5. Combined with the fixed pattern (_ A R _ _), S must be in position 1 or 4.\n- Words with S in position 1 (e.g., ""sards"", ""sarin"") are invalid due to exclusions (I, N) or non-common words.\n- Words with S in position 4: _ A R S _ → common options include ""marsh"", ""harsh"", ""parse"", but ""parse"" has E (excluded), leaving ""marsh"" and ""harsh"".\n- ""marsh"" (validating: M and H are untested; avoids exclusions) and ""harsh"" (uses H twice, less common) → prefer ""marsh"" to test M and H separately.\n- Incorrectly guessing ""marsh"" will confirm if S is in position 4 or guide to position 1 for future guesses (with 3 tries remaining).\n- Feedback on M and H will provide new information (e.g., M absence or position).\n</step-by-step>\n\n<guess>marsh</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: barks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(-)\nGuess 4: marsh -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""marsh"":
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position, as before)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position, as before)
- S: ✓ (correct and in position! So S is in position 4)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position! So H is in position 5)

Therefore, the secret word is: _ A R S H

But we have the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: R, position 4: S, position 5: H.

And M is not in the word, so position 1 is not M.

We also know from previous feedback that the first letter cannot be any of the excluded letters: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T, and now M.

So, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter not excluded, and the rest is ""ARSH"".

The word must be of the form: X A R S H, where X is a letter not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T, M.

Available letters: D, F, G, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words are there that end with ""ARSH""?

Common English words:
- ""harsh"" but H is at position 5, but in ""harsh"", the first letter is H, but we have H at position 5? No, ""harsh"" is H-A-R-S-H, so position 1 is H and position 5 is H. But we have position 5 fixed as H, so if we put H at position 1, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in the feedback for ""marsh"", we had M at position 1 which was wrong, and H at position 5 which was correct. So the secret word has H at position 5, but we don't know if it has H at position 1.

However, in the word ""harsh"", it has two H's. But we haven't tested that.

But let's see: if the secret word is ""harsh"", then in our previous guess ""barks"", we had S at position 5 which was marked as wrong position. But in ""harsh"", S is at position 4, so that would be correct? And in ""barks"", S was at position 5, which is not the correct position (since it should be at 4), so the feedback was correct: S is in the word but not at position 5.

Similarly, in ""marsh"", we tested S at position 4 and it was correct.

But for ""harsh"", the first letter is H, which is the same as the last letter? But that might be possible.

But we have to check if H is allowed at position 1? We don't have information that H is excluded? H was not tested before.

In fact, in ""marsh"", we tested H at position 5 and it was correct, but we didn't test H at position 1.

So, ""harsh"" is a candidate.

But we also have other words? Like ""garsh"" is not a word.

""darsh"" not common.

""jarsh"" not.

""larsh"" not.

""parsh"" not.

""tarsh"" not, and T excluded.

""warsh"" not standard.

""yarsh"" not.

So, the only common word that fits X A R S H is ""harsh"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""harsh"".

But let's confirm with the feedback.

First guess: ""crane"" -> C not in, R in word but not position 2 (in ""harsh"", R is at position 3, so not 2), A in word but not position 3 (in ""harsh"", A is at position 2, so not 3), N not, E not. Correct.

Second guess: ""ratio"" -> R in word but not position 1 (in ""harsh"", R is at 3, not 1), A correct at position 2, T not, I not, O not. Correct.

Third guess: ""barks"" -> B not, A correct, R correct, K not, S in word but not position 5 (in ""harsh"", S is at position 4, not 5). Correct.

Fourth guess: ""marsh"" -> M not, A correct, R correct, S correct, H correct. But in ""harsh"", the first letter is H, not M, so M not in word is correct? But ""marsh"" has M at position 1, which is not in ""harsh"", so M not in word is correct. And S at position 4 is correct, H at position 5 is correct.

But the secret word is ""harsh"", which has H at position 1 and 5? But in the feedback for ""marsh"", we only tested H at position 5, which was correct. We didn't test H at position 1? But the feedback for H was ✓, meaning the letter H is in the correct position (position 5). It doesn't say anything about position 1.

In ""harsh"", position 1 is H, which is the same letter as position 5. But in the game, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.

In the feedback for ""marsh"", we have:
- M: not in word (x)
- A: correct (✓)
- R: correct (✓)
- S: correct (✓)
- H: correct (✓)

But in ""marsh"", the H is only at position 5. In the secret word ""harsh"", there is an H at position 1 and position 5. So when we guess ""marsh"", which has H only at position 5, the feedback for H should be ✓ because it is correct at that position. The H at position 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess, so it doesn't affect.

But the letter H is in the word, and we have one H in the guess at position 5, which matches, so it gets ✓.

The fact that there is an extra H at position 1 in the secret word doesn't change that.

Similarly, in the third guess ""barks"", we had S at position 5, but in ""harsh"", S is at position 4, and there is no S at position 5, so S was marked as - (in word but wrong position) because S is present but not at position 5.

So all feedback is consistent.

Therefore, the secret word is ""harsh"".

But we need to make a new guess? Or is this the solution?

The instruction says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", but we have figured it out.

But we have to guess it to win.

So, we should guess ""harsh"".

But let's make sure there are no other possibilities.

Is there any other word of the form X A R S H?

For example, ""barsh"" not a word.

""cars"" not 5.

""darsh"" not in common English.

""farsh"" not.

""garsh"" not.

""jarsh"" not.

""larsh"" not.

""parsh"" not.

""qarsh"" not.

""tarsh"" not.

""warsh"" not standard.

""yarsh"" not.

""zarsh"" not.

So, ""harsh"" is the only common English word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""harsh"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been deduced to be ""harsh"". Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Guess 3 (""barks"") confirmed A(✓) in position 2 and R(✓) in position 3, giving the pattern: `_ A R _ _`.
   - Guess 4 (""marsh"") confirmed S(✓) in position 4 and H(✓) in position 5, extending the pattern to `_ A R S H`.
   - The only remaining unknown is position 1.

2. **Excluded Letters**:
   - From Guess 1: C, N, E are not in the word.
   - From Guess 2: T, I, O are not in the word.
   - From Guess 3: B, K are not in the word.
   - From Guess 4: M is not in the word.
   - **Total exclusions**: B, C, E, I, K, M, N, O, T.

3. **Possible Letters for Position 1**:
   - Valid letters (not excluded): D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - However, the word must be a valid English word ending in ""ARSH"".

4. **Testing the Pattern `_ A R S H`**:
   - Common English words fitting this pattern were evaluated (e.g., ""harsh"", ""marsh"" was already tested and ruled out for position 1).
   - ""harsh"" is the only common English word that fits:
     - It starts with H (a valid, non-excluded letter).
     - It matches the pattern: H (position 1), A (position 2), R (position 3), S (position 4), H (position 5).
   - Other combinations (e.g., ""darsh"", ""garsh"", ""parsh"") are not valid English words.

5. **Consistency with Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R(-) and A(-) are consistent with ""harsh"" (R is at position 3, not 2; A is at position 2, not 3). C, N, E are absent (✓).
   - **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: R(-) is consistent (R is not at position 1). A(✓) is correct. T, I, O are absent (✓).
   - **Guess 3 (""barks"")**: A(✓) and R(✓) are correct. S(-) is consistent (S is at position 4, not 5). B, K are absent (✓).
   - **Guess 4 (""marsh"")**: A(✓), R(✓), S(✓), H(✓) are correct. M is absent (✓), consistent with ""harsh"" not containing M.

Thus, ""harsh"" is the only word that satisfies all feedback and constraints.

<guess>harsh</guess>",harsh,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""marsh"":
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position, as before)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position, as before)
- S: ✓ (correct and in position! So S is in position 4)
- H: ✓ (correct and in position! So H is in position 5)

Therefore, the secret word is: _ A R S H

But we have the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: R, position 4: S, position 5: H.

And M is not in the word, so position 1 is not M.

We also know from previous feedback that the first letter cannot be any of the excluded letters: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T, and now M.

So, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter not excluded, and the rest is ""ARSH"".

The word must be of the form: X A R S H, where X is a letter not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: B, C, E, I, K, N, O, T, M.

Available letters: D, F, G, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words are there that end with ""ARSH""?

Common English words:
- ""harsh"" but H is at position 5, but in ""harsh"", the first letter is H, but we have H at position 5? No, ""harsh"" is H-A-R-S-H, so position 1 is H and position 5 is H. But we have position 5 fixed as H, so if we put H at position 1, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in the feedback for ""marsh"", we had M at position 1 which was wrong, and H at position 5 which was correct. So the secret word has H at position 5, but we don't know if it has H at position 1.

However, in the word ""harsh"", it has two H's. But we haven't tested that.

But let's see: if the secret word is ""harsh"", then in our previous guess ""barks"", we had S at position 5 which was marked as wrong position. But in ""harsh"", S is at position 4, so that would be correct? And in ""barks"", S was at position 5, which is not the correct position (since it should be at 4), so the feedback was correct: S is in the word but not at position 5.

Similarly, in ""marsh"", we tested S at position 4 and it was correct.

But for ""harsh"", the first letter is H, which is the same as the last letter? But that might be possible.

But we have to check if H is allowed at position 1? We don't have information that H is excluded? H was not tested before.

In fact, in ""marsh"", we tested H at position 5 and it was correct, but we didn't test H at position 1.

So, ""harsh"" is a candidate.

But we also have other words? Like ""garsh"" is not a word.

""darsh"" not common.

""jarsh"" not.

""larsh"" not.

""parsh"" not.

""tarsh"" not, and T excluded.

""warsh"" not standard.

""yarsh"" not.

So, the only common word that fits X A R S H is ""harsh"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""harsh"".

But let's confirm with the feedback.

First guess: ""crane"" -> C not in, R in word but not position 2 (in ""harsh"", R is at position 3, so not 2), A in word but not position 3 (in ""harsh"", A is at position 2, so not 3), N not, E not. Correct.

Second guess: ""ratio"" -> R in word but not position 1 (in ""harsh"", R is at 3, not 1), A correct at position 2, T not, I not, O not. Correct.

Third guess: ""barks"" -> B not, A correct, R correct, K not, S in word but not position 5 (in ""harsh"", S is at position 4, not 5). Correct.

Fourth guess: ""marsh"" -> M not, A correct, R correct, S correct, H correct. But in ""harsh"", the first letter is H, not M, so M not in word is correct? But ""marsh"" has M at position 1, which is not in ""harsh"", so M not in word is correct. And S at position 4 is correct, H at position 5 is correct.

But the secret word is ""harsh"", which has H at position 1 and 5? But in the feedback for ""marsh"", we only tested H at position 5, which was correct. We didn't test H at position 1? But the feedback for H was ✓, meaning the letter H is in the correct position (position 5). It doesn't say anything about position 1.

In ""harsh"", position 1 is H, which is the same letter as position 5. But in the game, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky.

In the feedback for ""marsh"", we have:
- M: not in word (x)
- A: correct (✓)
- R: correct (✓)
- S: correct (✓)
- H: correct (✓)

But in ""marsh"", the H is only at position 5. In the secret word ""harsh"", there is an H at position 1 and position 5. So when we guess ""marsh"", which has H only at position 5, the feedback for H should be ✓ because it is correct at that position. The H at position 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess, so it doesn't affect.

But the letter H is in the word, and we have one H in the guess at position 5, which matches, so it gets ✓.

The fact that there is an extra H at position 1 in the secret word doesn't change that.

Similarly, in the third guess ""barks"", we had S at position 5, but in ""harsh"", S is at position 4, and there is no S at position 5, so S was marked as - (in word but wrong position) because S is present but not at position 5.

So all feedback is consistent.

Therefore, the secret word is ""harsh"".

But we need to make a new guess? Or is this the solution?

The instruction says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", but we have figured it out.

But we have to guess it to win.

So, we should guess ""harsh"".

But let's make sure there are no other possibilities.

Is there any other word of the form X A R S H?

For example, ""barsh"" not a word.

""cars"" not 5.

""darsh"" not in common English.

""farsh"" not.

""garsh"" not.

""jarsh"" not.

""larsh"" not.

""parsh"" not.

""qarsh"" not.

""tarsh"" not.

""warsh"" not standard.

""yarsh"" not.

""zarsh"" not.

So, ""harsh"" is the only common English word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""harsh"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been deduced to be ""harsh"". Here's a step-by-step reasoning:
