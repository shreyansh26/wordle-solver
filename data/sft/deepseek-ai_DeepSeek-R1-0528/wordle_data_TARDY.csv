First, I need to make an initial guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback.

Common letters in English words: According to frequency analysis, vowels like A, E, I, O, U are common, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also frequent.

A good starting word should include multiple common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", or ""ADIEU"" are often used because they have high-frequency letters.

""ADIEU"" has a lot of vowels, which might be useful since every word has vowels. But consonants are important too.

Another popular starter is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" might be better.

I am considering using ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E—all common letters: R, S, and vowels A, I, E.

Letters: R, A, I, S, E.

- R is a common consonant.

- A is a common vowel.

- I is a vowel.

- S is a common consonant.

- E is a common vowel.

That covers four vowels and one consonant, but S is a consonant. So three vowels and two consonants? A, I, E are vowels; R and S are consonants. So three vowels and two consonants.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E. So two vowels and three consonants.

Perhaps ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – consonants S, L, T and vowels A, E. Again, two vowels.

To maximize vowel coverage, ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – that's four vowels and one consonant (D). But D might not be as common.

In terms of information, I want letters that are likely to be in the word to get some hits.

Standard advice is to use words with common consonants and vowels.

I recall that in Wordle, good starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""STARE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

Let me think about letter frequency in English. E is the most common letter, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

So perhaps include E, A, R, S, T, etc.

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – common letters: S, T, A, R, E.

Yes, that seems solid: S, T, A, R, E – all high-frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CRATE"": C, R, A, T, E – C is less common than S, so ""STARE"" might be better.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – I is also common.

""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E – that gives me four vowels (A, I, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it's covered.

Vowels: A, I, E – that's three vowels.

""ADIEU"" has A, I, E, U – four vowels, but U is less common.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good choice because it covers multiple vowels and common consonants.

In the response format, I need to think step by step within <think> </think> tags and then output the guess in <guess> tags.

So for my initial thought:

I should start with a word that contains frequent letters to increase the chances of getting feedback hits. Considering English letter frequency, I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters, with three vowels and two consonants, covering broad possibilities.

Then, after thinking, output my guess.
</think>
I am starting with no prior information about the secret word. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a guess that includes common letters in the English language, particularly focusing on high-frequency vowels and consonants. This way, I can gather useful information about which letters are present and their positions. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I select ""RAISE"" because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E—all of which are among the most frequent in English words (based on letter frequency data). ""RAISE"" includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which increases the likelihood of identifying correct letters or positions in the first guess.

We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback. We need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common strategies involve selecting words with frequent letters or a good mix of vowels and consonants. 

English letter frequency: The most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Vowels are important to test early.

Possible starter words:
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E – covers vowels A and E, and common consonants.
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E – similar vowels, common consonants.
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E – includes vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S. 

After evaluating, ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) improving chances of hitting vowel positions.
- Consonants R and S are very common.
- It avoids repeating letters, ensuring wider coverage.

Thus, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"". This will provide feedback on these common letters and their positions.

Next, I need to output in the required format. Since the guess is ""RAISE"", I write it accordingly.

Since I have no prior information, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback.\n\nCommon letters in English words: According to frequency analysis, vowels like A, E, I, O, U are common, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also frequent.\n\nA good starting word should include multiple common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", or ""ADIEU"" are often used because they have high-frequency letters.\n\n""ADIEU"" has a lot of vowels, which might be useful since every word has vowels. But consonants are important too.\n\nAnother popular starter is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" might be better.\n\nI am considering using ""RAISE"".

So three vowels and two consonants? A, I, E are vowels; R and S are consonants. So three vowels and two consonants.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that\'s consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E. So two vowels and three consonants.\n\nPerhaps ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – consonants S, L, T and vowels A, E. Again, two vowels.\n\nTo maximize vowel coverage, ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – that\'s four vowels and one consonant (D).

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""RAISE"" resulted in R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(x), E(x). This means:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- R is in the word but not in the correct position (first position was wrong).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So, the secret word:
- Must have the letter A in the second position (position 2).
- Contains the letter R somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Does not contain I, S, or E.

Since A is confirmed in position 2, and R is present but not in position 1, we need to choose a new guess that:
1. Includes A in position 2 to maintain the correct position we know.
2. Includes R in a different position (since it can't be in position 1).
3. Avoids I, S, E entirely as they are absent from the secret word.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Additionally, we want to cover other positions and include fresh consonants/vowels that weren't tested. Possible vowels left: O, U (since A is confirmed, and I,E are out). Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Given this, let's brainstorm words that fit:
- Position 2 must be A.
- Contains R not in position 1.
- No I, S, E.

Some ideas:
- CARTE: but E is bad (eliminated) -> invalid.
- PARTY: P, A (position 2), R, T, Y. Position 1: P, position 3: R, position 4: T, position 5: Y. This avoids I,S,E and moves R to position 3.
- CARVE: but C,A,R,V,E -> E is bad -> invalid.
- MARCH: M,A,R,C,H -> avoids I,S,E. Position 1: M, A in 2, R in 3, C in 4, H in 5. Good.
- PARTH: not a word? Don't confuse with ""PATH"" which is shorter.
- BOARD: B,O,A,R,D -> O and D are new, but R is in position 4? Position 2: A? BOARD: positions: B-1, O-2? No, BOARD is B-O-A-R-D, so position 3 is A -> not position 2. Invalid because A must be in position 2.

We need words with A in position 2. Examples:
- _A_T_ (like ""PASTA"" but S is bad -> invalid)
- _A_R_ (like ""MARRY"" but R repeated and Y? Let's think valid words)
  - PARTY: P-A-R-T-Y -> A in position 2, so positions: 1: P, 2: A, 3: R, 4: T, 5: Y. This works, and it avoids I,S,E.
  - CARAT: C-A-R-A-T -> A in 2, but also A in 4? But that's fine. However, it has two A's? Secret might not, but we don't know. Also, avoids I,S,E. But is CARAT common? Valid as a word meaning a unit of weight for gemstones.
- HAREM: H,A,R,E,M -> E is bad -> invalid.
- LARGO: L,A,R,G,O -> avoids I,S,E. Positions: L in 1, A in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.
- TAROT: T,A,R,O,T -> repeats T? Positions: T in 1, A in 2, R in 3, O in 4, T in 5. Avoids I,S,E.

But let's pick one that maximizes new letters. PARTY: introduces P, T, Y (T is very common). MARSH: M,A,R,S,H -> S is bad -> invalid since S eliminated.

Part of the goal is also to test other vowels. O seems a good candidate. Words:
- MAORI: M,A,O,R,I -> I is bad -> invalid.
- VALOR: V,A,L,O,R -> A in position 2? Positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:L, 4:O, 5:R. Avoids I,S,E. Good.

But VALOR has R in position 5, which is new. PARTY has R in 3. Either is fine.

I should include fresh common consonants to test more letters. Consider T, N, L, C, D, M.

Top choice: PARTY (letters P, T, Y) or CARGO: C,A,R,G,O -> C in 1, A in 2, R in 3 -> works? CARGO: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:G, 5:O. Avoids I,S,E. Good alternative.

PARTY: P, A (known), R (known), T, Y. Since R is already known, using PARTY tests P (new), T (new), Y (new), while confirming A position and moving R to a different position (position 3).

After comparing, PARTY seems like a strong second guess because:
- It tests three new letters: P, T, Y.
- Confirms the position of A.
- Puts R in a new position (position 3) so if it changes feedback, we learn R's position.

If PARTY results:
- If any of P, T, Y are ✓ or -, we know they exist and perhaps positions.
- R should still be present; if it becomes ✓ in position 3, we know R's position.

So I'll go with ""PARTY"".

Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE""): R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(x), E(x), we know:
- A is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.
- R is in the secret word, but not in position 1.
- I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I want to:
- Keep A in position 2 to maintain the known correct position.
- Include R in a position other than 1 to test where it might be (since it can't be in position 1).
- Avoid using I, S, or E entirely.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, focusing on high-frequency consonants like T, P, and vowels like O or U (since E and I are eliminated).

After considering words like ""CARGO"" (which uses C and G) and ""VALOR"" (which uses V, L, O), I choose ""PARTY"". It fits all constraints:
- Position 2 is A.
- R is placed in position 3 (not position 1, avoiding the previous incorrect placement).
- It avoids I, S, E.
- It introduces three new common letters: P (in position 1), T (in position 4), and Y (in position 5), maximizing feedback potential.
""PARTY"" is a valid 5-letter English word meaning a social gathering or celebration.

This guess should help identify R's correct position and test for the presence of P, T, and Y.

<guess> raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback. We need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common strategies involve selecting words with frequent letters or a good mix of vowels and consonants. 

English letter frequency: The most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Vowels are important to test early.

Possible starter words:
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E – covers vowels A and E, and common consonants.
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E – similar vowels, common consonants.
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E – includes vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S. 

After evaluating, ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) improving chances of hitting vowel positions.
- Consonants R and S are very common.
- It avoids repeating letters, ensuring wider coverage.

Thus, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"". This will provide feedback on these common letters and their positions.

Next, I need to output in the required format. Since the guess is ""RAISE"", I write it accordingly.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""RAISE"" resulted in R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(x), E(x). This means:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- R is in the word but not in the correct position (first position was wrong).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So, the secret word:
- Must have the letter A in the second position (position 2).

2. Includes R in a different position (since it can't be in position 1).

4. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Additionally, we want to cover other positions and include fresh consonants/vowels that weren't tested. Possible vowels left: O, U (since A is confirmed, and I,E are out). Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

- MARCH: M,A,R,C,H -> avoids I,S,E. Position 1: M, A in 2, R in 3, C in 4, H in 5. Good.

- BOARD: B,O,A,R,D -> O and D are new, but R is in position 4? Position 2: A? BOARD: positions: B-1, O-2? No, BOARD is B-O-A-R-D, so position 3 is A -> not position 2. Invalid because A must be in position 2.

We need words with A in position 2. Examples:
- _A_T_ (like ""PASTA"" but S is bad -> invalid)
- _A_R_ (like ""MARRY"" but R repeated and Y? Let's think valid words)
  - PARTY: P-A-R-T-Y -> A in position 2, so positions: 1: P, 2: A, 3: R, 4: T, 5: Y. This works, and it avoids I,S,E.
  - CARAT: C-A-R-A-T -> A in 2, but also A in 4? But that's fine. However, it has two A's? Secret might not, but we don't know. Also, avoids I,S,E. But is CARAT common? Valid as a word meaning a unit of weight for gemstones.
- HAREM: H,A,R,E,M -> E is bad -> invalid.
- LARGO: L,A,R,G,O -> avoids I,S,E. Positions: L in 1, A in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.
- TAROT: T,A,R,O,T -> repeats T? Positions: T in 1, A in 2, R in 3, O in 4, T in 5. Avoids I,S,E.

But let's pick one that maximizes new letters. PARTY: introduces P, T, Y (T is very common). MARSH: M,A,R,S,H -> S is bad -> invalid since S eliminated.

Part of the goal is also to test other vowels. O seems a good candidate. Words:
- MAORI: M,A,O,R,I -> I is bad -> invalid.
- VALOR: V,A,L,O,R -> A in position 2? Positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:L, 4:O, 5:R. Avoids I,S,E. Good.

But VALOR has R in position 5, which is new. PARTY has R in 3. Either is fine.

I should include fresh common consonants to test more letters. Consider T, N, L, C, D, M.

Top choice: PARTY (letters P, T, Y) or CARGO: C,A,R,G,O -> C in 1, A in 2, R in 3 -> works? CARGO: positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:G, 5:O. Avoids I,S,E. Good alternative.

PARTY: P, A (known), R (known), T, Y. Since R is already known, using PARTY tests P (new), T (new), Y (new), while confirming A position and moving R to a different position (position 3).

After comparing, PARTY seems like a strong second guess because:
- It tests three new letters: P, T, Y.
- Confirms the position of A.
- Puts R in a new position (position 3) so if it changes feedback, we learn R's position.

If PARTY results:
- If any of P, T, Y are ✓ or -, we know they exist and perhaps positions.
- R should still be present; if it becomes ✓ in position 3, we know R's position.

So I'll go with ""PARTY"".Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE""): R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(x), E(x), we know:
- A is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.
- R is in the secret word, but not in position 1.
- I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I want to:
- Keep A in position 2 to maintain the known correct position.
- Include R in a position other than 1 to test where it might be (since it can't be in position 1).
- Avoid using I, S, or E entirely.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, focusing on high-frequency consonants like T, P, and vowels like O or U (since E and I are eliminated).

After considering words like ""CARGO"" (which uses C and G) and ""VALOR"" (which uses V, L, O), I choose ""PARTY"". It fits all constraints:
- Position 2 is A.
- R is placed in position 3 (not position 1, avoiding the previous incorrect placement).
- It avoids I, S, E.
- It introduces three new common letters: P (in position 1), T (in position 4), and Y (in position 5), maximizing feedback potential.
""PARTY"" is a valid 5-letter English word meaning a social gathering or celebration.

This guess should help identify R's correct position and test for the presence of P, T, and Y.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

So for my initial thought:

I should start with a word that contains frequent letters to increase the chances of getting feedback hits. Considering English letter frequency, I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, E – all common letters, with three vowels and two consonants, covering broad possibilities.

Then, after thinking, output my guess.
</think>
I am starting with no prior information about the secret word. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a guess that includes common letters in the English language, particularly focusing on high-frequency vowels and consonants. This way, I can gather useful information about which letters are present and their positions. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I select ""RAISE"" because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E—all of which are among the most frequent in English words (based on letter frequency data). ""RAISE"" includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which increases the likelihood of identifying correct letters or positions in the first guess. This sets a good foundation for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

We are given the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
  - Interpretation: 
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
    - R is in the word but not in position 1.
    - I, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Guess 2: ""PARTY"" → P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(-) Y(✓)
  - Interpretation:
    - A is still in the correct position (position 2).
    - R is now in the correct position (position 3, since in ""PARTY"" R is at position 3).
    - T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position).
    - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
    - P is not in the word.

So, from all feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 5: Y
- Additionally, T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters not in the word: I, S, E, P (from the x's in both guesses).
- R is confirmed in position 3, so we don't need to move it.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ A R _ Y
- We need to fill positions 1 and 4.
- Position 4 cannot be T (since T is not in position 4, but T is present somewhere else).

Also, we know T is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 1 and 4 are open, T must be in position 1 (because if it were in position 4, it would have been marked as wrong position, but it is marked as present, so it must be in one of the open positions, and position 4 is excluded by the feedback, so T must be in position 1). However, we must consider that T could be in a position that hasn't been tested yet? But in ""PARTY"", T was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not there. The only other open position is position 1. So T must be in position 1? But wait, what if the word has two T's? We don't know. But the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word. Since we have only one T in the guess and it was marked as present but wrong position, and we know position 4 is wrong, then T must be in position 1 or possibly in a position that was already fixed? But positions 2,3,5 are fixed and not T (A, R, Y). So T must be in position 1.

But let's confirm: the secret word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,5 are fixed as A, R, Y. Position 4 was tested with T and it was wrong. So T must be in position 1? But what if the word has T in position 1? Then the feedback for T would be ""-"" if it were in position 1? No, if T were in position 1 and we guessed T in position 4, we would get a ""-"" for T meaning it's in the word but not in position 4, which is consistent. But it doesn't tell us about position 1. So T could be in position 1 or in a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Actually, the feedback for ""PARTY"": 
- P (position 1) is absent (x)
- A (position 2) is correct (✓)
- R (position 3) is correct (✓)
- T (position 4) is present but wrong position (-)
- Y (position 5) is correct (✓)

So T is in the word, but not in position 4. The only positions left are position 1 and any duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates. However, since position 1 was guessed as P and was absent, and T is present, T cannot be in position 1 because if it were, then when we put T in position 4 (which is wrong) but T is in position 1, then the feedback would still show T as present (with a ""-"" for position 4) and we wouldn't know about position 1. But position 1 was tested with P and it was absent, so position 1 is open and could be T? But if position 1 were T, then in the guess ""PARTY"", we have T in position 4, but the secret has T in position 1. Then the feedback for T would be ""-"" (because it's in the word but not in position 4). It doesn't tell us that T is in position 1. But we know position 1 is not P, so it could be T.

Alternatively, T could be in a position that we haven't guessed? But we have only 5 positions. Positions 2,3,5 are fixed and not T (they are A,R,Y). Position 4 is not T (because of the ""-"" meaning not there). So the only possibility is that T is in position 1. Therefore, position 1 must be T.

But wait, what if the word has T in position 1 and also in another position? But we don't have evidence for that. The feedback only shows one T as present, but if there were two, it might not show both? Actually, in Wordle-style feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it. But in this case, we only guessed one T, so if the secret has two T's, we might not know. However, the feedback for T is ""-"", meaning at least one T is present and not in position 4. Since position 1 is the only open position, T must be in position 1. If there were a duplicate, we would need to see, but without evidence, we assume one occurrence.

So, the secret word is T A R _ Y? But we have to fill position 4. And we know T is in the word, and if it's in position 1, then position 4 must be something else.

But let's list what we know:
- Secret word: [position1] A R [position4] Y
- position1: must be T? Because T is in the word and the only possible position left is position1 (since 2,3,5 are fixed and 4 is not T).
- position4: must be a letter that is not I, S, E, P (from the absent letters) and not T (because if it were T, then in ""PARTY"" we would have a second T? But we didn't guess T in position4? In ""PARTY"", we have T in position4 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not there. So position4 cannot be T. Therefore, position1 must be T.

So the word is T A R _ Y.

Now, what can position4 be? It must be a letter that hasn't been used yet and is not in the absent list. Absent letters: I, S, E, P. Also, we have used: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess) and P, A, R, T, Y (from second). So used letters: A, E, I, P, R, S, T, Y.

We need a letter for position4 that is not in {E, I, P, S} (the absent ones) and not A, R, T, Y (which are already in the word). But A, R, T, Y are in the word, so position4 must be a new letter.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to choose a word that fits T A R ? Y and the ? is one of these.

But we don't have many constraints on position4 except that it must be a letter not absent and not conflicting.

However, we also have to make sure that the word is valid. Possible words: TARDY, TARRY, TARTY, TARZY (not a word), etc.

But TARDY is a word (meaning delayed). TARRY is a word (meaning to delay). TARTY is not common. Also, we must avoid letters that are absent.

In TARDY: T, A, R, D, Y. D is not in the absent list. Similarly, TARRY has two R's? But we don't know if R is duplicated. In the feedback, for ""RAISE"", R was present but not in position1, and in ""PARTY"", R was correct in position3. If the secret has two R's, we might not know because we only have one R in each guess. But in ""RAISE"", R was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning R is present but not there. Then in ""PARTY"", R was in position3 and got ""✓"", so that accounts for one R. If there were a second R, we might have seen it in the feedback? Actually, in ""PARTY"", if the secret had two R's, and we only have one R in the guess, the feedback would still only show one R as correct. So we don't know about duplicates.

But for TARRY, it has two R's. However, in our pattern, position3 is R, so if position4 is R, then the word is T A R R Y. But in ""PARTY"", we have position4 as T (which was wrong) and no R in position4, so we wouldn't have detected the second R. But that's possible.

But we need to choose a guess that tests the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses a new letter for position4 to confirm.

But we have only one position to fill, so we can try TARDY or TARRY.

But we also have to consider that T might not be in position1? Earlier I concluded T must be in position1, but let me double-check.

The secret word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5 = ?, A, R, ?, Y.
We know T is in the word and not in position4 (from ""PARTY"" feedback: T in position4 got ""-""). The fixed positions are 2:A, 3:R, 5:Y. So T must be in position1 because that's the only position left? But what about position4? Position4 is not T, so T must be in position1. Yes.

Therefore, the word is T A R ? Y.

Now, for position4, we need a letter that is not in the absent list: absent are I, S, E, P. Also, we have used A, R, T, Y, so position4 must be a new letter.

Possible words:
- TARDY (D)
- TARRY (R) - but R is already in position3, so if we use R again, it might be a duplicate.
- TARTY (T) - but T is already in position1, and T is not in position4 (as per feedback), so TARTY would have T in position1 and position4? But we know position4 is not T, so TARTY is invalid because position4 would be T, which is not allowed.
- TARMY (M) - meaning? Not common, but TARMY is a word (resembling tar).
- TANSY (N) - but N is not absent? TANSY is a plant. But in TANSY, position2 is A, position3 is N? No, T A N S Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:N, 4:S, 5:Y. But S is absent (from first guess), so S cannot be in the word. So TANSY is invalid because of S.
- TANGY (N,G) - T A N G Y -> but position3 is N? But we need position3 to be R. So no, the pattern must be T A R ? Y, so position3 is fixed as R.

So the word must start with T, then A, then R, then one letter, then Y.

Possible letters for position4: any letter except A, R, T, Y (because if it were one of these, it would be a duplicate, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed) and except the absent letters: I, S, E, P.

Common possibilities:
- D: TARDY
- R: TARRY (duplicate R)
- N: TARN Y - but TARN is not a 5-letter word? TARNY is not a word. TARN is 4 letters.
- L: TARLY? Not a word.
- M: TARMY? Not common, but TARMY is accepted in some dictionaries (meaning resinous).
- H: TARRY? Already considered.
- C: TARCY? Not a word.
- G: TARGY? Not a word.
- B: TARBY? Not a word.
- F: TARFY? Not a word.
- K: TARKY? Not a word.
- V: TARVY? Not a word.
- W: TARWY? Not a word.
- O: TAROT? But TAROT is T A R O T -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:R, 4:O, 5:T. But we need position5 to be Y, not T. So invalid.
- U: TARRU? Not a word.

So the only common words are TARDY and TARRY.

TARDY: T, A, R, D, Y
TARRY: T, A, R, R, Y

We need to choose one. Since we have no information about duplicates, we should pick the more common word or one that tests a new letter.

But we can also consider that in the feedback, we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that isn't necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we have only one position unknown, so we might as well guess a possible solution.

But we have two candidates: TARDY and TARRY. We need to pick one.

To be safe, we can choose TARDY because it introduces a new letter D, which hasn't been tested. If it's not correct, we get feedback on D.

But if we guess TARDY and it's wrong, we know D is absent, then the only other possibility is TARRY (or a very obscure word).

Similarly, if we guess TARRY and it's wrong, then TARDY might be it.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

Since we have limited guesses, and we are on guess 3, we can make a guess that is a possible solution.

I think TARDY is a more common word, so I'll go with that.

But wait, we have to output the guess.

So the next guess is ""TARDY"".

But let me confirm the pattern: T A R D Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:R, 4:D, 5:Y. This matches the fixed positions and the requirement that T is in position1 and D is a new letter.

If it's not TARDY, then we can adjust.

So, the guess is ""TARDY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""RAISE"")**: R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(x), E(x) → A is in position 2; R is in the word but not position 1; I, S, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""PARTY"")**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(-), Y(✓) → A (position 2) and R (position 3) are confirmed correct; Y is in position 5; T is in the word but not position 4; P is absent.

### Analysis:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 = A, position 3 = R, position 5 = Y. The secret word pattern is `_ A R _ Y`.
- **T's position**: T is present but not in position 4. Since positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed (A, R, Y), and position 4 cannot be T, T must be in position 1. Thus, the pattern is `T A R _ Y`.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, P (from both guesses) cannot be in the word.
- **Position 4 constraints**: Must be a letter not in {A, R, T, Y} (to avoid duplicates unless confirmed) and not absent. Common options are D (for ""TARDY"") or R (for ""TARRY""). ""TARDY"" is chosen as it tests a new letter (D) and is a common English word.

### Guess Selection:
I choose ""TARDY"" because:
- It fits the pattern `T A R _ Y` with D in position 4.
- It tests D, a new high-frequency consonant, for immediate feedback.
- If incorrect, the feedback on D will confirm if ""TARRY"" (with R in position 4) is the solution.

<guess>tardy</guess>",tardy,"We are given the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
  - Interpretation: 
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
    - R is in the word but not in position 1.
    - I, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Guess 2: ""PARTY"" → P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(-) Y(✓)
  - Interpretation:
    - A is still in the correct position (position 2).
    - R is now in the correct position (position 3, since in ""PARTY"" R is at position 3).
    - T is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position).
    - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
    - P is not in the word.

So, from all feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 5: Y
- Additionally, T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters not in the word: I, S, E, P (from the x's in both guesses).
- R is confirmed in position 3, so we don't need to move it.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ A R _ Y
- We need to fill positions 1 and 4.
- Position 4 cannot be T (since T is not in position 4, but T is present somewhere else).

Also, we know T is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 1 and 4 are open, T must be in position 1 (because if it were in position 4, it would have been marked as wrong position, but it is marked as present, so it must be in one of the open positions, and position 4 is excluded by the feedback, so T must be in position 1). However, we must consider that T could be in a position that hasn't been tested yet? But in ""PARTY"", T was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not there. The only other open position is position 1. So T must be in position 1? But wait, what if the word has two T's? We don't know. But the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word. Since we have only one T in the guess and it was marked as present but wrong position, and we know position 4 is wrong, then T must be in position 1 or possibly in a position that was already fixed? But positions 2,3,5 are fixed and not T (A, R, Y). So T must be in position 1.

But let's confirm: the secret word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,5 are fixed as A, R, Y. Position 4 was tested with T and it was wrong. So T must be in position 1? But what if the word has T in position 1? Then the feedback for T would be ""-"" if it were in position 1? No, if T were in position 1 and we guessed T in position 4, we would get a ""-"" for T meaning it's in the word but not in position 4, which is consistent. But it doesn't tell us about position 1. So T could be in position 1 or in a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Actually, the feedback for ""PARTY"": 
- P (position 1) is absent (x)
- A (position 2) is correct (✓)
- R (position 3) is correct (✓)
- T (position 4) is present but wrong position (-)
- Y (position 5) is correct (✓)

So T is in the word, but not in position 4. The only positions left are position 1 and any duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates. However, since position 1 was guessed as P and was absent, and T is present, T cannot be in position 1 because if it were, then when we put T in position 4 (which is wrong) but T is in position 1, then the feedback would still show T as present (with a ""-"" for position 4) and we wouldn't know about position 1. But position 1 was tested with P and it was absent, so position 1 is open and could be T? But if position 1 were T, then in the guess ""PARTY"", we have T in position 4, but the secret has T in position 1. Then the feedback for T would be ""-"" (because it's in the word but not in position 4). It doesn't tell us that T is in position 1. But we know position 1 is not P, so it could be T.

Alternatively, T could be in a position that we haven't guessed? But we have only 5 positions. Positions 2,3,5 are fixed and not T (they are A,R,Y). Position 4 is not T (because of the ""-"" meaning not there). So the only possibility is that T is in position 1. Therefore, position 1 must be T.

But wait, what if the word has T in position 1 and also in another position? But we don't have evidence for that. The feedback only shows one T as present, but if there were two, it might not show both? Actually, in Wordle-style feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it. But in this case, we only guessed one T, so if the secret has two T's, we might not know. However, the feedback for T is ""-"", meaning at least one T is present and not in position 4. Since position 1 is the only open position, T must be in position 1. If there were a duplicate, we would need to see, but without evidence, we assume one occurrence.

So, the secret word is T A R _ Y? But we have to fill position 4. And we know T is in the word, and if it's in position 1, then position 4 must be something else.

But let's list what we know:
- Secret word: [position1] A R [position4] Y
- position1: must be T? Because T is in the word and the only possible position left is position1 (since 2,3,5 are fixed and 4 is not T).
- position4: must be a letter that is not I, S, E, P (from the absent letters) and not T (because if it were T, then in ""PARTY"" we would have a second T? But we didn't guess T in position4? In ""PARTY"", we have T in position4 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not there. So position4 cannot be T. Therefore, position1 must be T.

So the word is T A R _ Y.

Now, what can position4 be? It must be a letter that hasn't been used yet and is not in the absent list. Absent letters: I, S, E, P. Also, we have used: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess) and P, A, R, T, Y (from second). So used letters: A, E, I, P, R, S, T, Y.

We need a letter for position4 that is not in {E, I, P, S} (the absent ones) and not A, R, T, Y (which are already in the word). But A, R, T, Y are in the word, so position4 must be a new letter.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to choose a word that fits T A R ? Y and the ? is one of these.

But we don't have many constraints on position4 except that it must be a letter not absent and not conflicting.

However, we also have to make sure that the word is valid. Possible words: TARDY, TARRY, TARTY, TARZY (not a word), etc.

But TARDY is a word (meaning delayed). TARRY is a word (meaning to delay). TARTY is not common. Also, we must avoid letters that are absent.

In TARDY: T, A, R, D, Y. D is not in the absent list. Similarly, TARRY has two R's? But we don't know if R is duplicated. In the feedback, for ""RAISE"", R was present but not in position1, and in ""PARTY"", R was correct in position3. If the secret has two R's, we might not know because we only have one R in each guess. But in ""RAISE"", R was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning R is present but not there.
