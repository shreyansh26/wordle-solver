We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So the secret word does not contain C or N.
It must contain R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in the guess.

Recall that the positions for ""crane"" are:
1. C (absent)
2. R (present but not in position 2)
3. A (present but not in position 3)
4. N (absent)
5. E (present but not in position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters R, A, E present (each at least once).
- Letters C and N absent.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Avoid using C and N.
2. Include R, A, E but in different positions than in ""crane"".
3. Try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

Let me think about the positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4? Wait, positions are 1 to 5. Since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for A (was position 3, so not there) and E (was position 5, so not there).

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So I should assume no duplicates for now unless forced.

Since we know A, R, E are in the word, and we must not use C and N, the next guess should include R, A, E and two new letters to test.

Positions:
We know R is not in position 2.
We know A is not in position 3.
We know E is not in position 5.

For our next guess, we should avoid placing R in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

We should try to place R, A, E in positions that are possible for the secret word. But we don't know which positions are correct yet.

Idea: choose a word that has R, A, E in different positions, plus two new letters.

Common letters: let's try S and T? Because S and T are very common.

Possible words: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? But E cannot be at the end because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E might not be at position 5? However, the secret word has E but not at position 5? It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, A not at 3.

Let me try to form a word.

Consider the word ""STARE"":
- S at first, T at second, A at third, R at fourth, E at fifth.

But we know A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can put A at position 3 because it might be correct in a different word? But no, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, meaning that position 3 is definitely wrong for A. So if we put A again at position 3, it will still be marked - (wrong position) if that's the case. But it isn't the correct position? So to test a new position we should put A elsewhere.

Similarly, we want to move R from position 2? But we won't put it at position 2 again since we know it's wrong.

For ""STARE"", let's see the positions:
Position 1: S (new)
Position 2: T (new)
Position 3: A (we know A cannot be at position 3, so avoid? But perhaps we can use it to confirm, but that would waste a position. So better to put A in a new position? So avoid position 3.

Similarly, R in position 4 (new position) and E in position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So E should be avoided at position 5.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not ideal because it places A at position 3 (which is forbidden) and E at position 5 (forbidden).

So we need a word with:
- R: not at position 2
- A: not at position 3
- E: not at position 5

And we want to include R, A, E in our next guess to confirm their presence and possibly find their positions.

Let me think of words that do not have A at position 3 and E at position 5 and that don't use C or N.

Possible words: 
- How about ""LATER""? 
  L at first, A at second, T at third, E at fourth, R at fifth.

But let's check:
- Position 2: A (was previously at position 3 and wrong, so maybe A at position 2 is possible? Since secret word has A somewhere else)
- Position 4: E (not position 5, so that's good)
- Position 5: R (was previously at position 2 and wrong, so not there? Wait, but R could be at position 5? We don't know, so it's okay.

In ""LATER"":
- Positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

We are placing:
- A at position 2, which was not tested before? Because in ""crane"" A was at position 3 and wrong, so position 2 is a new position and might be correct.
- Similarly, E at position 4 (new position, since E was at position 5 and not there? It could be at position 4? Not necessarily, but it's a possibility.
- R at position 5 (previously at position 2 and wrong, so now position 5 is a possibility).

Also, we are introducing two new letters: L and T.

Alternatively, another option: ""RAISE"". But R at position 1? That's possible? And A at 2? Position 1: R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.

But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong? Because E was in position 5 and marked wrong? Not necessarily, in the secret word E might be in position 5? But the feedback for E was - meaning it is in the word but not at position 5? Because if it were at position 5, it would be marked ✓.

So the symbol - for E means: E is in the word, but not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has E but not at position 5.

So putting E at position 5 in a new guess will yield - again, meaning wrong position. But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? That would be unwise. We should avoid position 5 for E because we know it definitely isn't there? Exactly, since it was in position 5 and marked wrong? So position 5 is known not to be E.

So we should not put E at position 5 in our guess. Similarly, A at position 3 and R at position 2 is not to be done? Because they were marked as not being there? But we can put R at position 2 if we want, but it would just repeat that it's wrong? So better to avoid to not waste spots.

Therefore, for next guess, avoid positions that we know are wrong:
- For R: avoid position 2? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, so putting it at position 2 again will get a - again, which we already know. So better to put R in a new position? So we can test a position that might be correct.

Similarly, avoid position 3 for A? Position 5 for E? Because they are confirmed wrong.

And for positions that were not tested? We don't know, but positions: position 2 was for R and it's wrong? Actually, the letter that was there (R) was not at the correct spot, but the position itself isn't necessarily bad? We just know R isn't there.

I think ""RAISE"" is problematic because E is at position 5, which we know E is not at 5.

So ""RAISE"" is bad.

Another word: ""ALERT""
- A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

Check:
- Position 1: A (previously A was at position 3 and wrong; placing at position 1 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E (but we don't know yet if E can be at position 3? In fact, E was only at position 5, so position 3 is unknown? So okay.)
- Position 4: R (was at position 2 and wrong, now at position 4)
- Position 5: T (new)

And E is not at position 5? So that's good.

We avoid C and N? Yes.

Also, we are testing A and E in new positions, and R in a new position.

Could also try ""ROAST"" but R at position 1? And O? But O is a vowel? And we have A? But ""ROAST"" has O and A and S and R? But R at position 1. And E is missing? But we must include E because we know E is in the word? We have to include R, A, E? Not necessarily? But including them might help place them?

We know that R, A, E are in the word? So if I don't include one, I might miss it? But the goal is to confirm their positions? Actually, we need to find the word? So I should include them to get positional info.

So including R, A, E in the guess? But I have limited positions? Two more letters? Yes.

Another possibility: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E.
Positions: 1:I? Not common, 2:R? But R is known not at position 2? In ""crane"" R was at position 2 and wrong? Why put at position 2 again? Then R at position 2 will still be marked wrong? Unless the word has duplicate R? But unlikely? But possible? So to save moves, avoid known wrong positions if possible.

So ""IRATE"": R at position 2 -> which we know is incorrect? Because R was at position 2 and marked wrong? So we know that R is not at position 2 regardless of duplicates? Because if there were another R? But if there is an R at position 2 and another R somewhere else? But the feedback marks one? It's tricky.

Standard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word once and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get a dash. If you guess it twice? It depends? Each feedback is per letter per occurrence? But often guessed letters are compared? We don't have duplicate? In ""crane"" all distinct.

Secret word might have duplicate? But not necessarily? Without feedback, we should avoid? But let's stick to distinct letters? Because duplicates are rarer? I think it's better to assume no duplicates unless forced? Given the information.

Therefore, to use R not in position 2? And similarly avoid A in position 3 and E in position 5.

So ""LATER"": 
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: A (not attempted before? Because in ""crane"", A was at position 3? So A at position 2 is new)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (E was at position 5? So position 4 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 5: R (R was at position 2? So position 5 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)

Also, we are introducing L and T.

Other possibilities? ""STEAR""? Is that a word? Stear is not common? Usually spelled differently? Better use common words.

""RATEL"" is a word? Maybe not well-known? ""TARES""? ""TARES"" works? T, A, R, E, S.

""TARES"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R (but we know R was at position 2 and wrong? Now at position 3? Why not?)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Again, we have A at position 2? E at position 4? R at position 3? And avoid C and N.

Also, we are introducing T and S? Which are common? So ""TARES"" might be a good choice? It has R, A, E? Yes.

But R at position 3? Previously R was at position 2 and wrong? Placing R at position 3? Could be? Similarly, E at position 4? Etc.

Another common word: ""ADIEU"" but missing R? And has D and U? But we must include R? Because we know R is present? We don't have to? But if I don't, I miss an opportunity to pin down R? Also E? But E is included? But R is missing.

If I guess without R, I might not get info on R? So better to include R, A, E.

I think ""TARES"" is a good word? ""STARE"" was bad because E at 5? But ""TARES"" has E at position 4? So better.

""TARES"": 
Yes, that is a valid word.

""LATER"" is also valid? But ""LATER"" has E at position 4? R at 5? So both? I think ""TARES"" has the advantage? Because S and T are very common? So we might uncover more letters? But L in ""LATER"" might not be as common? So ""TARES"" might be better? Because if S or T are in the word? We can find out.

But in secret word, we know C and N are absent? So S or T might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Therefore, I choose ""TARES"" as the next guess? So we can test T and S.

But wait, ""TARES"": 
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: A (new position for A, was at position 3? Now at 2)
Position 3: R (new position for R, was at position 2? Now at 3)
Position 4: E (new position for E, was at position 5? Now at 4)
Position 5: S (new)

We hope to get feedback on each.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is bad? Because E at 5? Yes.

""PARSE"" but we don't know P? And missing A? Wait, P,A,R,S,E? Position: P, A, R, S, E? Then E at 5? Bad? Same issue.

So after considering, ""TARES"" seems solid? Or ""LATER""?

Perhaps ""STALE"" but has L? And E at end? And missing R? Because S,T,A,L,E? Then no R? But we know R is present? So if I guess ""STALE"", I might get feedback that R is missing? But I already know it? But I won't get positional? So not advisable? Because I need to find the R position.

Therefore, words with R,A,E are essential? And ""TARES"" includes all three? So let's use ""TARES""?

But let's confirm: is ""TARES"" a word? Yes, meaning like hay or grass? It is accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""ALERT"": has R,A,E? Positions: A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? Then T at 5.

In ""ALERT"", we placed A at position 1? Previously A was at position 3 and wrong? So position 1 is new? Similarly E at position 3? Previously E was at position 5? So position 3 is new? And R at position 4? Position 4 is new? As opposed to position 4 for E in ""TARES"".

But ""TARES"" places E at position 4? Which is good? Because it avoids position 5? And in ""ALERT"", E at position 3? Similarly valid? I think both are fine.

But I'll go with ""TARES"" because it uses common letters? And T and S? So potentially more information? Because S is very common? If S is in the word? We'll know? If not, eliminated.

So I guess ""tares""? Spelling: T A R E S.

So the next guess: tares

But in response format: <guess>tares</guess>

We'll see feedback? 
</think>
After analyzing the first guess ""crane"", the feedback indicates:
- Letters R, A, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.
- Letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word that includes R, A, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C and N.
- Place R, A, and E in new positions to test for correctness:
  - R should not be in position 2.
  - A should not be in position 3.
  - E should not be in position 5.
- Include two new common letters to gather more information.

After brainstorming words, ""tares"" fits well:
- Letters: T, A, R, E, S.
- Positions:
  - A is in position 2 (avoiding position 3).
  - R is in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
  - E is in position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters T and S, which are common and could provide useful feedback.

Reasoning for ""tares"":
- Avoids wasteful positions: Placement of A at position 2, R at position 3, and E at position 4 are all untested but possible locations.
- Efficient probing: Tests T and S instead of less common letters.
- Word validity: ""Tares"" (meaning weeds or hay) is a valid word.

This guess maximizes feedback potential without reusing forbidden positions.

<guess>tares</guess>",tares,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So the secret word does not contain C or N.
It must contain R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in the guess.

Recall that the positions for ""crane"" are:
1. C (absent)
2. R (present but not in position 2)
3. A (present but not in position 3)
4. N (absent)
5. E (present but not in position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters R, A, E present (each at least once).
- Letters C and N absent.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Avoid using C and N.
2. Include R, A, E but in different positions than in ""crane"".
3. Try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

Let me think about the positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4? Wait, positions are 1 to 5. Since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for A (was position 3, so not there) and E (was position 5, so not there).

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So I should assume no duplicates for now unless forced.

Since we know A, R, E are in the word, and we must not use C and N, the next guess should include R, A, E and two new letters to test.

Positions:
We know R is not in position 2.
We know A is not in position 3.
We know E is not in position 5.

For our next guess, we should avoid placing R in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

We should try to place R, A, E in positions that are possible for the secret word. But we don't know which positions are correct yet.

Idea: choose a word that has R, A, E in different positions, plus two new letters.

Common letters: let's try S and T? Because S and T are very common.

Possible words: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? But E cannot be at the end because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E might not be at position 5? However, the secret word has E but not at position 5? It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, A not at 3.

Let me try to form a word.

Consider the word ""STARE"":
- S at first, T at second, A at third, R at fourth, E at fifth.

But we know A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can put A at position 3 because it might be correct in a different word? But no, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, meaning that position 3 is definitely wrong for A. So if we put A again at position 3, it will still be marked - (wrong position) if that's the case. But it isn't the correct position? So to test a new position we should put A elsewhere.

Similarly, we want to move R from position 2? But we won't put it at position 2 again since we know it's wrong.

For ""STARE"", let's see the positions:
Position 1: S (new)
Position 2: T (new)
Position 3: A (we know A cannot be at position 3, so avoid? But perhaps we can use it to confirm, but that would waste a position. So better to put A in a new position? So avoid position 3.

Similarly, R in position 4 (new position) and E in position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So E should be avoided at position 5.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not ideal because it places A at position 3 (which is forbidden) and E at position 5 (forbidden).

So we need a word with:
- R: not at position 2
- A: not at position 3
- E: not at position 5

And we want to include R, A, E in our next guess to confirm their presence and possibly find their positions.

Let me think of words that do not have A at position 3 and E at position 5 and that don't use C or N.

Possible words: 
- How about ""LATER""? 
  L at first, A at second, T at third, E at fourth, R at fifth.

But let's check:
- Position 2: A (was previously at position 3 and wrong, so maybe A at position 2 is possible? Since secret word has A somewhere else)
- Position 4: E (not position 5, so that's good)
- Position 5: R (was previously at position 2 and wrong, so not there? Wait, but R could be at position 5? We don't know, so it's okay.

In ""LATER"":
- Positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

We are placing:
- A at position 2, which was not tested before? Because in ""crane"" A was at position 3 and wrong, so position 2 is a new position and might be correct.
- Similarly, E at position 4 (new position, since E was at position 5 and not there? It could be at position 4? Not necessarily, but it's a possibility.
- R at position 5 (previously at position 2 and wrong, so now position 5 is a possibility).

Also, we are introducing two new letters: L and T.

Alternatively, another option: ""RAISE"". But R at position 1? That's possible? And A at 2? Position 1: R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.

But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong? Because E was in position 5 and marked wrong? Not necessarily, in the secret word E might be in position 5? But the feedback for E was - meaning it is in the word but not at position 5? Because if it were at position 5, it would be marked ✓.

So the symbol - for E means: E is in the word, but not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has E but not at position 5.

So putting E at position 5 in a new guess will yield - again, meaning wrong position. But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? That would be unwise. We should avoid position 5 for E because we know it definitely isn't there? Exactly, since it was in position 5 and marked wrong? So position 5 is known not to be E.

So we should not put E at position 5 in our guess. Similarly, A at position 3 and R at position 2 is not to be done? Because they were marked as not being there? But we can put R at position 2 if we want, but it would just repeat that it's wrong? So better to avoid to not waste spots.

Therefore, for next guess, avoid positions that we know are wrong:
- For R: avoid position 2? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, so putting it at position 2 again will get a - again, which we already know. So better to put R in a new position? So we can test a position that might be correct.

Similarly, avoid position 3 for A? Position 5 for E? Because they are confirmed wrong.

And for positions that were not tested? We don't know, but positions: position 2 was for R and it's wrong? Actually, the letter that was there (R) was not at the correct spot, but the position itself isn't necessarily bad? We just know R isn't there.

I think ""RAISE"" is problematic because E is at position 5, which we know E is not at 5.

So ""RAISE"" is bad.

Another word: ""ALERT""
- A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

Check:
- Position 1: A (previously A was at position 3 and wrong; placing at position 1 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E (but we don't know yet if E can be at position 3? In fact, E was only at position 5, so position 3 is unknown? So okay.)
- Position 4: R (was at position 2 and wrong, now at position 4)
- Position 5: T (new)

And E is not at position 5? So that's good.

We avoid C and N? Yes.

Also, we are testing A and E in new positions, and R in a new position.

Could also try ""ROAST"" but R at position 1? And O? But O is a vowel? And we have A? But ""ROAST"" has O and A and S and R? But R at position 1. And E is missing? But we must include E because we know E is in the word? We have to include R, A, E? Not necessarily? But including them might help place them?

We know that R, A, E are in the word? So if I don't include one, I might miss it? But the goal is to confirm their positions? Actually, we need to find the word? So I should include them to get positional info.

So including R, A, E in the guess? But I have limited positions? Two more letters? Yes.

Another possibility: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E.
Positions: 1:I? Not common, 2:R? But R is known not at position 2? In ""crane"" R was at position 2 and wrong? Why put at position 2 again? Then R at position 2 will still be marked wrong? Unless the word has duplicate R? But unlikely? But possible? So to save moves, avoid known wrong positions if possible.

So ""IRATE"": R at position 2 -> which we know is incorrect? Because R was at position 2 and marked wrong? So we know that R is not at position 2 regardless of duplicates? Because if there were another R? But if there is an R at position 2 and another R somewhere else? But the feedback marks one? It's tricky.

Standard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word once and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get a dash. If you guess it twice? It depends? Each feedback is per letter per occurrence? But often guessed letters are compared? We don't have duplicate? In ""crane"" all distinct.

Secret word might have duplicate? But not necessarily? Without feedback, we should avoid? But let's stick to distinct letters? Because duplicates are rarer? I think it's better to assume no duplicates unless forced? Given the information.

Therefore, to use R not in position 2? And similarly avoid A in position 3 and E in position 5.

So ""LATER"": 
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: A (not attempted before? Because in ""crane"", A was at position 3? So A at position 2 is new)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (E was at position 5? So position 4 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 5: R (R was at position 2? So position 5 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)

Also, we are introducing L and T.

Other possibilities? ""STEAR""? Is that a word? Stear is not common? Usually spelled differently? Better use common words.

""RATEL"" is a word? Maybe not well-known? ""TARES""? ""TARES"" works? T, A, R, E, S.

""TARES"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R (but we know R was at position 2 and wrong? Now at position 3? Why not?)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Again, we have A at position 2? E at position 4? R at position 3? And avoid C and N.

Also, we are introducing T and S? Which are common? So ""TARES"" might be a good choice? It has R, A, E? Yes.

But R at position 3? Previously R was at position 2 and wrong? Placing R at position 3? Could be? Similarly, E at position 4? Etc.

Another common word: ""ADIEU"" but missing R? And has D and U? But we must include R? Because we know R is present? We don't have to? But if I don't, I miss an opportunity to pin down R? Also E? But E is included? But R is missing.

If I guess without R, I might not get info on R? So better to include R, A, E.

I think ""TARES"" is a good word? ""STARE"" was bad because E at 5? But ""TARES"" has E at position 4? So better.

""TARES"": 
Yes, that is a valid word.

""LATER"" is also valid? But ""LATER"" has E at position 4? R at 5? So both? I think ""TARES"" has the advantage? Because S and T are very common? So we might uncover more letters? But L in ""LATER"" might not be as common? So ""TARES"" might be better? Because if S or T are in the word? We can find out.

But in secret word, we know C and N are absent? So S or T might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Therefore, I choose ""TARES"" as the next guess? So we can test T and S.

But wait, ""TARES"": 
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: A (new position for A, was at position 3? Now at 2)
Position 3: R (new position for R, was at position 2? Now at 3)
Position 4: E (new position for E, was at position 5? Now at 4)
Position 5: S (new)

We hope to get feedback on each.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is bad? Because E at 5? Yes.

""PARSE"" but we don't know P? And missing A? Wait, P,A,R,S,E? Position: P, A, R, S, E? Then E at 5? Bad? Same issue.

So after considering, ""TARES"" seems solid? Or ""LATER""?

Perhaps ""STALE"" but has L? And E at end? And missing R? Because S,T,A,L,E? Then no R? But we know R is present? So if I guess ""STALE"", I might get feedback that R is missing? But I already know it? But I won't get positional? So not advisable? Because I need to find the R position.

Therefore, words with R,A,E are essential? And ""TARES"" includes all three? So let's use ""TARES""?

But let's confirm: is ""TARES"" a word? Yes, meaning like hay or grass? It is accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""ALERT"": has R,A,E? Positions: A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? Then T at 5.

In ""ALERT"", we placed A at position 1? Previously A was at position 3 and wrong? So position 1 is new? Similarly E at position 3? Previously E was at position 5? So position 3 is new? And R at position 4? Position 4 is new? As opposed to position 4 for E in ""TARES"".

But ""TARES"" places E at position 4? Which is good? Because it avoids position 5? And in ""ALERT"", E at position 3? Similarly valid? I think both are fine.

But I'll go with ""TARES"" because it uses common letters? And T and S? So potentially more information? Because S is very common? If S is in the word? We'll know? If not, eliminated.

So I guess ""tares""? Spelling: T A R E S.

So the next guess: tares

But in response format: <guess>tares</guess>

We'll see feedback?After analyzing the first guess ""crane"", the feedback indicates:
- Letters R, A, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.
- Letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word that includes R, A, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C and N.
- Place R, A, and E in new positions to test for correctness:
  - R should not be in position 2.
  - A should not be in position 3.
  - E should not be in position 5.
- Include two new common letters to gather more information.

After brainstorming words, ""tares"" fits well:
- Letters: T, A, R, E, S.
- Positions:
  - A is in position 2 (avoiding position 3).
  - R is in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
  - E is in position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters T and S, which are common and could provide useful feedback.

Reasoning for ""tares"":
- Avoids wasteful positions: Placement of A at position 2, R at position 3, and E at position 4 are all untested but possible locations.
- Efficient probing: Tests T and S instead of less common letters.
- Word validity: ""Tares"" (meaning weeds or hay) is a valid word.

This guess maximizes feedback potential without reusing forbidden positions.",Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,extra,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So the secret word does not contain C or N.
It must contain R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in the guess.

Recall that the positions for ""crane"" are:
1. C (absent)
2. R (present but not in position 2)
3. A (present but not in position 3)
4. N (absent)
5. E (present but not in position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters R, A, E present (each at least once).
- Letters C and N absent.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Avoid using C and N.
2. Include R, A, E but in different positions than in ""crane"".
3. Try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

Let me think about the positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4? Wait, positions are 1 to 5. Since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for A (was position 3, so not there) and E (was position 5, so not there).

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So I should assume no duplicates for now unless forced.

Since we know A, R, E are in the word, and we must not use C and N, the next guess should include R, A, E and two new letters to test.

Positions:
We know R is not in position 2.
We know A is not in position 3.
We know E is not in position 5.

For our next guess, we should avoid placing R in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

We should try to place R, A, E in positions that are possible for the secret word. But we don't know which positions are correct yet.

Idea: choose a word that has R, A, E in different positions, plus two new letters.

Common letters: let's try S and T? Because S and T are very common.

Possible words: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? But E cannot be at the end because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E might not be at position 5? However, the secret word has E but not at position 5? It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, A not at 3.

Let me try to form a word.

Consider the word ""STARE"":
- S at first, T at second, A at third, R at fourth, E at fifth.

But we know A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can put A at position 3 because it might be correct in a different word? But no, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, meaning that position 3 is definitely wrong for A. So if we put A again at position 3, it will still be marked - (wrong position) if that's the case. But it isn't the correct position? So to test a new position we should put A elsewhere.

Similarly, we want to move R from position 2? But we won't put it at position 2 again since we know it's wrong.

For ""STARE"", let's see the positions:
Position 1: S (new)
Position 2: T (new)
Position 3: A (we know A cannot be at position 3, so avoid? But perhaps we can use it to confirm, but that would waste a position. So better to put A in a new position? So avoid position 3.

Similarly, R in position 4 (new position) and E in position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So E should be avoided at position 5.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not ideal because it places A at position 3 (which is forbidden) and E at position 5 (forbidden).

So we need a word with:
- R: not at position 2
- A: not at position 3
- E: not at position 5

And we want to include R, A, E in our next guess to confirm their presence and possibly find their positions.

Let me think of words that do not have A at position 3 and E at position 5 and that don't use C or N.

Possible words: 
- How about ""LATER""? 
  L at first, A at second, T at third, E at fourth, R at fifth.

But let's check:
- Position 2: A (was previously at position 3 and wrong, so maybe A at position 2 is possible? Since secret word has A somewhere else)
- Position 4: E (not position 5, so that's good)
- Position 5: R (was previously at position 2 and wrong, so not there? Wait, but R could be at position 5? We don't know, so it's okay.

In ""LATER"":
- Positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

We are placing:
- A at position 2, which was not tested before? Because in ""crane"" A was at position 3 and wrong, so position 2 is a new position and might be correct.
- Similarly, E at position 4 (new position, since E was at position 5 and not there? It could be at position 4? Not necessarily, but it's a possibility.
- R at position 5 (previously at position 2 and wrong, so now position 5 is a possibility).

Also, we are introducing two new letters: L and T.

Alternatively, another option: ""RAISE"". But R at position 1? That's possible? And A at 2? Position 1: R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.

But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong? Because E was in position 5 and marked wrong? Not necessarily, in the secret word E might be in position 5? But the feedback for E was - meaning it is in the word but not at position 5? Because if it were at position 5, it would be marked ✓.

So the symbol - for E means: E is in the word, but not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has E but not at position 5.

So putting E at position 5 in a new guess will yield - again, meaning wrong position. But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? That would be unwise. We should avoid position 5 for E because we know it definitely isn't there? Exactly, since it was in position 5 and marked wrong? So position 5 is known not to be E.

So we should not put E at position 5 in our guess. Similarly, A at position 3 and R at position 2 is not to be done? Because they were marked as not being there? But we can put R at position 2 if we want, but it would just repeat that it's wrong? So better to avoid to not waste spots.

Therefore, for next guess, avoid positions that we know are wrong:
- For R: avoid position 2? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, so putting it at position 2 again will get a - again, which we already know. So better to put R in a new position? So we can test a position that might be correct.

Similarly, avoid position 3 for A? Position 5 for E? Because they are confirmed wrong.

And for positions that were not tested? We don't know, but positions: position 2 was for R and it's wrong? Actually, the letter that was there (R) was not at the correct spot, but the position itself isn't necessarily bad? We just know R isn't there.

I think ""RAISE"" is problematic because E is at position 5, which we know E is not at 5.

So ""RAISE"" is bad.

Another word: ""ALERT""
- A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

Check:
- Position 1: A (previously A was at position 3 and wrong; placing at position 1 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E (but we don't know yet if E can be at position 3? In fact, E was only at position 5, so position 3 is unknown? So okay.)
- Position 4: R (was at position 2 and wrong, now at position 4)
- Position 5: T (new)

And E is not at position 5? So that's good.

We avoid C and N? Yes.

Also, we are testing A and E in new positions, and R in a new position.

Could also try ""ROAST"" but R at position 1? And O? But O is a vowel? And we have A? But ""ROAST"" has O and A and S and R? But R at position 1. And E is missing? But we must include E because we know E is in the word? We have to include R, A, E? Not necessarily? But including them might help place them?

We know that R, A, E are in the word? So if I don't include one, I might miss it? But the goal is to confirm their positions? Actually, we need to find the word? So I should include them to get positional info.

So including R, A, E in the guess? But I have limited positions? Two more letters? Yes.

Another possibility: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E.
Positions: 1:I? Not common, 2:R? But R is known not at position 2? In ""crane"" R was at position 2 and wrong? Why put at position 2 again? Then R at position 2 will still be marked wrong? Unless the word has duplicate R? But unlikely? But possible? So to save moves, avoid known wrong positions if possible.

So ""IRATE"": R at position 2 -> which we know is incorrect? Because R was at position 2 and marked wrong? So we know that R is not at position 2 regardless of duplicates? Because if there were another R? But if there is an R at position 2 and another R somewhere else? But the feedback marks one? It's tricky.

Standard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word once and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get a dash. If you guess it twice? It depends? Each feedback is per letter per occurrence? But often guessed letters are compared? We don't have duplicate? In ""crane"" all distinct.

Secret word might have duplicate? But not necessarily? Without feedback, we should avoid? But let's stick to distinct letters? Because duplicates are rarer? I think it's better to assume no duplicates unless forced? Given the information.

Therefore, to use R not in position 2? And similarly avoid A in position 3 and E in position 5.

So ""LATER"": 
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: A (not attempted before? Because in ""crane"", A was at position 3? So A at position 2 is new)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (E was at position 5? So position 4 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 5: R (R was at position 2? So position 5 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)

Also, we are introducing L and T.

Other possibilities? ""STEAR""? Is that a word? Stear is not common? Usually spelled differently? Better use common words.

""RATEL"" is a word? Maybe not well-known? ""TARES""? ""TARES"" works? T, A, R, E, S.

""TARES"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R (but we know R was at position 2 and wrong? Now at position 3? Why not?)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Again, we have A at position 2? E at position 4? R at position 3? And avoid C and N.

Also, we are introducing T and S? Which are common? So ""TARES"" might be a good choice? It has R, A, E? Yes.

But R at position 3? Previously R was at position 2 and wrong? Placing R at position 3? Could be? Similarly, E at position 4? Etc.

Another common word: ""ADIEU"" but missing R? And has D and U? But we must include R? Because we know R is present? We don't have to? But if I don't, I miss an opportunity to pin down R? Also E? But E is included? But R is missing.

If I guess without R, I might not get info on R? So better to include R, A, E.

I think ""TARES"" is a good word? ""STARE"" was bad because E at 5? But ""TARES"" has E at position 4? So better.

""TARES"": 
Yes, that is a valid word.

""LATER"" is also valid? But ""LATER"" has E at position 4? R at 5? So both? I think ""TARES"" has the advantage? Because S and T are very common? So we might uncover more letters? But L in ""LATER"" might not be as common? So ""TARES"" might be better? Because if S or T are in the word? We can find out.

But in secret word, we know C and N are absent? So S or T might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Therefore, I choose ""TARES"" as the next guess? So we can test T and S.

But wait, ""TARES"": 
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: A (new position for A, was at position 3? Now at 2)
Position 3: R (new position for R, was at position 2? Now at 3)
Position 4: E (new position for E, was at position 5? Now at 4)
Position 5: S (new)

We hope to get feedback on each.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is bad? Because E at 5? Yes.

""PARSE"" but we don't know P? And missing A? Wait, P,A,R,S,E? Position: P, A, R, S, E? Then E at 5? Bad? Same issue.

So after considering, ""TARES"" seems solid? Or ""LATER""?

Perhaps ""STALE"" but has L? And E at end? And missing R? Because S,T,A,L,E? Then no R? But we know R is present? So if I guess ""STALE"", I might get feedback that R is missing? But I already know it? But I won't get positional? So not advisable? Because I need to find the R position.

Therefore, words with R,A,E are essential? And ""TARES"" includes all three? So let's use ""TARES""?

But let's confirm: is ""TARES"" a word? Yes, meaning like hay or grass? It is accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""ALERT"": has R,A,E? Positions: A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? Then T at 5.

In ""ALERT"", we placed A at position 1? Previously A was at position 3 and wrong? So position 1 is new? Similarly E at position 3? Previously E was at position 5? So position 3 is new? And R at position 4? Position 4 is new? As opposed to position 4 for E in ""TARES"".

But ""TARES"" places E at position 4? Which is good? Because it avoids position 5? And in ""ALERT"", E at position 3? Similarly valid? I think both are fine.

But I'll go with ""TARES"" because it uses common letters? And T and S? So potentially more information? Because S is very common? If S is in the word? We'll know? If not, eliminated.

So I guess ""tares""? Spelling: T A R E S.

So the next guess: tares

But in response format: <guess>tares</guess>

We'll see feedback?After analyzing the first guess ""crane"", the feedback indicates:
- Letters R, A, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.
- Letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word that includes R, A, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C and N.
- Place R, A, and E in new positions to test for correctness:
  - R should not be in position 2.
  - A should not be in position 3.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n\nSo the secret word does not contain C or N.\nIt must contain R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in the guess.\n\nRecall that the positions for ""crane"" are:\n1. C (absent)\n2. R (present but not in position 2)\n3. A (present but not in position 3)\n4. N (absent)\n5. E (present but not in position 5)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Letters R, A, E present (each at least once).\n- Letters C and N absent.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters.\n\nFor the next guess, we should:\n1. Avoid using C and N.\n2. Include R, A, E but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n3. Try to use other common letters to uncover more information.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4? Wait, positions are 1 to 5. Since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for A (was position 3, so not there) and E (was position 5, so not there).\n\nBut note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So I should assume no duplicates for now unless forced.\n\nSince we know A, R, E are in the word, and we must not use C and N, the next guess should include R, A, E and two new letters to test.\n\nPositions:\nWe know R is not in position 2.\nWe know A is not in position 3.\nWe know E is not in position 5.\n\nFor our next guess, we should avoid placing R in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.\n\nWe should try to place R, A, E in positions that are possible for the secret word. But we don\'t know which positions are correct yet.\n\nIdea: choose a word that has R, A, E in different positions, plus two new letters.\n\nCommon letters: let\'s try S and T? Because S and T are very common.\n\nPossible words: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? But E cannot be at the end because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E might not be at position 5? However, the secret word has E but not at position 5? It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, R is not at position 2, A not at 3.\n\nLet me try to form a word.\n\nConsider the word ""STARE"":\n- S at first, T at second, A at third, R at fourth, E at fifth.\n\nBut we know A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong position. So we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can put A at position 3 because it might be correct in a different word? But no, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, meaning that position 3 is definitely wrong for A. So if we put A again at position 3, it will still be marked - (wrong position) if that\'s the case. But it isn\'t the correct position? So to test a new position we should put A elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, we want to move R from position 2? But we won\'t put it at position 2 again since we know it\'s wrong.\n\nFor ""STARE"", let\'s see the positions:\nPosition 1: S (new)\nPosition 2: T (new)\nPosition 3: A (we know A cannot be at position 3, so avoid? But perhaps we can use it to confirm, but that would waste a position. So better to put A in a new position? So avoid position 3.\n\nSimilarly, R in position 4 (new position) and E in position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So E should be avoided at position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""STARE"" is not ideal because it places A at position 3 (which is forbidden) and E at position 5 (forbidden).\n\nSo we need a word with:\n- R: not at position 2\n- A: not at position 3\n- E: not at position 5\n\nAnd we want to include R, A, E in our next guess to confirm their presence and possibly find their positions.\n\nLet me think of words that do not have A at position 3 and E at position 5 and that don\'t use C or N.\n\nPossible words: \n- How about ""LATER""? \n  L at first, A at second, T at third, E at fourth, R at fifth.\n\nBut let\'s check:\n- Position 2: A (was previously at position 3 and wrong, so maybe A at position 2 is possible? Since secret word has A somewhere else)\n- Position 4: E (not position 5, so that\'s good)\n- Position 5: R (was previously at position 2 and wrong, so not there? Wait, but R could be at position 5? We don\'t know, so it\'s okay.\n\nIn ""LATER"":\n- Positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R\n\nWe are placing:\n- A at position 2, which was not tested before? Because in ""crane"" A was at position 3 and wrong, so position 2 is a new position and might be correct.\n- Similarly, E at position 4 (new position, since E was at position 5 and not there? It could be at position 4? Not necessarily, but it\'s a possibility.\n- R at position 5 (previously at position 2 and wrong, so now position 5 is a possibility).\n\nAlso, we are introducing two new letters: L and T.\n\nAlternatively, another option: ""RAISE"". But R at position 1? That\'s possible? And A at 2? Position 1: R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.\n\nBut E is at position 5, which we know is wrong? Because E was in position 5 and marked wrong? Not necessarily, in the secret word E might be in position 5? But the feedback for E was - meaning it is in the word but not at position 5? Because if it were at position 5, it would be marked ✓.\n\nSo the symbol - for E means: E is in the word, but not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has E but not at position 5.\n\nSo putting E at position 5 in a new guess will yield - again, meaning wrong position. But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? That would be unwise. We should avoid position 5 for E because we know it definitely isn\'t there? Exactly, since it was in position 5 and marked wrong? So position 5 is known not to be E.\n\nSo we should not put E at position 5 in our guess. Similarly, A at position 3 and R at position 2 is not to be done? Because they were marked as not being there? But we can put R at position 2 if we want, but it would just repeat that it\'s wrong? So better to avoid to not waste spots.\n\nTherefore, for next guess, avoid positions that we know are wrong:\n- For R: avoid position 2? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, so putting it at position 2 again will get a - again, which we already know. So better to put R in a new position? So we can test a position that might be correct.\n\nSimilarly, avoid position 3 for A? Position 5 for E? Because they are confirmed wrong.\n\nAnd for positions that were not tested? We don\'t know, but positions: position 2 was for R and it\'s wrong? Actually, the letter that was there (R) was not at the correct spot, but the position itself isn\'t necessarily bad? We just know R isn\'t there.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" is problematic because E is at position 5, which we know E is not at 5.\n\nSo ""RAISE"" is bad.\n\nAnother word: ""ALERT""\n- A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\nCheck:\n- Position 1: A (previously A was at position 3 and wrong; placing at position 1 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know.)\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: E (but we don\'t know yet if E can be at position 3? In fact, E was only at position 5, so position 3 is unknown? So okay.)\n- Position 4: R (was at position 2 and wrong, now at position 4)\n- Position 5: T (new)\n\nAnd E is not at position 5? So that\'s good.\n\nWe avoid C and N? Yes.\n\nAlso, we are testing A and E in new positions, and R in a new position.\n\nCould also try ""ROAST"" but R at position 1? And O? But O is a vowel? And we have A? But ""ROAST"" has O and A and S and R? But R at position 1. And E is missing? But we must include E because we know E is in the word? We have to include R, A, E? Not necessarily? But including them might help place them?\n\nWe know that R, A, E are in the word? So if I don\'t include one, I might miss it? But the goal is to confirm their positions? Actually, we need to find the word? So I should include them to get positional info.\n\nSo including R, A, E in the guess? But I have limited positions? Two more letters? Yes.\n\nAnother possibility: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E.\nPositions: 1:I? Not common, 2:R? But R is known not at position 2? In ""crane"" R was at position 2 and wrong? Why put at position 2 again? Then R at position 2 will still be marked wrong? Unless the word has duplicate R? But unlikely? But possible? So to save moves, avoid known wrong positions if possible.\n\nSo ""IRATE"": R at position 2 -> which we know is incorrect? Because R was at position 2 and marked wrong? So we know that R is not at position 2 regardless of duplicates? Because if there were another R? But if there is an R at position 2 and another R somewhere else? But the feedback marks one? It\'s tricky.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word once and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get a dash. If you guess it twice? It depends? Each feedback is per letter per occurrence? But often guessed letters are compared? We don\'t have duplicate? In ""crane"" all distinct.\n\nSecret word might have duplicate? But not necessarily? Without feedback, we should avoid? But let\'s stick to distinct letters? Because duplicates are rarer? I think it\'s better to assume no duplicates unless forced? Given the information.\n\nTherefore, to use R not in position 2? And similarly avoid A in position 3 and E in position 5.\n\nSo ""LATER"": \n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: A (not attempted before? Because in ""crane"", A was at position 3? So A at position 2 is new)\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: E (E was at position 5? So position 4 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know.)\n- Position 5: R (R was at position 2? So position 5 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know.)\n\nAlso, we are introducing L and T.\n\nOther possibilities? ""STEAR""? Is that a word? Stear is not common? Usually spelled differently? Better use common words.\n\n""RATEL"" is a word? Maybe not well-known? ""TARES""? ""TARES"" works? T, A, R, E, S.\n\n""TARES"": \n- Position 1: T\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: R (but we know R was at position 2 and wrong? Now at position 3? Why not?)\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: S\n\nAgain, we have A at position 2? E at position 4? R at position 3? And avoid C and N.\n\nAlso, we are introducing T and S? Which are common? So ""TARES"" might be a good choice? It has R, A, E? Yes.\n\nBut R at position 3? Previously R was at position 2 and wrong? Placing R at position 3? Could be? Similarly, E at position 4? Etc.\n\nAnother common word: ""ADIEU"" but missing R? And has D and U? But we must include R? Because we know R is present? We don\'t have to? But if I don\'t, I miss an opportunity to pin down R? Also E? But E is included? But R is missing.\n\nIf I guess without R, I might not get info on R? So better to include R, A, E.\n\nI think ""TARES"" is a good word? ""STARE"" was bad because E at 5? But ""TARES"" has E at position 4? So better.\n\n""TARES"": \nYes, that is a valid word.\n\n""LATER"" is also valid? But ""LATER"" has E at position 4? R at 5? So both? I think ""TARES"" has the advantage? Because S and T are very common? So we might uncover more letters? But L in ""LATER"" might not be as common? So ""TARES"" might be better? Because if S or T are in the word? We can find out.\n\nBut in secret word, we know C and N are absent? So S or T might be present? Or absent? We don\'t know.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""TARES"" as the next guess? So we can test T and S.\n\nBut wait, ""TARES"": \nPosition 1: T (new)\nPosition 2: A (new position for A, was at position 3? Now at 2)\nPosition 3: R (new position for R, was at position 2? Now at 3)\nPosition 4: E (new position for E, was at position 5? Now at 4)\nPosition 5: S (new)\n\nWe hope to get feedback on each.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" is bad? Because E at 5? Yes.\n\n""PARSE"" but we don\'t know P? And missing A? Wait, P,A,R,S,E? Position: P, A, R, S, E? Then E at 5? Bad? Same issue.\n\nSo after considering, ""TARES"" seems solid? Or ""LATER""?\n\nPerhaps ""STALE"" but has L? And E at end? And missing R? Because S,T,A,L,E? Then no R? But we know R is present? So if I guess ""STALE"", I might get feedback that R is missing? But I already know it? But I won\'t get positional? So not advisable? Because I need to find the R position.\n\nTherefore, words with R,A,E are essential? And ""TARES"" includes all three? So let\'s use ""TARES""?\n\nBut let\'s confirm: is ""TARES"" a word? Yes, meaning like hay or grass? It is accepted as a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALERT"": has R,A,E? Positions: A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? Then T at 5.\n\nIn ""ALERT"", we placed A at position 1? Previously A was at position 3 and wrong? So position 1 is new? Similarly E at position 3? Previously E was at position 5? So position 3 is new? And R at position 4? Position 4 is new? As opposed to position 4 for E in ""TARES"".\n\nBut ""TARES"" places E at position 4? Which is good? Because it avoids position 5? And in ""ALERT"", E at position 3? Similarly valid? I think both are fine.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""TARES"" because it uses common letters? And T and S? So potentially more information? Because S is very common? If S is in the word? We\'ll know? If not, eliminated.\n\nSo I guess ""tares""? Spelling: T A R E S.\n\nSo the next guess: tares\n\nBut in response format: <guess>tares</guess>\n\nWe\'ll see feedback?After analyzing the first guess ""crane"", the feedback indicates:\n- Letters R, A, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.\n- Letters C and N are not in the secret word.\n- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I need:\n- A valid 5-letter English word that includes R, A, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoid C and N.\n- Place R, A, and E in new positions to test for correctness:\n  - R should not be in position 2.\n  - A should not be in position 3.\n  - E should not be in position 5.\n- Include two new common letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter brainstorming words, ""tares"" fits well:\n- Letters: T, A, R, E, S.\n- Positions:\n  - A is in position 2 (avoiding position 3).\n  - R is in position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n  - E is in position 4 (avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces new letters T and S, which are common and could provide useful feedback.\n\nReasoning for ""tares"":\n- Avoids wasteful positions: Placement of A at position 2, R at position 3, and E at position 4 are all untested but possible locations.\n- Efficient probing: Tests T and S instead of less common letters.\n- Word validity: ""Tares"" (meaning weeds or hay) is a valid word.\n\nThis guess maximizes feedback potential without reusing forbidden positions.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   Interpretation:
      - C and N are not in the word.
      - R, A, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed: 
          R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: tares -> Feedback: T(-), A(-), R(-), E(-), S(x)
   Interpretation:
      - S is not in the word (S is confirmed absent).
      - T, A, R, E are in the word, but in wrong positions as per the positions guessed:
        For ""tares"":
          Position 1: T(-) -> T is in the word, but not at position 1.
          Position 2: A(-) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (this is new: we already knew A not at position 3 from guess 1; now also not at position 2).
          Position 3: R(-) -> R is in the word, but not at position 3 (we already knew R not at position 2 from guess 1; now also not at position 3).
          Position 4: E(-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4 (we already knew E not at position 5; now also not at position 4).

From both guesses, we know:
- Absent letters: C, N, S.
- Present letters: R, A, E (from guess 1) and T (from guess 2) are confirmed in the word. Also, we have R, A, E, T present (and from the feedback of both guesses, we see that the word must contain these four).
- Since the word is 5 letters long, and we have four confirmed letters (R, A, E, T), the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been eliminated.

Now, let's list the possible positions that are invalid for each letter so far:

For A:
- From ""crane"" (position 3): not at position 3.
- From ""tares"" (position 2): not at position 2.
So A cannot be at positions 2 or 3.

For R:
- From ""crane"" (position 2): not at position 2.
- From ""tares"" (position 3): not at position 3.
So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3.

For E:
- From ""crane"" (position 5): not at position 5.
- From ""tares"" (position 4): not at position 4.
So E cannot be at positions 4 or 5.

For T:
- From ""tares"" (position 1): not at position 1.

We also note that all four of these letters must be placed in the remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but we have only five positions and four letters? However, we know the word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily; duplicates are possible, but we haven't encountered any evidence yet.

Wait, we have five positions and four confirmed letters? Then one of these letters must appear twice? Or there is a fifth letter? Actually, we must find a fifth letter that is not among the eliminated ones (C, N, S) and not R, A, E, T? Because R, A, E, T are known to be present? But they might be more than one? However, we don't have any duplicate feedback yet? So likely each is one occurrence? But not necessarily.

But the feedback for ""tares"" didn't have any ""x"" except S? And T, A, R, E got dashes? Meaning each one is present, and each one is in the word? So if each is present and the word has five letters, then the word must contain exactly these four? Then one of them must be duplicated? Or there is a fifth letter? But we don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify if there are duplicates? Because if a letter is duplicated and we guess one, it might not account for extra? Alternatively, if we have five distinct letters: R, A, E, T, and one unknown? But we had ""crane"" and ""tares"", which included letters? So let's reason:

We have eliminated: C, N, S.

We have confirmed: R, A, E, T.

Thus, the fifth letter must not be C, N, S? And must be any letter not yet eliminated? But we don't know? So it must be present? And we haven't guessed it? So the fifth letter is missing from our guesses so far? Therefore, we need to include R, A, E, T and a fifth new letter that hasn't been guessed? And hasn't been eliminated? So we must try a fifth letter.

But note: we only have four positions effectively? Because we have five positions? We have to place five letters? But with four letters confirmed? So one duplicate? Without feedback about duplicates, it is likely that the word has only four distinct letters? But we don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? So perhaps we should consider that one letter is duplicated? Or we have a fifth unknown letter.

Since from guess 1 we had R, A, E? And guess 2 added T? And S was eliminated? Then the word has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But what about E? How? So the secret word has five letters: consisting of R, A, E, T and one more.

But we don't know what that one more is? So we need to guess a word that has R, A, E, T? And a fifth letter? Which hasn't been eliminated? So not C, N, S.

Now, possible positions? We need to assign R, A, E, T and fifth letter to positions 1-5? Avoiding the forbidden placements:

For A: avoid positions 2 and 3? So possible: position 1, 4, or 5? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5; so available: 1,4,5.

For R: avoid positions 2 and 3? So available: 1, 4, 5? Same? But position overlap? We cannot put two letters at the same position? So we have four letters? Or five? We need to assign each to a position? But also, one position must be the fifth letter? Or we have duplicate? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be another letter? But we don't have an alternative? So?

First, list possible positions available:

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:

A: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.
R: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.
E: cannot be at 4 or 5 -> allowed positions: 1,2,3? Because 4 and 5 are forbidden? So E can be at 1, 2, or 3? Not? Because E is forbidden at 4 and 5? So E can be at 1,2,3.
T: cannot be at 1 -> allowed positions: 2,3,4,5.

Now, fifth letter: we don't know? It must be placed? And it hasn't been guessed? So we need to introduce? How? We must guess a word that exactly has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But we have five letters? So we have four letters but we need five? Therefore:

Let me think: we have no duplication? Because if there were duplication, the feedback might show something? For example, if R appeared twice? Then when we guessed one R correctly placed? We might not know? But so far, we have guessed each of R, A, E, T, one? And they were present? So if the word contains two Rs? Then when we guessed R at one position, it might not be the only one? But without feedback? We don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't distinguish: if a letter is duplicated, and we guessed one instance in wrong position and another? But we have placed R only once? So we don't know? Therefore, we must consider the possibility of a fifth letter? So the word has five distinct letters? Probably? But duplicates are possible? So we should not assume? But since we have eliminated only S, and not T? Etc.

But from the absence of any duplicate feedback? By parsimony? We assume distinct letters? Until proven otherwise? So I'll proceed with distinct? Because it's simpler? And we have R,A,E,T? And a fifth letter? Which must not be C, N, S? And not any other? So among the other letters? How to choose? We must pick a new letter? So let's introduce a letter like O, U, I, L, D? Etc? Common vowels/consonants? We also need to assign positions for T, A, R, E? With constraints? And the fifth letter? In a position.

But we have three positions for E: 1? Or 2? Or 3? Etc? And similarly for others? So we must form a word with letters: R, A, E, T, and X? Where X is a new letter not C, N, S.

For example, let X be L? Then word ""LATER""? But L is new? And positions: 
- L at position 1?
- A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? Because from guess 2 (tares), A was at position 2 and wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore ""LATER"" places A at position 2? Which is forbidden? So not possible? Similarly, ""ALTER"" but then A at position 1? Etc? Let me see.

Avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3? And E cannot be at 4 or 5? Etc.

Also, we haven't guessed any word with E in positions 1,2,3? So we need to put E at one of 1,2,3.

Now, possible words? With R, A, E, T and a fifth letter.

Fifth letter possibilities: let's pick common letters? But not eliminated: so not C, N, S? Common letters: L, O, U, I, D, G, H? Etc.

Let me compile possible words? Also, the word must be valid? And meet position constraints.

For example, ""IRATE"": but I? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning angry? 
Positions:
- Position 1: I (new letter)
- Position 2: R -> R cannot be at position 2 (known from guess 1)? Because R was at position 2 in crane and wrong? So not position 2? Therefore putting R at position 2? Will get dash? Which is redundant? So avoid? Because we already know R cannot be at position 2? So why put it there? Then using ""IRATE"": is waste? Because R at position 2? Also, placing T? Where? Position 5? Which is possible? Since T can be at 5? But E is at position 5? Contradiction? ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? Positions:
1: I
2: R -> avoid: position 2 for R
3: A -> position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? Also known? Because from crane? So positions 2 and 3 are forbidden? For R? And A? So both issues.

Therefore ""IRATE"" is bad? Because R and A in forbidden positions.

Another word: ""TREAT"": duplicate T? Could be? But we don't know? Or ""TRAIL"": has R,A,I? And L? But missing E? But we know E is present? So must include E? Therefore words without E are invalid? Because E must be in the word? Similarly, T? R? A?

So we must have E? Therefore, ""TREAT"": T, R, E, A, T? Duplicate T? So positions: 
1:T -> T cannot be at position 1? Known? Then 
2:R -> R cannot at position 2? Known? 
3:E -> E can be at position 3? Because forbidden? Only 4 and 5? So position 3 allowed? Yes? 
4:A -> A can be at position 4? Because forbid 2 and 3? So position 4 allowed? 
5:T -> T cannot be at position 5? Why? We don't know? Because T forbidden at position 1? But position 5 might be allowed? 

But in ""TREAT"", T is repeated? So feedback might be interesting? But we have to see? But the word has only four distinct letters? Then which T gets the feedback? It might be messy? Alternatively, avoid? Because simpler to avoid duplicates? 

But let's consider: since E can be at position 3? And A at position 4? So possible? But T and R are in forbidden positions? Positions 1 and 2? So the guess will be? But we already know that T1 is wrong and R2 is wrong? So we waste positions? So better choose a word that doesn't put any letter in a position we know forbidden? Unless forced? 

Therefore, we need to put R, A, E, T, and a fifth letter in positions that are allowed? And avoid positions that are forbidden for each? 

So:

Available positions:

A: positions 1,4,5.
R: positions 1,4,5.
E: positions 1,2,3.
T: positions 2,3,4,5.

Now, positions? How to assign?

Position 1: can be A, R, or E? Or the fifth letter? Similarly.

But conflict? Because positions 1,4,5 are available for R and A? But E can only be at 1,2,3? T can be at 2,3,4,5.

We need to form a valid English word? So let's find? 

Put E at position 1? Then R or A cannot be at position 1? Then at position 1: E? Position 1 for E? Valid? Like ""EARTH""? Earth has E, A, R, T? And H? Fifth letter H? So positions: E at 1? Then available? But E at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because E can be at position 1? 
Then A? Must be at 4 or 5? Etc? 

""EARTH"": 
- Position 1: E -> allowed? Yes? 
- Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Because from tares? A was at position 2? Marked wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore, putting A at position 2? Will get dash? Redundant? 

Similarly, why? If we put E at position 1? Then we can place A at position 4 or 5? But ""EARTH"" puts A at position 2? Which is bad? So ""EARTH"" is not good? 

""ETRAP"": Not common? ""REACT"": has C? Eliminated? C not allowed? 

""LATER"": but L? Then position 1:L? Then A at position 2? But A cannot at position 2? So no? 

""ALERT"": 
- Position 1: A? Allowed? A at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because not position 2 or 3? 
- Position 2: L? 
- Position 3: E? Allowed? E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: R? Allowed? R can be at position 4? 
- Position 5: T? T can be at position 5? 

Check constraints:
- A: position 1 => allowed? Yes? Because constraints: A allowed at 1,4,5? Position 1 is good? 
- E: position 3 => allowed? Yes? E can be at position 3? 
- R: position 4 => allowed? Yes? R can be at position 4? 
- T: position 5 => allowed? Yes? T can be at position 5? 
- L: fifth letter? Which we don't know? But haven't guessed? So valid? 

But what about feedback? Will we get useful? The word ""ALERT"" satisfies constraints? And is a valid word? 

Another option: ""OATER""? Obscure? ""WATER"": has W? Then positions: 
W at position 1? 
A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? So not allowed? 

""TRIED"": has D? Then T at position 1? T cannot at position 1? So avoid? 

""TRIAL"": T at position 1? Not allowed? 

""TREAD"": T at position 1? Not allowed? 

""STARE"": but S eliminated? 

""CRATE"": C eliminated? 

So after looking? ""ALERT"" seems suitable? 

Alternatively? ""LATRE"": not word? ""AISLE"": missing R? 

""TABLE"": missing R and E? 

Therefore? We choose ""ALERT"" as the next guess? Because it satisfies the position constraints? And uses L as the fifth letter? We hope to get feedback on L? And refine? 

But note: E is at position 3? And A at position 1? R at position 4? T at position 5? All within allowed positions? 

We also haven't guessed L? So if L is absent? Or present? We'll know? 

But L might be present? Or we must see? At this point, I guess ""ALERT"". 

After analyzing, ""ALERT"" is:

- Position 1: A -> we know A cannot be at 2 or 3? So we put at 1? Which is allowed? Might be correct? Or not? 
- Position 2: L -> new letter? 
- Position 3: E -> we know E cannot be at 4 or 5? So position 3? Might be correct? 
- Position 4: R -> R cannot be at 2 or 3? Position 4? Might be correct? 
- Position 5: T -> we know T cannot be at 1? So position 5? Might be correct? 

So all placements are in newly tested positions? So potentially? We might get some correct? Or get clues? 

Therefore, next guess: alert

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

Following the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  
   - C and N are **absent**.  
   - R, A, E are **present** but not in positions 2, 3, or 5, respectively.

2. **Guess 2: tares → Feedback: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)**  
   - S is **absent**.  
   - T, A, R, E are **present** but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed present letters**: R, A, E, T.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, N, S.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from *tares*) or 3 (from *crane*).  
  - **R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from *crane*) or 3 (from *tares*).  
  - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from *tares*) or 5 (from *crane*).  
  - **T**: Cannot be in position 1 (from *tares*).  
- Since R, A, E, T are all confirmed present, the secret word must include *exactly these four letters* plus **one unknown letter** (not C, N, or S).  
- The unknown fifth letter must be inferred by testing **common letters** not yet eliminated (e.g., L, O, I, D, G, H).  

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Prioritize:  
  - **Place A, R, E, T only in allowed positions**:  
    - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.  
    - R: Positions 1, 4, or 5.  
    - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.  
    - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - Include a **new common vowel/consonant** that hasn't been tested (e.g., L).  
- **""ALERT""** (meaning *vigilant*) fits all constraints:  
  - Positions:  
    - A at position 1 (allowed per constraints).  
    - L at position 2 (new letter; not eliminated).  
    - E at position 3 (allowed per constraints).  
    - R at position 4 (allowed per constraints).  
    - T at position 5 (allowed per constraints).  
  - Avoids forbidden positions for all confirmed letters.  
- If L is present, we get positional feedback; if absent, it is eliminated for future guesses.

This guess efficiently tests constraints and introduces ""L"" as a potential fifth letter while respecting all feedback.

<guess>alert</guess>",alert,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   Interpretation:
      - C and N are not in the word.
      - R, A, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed: 
          R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: tares -> Feedback: T(-), A(-), R(-), E(-), S(x)
   Interpretation:
      - S is not in the word (S is confirmed absent).
      - T, A, R, E are in the word, but in wrong positions as per the positions guessed:
        For ""tares"":
          Position 1: T(-) -> T is in the word, but not at position 1.
          Position 2: A(-) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (this is new: we already knew A not at position 3 from guess 1; now also not at position 2).
          Position 3: R(-) -> R is in the word, but not at position 3 (we already knew R not at position 2 from guess 1; now also not at position 3).
          Position 4: E(-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4 (we already knew E not at position 5; now also not at position 4).

From both guesses, we know:
- Absent letters: C, N, S.
- Present letters: R, A, E (from guess 1) and T (from guess 2) are confirmed in the word. Also, we have R, A, E, T present (and from the feedback of both guesses, we see that the word must contain these four).
- Since the word is 5 letters long, and we have four confirmed letters (R, A, E, T), the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been eliminated.

Now, let's list the possible positions that are invalid for each letter so far:

For A:
- From ""crane"" (position 3): not at position 3.
- From ""tares"" (position 2): not at position 2.
So A cannot be at positions 2 or 3.

For R:
- From ""crane"" (position 2): not at position 2.
- From ""tares"" (position 3): not at position 3.
So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3.

For E:
- From ""crane"" (position 5): not at position 5.
- From ""tares"" (position 4): not at position 4.
So E cannot be at positions 4 or 5.

For T:
- From ""tares"" (position 1): not at position 1.

We also note that all four of these letters must be placed in the remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but we have only five positions and four letters? However, we know the word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily; duplicates are possible, but we haven't encountered any evidence yet.

Wait, we have five positions and four confirmed letters? Then one of these letters must appear twice? Or there is a fifth letter? Actually, we must find a fifth letter that is not among the eliminated ones (C, N, S) and not R, A, E, T? Because R, A, E, T are known to be present? But they might be more than one? However, we don't have any duplicate feedback yet? So likely each is one occurrence? But not necessarily.

But the feedback for ""tares"" didn't have any ""x"" except S? And T, A, R, E got dashes? Meaning each one is present, and each one is in the word? So if each is present and the word has five letters, then the word must contain exactly these four? Then one of them must be duplicated? Or there is a fifth letter? But we don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify if there are duplicates? Because if a letter is duplicated and we guess one, it might not account for extra? Alternatively, if we have five distinct letters: R, A, E, T, and one unknown? But we had ""crane"" and ""tares"", which included letters? So let's reason:

We have eliminated: C, N, S.

We have confirmed: R, A, E, T.

Thus, the fifth letter must not be C, N, S? And must be any letter not yet eliminated? But we don't know? So it must be present? And we haven't guessed it? So the fifth letter is missing from our guesses so far? Therefore, we need to include R, A, E, T and a fifth new letter that hasn't been guessed? And hasn't been eliminated? So we must try a fifth letter.

But note: we only have four positions effectively? Because we have five positions? We have to place five letters? But with four letters confirmed? So one duplicate? Without feedback about duplicates, it is likely that the word has only four distinct letters? But we don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? So perhaps we should consider that one letter is duplicated? Or we have a fifth unknown letter.

Since from guess 1 we had R, A, E? And guess 2 added T? And S was eliminated? Then the word has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But what about E? How? So the secret word has five letters: consisting of R, A, E, T and one more.

But we don't know what that one more is? So we need to guess a word that has R, A, E, T? And a fifth letter? Which hasn't been eliminated? So not C, N, S.

Now, possible positions? We need to assign R, A, E, T and fifth letter to positions 1-5? Avoiding the forbidden placements:

For A: avoid positions 2 and 3? So possible: position 1, 4, or 5? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5; so available: 1,4,5.

For R: avoid positions 2 and 3? So available: 1, 4, 5? Same? But position overlap? We cannot put two letters at the same position? So we have four letters? Or five? We need to assign each to a position? But also, one position must be the fifth letter? Or we have duplicate? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be another letter? But we don't have an alternative? So?

First, list possible positions available:

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:

A: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.
R: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.
E: cannot be at 4 or 5 -> allowed positions: 1,2,3? Because 4 and 5 are forbidden? So E can be at 1, 2, or 3? Not? Because E is forbidden at 4 and 5? So E can be at 1,2,3.
T: cannot be at 1 -> allowed positions: 2,3,4,5.

Now, fifth letter: we don't know? It must be placed? And it hasn't been guessed? So we need to introduce? How? We must guess a word that exactly has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But we have five letters? So we have four letters but we need five? Therefore:

Let me think: we have no duplication? Because if there were duplication, the feedback might show something? For example, if R appeared twice? Then when we guessed one R correctly placed? We might not know? But so far, we have guessed each of R, A, E, T, one? And they were present? So if the word contains two Rs? Then when we guessed R at one position, it might not be the only one? But without feedback? We don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't distinguish: if a letter is duplicated, and we guessed one instance in wrong position and another? But we have placed R only once? So we don't know? Therefore, we must consider the possibility of a fifth letter? So the word has five distinct letters? Probably? But duplicates are possible? So we should not assume? But since we have eliminated only S, and not T? Etc.

But from the absence of any duplicate feedback? By parsimony? We assume distinct letters? Until proven otherwise? So I'll proceed with distinct? Because it's simpler? And we have R,A,E,T? And a fifth letter? Which must not be C, N, S? And not any other? So among the other letters? How to choose? We must pick a new letter? So let's introduce a letter like O, U, I, L, D? Etc? Common vowels/consonants? We also need to assign positions for T, A, R, E? With constraints? And the fifth letter? In a position.

But we have three positions for E: 1? Or 2? Or 3? Etc? And similarly for others? So we must form a word with letters: R, A, E, T, and X? Where X is a new letter not C, N, S.

For example, let X be L? Then word ""LATER""? But L is new? And positions: 
- L at position 1?
- A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? Because from guess 2 (tares), A was at position 2 and wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore ""LATER"" places A at position 2? Which is forbidden? So not possible? Similarly, ""ALTER"" but then A at position 1? Etc? Let me see.

Avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3? And E cannot be at 4 or 5? Etc.

Also, we haven't guessed any word with E in positions 1,2,3? So we need to put E at one of 1,2,3.

Now, possible words? With R, A, E, T and a fifth letter.

Fifth letter possibilities: let's pick common letters? But not eliminated: so not C, N, S? Common letters: L, O, U, I, D, G, H? Etc.

Let me compile possible words? Also, the word must be valid? And meet position constraints.

For example, ""IRATE"": but I? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning angry? 
Positions:
- Position 1: I (new letter)
- Position 2: R -> R cannot be at position 2 (known from guess 1)? Because R was at position 2 in crane and wrong? So not position 2? Therefore putting R at position 2? Will get dash? Which is redundant? So avoid? Because we already know R cannot be at position 2? So why put it there? Then using ""IRATE"": is waste? Because R at position 2? Also, placing T? Where? Position 5? Which is possible? Since T can be at 5? But E is at position 5? Contradiction? ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? Positions:
1: I
2: R -> avoid: position 2 for R
3: A -> position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? Also known? Because from crane? So positions 2 and 3 are forbidden? For R? And A? So both issues.

Therefore ""IRATE"" is bad? Because R and A in forbidden positions.

Another word: ""TREAT"": duplicate T? Could be? But we don't know? Or ""TRAIL"": has R,A,I? And L? But missing E? But we know E is present? So must include E? Therefore words without E are invalid? Because E must be in the word? Similarly, T? R? A?

So we must have E? Therefore, ""TREAT"": T, R, E, A, T? Duplicate T? So positions: 
1:T -> T cannot be at position 1? Known? Then 
2:R -> R cannot at position 2? Known? 
3:E -> E can be at position 3? Because forbidden? Only 4 and 5? So position 3 allowed? Yes? 
4:A -> A can be at position 4? Because forbid 2 and 3? So position 4 allowed? 
5:T -> T cannot be at position 5? Why? We don't know? Because T forbidden at position 1? But position 5 might be allowed? 

But in ""TREAT"", T is repeated? So feedback might be interesting? But we have to see? But the word has only four distinct letters? Then which T gets the feedback? It might be messy? Alternatively, avoid? Because simpler to avoid duplicates? 

But let's consider: since E can be at position 3? And A at position 4? So possible? But T and R are in forbidden positions? Positions 1 and 2? So the guess will be? But we already know that T1 is wrong and R2 is wrong? So we waste positions? So better choose a word that doesn't put any letter in a position we know forbidden? Unless forced? 

Therefore, we need to put R, A, E, T, and a fifth letter in positions that are allowed? And avoid positions that are forbidden for each? 

So:

Available positions:

A: positions 1,4,5.
R: positions 1,4,5.
E: positions 1,2,3.
T: positions 2,3,4,5.

Now, positions? How to assign?

Position 1: can be A, R, or E? Or the fifth letter? Similarly.

But conflict? Because positions 1,4,5 are available for R and A? But E can only be at 1,2,3? T can be at 2,3,4,5.

We need to form a valid English word? So let's find? 

Put E at position 1? Then R or A cannot be at position 1? Then at position 1: E? Position 1 for E? Valid? Like ""EARTH""? Earth has E, A, R, T? And H? Fifth letter H? So positions: E at 1? Then available? But E at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because E can be at position 1? 
Then A? Must be at 4 or 5? Etc? 

""EARTH"": 
- Position 1: E -> allowed? Yes? 
- Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Because from tares? A was at position 2? Marked wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore, putting A at position 2? Will get dash? Redundant? 

Similarly, why? If we put E at position 1? Then we can place A at position 4 or 5? But ""EARTH"" puts A at position 2? Which is bad? So ""EARTH"" is not good? 

""ETRAP"": Not common? ""REACT"": has C? Eliminated? C not allowed? 

""LATER"": but L? Then position 1:L? Then A at position 2? But A cannot at position 2? So no? 

""ALERT"": 
- Position 1: A? Allowed? A at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because not position 2 or 3? 
- Position 2: L? 
- Position 3: E? Allowed? E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: R? Allowed? R can be at position 4? 
- Position 5: T? T can be at position 5? 

Check constraints:
- A: position 1 => allowed? Yes? Because constraints: A allowed at 1,4,5? Position 1 is good? 
- E: position 3 => allowed? Yes? E can be at position 3? 
- R: position 4 => allowed? Yes? R can be at position 4? 
- T: position 5 => allowed? Yes? T can be at position 5? 
- L: fifth letter? Which we don't know? But haven't guessed? So valid? 

But what about feedback? Will we get useful? The word ""ALERT"" satisfies constraints? And is a valid word? 

Another option: ""OATER""? Obscure? ""WATER"": has W? Then positions: 
W at position 1? 
A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? So not allowed? 

""TRIED"": has D? Then T at position 1? T cannot at position 1? So avoid? 

""TRIAL"": T at position 1? Not allowed? 

""TREAD"": T at position 1? Not allowed? 

""STARE"": but S eliminated? 

""CRATE"": C eliminated? 

So after looking? ""ALERT"" seems suitable? 

Alternatively? ""LATRE"": not word? ""AISLE"": missing R? 

""TABLE"": missing R and E? 

Therefore? We choose ""ALERT"" as the next guess? Because it satisfies the position constraints? And uses L as the fifth letter? We hope to get feedback on L? And refine? 

But note: E is at position 3? And A at position 1? R at position 4? T at position 5? All within allowed positions? 

We also haven't guessed L? So if L is absent? Or present? We'll know? 

But L might be present? Or we must see? At this point, I guess ""ALERT"". 

After analyzing, ""ALERT"" is:

- Position 1: A -> we know A cannot be at 2 or 3? So we put at 1? Which is allowed? Might be correct? Or not? 
- Position 2: L -> new letter? 
- Position 3: E -> we know E cannot be at 4 or 5? So position 3? Might be correct? 
- Position 4: R -> R cannot be at 2 or 3? Position 4? Might be correct? 
- Position 5: T -> we know T cannot be at 1? So position 5? Might be correct? 

So all placements are in newly tested positions? So potentially? We might get some correct? Or get clues?

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So the secret word does not contain C or N.
It must contain R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in the guess.

Recall that the positions for ""crane"" are:
1. C (absent)
2. R (present but not in position 2)
3. A (present but not in position 3)
4. N (absent)
5. E (present but not in position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Letters R, A, E present (each at least once).
- Letters C and N absent.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Avoid using C and N.
2. Include R, A, E but in different positions than in ""crane"".
3. Try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

Let me think about the positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4? Wait, positions are 1 to 5. Since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for A (was position 3, so not there) and E (was position 5, so not there).

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So I should assume no duplicates for now unless forced.

Since we know A, R, E are in the word, and we must not use C and N, the next guess should include R, A, E and two new letters to test.

Positions:
We know R is not in position 2.
We know A is not in position 3.
We know E is not in position 5.

For our next guess, we should avoid placing R in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.

We should try to place R, A, E in positions that are possible for the secret word. But we don't know which positions are correct yet.

Idea: choose a word that has R, A, E in different positions, plus two new letters.

Common letters: let's try S and T? Because S and T are very common.

Possible words: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? But E cannot be at the end because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E might not be at position 5? However, the secret word has E but not at position 5? It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, A not at 3.

Let me try to form a word.

Consider the word ""STARE"":
- S at first, T at second, A at third, R at fourth, E at fifth.

But we know A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can put A at position 3 because it might be correct in a different word? But no, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, meaning that position 3 is definitely wrong for A. So if we put A again at position 3, it will still be marked - (wrong position) if that's the case. But it isn't the correct position? So to test a new position we should put A elsewhere.

Similarly, we want to move R from position 2? But we won't put it at position 2 again since we know it's wrong.

For ""STARE"", let's see the positions:
Position 1: S (new)
Position 2: T (new)
Position 3: A (we know A cannot be at position 3, so avoid? But perhaps we can use it to confirm, but that would waste a position. So better to put A in a new position? So avoid position 3.

Similarly, R in position 4 (new position) and E in position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So E should be avoided at position 5.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not ideal because it places A at position 3 (which is forbidden) and E at position 5 (forbidden).

So we need a word with:
- R: not at position 2
- A: not at position 3
- E: not at position 5

And we want to include R, A, E in our next guess to confirm their presence and possibly find their positions.

Let me think of words that do not have A at position 3 and E at position 5 and that don't use C or N.

Possible words: 
- How about ""LATER""? 
  L at first, A at second, T at third, E at fourth, R at fifth.

But let's check:
- Position 2: A (was previously at position 3 and wrong, so maybe A at position 2 is possible? Since secret word has A somewhere else)
- Position 4: E (not position 5, so that's good)
- Position 5: R (was previously at position 2 and wrong, so not there? Wait, but R could be at position 5? We don't know, so it's okay.

In ""LATER"":
- Positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

We are placing:
- A at position 2, which was not tested before? Because in ""crane"" A was at position 3 and wrong, so position 2 is a new position and might be correct.
- Similarly, E at position 4 (new position, since E was at position 5 and not there? It could be at position 4? Not necessarily, but it's a possibility.
- R at position 5 (previously at position 2 and wrong, so now position 5 is a possibility).

Also, we are introducing two new letters: L and T.

Alternatively, another option: ""RAISE"". But R at position 1? That's possible? And A at 2? Position 1: R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.

But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong? Because E was in position 5 and marked wrong? Not necessarily, in the secret word E might be in position 5? But the feedback for E was - meaning it is in the word but not at position 5? Because if it were at position 5, it would be marked ✓.

So the symbol - for E means: E is in the word, but not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has E but not at position 5.

So putting E at position 5 in a new guess will yield - again, meaning wrong position. But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? That would be unwise. We should avoid position 5 for E because we know it definitely isn't there? Exactly, since it was in position 5 and marked wrong? So position 5 is known not to be E.

So we should not put E at position 5 in our guess. Similarly, A at position 3 and R at position 2 is not to be done? Because they were marked as not being there? But we can put R at position 2 if we want, but it would just repeat that it's wrong? So better to avoid to not waste spots.

Therefore, for next guess, avoid positions that we know are wrong:
- For R: avoid position 2? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, so putting it at position 2 again will get a - again, which we already know. So better to put R in a new position? So we can test a position that might be correct.

Similarly, avoid position 3 for A? Position 5 for E? Because they are confirmed wrong.

And for positions that were not tested? We don't know, but positions: position 2 was for R and it's wrong? Actually, the letter that was there (R) was not at the correct spot, but the position itself isn't necessarily bad? We just know R isn't there.

I think ""RAISE"" is problematic because E is at position 5, which we know E is not at 5.

So ""RAISE"" is bad.

Another word: ""ALERT""
- A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

Check:
- Position 1: A (previously A was at position 3 and wrong; placing at position 1 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E (but we don't know yet if E can be at position 3? In fact, E was only at position 5, so position 3 is unknown? So okay.)
- Position 4: R (was at position 2 and wrong, now at position 4)
- Position 5: T (new)

And E is not at position 5? So that's good.

We avoid C and N? Yes.

Also, we are testing A and E in new positions, and R in a new position.

Could also try ""ROAST"" but R at position 1? And O? But O is a vowel? And we have A? But ""ROAST"" has O and A and S and R? But R at position 1. And E is missing? But we must include E because we know E is in the word? We have to include R, A, E? Not necessarily? But including them might help place them?

We know that R, A, E are in the word? So if I don't include one, I might miss it? But the goal is to confirm their positions? Actually, we need to find the word? So I should include them to get positional info.

So including R, A, E in the guess? But I have limited positions? Two more letters? Yes.

Another possibility: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E.
Positions: 1:I? Not common, 2:R? But R is known not at position 2? In ""crane"" R was at position 2 and wrong? Why put at position 2 again? Then R at position 2 will still be marked wrong? Unless the word has duplicate R? But unlikely? But possible? So to save moves, avoid known wrong positions if possible.

So ""IRATE"": R at position 2 -> which we know is incorrect? Because R was at position 2 and marked wrong? So we know that R is not at position 2 regardless of duplicates? Because if there were another R? But if there is an R at position 2 and another R somewhere else? But the feedback marks one? It's tricky.

Standard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word once and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get a dash. If you guess it twice? It depends? Each feedback is per letter per occurrence? But often guessed letters are compared? We don't have duplicate? In ""crane"" all distinct.

Secret word might have duplicate? But not necessarily? Without feedback, we should avoid? But let's stick to distinct letters? Because duplicates are rarer? I think it's better to assume no duplicates unless forced? Given the information.

Therefore, to use R not in position 2? And similarly avoid A in position 3 and E in position 5.

So ""LATER"": 
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: A (not attempted before? Because in ""crane"", A was at position 3? So A at position 2 is new)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (E was at position 5? So position 4 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)
- Position 5: R (R was at position 2? So position 5 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.)

Also, we are introducing L and T.

Other possibilities? ""STEAR""? Is that a word? Stear is not common? Usually spelled differently? Better use common words.

""RATEL"" is a word? Maybe not well-known? ""TARES""? ""TARES"" works? T, A, R, E, S.

""TARES"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R (but we know R was at position 2 and wrong? Now at position 3? Why not?)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Again, we have A at position 2? E at position 4? R at position 3? And avoid C and N.

Also, we are introducing T and S? Which are common? So ""TARES"" might be a good choice? It has R, A, E? Yes.

But R at position 3? Previously R was at position 2 and wrong? Placing R at position 3? Could be? Similarly, E at position 4? Etc.

Another common word: ""ADIEU"" but missing R? And has D and U? But we must include R? Because we know R is present? We don't have to? But if I don't, I miss an opportunity to pin down R? Also E? But E is included? But R is missing.

If I guess without R, I might not get info on R? So better to include R, A, E.

I think ""TARES"" is a good word? ""STARE"" was bad because E at 5? But ""TARES"" has E at position 4? So better.

""TARES"": 
Yes, that is a valid word.

""LATER"" is also valid? But ""LATER"" has E at position 4? R at 5? So both? I think ""TARES"" has the advantage? Because S and T are very common? So we might uncover more letters? But L in ""LATER"" might not be as common? So ""TARES"" might be better? Because if S or T are in the word? We can find out.

But in secret word, we know C and N are absent? So S or T might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Therefore, I choose ""TARES"" as the next guess? So we can test T and S.

But wait, ""TARES"": 
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: A (new position for A, was at position 3? Now at 2)
Position 3: R (new position for R, was at position 2? Now at 3)
Position 4: E (new position for E, was at position 5? Now at 4)
Position 5: S (new)

We hope to get feedback on each.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is bad? Because E at 5? Yes.

""PARSE"" but we don't know P? And missing A? Wait, P,A,R,S,E? Position: P, A, R, S, E? Then E at 5? Bad? Same issue.

So after considering, ""TARES"" seems solid? Or ""LATER""?

Perhaps ""STALE"" but has L? And E at end? And missing R? Because S,T,A,L,E? Then no R? But we know R is present? So if I guess ""STALE"", I might get feedback that R is missing? But I already know it? But I won't get positional? So not advisable? Because I need to find the R position.

Therefore, words with R,A,E are essential? And ""TARES"" includes all three? So let's use ""TARES""?

But let's confirm: is ""TARES"" a word? Yes, meaning like hay or grass? It is accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""ALERT"": has R,A,E? Positions: A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? Then T at 5.

In ""ALERT"", we placed A at position 1? Previously A was at position 3 and wrong? So position 1 is new? Similarly E at position 3? Previously E was at position 5? So position 3 is new? And R at position 4? Position 4 is new? As opposed to position 4 for E in ""TARES"".

But ""TARES"" places E at position 4? Which is good? Because it avoids position 5? And in ""ALERT"", E at position 3? Similarly valid? I think both are fine.

But I'll go with ""TARES"" because it uses common letters? And T and S? So potentially more information? Because S is very common? If S is in the word? We'll know? If not, eliminated.

So I guess ""tares""? Spelling: T A R E S.

So the next guess: tares

But in response format: <guess>tares</guess>

We'll see feedback?After analyzing the first guess ""crane"", the feedback indicates:
- Letters R, A, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.
- Letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word that includes R, A, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C and N.
- Place R, A, and E in new positions to test for correctness:
  - R should not be in position 2.
  - A should not be in position 3.
  - E should not be in position 5.
- Include two new common letters to gather more information.

After brainstorming words, ""tares"" fits well:
- Letters: T, A, R, E, S.
- Positions:
  - A is in position 2 (avoiding position 3).
  - R is in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
  - E is in position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters T and S, which are common and could provide useful feedback.

Reasoning for ""tares"":
- Avoids wasteful positions: Placement of A at position 2, R at position 3, and E at position 4 are all untested but possible locations.
- Efficient probing: Tests T and S instead of less common letters.
- Word validity: ""Tares"" (meaning weeds or hay) is a valid word.

This guess maximizes feedback potential without reusing forbidden positions.

<guess>tares</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   Interpretation:
      - C and N are not in the word.
      - R, A, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed: 
          R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: tares -> Feedback: T(-), A(-), R(-), E(-), S(x)
   Interpretation:
      - S is not in the word (S is confirmed absent).
      - T, A, R, E are in the word, but in wrong positions as per the positions guessed:
        For ""tares"":
          Position 1: T(-) -> T is in the word, but not at position 1.
          Position 2: A(-) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (this is new: we already knew A not at position 3 from guess 1; now also not at position 2).
          Position 3: R(-) -> R is in the word, but not at position 3 (we already knew R not at position 2 from guess 1; now also not at position 3).
          Position 4: E(-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4 (we already knew E not at position 5; now also not at position 4).

From both guesses, we know:
- Absent letters: C, N, S.
- Present letters: R, A, E (from guess 1) and T (from guess 2) are confirmed in the word. Also, we have R, A, E, T present (and from the feedback of both guesses, we see that the word must contain these four).
- Since the word is 5 letters long, and we have four confirmed letters (R, A, E, T), the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been eliminated.

Now, let's list the possible positions that are invalid for each letter so far:

For A:
- From ""crane"" (position 3): not at position 3.
- From ""tares"" (position 2): not at position 2.
So A cannot be at positions 2 or 3.

For R:
- From ""crane"" (position 2): not at position 2.
- From ""tares"" (position 3): not at position 3.
So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3.

For E:
- From ""crane"" (position 5): not at position 5.
- From ""tares"" (position 4): not at position 4.
So E cannot be at positions 4 or 5.

For T:
- From ""tares"" (position 1): not at position 1.

We also note that all four of these letters must be placed in the remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but we have only five positions and four letters? However, we know the word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily; duplicates are possible, but we haven't encountered any evidence yet.

Wait, we have five positions and four confirmed letters? Then one of these letters must appear twice? Or there is a fifth letter? Actually, we must find a fifth letter that is not among the eliminated ones (C, N, S) and not R, A, E, T? Because R, A, E, T are known to be present? But they might be more than one? However, we don't have any duplicate feedback yet? So likely each is one occurrence? But not necessarily.

But the feedback for ""tares"" didn't have any ""x"" except S? And T, A, R, E got dashes? Meaning each one is present, and each one is in the word? So if each is present and the word has five letters, then the word must contain exactly these four? Then one of them must be duplicated? Or there is a fifth letter? But we don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify if there are duplicates? Because if a letter is duplicated and we guess one, it might not account for extra? Alternatively, if we have five distinct letters: R, A, E, T, and one unknown? But we had ""crane"" and ""tares"", which included letters? So let's reason:

We have eliminated: C, N, S.

We have confirmed: R, A, E, T.

Thus, the fifth letter must not be C, N, S? And must be any letter not yet eliminated? But we don't know? So it must be present? And we haven't guessed it? So the fifth letter is missing from our guesses so far? Therefore, we need to include R, A, E, T and a fifth new letter that hasn't been guessed? And hasn't been eliminated? So we must try a fifth letter.

But note: we only have four positions effectively? Because we have five positions? We have to place five letters? But with four letters confirmed? So one duplicate? Without feedback about duplicates, it is likely that the word has only four distinct letters? But we don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? So perhaps we should consider that one letter is duplicated? Or we have a fifth unknown letter.

Since from guess 1 we had R, A, E? And guess 2 added T? And S was eliminated? Then the word has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But what about E? How? So the secret word has five letters: consisting of R, A, E, T and one more.

But we don't know what that one more is? So we need to guess a word that has R, A, E, T? And a fifth letter? Which hasn't been eliminated? So not C, N, S.

Now, possible positions? We need to assign R, A, E, T and fifth letter to positions 1-5? Avoiding the forbidden placements:

For A: avoid positions 2 and 3? So possible: position 1, 4, or 5? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5; so available: 1,4,5.

For R: avoid positions 2 and 3? So available: 1, 4, 5? Same? But position overlap? We cannot put two letters at the same position? So we have four letters? Or five? We need to assign each to a position? But also, one position must be the fifth letter? Or we have duplicate? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be another letter? But we don't have an alternative? So?

First, list possible positions available:

Available positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:

A: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.
R: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.
E: cannot be at 4 or 5 -> allowed positions: 1,2,3? Because 4 and 5 are forbidden? So E can be at 1, 2, or 3? Not? Because E is forbidden at 4 and 5? So E can be at 1,2,3.
T: cannot be at 1 -> allowed positions: 2,3,4,5.

Now, fifth letter: we don't know? It must be placed? And it hasn't been guessed? So we need to introduce? How? We must guess a word that exactly has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But we have five letters? So we have four letters but we need five? Therefore:

Let me think: we have no duplication? Because if there were duplication, the feedback might show something? For example, if R appeared twice? Then when we guessed one R correctly placed? We might not know? But so far, we have guessed each of R, A, E, T, one? And they were present? So if the word contains two Rs? Then when we guessed R at one position, it might not be the only one? But without feedback? We don't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't distinguish: if a letter is duplicated, and we guessed one instance in wrong position and another? But we have placed R only once? So we don't know? Therefore, we must consider the possibility of a fifth letter? So the word has five distinct letters? Probably? But duplicates are possible? So we should not assume? But since we have eliminated only S, and not T? Etc.

But from the absence of any duplicate feedback? By parsimony? We assume distinct letters? Until proven otherwise? So I'll proceed with distinct? Because it's simpler? And we have R,A,E,T? And a fifth letter? Which must not be C, N, S? And not any other? So among the other letters? How to choose? We must pick a new letter? So let's introduce a letter like O, U, I, L, D? Etc? Common vowels/consonants? We also need to assign positions for T, A, R, E? With constraints? And the fifth letter? In a position.

But we have three positions for E: 1? Or 2? Or 3? Etc? And similarly for others? So we must form a word with letters: R, A, E, T, and X? Where X is a new letter not C, N, S.

For example, let X be L? Then word ""LATER""? But L is new? And positions: 
- L at position 1?
- A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? Because from guess 2 (tares), A was at position 2 and wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore ""LATER"" places A at position 2? Which is forbidden? So not possible? Similarly, ""ALTER"" but then A at position 1? Etc? Let me see.

Avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3? And E cannot be at 4 or 5? Etc.

Also, we haven't guessed any word with E in positions 1,2,3? So we need to put E at one of 1,2,3.

Now, possible words? With R, A, E, T and a fifth letter.

Fifth letter possibilities: let's pick common letters? But not eliminated: so not C, N, S? Common letters: L, O, U, I, D, G, H? Etc.

Let me compile possible words? Also, the word must be valid? And meet position constraints.

For example, ""IRATE"": but I? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning angry? 
Positions:
- Position 1: I (new letter)
- Position 2: R -> R cannot be at position 2 (known from guess 1)? Because R was at position 2 in crane and wrong? So not position 2? Therefore putting R at position 2? Will get dash? Which is redundant? So avoid? Because we already know R cannot be at position 2? So why put it there? Then using ""IRATE"": is waste? Because R at position 2? Also, placing T? Where? Position 5? Which is possible? Since T can be at 5? But E is at position 5? Contradiction? ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? Positions:
1: I
2: R -> avoid: position 2 for R
3: A -> position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? Also known? Because from crane? So positions 2 and 3 are forbidden? For R? And A? So both issues.

Therefore ""IRATE"" is bad? Because R and A in forbidden positions.

Another word: ""TREAT"": duplicate T? Could be? But we don't know? Or ""TRAIL"": has R,A,I? And L? But missing E? But we know E is present? So must include E? Therefore words without E are invalid? Because E must be in the word? Similarly, T? R? A?

So we must have E? Therefore, ""TREAT"": T, R, E, A, T? Duplicate T? So positions: 
1:T -> T cannot be at position 1? Known? Then 
2:R -> R cannot at position 2? Known? 
3:E -> E can be at position 3? Because forbidden? Only 4 and 5? So position 3 allowed? Yes? 
4:A -> A can be at position 4? Because forbid 2 and 3? So position 4 allowed? 
5:T -> T cannot be at position 5? Why? We don't know? Because T forbidden at position 1? But position 5 might be allowed? 

But in ""TREAT"", T is repeated? So feedback might be interesting? But we have to see? But the word has only four distinct letters? Then which T gets the feedback? It might be messy? Alternatively, avoid? Because simpler to avoid duplicates? 

But let's consider: since E can be at position 3? And A at position 4? So possible? But T and R are in forbidden positions? Positions 1 and 2? So the guess will be? But we already know that T1 is wrong and R2 is wrong? So we waste positions? So better choose a word that doesn't put any letter in a position we know forbidden? Unless forced? 

Therefore, we need to put R, A, E, T, and a fifth letter in positions that are allowed? And avoid positions that are forbidden for each? 

So:

Available positions:

A: positions 1,4,5.
R: positions 1,4,5.
E: positions 1,2,3.
T: positions 2,3,4,5.

Now, positions? How to assign?

Position 1: can be A, R, or E? Or the fifth letter? Similarly.

But conflict? Because positions 1,4,5 are available for R and A? But E can only be at 1,2,3? T can be at 2,3,4,5.

We need to form a valid English word? So let's find? 

Put E at position 1? Then R or A cannot be at position 1? Then at position 1: E? Position 1 for E? Valid? Like ""EARTH""? Earth has E, A, R, T? And H? Fifth letter H? So positions: E at 1? Then available? But E at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because E can be at position 1? 
Then A? Must be at 4 or 5? Etc? 

""EARTH"": 
- Position 1: E -> allowed? Yes? 
- Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Because from tares? A was at position 2? Marked wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore, putting A at position 2? Will get dash? Redundant? 

Similarly, why? If we put E at position 1? Then we can place A at position 4 or 5? But ""EARTH"" puts A at position 2? Which is bad? So ""EARTH"" is not good? 

""ETRAP"": Not common? ""REACT"": has C? Eliminated? C not allowed? 

""LATER"": but L? Then position 1:L? Then A at position 2? But A cannot at position 2? So no? 

""ALERT"": 
- Position 1: A? Allowed? A at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because not position 2 or 3? 
- Position 2: L? 
- Position 3: E? Allowed? E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: R? Allowed? R can be at position 4? 
- Position 5: T? T can be at position 5? 

Check constraints:
- A: position 1 => allowed? Yes? Because constraints: A allowed at 1,4,5? Position 1 is good? 
- E: position 3 => allowed? Yes? E can be at position 3? 
- R: position 4 => allowed? Yes? R can be at position 4? 
- T: position 5 => allowed? Yes? T can be at position 5? 
- L: fifth letter? Which we don't know? But haven't guessed? So valid? 

But what about feedback? Will we get useful? The word ""ALERT"" satisfies constraints? And is a valid word? 

Another option: ""OATER""? Obscure? ""WATER"": has W? Then positions: 
W at position 1? 
A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? So not allowed? 

""TRIED"": has D? Then T at position 1? T cannot at position 1? So avoid? 

""TRIAL"": T at position 1? Not allowed? 

""TREAD"": T at position 1? Not allowed? 

""STARE"": but S eliminated? 

""CRATE"": C eliminated? 

So after looking? ""ALERT"" seems suitable? 

Alternatively? ""LATRE"": not word? ""AISLE"": missing R? 

""TABLE"": missing R and E? 

Therefore? We choose ""ALERT"" as the next guess? Because it satisfies the position constraints? And uses L as the fifth letter? We hope to get feedback on L? And refine? 

But note: E is at position 3? And A at position 1? R at position 4? T at position 5? All within allowed positions? 

We also haven't guessed L? So if L is absent? Or present? We'll know? 

But L might be present? Or we must see? At this point, I guess ""ALERT"". 

After analyzing, ""ALERT"" is:

- Position 1: A -> we know A cannot be at 2 or 3? So we put at 1? Which is allowed? Might be correct? Or not? 
- Position 2: L -> new letter? 
- Position 3: E -> we know E cannot be at 4 or 5? So position 3? Might be correct? 
- Position 4: R -> R cannot be at 2 or 3? Position 4? Might be correct? 
- Position 5: T -> we know T cannot be at 1? So position 5? Might be correct? 

So all placements are in newly tested positions? So potentially? We might get some correct? Or get clues? 

Therefore, next guess: alert### Step-by-step Reasoning:

Following the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  
   - C and N are **absent**.  
   - R, A, E are **present** but not in positions 2, 3, or 5, respectively.

2. **Guess 2: tares → Feedback: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)**  
   - S is **absent**.  
   - T, A, R, E are **present** but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed present letters**: R, A, E, T.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, N, S.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from *tares*) or 3 (from *crane*).  
  - **R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from *crane*) or 3 (from *tares*).  
  - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from *tares*) or 5 (from *crane*).  
  - **T**: Cannot be in position 1 (from *tares*).  
- Since R, A, E, T are all confirmed present, the secret word must include *exactly these four letters* plus **one unknown letter** (not C, N, or S).  
- The unknown fifth letter must be inferred by testing **common letters** not yet eliminated (e.g., L, O, I, D, G, H).  

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Prioritize:  
  - **Place A, R, E, T only in allowed positions**:  
    - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.  
    - R: Positions 1, 4, or 5.  
    - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.  
    - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - Include a **new common vowel/consonant** that hasn't been tested (e.g., L).  
- **""ALERT""** (meaning *vigilant*) fits all constraints:  
  - Positions:  
    - A at position 1 (allowed per constraints).  
    - L at position 2 (new letter; not eliminated).  
    - E at position 3 (allowed per constraints).  
    - R at position 4 (allowed per constraints).  
    - T at position 5 (allowed per constraints).  
  - Avoids forbidden positions for all confirmed letters.  
- If L is present, we get positional feedback; if absent, it is eliminated for future guesses.

This guess efficiently tests constraints and introduces ""L"" as a potential fifth letter while respecting all feedback.

C (absent)\n2. R (present but not in position 2)\n3. A (present but not in position 3)\n4. N (absent)\n5. E (present but not in position 5)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Letters R, A, E present (each at least once).\n- Letters C and N absent.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters.\n\nFor the next guess, we should:\n1. Avoid using C and N.\n2. Include R, A, E but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n3. Try to use other common letters to uncover more information.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4? Wait, positions are 1 to 5. Since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for A (was position 3, so not there) and E (was position 5, so not there).\n\nBut note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So I should assume no duplicates for now unless forced.\n\nSince we know A, R, E are in the word, and we must not use C and N, the next guess should include R, A, E and two new letters to test.\n\nPositions:\nWe know R is not in position 2.\nWe know A is not in position 3.\nWe know E is not in position 5.\n\nFor our next guess, we should avoid placing R in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.\n\nWe should try to place R, A, E in positions that are possible for the secret word. But we don\'t know which positions are correct yet.\n\nIdea: choose a word that has R, A, E in different positions, plus two new letters.\n\nCommon letters: let\'s try S and T? Because S and T are very common.\n\nPossible words: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? But E cannot be at the end because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E might not be at position 5? However, the secret word has E but not at position 5? It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, R is not at position 2, A not at 3.\n\nLet me try to form a word.\n\nConsider the word ""STARE"":\n- S at first, T at second, A at third, R at fourth, E at fifth.\n\nBut we know A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong position. So we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can put A at position 3 because it might be correct in a different word? But no, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, meaning that position 3 is definitely wrong for A. So if we put A again at position 3, it will still be marked - (wrong position) if that\'s the case. But it isn\'t the correct position? So to test a new position we should put A elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, we want to move R from position 2? But we won\'t put it at position 2 again since we know it\'s wrong.\n\nFor ""STARE"", let\'s see the positions:\nPosition 1: S (new)\nPosition 2: T (new)\nPosition 3: A (we know A cannot be at position 3, so avoid? But perhaps we can use it to confirm, but that would waste a position. So better to put A in a new position? So avoid position 3.\n\nSimilarly, R in position 4 (new position) and E in position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So E should be avoided at position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""STARE"" is not ideal because it places A at position 3 (which is forbidden) and E at position 5 (forbidden).\n\nSo we need a word with:\n- R: not at position 2\n- A: not at position 3\n- E: not at position 5\n\nAnd we want to include R, A, E in our next guess to confirm their presence and possibly find their positions.\n\nLet me think of words that do not have A at position 3 and E at position 5 and that don\'t use C or N.\n\nPossible words: \n- How about ""LATER""? \n  L at first, A at second, T at third, E at fourth, R at fifth.\n\nBut let\'s check:\n- Position 2: A (was previously at position 3 and wrong, so maybe A at position 2 is possible? Since secret word has A somewhere else)\n- Position 4: E (not position 5, so that\'s good)\n- Position 5: R (was previously at position 2 and wrong, so not there? Wait, but R could be at position 5? We don\'t know, so it\'s okay.\n\nIn ""LATER"":\n- Positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R\n\nWe are placing:\n- A at position 2, which was not tested before? Because in ""crane"" A was at position 3 and wrong, so position 2 is a new position and might be correct.\n- Similarly, E at position 4 (new position, since E was at position 5 and not there? It could be at position 4? Not necessarily, but it\'s a possibility.\n- R at position 5 (previously at position 2 and wrong, so now position 5 is a possibility).\n\nAlso, we are introducing two new letters: L and T.\n\nAlternatively, another option: ""RAISE"". But R at position 1? That\'s possible? And A at 2? Position 1: R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.\n\nBut E is at position 5, which we know is wrong? Because E was in position 5 and marked wrong? Not necessarily, in the secret word E might be in position 5? But the feedback for E was - meaning it is in the word but not at position 5? Because if it were at position 5, it would be marked ✓.\n\nSo the symbol - for E means: E is in the word, but not in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has E but not at position 5.\n\nSo putting E at position 5 in a new guess will yield - again, meaning wrong position. But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? That would be unwise. We should avoid position 5 for E because we know it definitely isn\'t there? Exactly, since it was in position 5 and marked wrong? So position 5 is known not to be E.\n\nSo we should not put E at position 5 in our guess. Similarly, A at position 3 and R at position 2 is not to be done? Because they were marked as not being there? But we can put R at position 2 if we want, but it would just repeat that it\'s wrong? So better to avoid to not waste spots.\n\nTherefore, for next guess, avoid positions that we know are wrong:\n- For R: avoid position 2? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, so putting it at position 2 again will get a - again, which we already know. So better to put R in a new position? So we can test a position that might be correct.\n\nSimilarly, avoid position 3 for A? Position 5 for E? Because they are confirmed wrong.\n\nAnd for positions that were not tested? We don\'t know, but positions: position 2 was for R and it\'s wrong? Actually, the letter that was there (R) was not at the correct spot, but the position itself isn\'t necessarily bad? We just know R isn\'t there.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" is problematic because E is at position 5, which we know E is not at 5.\n\nSo ""RAISE"" is bad.\n\nAnother word: ""ALERT""\n- A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\nCheck:\n- Position 1: A (previously A was at position 3 and wrong; placing at position 1 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know.)\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: E (but we don\'t know yet if E can be at position 3? In fact, E was only at position 5, so position 3 is unknown? So okay.)\n- Position 4: R (was at position 2 and wrong, now at position 4)\n- Position 5: T (new)\n\nAnd E is not at position 5? So that\'s good.\n\nWe avoid C and N? Yes.\n\nAlso, we are testing A and E in new positions, and R in a new position.\n\nCould also try ""ROAST"" but R at position 1? And O? But O is a vowel? And we have A? But ""ROAST"" has O and A and S and R? But R at position 1. And E is missing? But we must include E because we know E is in the word? We have to include R, A, E? Not necessarily? But including them might help place them?\n\nWe know that R, A, E are in the word? So if I don\'t include one, I might miss it? But the goal is to confirm their positions? Actually, we need to find the word? So I should include them to get positional info.\n\nSo including R, A, E in the guess? But I have limited positions? Two more letters? Yes.\n\nAnother possibility: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E.\nPositions: 1:I? Not common, 2:R? But R is known not at position 2? In ""crane"" R was at position 2 and wrong? Why put at position 2 again? Then R at position 2 will still be marked wrong? Unless the word has duplicate R? But unlikely? But possible? So to save moves, avoid known wrong positions if possible.\n\nSo ""IRATE"": R at position 2 -> which we know is incorrect? Because R was at position 2 and marked wrong? So we know that R is not at position 2 regardless of duplicates? Because if there were another R? But if there is an R at position 2 and another R somewhere else? But the feedback marks one? It\'s tricky.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word once and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get a dash. If you guess it twice? It depends? Each feedback is per letter per occurrence? But often guessed letters are compared? We don\'t have duplicate? In ""crane"" all distinct.\n\nSecret word might have duplicate? But not necessarily? Without feedback, we should avoid? But let\'s stick to distinct letters? Because duplicates are rarer? I think it\'s better to assume no duplicates unless forced? Given the information.\n\nTherefore, to use R not in position 2? And similarly avoid A in position 3 and E in position 5.\n\nSo ""LATER"": \n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: A (not attempted before? Because in ""crane"", A was at position 3? So A at position 2 is new)\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: E (E was at position 5? So position 4 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know.)\n- Position 5: R (R was at position 2? So position 5 is new? So might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know.)\n\nAlso, we are introducing L and T.\n\nOther possibilities? ""STEAR""? Is that a word? Stear is not common? Usually spelled differently? Better use common words.\n\n""RATEL"" is a word? Maybe not well-known? ""TARES""? ""TARES"" works? T, A, R, E, S.\n\n""TARES"": \n- Position 1: T\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: R (but we know R was at position 2 and wrong? Now at position 3? Why not?)\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: S\n\nAgain, we have A at position 2? E at position 4? R at position 3? And avoid C and N.\n\nAlso, we are introducing T and S? Which are common? So ""TARES"" might be a good choice? It has R, A, E? Yes.\n\nBut R at position 3? Previously R was at position 2 and wrong? Placing R at position 3? Could be? Similarly, E at position 4? Etc.\n\nAnother common word: ""ADIEU"" but missing R? And has D and U? But we must include R? Because we know R is present? We don\'t have to? But if I don\'t, I miss an opportunity to pin down R? Also E? But E is included? But R is missing.\n\nIf I guess without R, I might not get info on R? So better to include R, A, E.\n\nI think ""TARES"" is a good word? ""STARE"" was bad because E at 5? But ""TARES"" has E at position 4? So better.\n\n""TARES"": \nYes, that is a valid word.\n\n""LATER"" is also valid? But ""LATER"" has E at position 4? R at 5? So both? I think ""TARES"" has the advantage? Because S and T are very common? So we might uncover more letters? But L in ""LATER"" might not be as common? So ""TARES"" might be better? Because if S or T are in the word? We can find out.\n\nBut in secret word, we know C and N are absent? So S or T might be present? Or absent? We don\'t know.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""TARES"" as the next guess? So we can test T and S.\n\nBut wait, ""TARES"": \nPosition 1: T (new)\nPosition 2: A (new position for A, was at position 3? Now at 2)\nPosition 3: R (new position for R, was at position 2? Now at 3)\nPosition 4: E (new position for E, was at position 5? Now at 4)\nPosition 5: S (new)\n\nWe hope to get feedback on each.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" is bad? Because E at 5? Yes.\n\n""PARSE"" but we don\'t know P? And missing A? Wait, P,A,R,S,E? Position: P, A, R, S, E? Then E at 5? Bad? Same issue.\n\nSo after considering, ""TARES"" seems solid? Or ""LATER""?\n\nPerhaps ""STALE"" but has L? And E at end? And missing R? Because S,T,A,L,E? Then no R? But we know R is present? So if I guess ""STALE"", I might get feedback that R is missing? But I already know it? But I won\'t get positional? So not advisable? Because I need to find the R position.\n\nTherefore, words with R,A,E are essential? And ""TARES"" includes all three? So let\'s use ""TARES""?\n\nBut let\'s confirm: is ""TARES"" a word? Yes, meaning like hay or grass? It is accepted as a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALERT"": has R,A,E? Positions: A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? Then T at 5.\n\nIn ""ALERT"", we placed A at position 1? Previously A was at position 3 and wrong? So position 1 is new? Similarly E at position 3? Previously E was at position 5? So position 3 is new? And R at position 4? Position 4 is new? As opposed to position 4 for E in ""TARES"".\n\nBut ""TARES"" places E at position 4? Which is good? Because it avoids position 5? And in ""ALERT"", E at position 3? Similarly valid? I think both are fine.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""TARES"" because it uses common letters? And T and S? So potentially more information? Because S is very common? If S is in the word? We\'ll know? If not, eliminated.\n\nSo I guess ""tares""? Spelling: T A R E S.\n\nSo the next guess: tares\n\nBut in response format: <guess>tares</guess>\n\nWe\'ll see feedback?After analyzing the first guess ""crane"", the feedback indicates:\n- Letters R, A, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.\n- Letters C and N are not in the secret word.\n- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I need:\n- A valid 5-letter English word that includes R, A, and E (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoid C and N.\n- Place R, A, and E in new positions to test for correctness:\n  - R should not be in position 2.\n  - A should not be in position 3.\n  - E should not be in position 5.\n- Include two new common letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter brainstorming words, ""tares"" fits well:\n- Letters: T, A, R, E, S.\n- Positions:\n  - A is in position 2 (avoiding position 3).\n  - R is in position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n  - E is in position 4 (avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces new letters T and S, which are common and could provide useful feedback.\n\nReasoning for ""tares"":\n- Avoids wasteful positions: Placement of A at position 2, R at position 3, and E at position 4 are all untested but possible locations.\n- Efficient probing: Tests T and S instead of less common letters.\n- Word validity: ""Tares"" (meaning weeds or hay) is a valid word.\n\nThis guess maximizes feedback potential without reusing forbidden positions.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

Also, we have R, A, E, T present (and from the feedback of both guesses, we see that the word must contain these four).\n- Since the word is 5 letters long, and we have four confirmed letters (R, A, E, T), the fifth letter must be one that hasn\'t been eliminated.\n\nNow, let\'s list the possible positions that are invalid for each letter so far:\n\nFor A:\n- From ""crane"" (position 3): not at position 3.\n- From ""tares"" (position 2): not at position 2.\nSo A cannot be at positions 2 or 3.\n\nFor R:\n- From ""crane"" (position 2): not at position 2.\n- From ""tares"" (position 3): not at position 3.\nSo R cannot be at positions 2 or 3.\n\nFor E:\n- From ""crane"" (position 5): not at position 5.\n- From ""tares"" (position 4): not at position 4.\nSo E cannot be at positions 4 or 5.\n\nFor T:\n- From ""tares"" (position 1): not at position 1.\n\nWe also note that all four of these letters must be placed in the remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but we have only five positions and four letters? However, we know the word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily; duplicates are possible, but we haven\'t encountered any evidence yet.\n\nWait, we have five positions and four confirmed letters? Then one of these letters must appear twice? Or there is a fifth letter? Actually, we must find a fifth letter that is not among the eliminated ones (C, N, S) and not R, A, E, T? Because R, A, E, T are known to be present? But they might be more than one? However, we don\'t have any duplicate feedback yet? So likely each is one occurrence? But not necessarily.\n\nBut the feedback for ""tares"" didn\'t have any ""x"" except S? And T, A, R, E got dashes? Meaning each one is present, and each one is in the word? So if each is present and the word has five letters, then the word must contain exactly these four? Then one of them must be duplicated? Or there is a fifth letter? But we don\'t know? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t specify if there are duplicates? Because if a letter is duplicated and we guess one, it might not account for extra? Alternatively, if we have five distinct letters: R, A, E, T, and one unknown? But we had ""crane"" and ""tares"", which included letters? So let\'s reason:\n\nWe have eliminated: C, N, S.\n\nWe have confirmed: R, A, E, T.\n\nThus, the fifth letter must not be C, N, S? And must be any letter not yet eliminated? But we don\'t know? So it must be present? And we haven\'t guessed it? So the fifth letter is missing from our guesses so far? Therefore, we need to include R, A, E, T and a fifth new letter that hasn\'t been guessed? And hasn\'t been eliminated? So we must try a fifth letter.\n\nBut note: we only have four positions effectively? Because we have five positions? We have to place five letters? But with four letters confirmed? So one duplicate? Without feedback about duplicates, it is likely that the word has only four distinct letters? But we don\'t know? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates? So perhaps we should consider that one letter is duplicated? Or we have a fifth unknown letter.\n\nSince from guess 1 we had R, A, E? And guess 2 added T? And S was eliminated? Then the word has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But what about E? How? So the secret word has five letters: consisting of R, A, E, T and one more.\n\nBut we don\'t know what that one more is? So we need to guess a word that has R, A, E, T? And a fifth letter? Which hasn\'t been eliminated? So not C, N, S.\n\nNow, possible positions? We need to assign R, A, E, T and fifth letter to positions 1-5? Avoiding the forbidden placements:\n\nFor A: avoid positions 2 and 3? So possible: position 1, 4, or 5? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5; so available: 1,4,5.\n\nFor R: avoid positions 2 and 3? So available: 1, 4, 5? Same? But position overlap? We cannot put two letters at the same position? So we have four letters? Or five? We need to assign each to a position? But also, one position must be the fifth letter? Or we have duplicate? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be another letter? But we don\'t have an alternative? So?\n\nFirst, list possible positions available:\n\nAvailable positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints:\n\nA: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.\nR: cannot be at 2 or 3 -> allowed positions: 1,4,5.\nE: cannot be at 4 or 5 -> allowed positions: 1,2,3? Because 4 and 5 are forbidden? So E can be at 1, 2, or 3? Not? Because E is forbidden at 4 and 5? So E can be at 1,2,3.\nT: cannot be at 1 -> allowed positions: 2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, fifth letter: we don\'t know? It must be placed? And it hasn\'t been guessed? So we need to introduce? How? We must guess a word that exactly has R, A, E, T? And one more letter? But we have five letters? So we have four letters but we need five? Therefore:\n\nLet me think: we have no duplication? Because if there were duplication, the feedback might show something? For example, if R appeared twice? Then when we guessed one R correctly placed? We might not know? But so far, we have guessed each of R, A, E, T, one? And they were present? So if the word contains two Rs? Then when we guessed R at one position, it might not be the only one? But without feedback? We don\'t know? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t distinguish: if a letter is duplicated, and we guessed one instance in wrong position and another? But we have placed R only once? So we don\'t know? Therefore, we must consider the possibility of a fifth letter? So the word has five distinct letters? Probably? But duplicates are possible? So we should not assume? But since we have eliminated only S, and not T? Etc.\n\nBut from the absence of any duplicate feedback? By parsimony? We assume distinct letters? Until proven otherwise? So I\'ll proceed with distinct? Because it\'s simpler? And we have R,A,E,T? And a fifth letter? Which must not be C, N, S? And not any other? So among the other letters? How to choose? We must pick a new letter? So let\'s introduce a letter like O, U, I, L, D? Etc? Common vowels/consonants? We also need to assign positions for T, A, R, E? With constraints? And the fifth letter? In a position.\n\nBut we have three positions for E: 1? Or 2? Or 3? Etc? And similarly for others? So we must form a word with letters: R, A, E, T, and X? Where X is a new letter not C, N, S.\n\nFor example, let X be L? Then word ""LATER""? But L is new? And positions: \n- L at position 1?\n- A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? Because from guess 2 (tares), A was at position 2 and wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore ""LATER"" places A at position 2? Which is forbidden? So not possible? Similarly, ""ALTER"" but then A at position 1? Etc? Let me see.\n\nAvoid placing A at positions 2 or 3? And E cannot be at 4 or 5? Etc.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t guessed any word with E in positions 1,2,3? So we need to put E at one of 1,2,3.\n\nNow, possible words? With R, A, E, T and a fifth letter.\n\nFifth letter possibilities: let\'s pick common letters? But not eliminated: so not C, N, S? Common letters: L, O, U, I, D, G, H? Etc.\n\nLet me compile possible words? Also, the word must be valid? And meet position constraints.\n\nFor example, ""IRATE"": but I? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning angry? \nPositions:\n- Position 1: I (new letter)\n- Position 2: R -> R cannot be at position 2 (known from guess 1)? Because R was at position 2 in crane and wrong? So not position 2? Therefore putting R at position 2? Will get dash? Which is redundant? So avoid? Because we already know R cannot be at position 2? So why put it there? Then using ""IRATE"": is waste? Because R at position 2? Also, placing T? Where? Position 5? Which is possible? Since T can be at 5? But E is at position 5? Contradiction? ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? Positions:\n1: I\n2: R -> avoid: position 2 for R\n3: A -> position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? Also known? Because from crane? So positions 2 and 3 are forbidden? For R? And A? So both issues.\n\nTherefore ""IRATE"" is bad? Because R and A in forbidden positions.\n\nAnother word: ""TREAT"": duplicate T? Could be? But we don\'t know? Or ""TRAIL"": has R,A,I? And L? But missing E? But we know E is present? So must include E? Therefore words without E are invalid? Because E must be in the word? Similarly, T? R? A?\n\nSo we must have E? Therefore, ""TREAT"": T, R, E, A, T? Duplicate T? So positions: \n1:T -> T cannot be at position 1? Known? Then \n2:R -> R cannot at position 2? Known? \n3:E -> E can be at position 3? Because forbidden? Only 4 and 5? So position 3 allowed? Yes? \n4:A -> A can be at position 4? Because forbid 2 and 3? So position 4 allowed? \n5:T -> T cannot be at position 5? Why? We don\'t know? Because T forbidden at position 1? But position 5 might be allowed? \n\nBut in ""TREAT"", T is repeated? So feedback might be interesting? But we have to see? But the word has only four distinct letters? Then which T gets the feedback? It might be messy? Alternatively, avoid? Because simpler to avoid duplicates? \n\nBut let\'s consider: since E can be at position 3? And A at position 4? So possible? But T and R are in forbidden positions? Positions 1 and 2? So the guess will be? But we already know that T1 is wrong and R2 is wrong? So we waste positions? So better choose a word that doesn\'t put any letter in a position we know forbidden? Unless forced? \n\nTherefore, we need to put R, A, E, T, and a fifth letter in positions that are allowed? And avoid positions that are forbidden for each? \n\nSo:\n\nAvailable positions:\n\nA: positions 1,4,5.\nR: positions 1,4,5.\nE: positions 1,2,3.\nT: positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, positions? How to assign?\n\nPosition 1: can be A, R, or E? Or the fifth letter? Similarly.\n\nBut conflict? Because positions 1,4,5 are available for R and A? But E can only be at 1,2,3? T can be at 2,3,4,5.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word? So let\'s find? \n\nPut E at position 1? Then R or A cannot be at position 1? Then at position 1: E? Position 1 for E? Valid? Like ""EARTH""? Earth has E, A, R, T? And H? Fifth letter H? So positions: E at 1? Then available? But E at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because E can be at position 1? \nThen A? Must be at 4 or 5? Etc? \n\n""EARTH"": \n- Position 1: E -> allowed? Yes? \n- Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Because from tares? A was at position 2? Marked wrong? So A cannot be at position 2? Therefore, putting A at position 2? Will get dash? Redundant? \n\nSimilarly, why? If we put E at position 1? Then we can place A at position 4 or 5? But ""EARTH"" puts A at position 2? Which is bad? So ""EARTH"" is not good? \n\n""ETRAP"": Not common? ""REACT"": has C? Eliminated? C not allowed? \n\n""LATER"": but L? Then position 1:L? Then A at position 2? But A cannot at position 2? So no? \n\n""ALERT"": \n- Position 1: A? Allowed? A at position 1? Permitted? Yes? Because not position 2 or 3? \n- Position 2: L? \n- Position 3: E? Allowed? E can be at position 3? \n- Position 4: R? Allowed? R can be at position 4? \n- Position 5: T? T can be at position 5? \n\nCheck constraints:\n- A: position 1 => allowed? Yes? Because constraints: A allowed at 1,4,5? Position 1 is good? \n- E: position 3 => allowed? Yes? E can be at position 3? \n- R: position 4 => allowed? Yes? R can be at position 4? \n- T: position 5 => allowed? Yes? T can be at position 5? \n- L: fifth letter? Which we don\'t know? But haven\'t guessed? So valid? \n\nBut what about feedback? Will we get useful? The word ""ALERT"" satisfies constraints? And is a valid word? \n\nAnother option: ""OATER""? Obscure? ""WATER"": has W? Then positions: \nW at position 1? \nA at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? So not allowed? \n\n""TRIED"": has D? Then T at position 1? T cannot at position 1? So avoid? \n\n""TRIAL"": T at position 1? Not allowed? \n\n""TREAD"": T at position 1? Not allowed? \n\n""STARE"": but S eliminated? \n\n""CRATE"": C eliminated? \n\nSo after looking? ""ALERT"" seems suitable? \n\nAlternatively? ""LATRE"": not word? ""AISLE"": missing R? \n\n""TABLE"": missing R and E? \n\nTherefore? We choose ""ALERT"" as the next guess? Because it satisfies the position constraints? And uses L as the fifth letter? We hope to get feedback on L? And refine? \n\nBut note: E is at position 3? And A at position 1? R at position 4? T at position 5? All within allowed positions? \n\nWe also haven\'t guessed L? So if L is absent? Or present? We\'ll know? \n\nBut L might be present? Or we must see? At this point, I guess ""ALERT"". \n\nAfter analyzing, ""ALERT"" is:\n\n- Position 1: A -> we know A cannot be at 2 or 3? So we put at 1? Which is allowed? Might be correct? Or not? \n- Position 2: L -> new letter? \n- Position 3: E -> we know E cannot be at 4 or 5? So position 3? Might be correct? \n- Position 4: R -> R cannot be at 2 or 3? Position 4? Might be correct? \n- Position 5: T -> we know T cannot be at 1? So position 5? Might be correct? \n\nSo all placements are in newly tested positions? So potentially? We might get some correct? Or get clues? \n\nTherefore, next guess: alert### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\nFollowing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  \n   - C and N are **absent**.  \n   - R, A, E are **present** but not in positions 2, 3, or 5, respectively.\n\n2. **Guess 2: tares → Feedback: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)**  \n   - S is **absent**.  \n   - T, A, R, E are **present** but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed present letters**: R, A, E, T.  \n- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, N, S.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from *tares*) or 3 (from *crane*).  \n  - **R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from *crane*) or 3 (from *tares*).  \n  - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from *tares*) or 5 (from *crane*).  \n  - **T**: Cannot be in position 1 (from *tares*).  \n- Since R, A, E, T are all confirmed present, the secret word must include *exactly these four letters* plus **one unknown letter** (not C, N, or S).  \n- The unknown fifth letter must be inferred by testing **common letters** not yet eliminated (e.g., L, O, I, D, G, H).  \n\n### Next Guess Strategy:\n- Prioritize:  \n  - **Place A, R, E, T only in allowed positions**:  \n    - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.  \n    - R: Positions 1, 4, or 5.  \n    - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.  \n    - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  \n  - Include a **new common vowel/consonant** that hasn\'t been tested (e.g., L).  \n- **""ALERT""** (meaning *vigilant*) fits all constraints:  \n  - Positions:  \n    - A at position 1 (allowed per constraints).  \n    - L at position 2 (new letter; not eliminated).  \n    - E at position 3 (allowed per constraints).  \n    - R at position 4 (allowed per constraints).  \n    - T at position 5 (allowed per constraints).  \n  - Avoids forbidden positions for all confirmed letters.  \n- If L is present, we get positional feedback; if absent, it is eliminated for future guesses.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests constraints and introduces ""L"" as a potential fifth letter while respecting all feedback.\n\n<guess>alert</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) R(-) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: tares
- T: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- E: present, wrong position (-)
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: alert
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- L: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 4
- T: present, wrong position (-)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Absent letters**: C, N, S, L (from the x's)
2. **Present letters**: R, A, E, T (confirmed in multiple guesses)
   - R is now known to be in position 4 (from guess 3: R at position 4 is correct)

Since R is fixed at position 4, we can use that.

3. **Position constraints for present letters**:

   - **A**: 
     - From crane (position 3): not at 3
     - From tares (position 2): not at 2
     - From alert (position 1): not at 1 (because it's marked as wrong position)
     - So A cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3. The only positions left are 4 and 5? But position 4 is taken by R. Therefore, A must be at position 5? But let's check:

     Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
     R is at 4, so A cannot be at 4. Therefore, A must be at position 5? But we have to confirm.

     However, in alert, A was at position 1 and marked wrong, so A is not at 1. Similarly, not at 2 or 3. So only position 5 is left? But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates. So let's assume no duplicates for now.

     Therefore, A must be at position 5.

   - **E**:
     - From crane (position 5): not at 5
     - From tares (position 4): not at 4 (but now position 4 is R, so that's consistent)
     - From alert (position 3): not at 3
     - So E cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 2.

   - **T**:
     - From tares (position 1): not at 1
     - From alert (position 5): not at 5 (because marked wrong)
     - Also, from the constraints, T can be at 2,3,4? But position 4 is R, so T cannot be at 4. Therefore, T must be at position 2 or 3.

   - **R**: fixed at position 4.

4. **Fifth letter**: We have R, A, E, T, and one more letter. The absent letters are C, N, S, L. So the fifth letter must be a letter not in {C, N, S, L} and not R,A,E,T (if no duplicates). But we have five positions and five distinct letters? So the fifth letter is unknown.

   We know the word has R at 4, A must be at 5 (as deduced), E at 1 or 2, T at 2 or 3, and the fifth letter at the remaining position.

   Let's consider the positions:

   Position 4: R (fixed)
   Position 5: A (deduced)

   Then positions 1,2,3 must be filled by E, T, and the fifth letter.

   But E must be at 1 or 2, and T at 2 or 3.

   Now, the fifth letter must be at one of 1,2,3.

   Also, from guess 3 (alert), we had:
   Position 1: A (wrong) -> but we now think A is at 5, so that's consistent.
   Position 2: L (absent) -> so L is not in the word.
   Position 3: E (wrong) -> so E not at 3, which we already have.
   Position 4: R (correct)
   Position 5: T (wrong) -> so T not at 5, which we have.

   Now, we need to assign E and T to positions 1,2,3 without conflict.

   Possibilities:

   Case 1: E at position 1, then T at position 2 or 3.
   Case 2: E at position 2, then T at position 3 (since if E at 2, T cannot be at 2, so T at 3).

   But we also have the fifth letter to place? So:

   The positions 1,2,3 must be: one of them is E, one is T, and one is the fifth letter.

   So:

   Option A:
     Position 1: E
     Position 2: T
     Position 3: fifth letter

   Option B:
     Position 1: E
     Position 2: fifth letter
     Position 3: T

   Option C:
     Position 1: fifth letter
     Position 2: E
     Position 3: T

   But E cannot be at 3? So Option A and B have E at 1? And Option C has E at 2.

   Now, we need to form a valid word.

   Also, we know from guess 2 (tares) that T was at position 1 and wrong? But in our options, T is at 2 or 3? So that's fine.

   Now, let's think of words that end with ""RA"" (positions 4 and 5: R and A). So the word pattern: _ _ _ R A

   And the first three letters: must include E, T, and one more letter.

   Now, from Option A: E T ? R A -> word: ET?RA

   Option B: E ? T R A -> word: E?TRA

   Option C: ? E T R A -> word: ?ETRA

   We need to find a valid English word.

   Also, the fifth letter (?) must not be C, N, S, L, and not R,A,E,T (if distinct). So we need to choose a common letter that fits.

   Let's try Option C: ?ETRA -> words ending with ETRA? Like ""EXTRA""? But X is not eliminated? And E is at position 2? In ""EXTRA"", positions:
   X at 1, E at 2, T at 3, R at 4, A at 5? That matches.

   Check constraints for E: at position 2? We said E can be at 1 or 2? So position 2 is allowed? And T at position 3? We said T can be at 2 or 3? So position 3 is allowed? And R at 4 (fixed), A at 5 (deduced).

   Also, X: we haven't guessed X? So it might be present? And not eliminated.

   Now, check against previous feedback:

   In guess 1: crane -> no X, so no issue.
   In guess 2: tares -> no X, so no issue.
   In guess 3: alert -> no X, so no issue.

   So ""EXTRA"" is a possible word? But let's confirm the pattern.

   Also, in ""EXTRA"", the fifth letter is X at position 1.

   Now, is there any conflict? We need to verify the feedback we would have gotten? But we haven't guessed it? So we can try.

   Alternatively, are there other options? For example, Option A: ET?RA. What words? Like ""ETHRA""? Not common? Or ""ETCRA""? C is eliminated. So not.

   Option B: E?TRA. Words: ""EXTRA"" is actually E at 1? No, in Option B: E at 1, then fifth letter at 2, then T at 3? So pattern: E _ T R A. Words: ""EXITRA""? Not a word. ""EDITRA""? Not. ""ELTRA""? L is absent. So not many common words.

   Therefore, Option C: ? E T R A -> _ E T R A, like ""EXTRA"" or ""METRA""? But ""METRA"" might not be common? ""PETRA""? But P not eliminated? But ""EXTRA"" is a very common word.

   So ""EXTRA"" seems a strong candidate.

   But in ""EXTRA"", we have:
   Position 1: X
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: T
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: A

   Now, check constraints:

   - E: at position 2? We said E can be at 1 or 2? Yes? And it was not at 3,4,5? So position 2 is allowed? 
   - T: at position 3? We said T can be at 2 or 3? Yes? And not at 1 or 5? So allowed? 
   - R: at 4? Correct? 
   - A: at 5? We deduced? 
   - X: new letter? Not eliminated? 

   Also, the word ""EXTRA"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess ""EXTRA"".

   But note: in guess 3 (alert), we had E at position 3? Which was wrong? And in ""EXTRA"", E is at position 2? So that's a new position? And T at position 3? Which was not tested? Because in alert, position 3 was E? Not T? So we are testing T at position 3? Which is allowed? 

   So I think ""EXTRA"" is the best guess.

   Alternatively, if we want to be safe? But we have to guess.

   So next guess: extra
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, I have deduced the following:

- **Confirmed Letters**: R, A, E, T are present in the word.
- **Absent Letters**: C, N, S, L are not in the word.
- **Positional Constraints**:
  - R is **correctly placed at position 4** (from Guess 3: R(✓)).
  - A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from all feedback), so it **must be in position 5**.
  - E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from all feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
  - T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback), so it must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Word Structure**: The word ends with ""RA"" (positions 4 and 5: R and A). The first three positions must contain E, T, and one new letter (since C, N, S, L are absent).
- **Deduced Pattern**:  
  - Positions: [E or new] [E or T] [T or new] R A  
  - Given constraints, the only valid arrangement is:  
    - Position 1: New letter (not E, T, R, A, or eliminated letters).  
    - Position 2: E (since E must be in 1 or 2, and position 1 is taken by the new letter).  
    - Position 3: T (since T must be in 2 or 3, and position 2 is taken by E).  

The word **""EXTRA""** fits perfectly:
- **X** (new letter) at position 1,  
- **E** at position 2 (allowed, since E cannot be in 3/4/5),  
- **T** at position 3 (allowed, since T cannot be in 1/5),  
- **R** at position 4 (confirmed correct),  
- **A** at position 5 (deduced).  

This guess tests the deduced structure and uses ""X"" (a common letter not yet tested) as the fifth character. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, it provides critical feedback for the next guess.

<guess>extra</guess>",extra,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: tares
- T: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- E: present, wrong position (-)
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: alert
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- L: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 4
- T: present, wrong position (-)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Absent letters**: C, N, S, L (from the x's)
2. **Present letters**: R, A, E, T (confirmed in multiple guesses)
   - R is now known to be in position 4 (from guess 3: R at position 4 is correct)

Since R is fixed at position 4, we can use that.

3. **Position constraints for present letters**:

   - **A**: 
     - From crane (position 3): not at 3
     - From tares (position 2): not at 2
     - From alert (position 1): not at 1 (because it's marked as wrong position)
     - So A cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3. The only positions left are 4 and 5? But position 4 is taken by R. Therefore, A must be at position 5? But let's check:

     Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
     R is at 4, so A cannot be at 4. Therefore, A must be at position 5? But we have to confirm.

     However, in alert, A was at position 1 and marked wrong, so A is not at 1. Similarly, not at 2 or 3. So only position 5 is left? But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates. So let's assume no duplicates for now.

     Therefore, A must be at position 5.

   - **E**:
     - From crane (position 5): not at 5
     - From tares (position 4): not at 4 (but now position 4 is R, so that's consistent)
     - From alert (position 3): not at 3
     - So E cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 2.

   - **T**:
     - From tares (position 1): not at 1
     - From alert (position 5): not at 5 (because marked wrong)
     - Also, from the constraints, T can be at 2,3,4? But position 4 is R, so T cannot be at 4. Therefore, T must be at position 2 or 3.

   - **R**: fixed at position 4.

4. **Fifth letter**: We have R, A, E, T, and one more letter. The absent letters are C, N, S, L. So the fifth letter must be a letter not in {C, N, S, L} and not R,A,E,T (if no duplicates). But we have five positions and five distinct letters? So the fifth letter is unknown.

   We know the word has R at 4, A must be at 5 (as deduced), E at 1 or 2, T at 2 or 3, and the fifth letter at the remaining position.

   Let's consider the positions:

   Position 4: R (fixed)
   Position 5: A (deduced)

   Then positions 1,2,3 must be filled by E, T, and the fifth letter.

   But E must be at 1 or 2, and T at 2 or 3.

   Now, the fifth letter must be at one of 1,2,3.

   Also, from guess 3 (alert), we had:
   Position 1: A (wrong) -> but we now think A is at 5, so that's consistent.
   Position 2: L (absent) -> so L is not in the word.
   Position 3: E (wrong) -> so E not at 3, which we already have.
   Position 4: R (correct)
   Position 5: T (wrong) -> so T not at 5, which we have.

   Now, we need to assign E and T to positions 1,2,3 without conflict.

   Possibilities:

   Case 1: E at position 1, then T at position 2 or 3.
   Case 2: E at position 2, then T at position 3 (since if E at 2, T cannot be at 2, so T at 3).

   But we also have the fifth letter to place? So:

   The positions 1,2,3 must be: one of them is E, one is T, and one is the fifth letter.

   So:

   Option A:
     Position 1: E
     Position 2: T
     Position 3: fifth letter

   Option B:
     Position 1: E
     Position 2: fifth letter
     Position 3: T

   Option C:
     Position 1: fifth letter
     Position 2: E
     Position 3: T

   But E cannot be at 3? So Option A and B have E at 1? And Option C has E at 2.

   Now, we need to form a valid word.

   Also, we know from guess 2 (tares) that T was at position 1 and wrong? But in our options, T is at 2 or 3? So that's fine.

   Now, let's think of words that end with ""RA"" (positions 4 and 5: R and A). So the word pattern: _ _ _ R A

   And the first three letters: must include E, T, and one more letter.

   Now, from Option A: E T ? R A -> word: ET?RA

   Option B: E ? T R A -> word: E?TRA

   Option C: ? E T R A -> word: ?ETRA

   We need to find a valid English word.

   Also, the fifth letter (?) must not be C, N, S, L, and not R,A,E,T (if distinct). So we need to choose a common letter that fits.

   Let's try Option C: ?ETRA -> words ending with ETRA? Like ""EXTRA""? But X is not eliminated? And E is at position 2? In ""EXTRA"", positions:
   X at 1, E at 2, T at 3, R at 4, A at 5? That matches.

   Check constraints for E: at position 2? We said E can be at 1 or 2? So position 2 is allowed? And T at position 3? We said T can be at 2 or 3? So position 3 is allowed? And R at 4 (fixed), A at 5 (deduced).

   Also, X: we haven't guessed X? So it might be present? And not eliminated.

   Now, check against previous feedback:

   In guess 1: crane -> no X, so no issue.
   In guess 2: tares -> no X, so no issue.
   In guess 3: alert -> no X, so no issue.

   So ""EXTRA"" is a possible word? But let's confirm the pattern.

   Also, in ""EXTRA"", the fifth letter is X at position 1.

   Now, is there any conflict? We need to verify the feedback we would have gotten? But we haven't guessed it? So we can try.

   Alternatively, are there other options? For example, Option A: ET?RA. What words? Like ""ETHRA""? Not common? Or ""ETCRA""? C is eliminated. So not.

   Option B: E?TRA. Words: ""EXTRA"" is actually E at 1? No, in Option B: E at 1, then fifth letter at 2, then T at 3? So pattern: E _ T R A. Words: ""EXITRA""? Not a word. ""EDITRA""? Not. ""ELTRA""? L is absent. So not many common words.

   Therefore, Option C: ? E T R A -> _ E T R A, like ""EXTRA"" or ""METRA""? But ""METRA"" might not be common? ""PETRA""? But P not eliminated? But ""EXTRA"" is a very common word.

   So ""EXTRA"" seems a strong candidate.

   But in ""EXTRA"", we have:
   Position 1: X
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: T
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: A

   Now, check constraints:

   - E: at position 2? We said E can be at 1 or 2? Yes? And it was not at 3,4,5? So position 2 is allowed? 
   - T: at position 3? We said T can be at 2 or 3? Yes? And not at 1 or 5? So allowed? 
   - R: at 4? Correct? 
   - A: at 5? We deduced? 
   - X: new letter? Not eliminated? 

   Also, the word ""EXTRA"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess ""EXTRA"".

   But note: in guess 3 (alert), we had E at position 3? Which was wrong? And in ""EXTRA"", E is at position 2? So that's a new position? And T at position 3? Which was not tested? Because in alert, position 3 was E? Not T? So we are testing T at position 3? Which is allowed? 

   So I think ""EXTRA"" is the best guess.

   Alternatively, if we want to be safe? But we have to guess.

   So next guess: extraBased on the feedback from all previous guesses, I have deduced the following:

- **Confirmed Letters**: R, A, E, T are present in the word.
- **Absent Letters**: C, N, S, L are not in the word.
- **Positional Constraints**:
  - R is **correctly placed at position 4** (from Guess 3: R(✓)).
  - A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from all feedback), so it **must be in position 5**.
  - E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from all feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 2.
  - T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback), so it must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Word Structure**: The word ends with ""RA"" (positions 4 and 5: R and A). The first three positions must contain E, T, and one new letter (since C, N, S, L are absent).
- **Deduced Pattern**:  
  - Positions: [E or new] [E or T] [T or new] R A  
  - Given constraints, the only valid arrangement is:  
    - Position 1: New letter (not E, T, R, A, or eliminated letters).  
    - Position 2: E (since E must be in 1 or 2, and position 1 is taken by the new letter).  
    - Position 3: T (since T must be in 2 or 3, and position 2 is taken by E).  

The word **""EXTRA""** fits perfectly:
- **X** (new letter) at position 1,  
- **E** at position 2 (allowed, since E cannot be in 3/4/5),  
- **T** at position 3 (allowed, since T cannot be in 1/5),  
- **R** at position 4 (confirmed correct),  
- **A** at position 5 (deduced).  

This guess tests the deduced structure and uses ""X"" (a common letter not yet tested) as the fifth character. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, it provides critical feedback for the next guess.",Guess 4: extra -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) X(✓) T(✓) R(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
