We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess.
 Since we don't have any prior information, it's good to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc. These cover common letters and can help gather information.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I think ""RAISE"" is a good start because:
   - It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E) [note: E is also a vowel, but often used as a consonant in word games].
   - The letters R, S, and E are common.

 So, I'll guess ""RAISE"".

- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).  
- All letters are distinct, allowing each to provide feedback.  
This will help identify correct positions and possible letter matches efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""RAISE"" are in the secret word, we need to choose a new word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding R, A, I, S, E) might include: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""CLOUD"" or ""POINT"" or ""MOUNT"". However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let's consider the word ""TOUCH"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, we need 5-letter words.

 Possible words:
 - ""POINT"": letters P, O, I, N, T -> but I is already excluded (from first guess), so we cannot use I.
   We must avoid R, A, I, S, E. So we cannot use I.

 - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> all new letters.

 - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D -> all new.

 - ""NYMPH"": N, Y, M, P, H -> includes Y which is less common, but it's a valid word.

 - ""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y.

 We want to choose a word with high-frequency letters. After excluding R, A, I, S, E, the next most common letters are T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M.

 Let's pick a word that includes T, N, O, and a couple of others.

 The word ""POINT"" is invalid because it has I (excluded). So we can use ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T.

 Alternatively, ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters.

 Another classic second guess after eliminating some letters is to use a word like ""CLUMP"" or ""THONG"".

 Considering the above, I choose ""MOUNT"" because it uses M, O, U, N, T which are common and not used before.

 However, let me check if there's a word that covers more common letters. The letters T, O, N are very common. M and U are also fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""DONUT"" is not a word? Actually, we need valid words. ""DONUT"" is 5 letters and valid? But it has D, O, N, U, T.

 But we can also consider ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D.

 Since we are avoiding R,A,I,S,E, any of these are acceptable.

 I think ""MOUNT"" is a good choice: M, O, U, N, T.

 Let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback for ""RAISE"" (all letters marked as 'x'), none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and uses new common letters to gather more information. 

I'll select **""MOUNT""** because:
- It uses entirely new letters (M, O, U, N, T), avoiding R, A, I, S, E.
- These letters are common in English words (T, O, N are top-frequency consonants/vowels).
- The word has no repeating letters, maximizing information potential.

- For ""RAISE"": all letters are incorrect (x), meaning the secret word contains none of R, A, I, S, E.
- For ""MOUNT"": M(x), O(x), U(✓), N(✓), T(✓). This tells us:
  - U, N, T are in the secret word and in the correct positions. Since U is the third letter in ""MOUNT"", it means the third letter of the secret word is U. Similarly, N is the fourth letter and must be in the fourth position, and T is the fifth letter and must be in the fifth position.
  - M and O are not in the word at all (x).

So, the secret word has the form: _ _ U N T
- The third letter is U, fourth is N, fifth is T.
- The first and second letters are unknown, but we know they cannot be R, A, I, S, E, M, or O (from the x's).

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""UNT"" and has the third letter U, fourth N, fifth T. So the pattern is: _ _ U N T.

Moreover, the first two letters must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,O.

We have to guess a word that fits: [letter1][letter2] U N T

Considering common English letters that can form words with ending ""UNT"":
- Examples: HUNT, GUNT (not common?), BUNT, PUNT, AUNT (but A is forbidden), etc.

But note: A is forbidden (from first guess feedback), and we must avoid R,A,I,S,E,M,O.

So possible words might be:
- HUNT: H and U N T. H is not forbidden? Letters used: H,U,N,T. U,N,T are confirmed. We need to check if H is allowed? Yes, because H wasn't used in previous guesses and isn't forbidden (only R,A,I,S,E,M,O are excluded so far).
- BUNT: B and U N T.
- PUNT: P and U N T.
- LUNT (if valid) but we must use valid words.

We also need to ensure the guessed word is valid.

But note: the feedback for ""MOUNT"" showed that U, N, T are in the correct positions. So we are only missing the first two letters. However, we have two positions to fill, so we need to guess a word that starts with two new letters that haven't been tested yet.

But we don't have information about the first two letters, so we can try a word that uses common consonants for the first two positions.

Possible words ending with UNT: 
- HUNT: H U N T -> but HUNT is 4 letters? No, wait: H-U-N-T is 4 letters? Actually, HUNT is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words! 

Wait, the pattern must be 5 letters: two letters then U, then N, then T. So the word has five positions: [1][2]U N T.

We need a 5-letter word where the last three letters are U, N, T. So the word must end with ""UNT"".

But ""UNT"" as in the suffix? Let me think of 5-letter words ending with ""UNT"":
- Actually, many are like: DAUNT, PAUNT? VAUNT? GAUNT? But note:
  - DAUNT: D-A-U-N-T -> but A is forbidden (from first guess, A is not in the word).
  - HAUNT: H-A-U-N-T -> A is forbidden.
  - GAUNT: G-A-U-N-T -> A forbidden.
  - VAUNT: V-A-U-N-T -> A forbidden.

It seems challenging because many have A.

What about ""BUNTS"" but that ends with S, and we have T as the fifth? No, our pattern is ...U N T, so fifth letter is T.

Wait, perhaps words that have the third letter U, fourth N, fifth T? That would be 5-letter words with U in position 3, N in 4, T in 5.

So the structure: letter1, letter2, U, N, T.

Known words:
- PUNT can be extended? P-U-N-T is 4. We need 5 letters.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ U N T:
- GRUNT: G-R-U-N-T -> but R is forbidden? From first guess, R was in RAISE and got x, so R is not in the word. So GRUNT is invalid because R is used and excluded.
- BRUNT: B-R-U-N-T -> R is forbidden (x).
- DAUNT: D-A-U-N-T -> A forbidden (x).
- HAUNT: H-A-U-N-T -> A forbidden.
- JAUNT: J-A-U-N-T -> A forbidden.
- VAUNT: V-A-U-N-T -> A forbidden.

So A is a problem. We need words without A.

Other possibilities:
- COUNT: C-O-U-N-T -> but O is forbidden? In the second guess, MOUNT had O and it was marked x, so O is not in the word. Thus COUNT is invalid because O is used.
- MOUNT: we just used it and it's not the word (since U,N,T were correct but not the first two).
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> has O and I (I is forbidden from first guess) and also position 3 is I, not U.

Wait, there is ""BUNTY""? Not valid.

Let me think without A: 
- ""A"" is forbidden, so we need words that don't use A and avoid R,A,I,S,E,M,O.

Try words like:
- BLUNT: B-L-U-N-T -> letters B,L,U,N,T. U,N,T are fixed. Check forbidden letters: we have B,L. Are B and L tested? Not yet, and they are not in the forbidden list. So BLUNT should be acceptable? Let me verify the word: BLUNT is a valid word meaning not sharp or abrupt.

Similarly:
- FLUNT? Not a word.
- GLUNT? Not a word.
- CLUNT? Maybe not.

But BLUNT is valid.

Another option: 
- STUNT: S-T-U-N-T -> but S is forbidden (from first guess). Also T is repeated? STUNT: positions: S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we only have one T? Wait, the secret word might have two Ts? We don't know yet. But S is forbidden, so STUNT is invalid because S is used.

How about ""PUNT""? Is there a 5-letter word? Punt is 4 letters.

But in 5-letters: PUNTS? But that would be U in position 2, not 3. We need U in position 3.

So BLUNT is one option: B-L-U-N-T.

Another possibility: ""SHUNT"" -> S-H-U-N-T -> S is forbidden.

Is there ""CRUNT""? Not a word.

What about ""TRUNT""? Not common.

Alternatively, words with U in third, N in fourth, T in fifth, but not necessarily ending ""UNT"" as a suffix? But the pattern is fixed.

Another word: ""YOUNT""? Not really a word.

Wait, I found: ""JAUNT"" but has A.

""VAUNT"" has A.

""HAUNT"" has A.

So BLUNT seems like a candidate.

Is there ""PLUNT""? Not a word.

Another word: ""ROUNT""? No, and has R.

So BLUNT appears to be a valid word that fits the pattern and avoids the forbidden letters.

We also haven't tested B or L yet.

But note: we only have 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3. If BLUNT is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on B and L.

We could also try other letters, but BLUNT is a common word? It's acceptable.

But let me confirm: secret word must be of the form ? ? U N T, with ? being letters not in R,A,I,S,E,M,O and distinct? Not necessarily distinct, but BLUNT has B,L which are not forbidden.

Perhaps there is another word? I recall ""TOUNT""? Not a word.

So BLUNT seems good.

But wait: what about ""JUNTO""? No, that doesn't have U in third and doesn't end with NT.

Given the constraints, BLUNT is a valid guess.

We could also consider ""GRUNT"" but R is forbidden.

Therefore, I will guess ""BLUNT"".

The first two letters are B and L, which are new. If the word is BLUNT, we get it right. If not, we'll get feedback on B and L, which will help.

But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but in BLUNT no repeats.

Also, position: B in first, L in second, U in third, N in fourth, T in fifth.

If the secret word doesn't have B or L correctly, we get feedback.

But since U,N,T are fixed, we can make progress.

Another possibility: maybe the word is ""COUNT"" but O is forbidden, so no.

Or ""MOUNT"" we already guessed and not correct.

So I think ""BLUNT"" is a reasonable next guess.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:  
- ""RAISE"" had all incorrect letters (x), meaning the secret word contains **none** of R, A, I, S, or E.  
- ""MOUNT"" revealed that **U**, **N**, and **T** are correct and in the exact positions (3rd, 4th, and 5th), while **M** and **O** are absent (x).  

This tells us the secret word has the fixed pattern: `__ U N T`.  
- The first two letters are unknown but must **exclude** the forbidden letters (R, A, I, S, E, M, O).  
- Common possibilities fitting this pattern include words like **HUNT** (invalid, only 4 letters), **COUNT** (invalid, contains O), and **HAUNT**/DAUNT (invalid, contain A).  

A valid word matching the pattern and avoiding forbidden letters is **BLUNT** (B-L-U-N-T).  
- B and L are new, untested letters to help gather feedback on the first two positions.  
- If correct, this solves the word; if not, it will reveal information about B and L.
