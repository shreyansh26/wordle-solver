We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. 
 This word has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), which are common.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".
</think>
I'm starting with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it contains common letters: two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This combination helps test frequent letters in the alphabet, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback about which letters are present and their positions. Since we have no prior clues, this balanced approach maximizes information gain.

We received feedback for ""crane"": C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
 - 'C' is in the correct position (position 1).
 - 'R' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
 - 'A' is not in the word.
 - 'N' is in the correct position (position 4).
 - 'E' is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'C' in position 1 and 'N' in position 4.
 - The secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in position 2.
 - The letters 'A' and 'E' are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: C _ _ N _

 We also know that 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So it can be in position 3 or 5.

 Additionally, we need to avoid using 'A' and 'E' in our next guess.

 We must also consider that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Since positions 1 and 4 are fixed as 'C' and 'N', and we need to place 'R' in either position 3 or 5, let's think of possibilities.

 Structure: C _ ? N ? 
 Where one of the ? must be 'R', and the other is a new letter.

 But note: the feedback told us that 'R' is present but not in position 2. So the second letter is still unknown and cannot be 'R'.

 Let's list possible letters for the second position: it cannot be 'A', 'E', or 'R' (because if it were 'R', it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in position 2, if it were 'R', it might be marked as present and correct if that's where it belongs? But here we know that 'R' is not in position 2 because it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, wait: the feedback for position 2 was 'R' and it got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 2.

 So for the second position, we need to pick a letter that is not 'A', 'E', and also not a letter we know isn't present. We only know about 'A' and 'E' being absent so far.

 We can use other vowels or consonants.

 Also note: we have two open positions: 2 and 3 (if we put R in position 5) OR 2 and 5 (if we put R in position 3).

 Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more common letters to gather more information.

 Common letters to test: perhaps vowels like 'O', 'I', 'U'? But note, we have position 3 open if we put R at 5? Actually, structure:

 Option 1: C X Y N R   (with Y being position 3, and R at 5)
 Option 2: C X R N Y   (with R at position 3, Y at 5)

 We need a word that satisfies C _ _ N _ and has an 'R' in either the 3rd or 5th position.

 Also, we don't know the middle letters. We should try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

 Previous guess used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know A and E are out.

 We are allowed to reuse letters that are known to be in the word? But caution: we know 'R' is present, so we can use it again.

 However, for maximizing information, we should try to use new letters for the unknown positions.

 So for position 2: we can try a vowel? But A and E are out, so try 'O', 'I', 'U'? Or a consonant?

 Also, we need to consider common 5-letter words that start with C and end with N? Actually, the pattern is: C ? ? N ? 

 We have two unknown positions: 2 and 3 (if R is at 5) or 2 and 5 (if R is at 3).

 Since we don't know which position R is in, we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to make one word.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that doesn't necessarily include R? But note: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it to confirm its position? However, the rules don't require us to include all known letters in every guess? But not including R would be wasting an opportunity to pin its location.

 However, we have limited tries, so we want to get both the position of R and test new letters.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have N at the fourth position.

 Some words:
 - ""crown"": C R O W N -> positions: C at 1, R at 2, O at 3, W at 4? No, N must be at position 4. So this would be C R O ? N? Actually, ""crown"" is C-R-O-W-N, so N is at position 5? Not matching: we need N at position 4.

 We need words with N at position 4: so the word is of the form: C X Y N Z.

 Possible words:
 Option: ""CHIN?"": CHIN? but ""CHIN"" is 4 letters. So 5-letter words: 
 - ""CHINA"": but ""A"" is ruled out? We know 'A' is absent. So we cannot use ""CHINA"" because it has an 'A'.

 Other possibilities: 
 - ""CORN?"": but ""CORN"" is 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""CORNS""? But ""S"" would be the last letter. But note: we don't know if plural words are allowed? Since it's Wordle-like, typically plurals are allowed? But let's assume valid English words: ""corny"" (meaning sentimental) has the pattern? ""corny"": C-O-R-N-Y -> C at 1, O at 2, R at 3, N at 4, Y at 5.

 But note: we know that 'R' must be in the word, but we think it might be at position 3? Then in ""corny"", we have R at position 3. Also, we haven't tested O and Y.

 However, we have to make a guess that fits the constraints.

 Other words: ""cabin"", but 'a' is out. ""cumin"", but 'u' is not tested and 'i'? But wait: ""cumin"": C at 1, U at 2, M at 3, I at 4? No, N must be at position 4. ""cumin"" is C-U-M-I-N -> so position 4 is I? Not N.

 We need N at the fourth position.

 Let me list words that start with C and have N at position 4:
 - ""cairn"" (a pile of stones): but it has an 'A', which is out and 'I'? 
 - ""chain"": but has 'A' and 'H'? And N at position 4? ""chain"": C-H-A-I-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> no, position 5 is N.

 The pattern is _ , _ , _ , N , _ : so the fourth letter is N.

 Words: 
 - ""corny"": C O R N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y -> matches pattern? But note: we have R at position 3. But we must remember that R cannot be at position 2? Yes. Position 3 is allowed.

 Alternate: without R at 3? For example, ""colon"": C O L O N -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> wait, position 4 is O? Not N. 

 Another: ""clink"": C L I N K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:K -> and note: we haven't ruled out L, I, K.

 But does it contain R? No, because R is known to be in the word? So if we guess ""clink"", we wouldn't have R? But we know the word must have R (from the feedback). So we cannot guess a word without R? Or we could? But if we do and the feedback shows R is missing, that would be inconsistent? Actually, we know R is present because of the '-' in the first guess? So the word must have R.

 Therefore, our guess must include R? Not necessarily? We know R is in the answer, so if we don't include R in a guess, then the feedback would show 'x' for that position? But we can still get information about other letters.

 However, we are trying to find the position of R. So including R can help us find where it is.

 But in ""clink"", there is no R, so we cannot test R. Moreover, we know R is in the word, so guessing without R doesn't help us locate R.

 Therefore, we should include R.

 Let's try words that fit C _ R N _ ? Then the word would be C ? R N ? 

 Because we know R must be either position 3 or 5? But if we put R at position 3, that's one possibility.

 Example: ""chirn"": not a common word? Or ""cairn"": has A -> out.

 Common words: ""crony"": C R O N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that R was in the wrong position and specifically not in position 2. Now in this word, R is at position 2? So we cannot use it because R cannot be at position 2? The feedback said position 2 of the first guess (which was R) was wrong? So R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 in our new guess.

 Therefore, ""crony"" (with R at 2) is not allowed? Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback already told us that position 2 is not R? Meaning that the R in the secret word is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our guess, then:

 - If the secret word has R at position 2? But it can't because we were told R is not in position 2. Therefore, we would see a '-' again (or might it be different?)?

 But note: the secret word does not have R at position 2, so if we put R at position 2 in a guess, it must be marked as absent (if there's no other R?) or present but wrong position if there's another R? Actually, no: because we know the secret word has one R? Or we don't know if there are multiple R? The feedback doesn't specify.

 Therefore, we can avoid using R at position 2 because we know it's incorrect? But to test other positions, we can choose to put R at position 3 or 5.

 Let's try to form words with R in position 3 or 5.

 Option: R at position 3: pattern C _ R N _

 Words: ""curtn""? Not a word. ""burn"" is 4 letters. 

 What about ""churn"": C H U R N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U? Wait, no: ""churn"" is C-H-U-R-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> but that has R at position 4? But we need N at position 4? Conflict? In ""churn"", position 4 is R and position 5 is N? Not matching: we need position 4 to be N.

 So we need position 4 to be N? Then for the word to have N at position 4, if we also have R in the word at a different position.

 How about: C ? ? N R? Then pattern: C ? ? N R

 Example: ""cater""? But has E? We know E is absent. Also, position 4 must be N? ""cater"" is C-A-T-E-R -> position 4 is E? Not N.

 Alternatively: ""cider"": C I D E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N? ... 

 Another: ""liner""? Not C. We need first letter C.

 Words: ""co?n?"", with one of the ? being R? How about ""corny"" we considered earlier? But it has R at position 2 which we want to avoid? Actually, we decided to avoid position 2.

 But note: if we put R at position 5? Then pattern: C ? ? N R

 What words? ""cyn?r""? I can't think. ""cyber""?: C Y B E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N.

 This seems difficult. Maybe I'm missing a word.

 Alternatively: we put R at position 3: then pattern: C ? R N ?

 Then the word has: position 1: C, position 2: ?, position 3: R, position 4: N, position 5: ?

 And that letter for position 2 cannot be 'A' or 'E'.

 Examples: ""born"" is 4 letters? ""cairn"" has A? ""carn?"": ""carne"" has E? ""carns""? not common? ""corns"": C O R N S -> C(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5). 

 But ""corns""? But note: the feedback told us that in the first guess, R was present but not at position 2? Now if we put R at position 3, that might be correct? And O is a new letter? And S?

 Also, we haven't tested O or S? So this word would test O and S.

 But what about 'corns'? It's the plural of 'corn'. Assuming plurals are allowed.

 Alternatively: ""curnt""? Not a word? Or ""burnt""? Not starting with C.

 Another word: ""crimp""? But that has five letters: C-R-I-M-R? Wait, no: ""crimp"": C R I M P -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:P -> no position 4 is not N? 

 We need position 4 to be N.

 So ""corns"" fits: C O R N S -> O at 2, R at 3, N at 4.

 It does not have A or E? And includes R at position 3? Which is allowed.

 But wait: we know from first guess: R was not at position 2? But now we are putting R at position 3? That might be correct? Also, O and S are new.

 Alternatively: ""crown"" doesn't fit? Because N at 5? Another: ""crone"": C R O N E -> but E is absent? And we know E is absent? In ""crone"", last letter E? But we know E is absent, so we cannot use words with E.

 So ""corns"" is acceptable.

 What other words? ""urn"" not C? ""cabin"" no? ""cumin"" no? 

 Another option: R at position 5: pattern C ? ? N R? What word? ""chain"" no? ""chink"": C, H, I, N, K -> no R? Doesn't include R? Then we must put R in position 5? How about ""con?r"": ""con"" words? ""cone"" has E? etc.

 Hard: I think ""corns"" is a valid choice.

 But let me confirm: ""corns"" -> positions: 
 - C is at 1 -> should be ✓ (since we know position 1 is C) 
 - R is at 3 -> but we don't know if that's correct? We are guessing R at 3? 
 - O is at 2?  
 - N at 4 -> should be ✓ 
 - S at 5.

 Also, we have an O at position 2? We haven't tested O? So we can get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has different new letters? But we have to include R? Because we know R is in the word? Or? Actually, we don't have to include R? But if we don't, then the feedback might not tell us the position? But we can infer? For example, if we guess a word without R and the feedback doesn't show R? Then it's not present? But we know it is present? So that would be inconsistent? Actually, the word must have R? So if we guess a word without R, we would get an 'x' for R? But we'd actually get feedback for each letter? 

 However, to save tries, including R and testing it in position 3 is useful? Since we know R isn't at 2, and we are testing at 3? If it turns out to be at position 3, we hit? If not, then we know R must be at position 5? Because those are the only options? Actually, position 5 is the other possibility.

 So if this guess doesn't have R at position 3 marked as correct, then R must be at position 5.

 Therefore, I choose ""corns"". Let's hope it's an accepted word? Or consider another word?

 What about ""curin""? Not a word? 

 Another word: ""cairn"" has A? Not allowed? ""cabin"" same? 

 Another: ""cronk""? Not common? ""cornu""? Not common? 

 So ""corns"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have the constraint that the word must be in the word list? We assume ""corns"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""corns""
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(✓): The first letter is confirmed as ""C"".
- R(-): ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x): ""A"" is absent from the word.
- N(✓): The fourth letter is confirmed as ""N"".
- E(x): ""E"" is absent from the word.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"" and has ""N"" as the fourth letter: C _ _ N _.
- ""R"" must be in either position 3 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out).
- ""A"" and ""E"" are not in the word, so they should be avoided.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word starting with ""C"", ending with a letter in the fifth position, with ""N"" in the fourth position, and containing ""R"" in position 3 or 5. Valid words include:
- Position 3 for ""R"": Words like ""corns"", ""curin"" (rare), or ""chirn"" (rare).
- Position 5 for ""R"": Words like ""cinır"" (obscure) or unconventional spellings.

The most common valid word fitting this pattern is **""corns""**:
- C (position 1): Confirmed ✓
- O (position 2): New letter to test.
- R (position 3): Tests if ""R"" belongs here.
- N (position 4): Confirmed ✓
- S (position 5): New letter to test.

This guess efficiently focuses on the unknown positions (2, 3, and 5) and includes ""R"" in a plausible position while avoiding unsafe letters.

<guess>corns</guess>",corns,"We received feedback for ""crane"": C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
 - 'C' is in the correct position (position 1).
 - 'R' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
 - 'A' is not in the word.
 - 'N' is in the correct position (position 4).
 - 'E' is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'C' in position 1 and 'N' in position 4.
 - The secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in position 2.
 - The letters 'A' and 'E' are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: C _ _ N _

 We also know that 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So it can be in position 3 or 5.

 Additionally, we need to avoid using 'A' and 'E' in our next guess.

 We must also consider that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Since positions 1 and 4 are fixed as 'C' and 'N', and we need to place 'R' in either position 3 or 5, let's think of possibilities.

 Structure: C _ ? N ? 
 Where one of the ? must be 'R', and the other is a new letter.

 But note: the feedback told us that 'R' is present but not in position 2. So the second letter is still unknown and cannot be 'R'.

 Let's list possible letters for the second position: it cannot be 'A', 'E', or 'R' (because if it were 'R', it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in position 2, if it were 'R', it might be marked as present and correct if that's where it belongs? But here we know that 'R' is not in position 2 because it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, wait: the feedback for position 2 was 'R' and it got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 2.

 So for the second position, we need to pick a letter that is not 'A', 'E', and also not a letter we know isn't present. We only know about 'A' and 'E' being absent so far.

 We can use other vowels or consonants.

 Also note: we have two open positions: 2 and 3 (if we put R in position 5) OR 2 and 5 (if we put R in position 3).

 Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more common letters to gather more information.

 Common letters to test: perhaps vowels like 'O', 'I', 'U'? But note, we have position 3 open if we put R at 5? Actually, structure:

 Option 1: C X Y N R   (with Y being position 3, and R at 5)
 Option 2: C X R N Y   (with R at position 3, Y at 5)

 We need a word that satisfies C _ _ N _ and has an 'R' in either the 3rd or 5th position.

 Also, we don't know the middle letters. We should try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

 Previous guess used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know A and E are out.

 We are allowed to reuse letters that are known to be in the word? But caution: we know 'R' is present, so we can use it again.

 However, for maximizing information, we should try to use new letters for the unknown positions.

 So for position 2: we can try a vowel? But A and E are out, so try 'O', 'I', 'U'? Or a consonant?

 Also, we need to consider common 5-letter words that start with C and end with N? Actually, the pattern is: C ? ? N ? 

 We have two unknown positions: 2 and 3 (if R is at 5) or 2 and 5 (if R is at 3).

 Since we don't know which position R is in, we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to make one word.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that doesn't necessarily include R? But note: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it to confirm its position? However, the rules don't require us to include all known letters in every guess? But not including R would be wasting an opportunity to pin its location.

 However, we have limited tries, so we want to get both the position of R and test new letters.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have N at the fourth position.

 Some words:
 - ""crown"": C R O W N -> positions: C at 1, R at 2, O at 3, W at 4? No, N must be at position 4. So this would be C R O ? N? Actually, ""crown"" is C-R-O-W-N, so N is at position 5? Not matching: we need N at position 4.

 We need words with N at position 4: so the word is of the form: C X Y N Z.

 Possible words:
 Option: ""CHIN?"": CHIN? but ""CHIN"" is 4 letters. So 5-letter words: 
 - ""CHINA"": but ""A"" is ruled out? We know 'A' is absent. So we cannot use ""CHINA"" because it has an 'A'.

 Other possibilities: 
 - ""CORN?"": but ""CORN"" is 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""CORNS""? But ""S"" would be the last letter. But note: we don't know if plural words are allowed? Since it's Wordle-like, typically plurals are allowed? But let's assume valid English words: ""corny"" (meaning sentimental) has the pattern? ""corny"": C-O-R-N-Y -> C at 1, O at 2, R at 3, N at 4, Y at 5.

 But note: we know that 'R' must be in the word, but we think it might be at position 3? Then in ""corny"", we have R at position 3. Also, we haven't tested O and Y.

 However, we have to make a guess that fits the constraints.

 Other words: ""cabin"", but 'a' is out. ""cumin"", but 'u' is not tested and 'i'? But wait: ""cumin"": C at 1, U at 2, M at 3, I at 4? No, N must be at position 4. ""cumin"" is C-U-M-I-N -> so position 4 is I? Not N.

 We need N at the fourth position.

 Let me list words that start with C and have N at position 4:
 - ""cairn"" (a pile of stones): but it has an 'A', which is out and 'I'? 
 - ""chain"": but has 'A' and 'H'? And N at position 4? ""chain"": C-H-A-I-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> no, position 5 is N.

 The pattern is _ , _ , _ , N , _ : so the fourth letter is N.

 Words: 
 - ""corny"": C O R N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y -> matches pattern? But note: we have R at position 3. But we must remember that R cannot be at position 2? Yes. Position 3 is allowed.

 Alternate: without R at 3? For example, ""colon"": C O L O N -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> wait, position 4 is O? Not N. 

 Another: ""clink"": C L I N K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:K -> and note: we haven't ruled out L, I, K.

 But does it contain R? No, because R is known to be in the word? So if we guess ""clink"", we wouldn't have R? But we know the word must have R (from the feedback). So we cannot guess a word without R? Or we could? But if we do and the feedback shows R is missing, that would be inconsistent? Actually, we know R is present because of the '-' in the first guess? So the word must have R.

 Therefore, our guess must include R? Not necessarily? We know R is in the answer, so if we don't include R in a guess, then the feedback would show 'x' for that position? But we can still get information about other letters.

 However, we are trying to find the position of R. So including R can help us find where it is.

 But in ""clink"", there is no R, so we cannot test R. Moreover, we know R is in the word, so guessing without R doesn't help us locate R.

 Therefore, we should include R.

 Let's try words that fit C _ R N _ ? Then the word would be C ? R N ? 

 Because we know R must be either position 3 or 5? But if we put R at position 3, that's one possibility.

 Example: ""chirn"": not a common word? Or ""cairn"": has A -> out.

 Common words: ""crony"": C R O N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that R was in the wrong position and specifically not in position 2. Now in this word, R is at position 2? So we cannot use it because R cannot be at position 2? The feedback said position 2 of the first guess (which was R) was wrong? So R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 in our new guess.

 Therefore, ""crony"" (with R at 2) is not allowed? Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback already told us that position 2 is not R? Meaning that the R in the secret word is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our guess, then:

 - If the secret word has R at position 2? But it can't because we were told R is not in position 2. Therefore, we would see a '-' again (or might it be different?)?

 But note: the secret word does not have R at position 2, so if we put R at position 2 in a guess, it must be marked as absent (if there's no other R?) or present but wrong position if there's another R? Actually, no: because we know the secret word has one R? Or we don't know if there are multiple R? The feedback doesn't specify.

 Therefore, we can avoid using R at position 2 because we know it's incorrect? But to test other positions, we can choose to put R at position 3 or 5.

 Let's try to form words with R in position 3 or 5.

 Option: R at position 3: pattern C _ R N _

 Words: ""curtn""? Not a word. ""burn"" is 4 letters. 

 What about ""churn"": C H U R N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U? Wait, no: ""churn"" is C-H-U-R-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> but that has R at position 4? But we need N at position 4? Conflict? In ""churn"", position 4 is R and position 5 is N? Not matching: we need position 4 to be N.

 So we need position 4 to be N? Then for the word to have N at position 4, if we also have R in the word at a different position.

 How about: C ? ? N R? Then pattern: C ? ? N R

 Example: ""cater""? But has E? We know E is absent. Also, position 4 must be N? ""cater"" is C-A-T-E-R -> position 4 is E? Not N.

 Alternatively: ""cider"": C I D E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N? ... 

 Another: ""liner""? Not C. We need first letter C.

 Words: ""co?n?"", with one of the ? being R? How about ""corny"" we considered earlier? But it has R at position 2 which we want to avoid? Actually, we decided to avoid position 2.

 But note: if we put R at position 5? Then pattern: C ? ? N R

 What words? ""cyn?r""? I can't think. ""cyber""?: C Y B E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N.

 This seems difficult. Maybe I'm missing a word.

 Alternatively: we put R at position 3: then pattern: C ? R N ?

 Then the word has: position 1: C, position 2: ?, position 3: R, position 4: N, position 5: ?

 And that letter for position 2 cannot be 'A' or 'E'.

 Examples: ""born"" is 4 letters? ""cairn"" has A? ""carn?"": ""carne"" has E? ""carns""? not common? ""corns"": C O R N S -> C(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5). 

 But ""corns""? But note: the feedback told us that in the first guess, R was present but not at position 2? Now if we put R at position 3, that might be correct? And O is a new letter? And S?

 Also, we haven't tested O or S? So this word would test O and S.

 But what about 'corns'? It's the plural of 'corn'. Assuming plurals are allowed.

 Alternatively: ""curnt""? Not a word? Or ""burnt""? Not starting with C.

 Another word: ""crimp""? But that has five letters: C-R-I-M-R? Wait, no: ""crimp"": C R I M P -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:P -> no position 4 is not N? 

 We need position 4 to be N.

 So ""corns"" fits: C O R N S -> O at 2, R at 3, N at 4.

 It does not have A or E? And includes R at position 3? Which is allowed.

 But wait: we know from first guess: R was not at position 2? But now we are putting R at position 3? That might be correct? Also, O and S are new.

 Alternatively: ""crown"" doesn't fit? Because N at 5? Another: ""crone"": C R O N E -> but E is absent? And we know E is absent? In ""crone"", last letter E? But we know E is absent, so we cannot use words with E.

 So ""corns"" is acceptable.

 What other words? ""urn"" not C? ""cabin"" no? ""cumin"" no? 

 Another option: R at position 5: pattern C ? ? N R? What word? ""chain"" no? ""chink"": C, H, I, N, K -> no R? Doesn't include R? Then we must put R in position 5? How about ""con?r"": ""con"" words? ""cone"" has E? etc.

 Hard: I think ""corns"" is a valid choice.

 But let me confirm: ""corns"" -> positions: 
 - C is at 1 -> should be ✓ (since we know position 1 is C) 
 - R is at 3 -> but we don't know if that's correct? We are guessing R at 3? 
 - O is at 2?  
 - N at 4 -> should be ✓ 
 - S at 5.

 Also, we have an O at position 2? We haven't tested O? So we can get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has different new letters? But we have to include R? Because we know R is in the word? Or? Actually, we don't have to include R? But if we don't, then the feedback might not tell us the position? But we can infer? For example, if we guess a word without R and the feedback doesn't show R? Then it's not present? But we know it is present? So that would be inconsistent? Actually, the word must have R? So if we guess a word without R, we would get an 'x' for R? But we'd actually get feedback for each letter? 

 However, to save tries, including R and testing it in position 3 is useful? Since we know R isn't at 2, and we are testing at 3? If it turns out to be at position 3, we hit? If not, then we know R must be at position 5? Because those are the only options? Actually, position 5 is the other possibility.

 So if this guess doesn't have R at position 3 marked as correct, then R must be at position 5.

 Therefore, I choose ""corns"". Let's hope it's an accepted word? Or consider another word?

 What about ""curin""? Not a word? 

 Another word: ""cairn"" has A? Not allowed? ""cabin"" same? 

 Another: ""cronk""? Not common? ""cornu""? Not common? 

 So ""corns"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have the constraint that the word must be in the word list? We assume ""corns"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""corns""Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(✓): The first letter is confirmed as ""C"".
- R(-): ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x): ""A"" is absent from the word.
- N(✓): The fourth letter is confirmed as ""N"".
- E(x): ""E"" is absent from the word.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"" and has ""N"" as the fourth letter: C _ _ N _.
- ""R"" must be in either position 3 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out).
- ""A"" and ""E"" are not in the word, so they should be avoided.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word starting with ""C"", ending with a letter in the fifth position, with ""N"" in the fourth position, and containing ""R"" in position 3 or 5. Valid words include:
- Position 3 for ""R"": Words like ""corns"", ""curin"" (rare), or ""chirn"" (rare).
- Position 5 for ""R"": Words like ""cinır"" (obscure) or unconventional spellings.

The most common valid word fitting this pattern is **""corns""**:
- C (position 1): Confirmed ✓
- O (position 2): New letter to test.
- R (position 3): Tests if ""R"" belongs here.
- N (position 4): Confirmed ✓
- S (position 5): New letter to test.

This guess efficiently focuses on the unknown positions (2, 3, and 5) and includes ""R"" in a plausible position while avoiding unsafe letters.",Guess 2: corns -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CORNY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. 
 This word has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N), which are common.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I'm starting with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it contains common letters: two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). This combination helps test frequent letters in the alphabet, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback about which letters are present and their positions. Since we have no prior clues, this balanced approach maximizes information gain.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for ""crane"": C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
 - 'C' is in the correct position (position 1).
 - 'R' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
 - 'A' is not in the word.
 - 'N' is in the correct position (position 4).
 - 'E' is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'C' in position 1 and 'N' in position 4.
 - The secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in position 2.
 - The letters 'A' and 'E' are absent.

 Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: C _ _ N _

 We also know that 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So it can be in position 3 or 5.

 Additionally, we need to avoid using 'A' and 'E' in our next guess.

 We must also consider that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Since positions 1 and 4 are fixed as 'C' and 'N', and we need to place 'R' in either position 3 or 5, let's think of possibilities.

 Structure: C _ ? N ? 
 Where one of the ? must be 'R', and the other is a new letter.

 But note: the feedback told us that 'R' is present but not in position 2. So the second letter is still unknown and cannot be 'R'.

 Let's list possible letters for the second position: it cannot be 'A', 'E', or 'R' (because if it were 'R', it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in position 2, if it were 'R', it might be marked as present and correct if that's where it belongs? But here we know that 'R' is not in position 2 because it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, wait: the feedback for position 2 was 'R' and it got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 2.

 So for the second position, we need to pick a letter that is not 'A', 'E', and also not a letter we know isn't present. We only know about 'A' and 'E' being absent so far.

 We can use other vowels or consonants.

 Also note: we have two open positions: 2 and 3 (if we put R in position 5) OR 2 and 5 (if we put R in position 3).

 Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more common letters to gather more information.

 Common letters to test: perhaps vowels like 'O', 'I', 'U'? But note, we have position 3 open if we put R at 5? Actually, structure:

 Option 1: C X Y N R   (with Y being position 3, and R at 5)
 Option 2: C X R N Y   (with R at position 3, Y at 5)

 We need a word that satisfies C _ _ N _ and has an 'R' in either the 3rd or 5th position.

 Also, we don't know the middle letters. We should try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

 Previous guess used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know A and E are out.

 We are allowed to reuse letters that are known to be in the word? But caution: we know 'R' is present, so we can use it again.

 However, for maximizing information, we should try to use new letters for the unknown positions.

 So for position 2: we can try a vowel? But A and E are out, so try 'O', 'I', 'U'? Or a consonant?

 Also, we need to consider common 5-letter words that start with C and end with N? Actually, the pattern is: C ? ? N ? 

 We have two unknown positions: 2 and 3 (if R is at 5) or 2 and 5 (if R is at 3).

 Since we don't know which position R is in, we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to make one word.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that doesn't necessarily include R? But note: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it to confirm its position? However, the rules don't require us to include all known letters in every guess? But not including R would be wasting an opportunity to pin its location.

 However, we have limited tries, so we want to get both the position of R and test new letters.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have N at the fourth position.

 Some words:
 - ""crown"": C R O W N -> positions: C at 1, R at 2, O at 3, W at 4? No, N must be at position 4. So this would be C R O ? N? Actually, ""crown"" is C-R-O-W-N, so N is at position 5? Not matching: we need N at position 4.

 We need words with N at position 4: so the word is of the form: C X Y N Z.

 Possible words:
 Option: ""CHIN?"": CHIN? but ""CHIN"" is 4 letters. So 5-letter words: 
 - ""CHINA"": but ""A"" is ruled out? We know 'A' is absent. So we cannot use ""CHINA"" because it has an 'A'.

 Other possibilities: 
 - ""CORN?"": but ""CORN"" is 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""CORNS""? But ""S"" would be the last letter. But note: we don't know if plural words are allowed? Since it's Wordle-like, typically plurals are allowed? But let's assume valid English words: ""corny"" (meaning sentimental) has the pattern? ""corny"": C-O-R-N-Y -> C at 1, O at 2, R at 3, N at 4, Y at 5.

 But note: we know that 'R' must be in the word, but we think it might be at position 3? Then in ""corny"", we have R at position 3. Also, we haven't tested O and Y.

 However, we have to make a guess that fits the constraints.

 Other words: ""cabin"", but 'a' is out. ""cumin"", but 'u' is not tested and 'i'? But wait: ""cumin"": C at 1, U at 2, M at 3, I at 4? No, N must be at position 4. ""cumin"" is C-U-M-I-N -> so position 4 is I? Not N.

 We need N at the fourth position.

 Let me list words that start with C and have N at position 4:
 - ""cairn"" (a pile of stones): but it has an 'A', which is out and 'I'? 
 - ""chain"": but has 'A' and 'H'? And N at position 4? ""chain"": C-H-A-I-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> no, position 5 is N.

 The pattern is _ , _ , _ , N , _ : so the fourth letter is N.

 Words: 
 - ""corny"": C O R N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y -> matches pattern? But note: we have R at position 3. But we must remember that R cannot be at position 2? Yes. Position 3 is allowed.

 Alternate: without R at 3? For example, ""colon"": C O L O N -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> wait, position 4 is O? Not N. 

 Another: ""clink"": C L I N K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:K -> and note: we haven't ruled out L, I, K.

 But does it contain R? No, because R is known to be in the word? So if we guess ""clink"", we wouldn't have R? But we know the word must have R (from the feedback). So we cannot guess a word without R? Or we could? But if we do and the feedback shows R is missing, that would be inconsistent? Actually, we know R is present because of the '-' in the first guess? So the word must have R.

 Therefore, our guess must include R? Not necessarily? We know R is in the answer, so if we don't include R in a guess, then the feedback would show 'x' for that position? But we can still get information about other letters.

 However, we are trying to find the position of R. So including R can help us find where it is.

 But in ""clink"", there is no R, so we cannot test R. Moreover, we know R is in the word, so guessing without R doesn't help us locate R.

 Therefore, we should include R.

 Let's try words that fit C _ R N _ ? Then the word would be C ? R N ? 

 Because we know R must be either position 3 or 5? But if we put R at position 3, that's one possibility.

 Example: ""chirn"": not a common word? Or ""cairn"": has A -> out.

 Common words: ""crony"": C R O N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that R was in the wrong position and specifically not in position 2. Now in this word, R is at position 2? So we cannot use it because R cannot be at position 2? The feedback said position 2 of the first guess (which was R) was wrong? So R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 in our new guess.

 Therefore, ""crony"" (with R at 2) is not allowed? Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback already told us that position 2 is not R? Meaning that the R in the secret word is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our guess, then:

 - If the secret word has R at position 2? But it can't because we were told R is not in position 2. Therefore, we would see a '-' again (or might it be different?)?

 But note: the secret word does not have R at position 2, so if we put R at position 2 in a guess, it must be marked as absent (if there's no other R?) or present but wrong position if there's another R? Actually, no: because we know the secret word has one R? Or we don't know if there are multiple R? The feedback doesn't specify.

 Therefore, we can avoid using R at position 2 because we know it's incorrect? But to test other positions, we can choose to put R at position 3 or 5.

 Let's try to form words with R in position 3 or 5.

 Option: R at position 3: pattern C _ R N _

 Words: ""curtn""? Not a word. ""burn"" is 4 letters. 

 What about ""churn"": C H U R N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U? Wait, no: ""churn"" is C-H-U-R-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> but that has R at position 4? But we need N at position 4? Conflict? In ""churn"", position 4 is R and position 5 is N? Not matching: we need position 4 to be N.

 So we need position 4 to be N? Then for the word to have N at position 4, if we also have R in the word at a different position.

 How about: C ? ? N R? Then pattern: C ? ? N R

 Example: ""cater""? But has E? We know E is absent. Also, position 4 must be N? ""cater"" is C-A-T-E-R -> position 4 is E? Not N.

 Alternatively: ""cider"": C I D E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N? ... 

 Another: ""liner""? Not C. We need first letter C.

 Words: ""co?n?"", with one of the ? being R? How about ""corny"" we considered earlier? But it has R at position 2 which we want to avoid? Actually, we decided to avoid position 2.

 But note: if we put R at position 5? Then pattern: C ? ? N R

 What words? ""cyn?r""? I can't think. ""cyber""?: C Y B E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N.

 This seems difficult. Maybe I'm missing a word.

 Alternatively: we put R at position 3: then pattern: C ? R N ?

 Then the word has: position 1: C, position 2: ?, position 3: R, position 4: N, position 5: ?

 And that letter for position 2 cannot be 'A' or 'E'.

 Examples: ""born"" is 4 letters? ""cairn"" has A? ""carn?"": ""carne"" has E? ""carns""? not common? ""corns"": C O R N S -> C(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5). 

 But ""corns""? But note: the feedback told us that in the first guess, R was present but not at position 2? Now if we put R at position 3, that might be correct? And O is a new letter? And S?

 Also, we haven't tested O or S? So this word would test O and S.

 But what about 'corns'? It's the plural of 'corn'. Assuming plurals are allowed.

 Alternatively: ""curnt""? Not a word? Or ""burnt""? Not starting with C.

 Another word: ""crimp""? But that has five letters: C-R-I-M-R? Wait, no: ""crimp"": C R I M P -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:P -> no position 4 is not N? 

 We need position 4 to be N.

 So ""corns"" fits: C O R N S -> O at 2, R at 3, N at 4.

 It does not have A or E? And includes R at position 3? Which is allowed.

 But wait: we know from first guess: R was not at position 2? But now we are putting R at position 3? That might be correct? Also, O and S are new.

 Alternatively: ""crown"" doesn't fit? Because N at 5? Another: ""crone"": C R O N E -> but E is absent? And we know E is absent? In ""crone"", last letter E? But we know E is absent, so we cannot use words with E.

 So ""corns"" is acceptable.

 What other words? ""urn"" not C? ""cabin"" no? ""cumin"" no? 

 Another option: R at position 5: pattern C ? ? N R? What word? ""chain"" no? ""chink"": C, H, I, N, K -> no R? Doesn't include R? Then we must put R in position 5? How about ""con?r"": ""con"" words? ""cone"" has E? etc.

 Hard: I think ""corns"" is a valid choice.

 But let me confirm: ""corns"" -> positions: 
 - C is at 1 -> should be ✓ (since we know position 1 is C) 
 - R is at 3 -> but we don't know if that's correct? We are guessing R at 3? 
 - O is at 2?  
 - N at 4 -> should be ✓ 
 - S at 5.

 Also, we have an O at position 2? We haven't tested O? So we can get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has different new letters? But we have to include R? Because we know R is in the word? Or? Actually, we don't have to include R? But if we don't, then the feedback might not tell us the position? But we can infer? For example, if we guess a word without R and the feedback doesn't show R? Then it's not present? But we know it is present? So that would be inconsistent? Actually, the word must have R? So if we guess a word without R, we would get an 'x' for R? But we'd actually get feedback for each letter? 

 However, to save tries, including R and testing it in position 3 is useful? Since we know R isn't at 2, and we are testing at 3? If it turns out to be at position 3, we hit? If not, then we know R must be at position 5? Because those are the only options? Actually, position 5 is the other possibility.

 So if this guess doesn't have R at position 3 marked as correct, then R must be at position 5.

 Therefore, I choose ""corns"". Let's hope it's an accepted word? Or consider another word?

 What about ""curin""? Not a word? 

 Another word: ""cairn"" has A? Not allowed? ""cabin"" same? 

 Another: ""cronk""? Not common? ""cornu""? Not common? 

 So ""corns"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have the constraint that the word must be in the word list? We assume ""corns"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""corns""Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(✓): The first letter is confirmed as ""C"".
- R(-): ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x): ""A"" is absent from the word.
- N(✓): The fourth letter is confirmed as ""N"".
- E(x): ""E"" is absent from the word.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"" and has ""N"" as the fourth letter: C _ _ N _.
- ""R"" must be in either position 3 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out).
- ""A"" and ""E"" are not in the word, so they should be avoided.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word starting with ""C"", ending with a letter in the fifth position, with ""N"" in the fourth position, and containing ""R"" in position 3 or 5. Valid words include:
- Position 3 for ""R"": Words like ""corns"", ""curin"" (rare), or ""chirn"" (rare).
- Position 5 for ""R"": Words like ""cinır"" (obscure) or unconventional spellings.

The most common valid word fitting this pattern is **""corns""**:
- C (position 1): Confirmed ✓
- O (position 2): New letter to test.
- R (position 3): Tests if ""R"" belongs here.
- N (position 4): Confirmed ✓
- S (position 5): New letter to test.

This guess efficiently focuses on the unknown positions (2, 3, and 5) and includes ""R"" in a plausible position while avoiding unsafe letters.

So it can be in position 3 or 5.\n\n Additionally, we need to avoid using \'A\' and \'E\' in our next guess.\n\n We must also consider that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\n Since positions 1 and 4 are fixed as \'C\' and \'N\', and we need to place \'R\' in either position 3 or 5, let\'s think of possibilities.\n\n Structure: C _ ? N ? \n Where one of the ? must be \'R\', and the other is a new letter.\n\n But note: the feedback told us that \'R\' is present but not in position 2. So the second letter is still unknown and cannot be \'R\'.\n\n Let\'s list possible letters for the second position: it cannot be \'A\', \'E\', or \'R\' (because if it were \'R\', it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in position 2, if it were \'R\', it might be marked as present and correct if that\'s where it belongs? But here we know that \'R\' is not in position 2 because it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, wait: the feedback for position 2 was \'R\' and it got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 2.\n\n So for the second position, we need to pick a letter that is not \'A\', \'E\', and also not a letter we know isn\'t present. We only know about \'A\' and \'E\' being absent so far.\n\n We can use other vowels or consonants.\n\n Also note: we have two open positions: 2 and 3 (if we put R in position 5) OR 2 and 5 (if we put R in position 3).\n\n Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more common letters to gather more information.\n\n Common letters to test: perhaps vowels like \'O\', \'I\', \'U\'? But note, we have position 3 open if we put R at 5? Actually, structure:\n\n Option 1: C X Y N R   (with Y being position 3, and R at 5)\n Option 2: C X R N Y   (with R at position 3, Y at 5)\n\n We need a word that satisfies C _ _ N _ and has an \'R\' in either the 3rd or 5th position.\n\n Also, we don\'t know the middle letters. We should try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet to get more information.\n\n Previous guess used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know A and E are out.\n\n We are allowed to reuse letters that are known to be in the word? But caution: we know \'R\' is present, so we can use it again.\n\n However, for maximizing information, we should try to use new letters for the unknown positions.\n\n So for position 2: we can try a vowel? But A and E are out, so try \'O\', \'I\', \'U\'? Or a consonant?\n\n Also, we need to consider common 5-letter words that start with C and end with N? Actually, the pattern is: C ? ? N ? \n\n We have two unknown positions: 2 and 3 (if R is at 5) or 2 and 5 (if R is at 3).\n\n Since we don\'t know which position R is in, we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to make one word.\n\n Alternatively, we can make a guess that doesn\'t necessarily include R? But note: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it to confirm its position? However, the rules don\'t require us to include all known letters in every guess? But not including R would be wasting an opportunity to pin its location.\n\n However, we have limited tries, so we want to get both the position of R and test new letters.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have N at the fourth position.\n\n Some words:\n - ""crown"": C R O W N -> positions: C at 1, R at 2, O at 3, W at 4? No, N must be at position 4. So this would be C R O ? N? Actually, ""crown"" is C-R-O-W-N, so N is at position 5? Not matching: we need N at position 4.\n\n We need words with N at position 4: so the word is of the form: C X Y N Z.\n\n Possible words:\n Option: ""CHIN?"": CHIN? but ""CHIN"" is 4 letters. So 5-letter words: \n - ""CHINA"": but ""A"" is ruled out? We know \'A\' is absent. So we cannot use ""CHINA"" because it has an \'A\'.\n\n Other possibilities: \n - ""CORN?"": but ""CORN"" is 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""CORNS""? But ""S"" would be the last letter. But note: we don\'t know if plural words are allowed? Since it\'s Wordle-like, typically plurals are allowed? But let\'s assume valid English words: ""corny"" (meaning sentimental) has the pattern? ""corny"": C-O-R-N-Y -> C at 1, O at 2, R at 3, N at 4, Y at 5.\n\n But note: we know that \'R\' must be in the word, but we think it might be at position 3? Then in ""corny"", we have R at position 3. Also, we haven\'t tested O and Y.\n\n However, we have to make a guess that fits the constraints.\n\n Other words: ""cabin"", but \'a\' is out. ""cumin"", but \'u\' is not tested and \'i\'? But wait: ""cumin"": C at 1, U at 2, M at 3, I at 4? No, N must be at position 4. ""cumin"" is C-U-M-I-N -> so position 4 is I? Not N.\n\n We need N at the fourth position.\n\n Let me list words that start with C and have N at position 4:\n - ""cairn"" (a pile of stones): but it has an \'A\', which is out and \'I\'? \n - ""chain"": but has \'A\' and \'H\'? And N at position 4? ""chain"": C-H-A-I-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> no, position 5 is N.\n\n The pattern is _ , _ , _ , N , _ : so the fourth letter is N.\n\n Words: \n - ""corny"": C O R N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y -> matches pattern? But note: we have R at position 3. But we must remember that R cannot be at position 2? Yes. Position 3 is allowed.\n\n Alternate: without R at 3? For example, ""colon"": C O L O N -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> wait, position 4 is O? Not N. \n\n Another: ""clink"": C L I N K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:K -> and note: we haven\'t ruled out L, I, K.\n\n But does it contain R? No, because R is known to be in the word? So if we guess ""clink"", we wouldn\'t have R? But we know the word must have R (from the feedback). So we cannot guess a word without R? Or we could? But if we do and the feedback shows R is missing, that would be inconsistent? Actually, we know R is present because of the \'-\' in the first guess? So the word must have R.\n\n Therefore, our guess must include R? Not necessarily? We know R is in the answer, so if we don\'t include R in a guess, then the feedback would show \'x\' for that position? But we can still get information about other letters.\n\n However, we are trying to find the position of R. So including R can help us find where it is.\n\n But in ""clink"", there is no R, so we cannot test R. Moreover, we know R is in the word, so guessing without R doesn\'t help us locate R.\n\n Therefore, we should include R.\n\n Let\'s try words that fit C _ R N _ ? Then the word would be C ? R N ? \n\n Because we know R must be either position 3 or 5? But if we put R at position 3, that\'s one possibility.\n\n Example: ""chirn"": not a common word? Or ""cairn"": has A -> out.\n\n Common words: ""crony"": C R O N Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that R was in the wrong position and specifically not in position 2. Now in this word, R is at position 2? So we cannot use it because R cannot be at position 2? The feedback said position 2 of the first guess (which was R) was wrong? So R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 in our new guess.\n\n Therefore, ""crony"" (with R at 2) is not allowed? Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback already told us that position 2 is not R? Meaning that the R in the secret word is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 in our guess, then:\n\n - If the secret word has R at position 2? But it can\'t because we were told R is not in position 2. Therefore, we would see a \'-\' again (or might it be different?)?\n\n But note: the secret word does not have R at position 2, so if we put R at position 2 in a guess, it must be marked as absent (if there\'s no other R?) or present but wrong position if there\'s another R? Actually, no: because we know the secret word has one R? Or we don\'t know if there are multiple R? The feedback doesn\'t specify.\n\n Therefore, we can avoid using R at position 2 because we know it\'s incorrect? But to test other positions, we can choose to put R at position 3 or 5.\n\n Let\'s try to form words with R in position 3 or 5.\n\n Option: R at position 3: pattern C _ R N _\n\n Words: ""curtn""? Not a word. ""burn"" is 4 letters. \n\n What about ""churn"": C H U R N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U? Wait, no: ""churn"" is C-H-U-R-N -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> but that has R at position 4? But we need N at position 4? Conflict? In ""churn"", position 4 is R and position 5 is N? Not matching: we need position 4 to be N.\n\n So we need position 4 to be N? Then for the word to have N at position 4, if we also have R in the word at a different position.\n\n How about: C ? ? N R? Then pattern: C ? ? N R\n\n Example: ""cater""? But has E? We know E is absent. Also, position 4 must be N? ""cater"" is C-A-T-E-R -> position 4 is E? Not N.\n\n Alternatively: ""cider"": C I D E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N? ... \n\n Another: ""liner""? Not C. We need first letter C.\n\n Words: ""co?n?"", with one of the ? being R? How about ""corny"" we considered earlier? But it has R at position 2 which we want to avoid? Actually, we decided to avoid position 2.\n\n But note: if we put R at position 5? Then pattern: C ? ? N R\n\n What words? ""cyn?r""? I can\'t think. ""cyber""?: C Y B E R -> E is absent? And position 4 is E? Not N.\n\n This seems difficult. Maybe I\'m missing a word.\n\n Alternatively: we put R at position 3: then pattern: C ? R N ?\n\n Then the word has: position 1: C, position 2: ?, position 3: R, position 4: N, position 5: ?\n\n And that letter for position 2 cannot be \'A\' or \'E\'.\n\n Examples: ""born"" is 4 letters? ""cairn"" has A? ""carn?"": ""carne"" has E? ""carns""? not common? ""corns"": C O R N S -> C(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5). \n\n But ""corns""? But note: the feedback told us that in the first guess, R was present but not at position 2? Now if we put R at position 3, that might be correct? And O is a new letter? And S?\n\n Also, we haven\'t tested O or S? So this word would test O and S.\n\n But what about \'corns\'? It\'s the plural of \'corn\'. Assuming plurals are allowed.\n\n Alternatively: ""curnt""? Not a word? Or ""burnt""? Not starting with C.\n\n Another word: ""crimp""? But that has five letters: C-R-I-M-R? Wait, no: ""crimp"": C R I M P -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:P -> no position 4 is not N? \n\n We need position 4 to be N.\n\n So ""corns"" fits: C O R N S -> O at 2, R at 3, N at 4.\n\n It does not have A or E? And includes R at position 3? Which is allowed.\n\n But wait: we know from first guess: R was not at position 2? But now we are putting R at position 3? That might be correct? Also, O and S are new.\n\n Alternatively: ""crown"" doesn\'t fit? Because N at 5? Another: ""crone"": C R O N E -> but E is absent? And we know E is absent? In ""crone"", last letter E? But we know E is absent, so we cannot use words with E.\n\n So ""corns"" is acceptable.\n\n What other words? ""urn"" not C? ""cabin"" no? ""cumin"" no? \n\n Another option: R at position 5: pattern C ? ? N R? What word? ""chain"" no? ""chink"": C, H, I, N, K -> no R? Doesn\'t include R? Then we must put R in position 5? How about ""con?r"": ""con"" words? ""cone"" has E? etc.\n\n Hard: I think ""corns"" is a valid choice.\n\n But let me confirm: ""corns"" -> positions: \n - C is at 1 -> should be ✓ (since we know position 1 is C) \n - R is at 3 -> but we don\'t know if that\'s correct? We are guessing R at 3? \n - O is at 2?  \n - N at 4 -> should be ✓ \n - S at 5.\n\n Also, we have an O at position 2? We haven\'t tested O? So we can get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has different new letters? But we have to include R? Because we know R is in the word? Or? Actually, we don\'t have to include R? But if we don\'t, then the feedback might not tell us the position? But we can infer? For example, if we guess a word without R and the feedback doesn\'t show R? Then it\'s not present? But we know it is present? So that would be inconsistent? Actually, the word must have R? So if we guess a word without R, we would get an \'x\' for R? But we\'d actually get feedback for each letter? \n\n However, to save tries, including R and testing it in position 3 is useful? Since we know R isn\'t at 2, and we are testing at 3? If it turns out to be at position 3, we hit? If not, then we know R must be at position 5? Because those are the only options? Actually, position 5 is the other possibility.\n\n So if this guess doesn\'t have R at position 3 marked as correct, then R must be at position 5.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""corns"". Let\'s hope it\'s an accepted word? Or consider another word?\n\n What about ""curin""? Not a word? \n\n Another word: ""cairn"" has A? Not allowed? ""cabin"" same? \n\n Another: ""cronk""? Not common? ""cornu""? Not common? \n\n So ""corns"" seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we have the constraint that the word must be in the word list?

We have received feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in position 1 and correct.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in position 4 and correct.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: corns -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- C in position 1: correct (as we knew).
- O in position 2: correct! So now we know position 2 is O.
- R in position 3: correct! So position 3 is R.
- N in position 4: correct (as we knew).
- S in position 5: not in the word? Or wait, 'S(x)' means S is not in the word? But the feedback shows 'x' for S, so S is absent?

Therefore, with Guess 2:
- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: O (now confirmed)
- Position 3: R (now confirmed)
- Position 4: N (confirmed)
- Position 5: unknown? But S is absent? So the secret word has S? No, the feedback says S(x), so S is not in the word.

Moreover, from previous feedback, A and E are also absent.

So the secret word is: C O R N ? 

We only need to find the fifth letter. It must be a letter that:
- Is not A, E, or S (since these are absent).
- Forms a valid English word with ""CORN"" as the first four letters.

We know the word must be 5 letters: positions 1-4 are C,O,R,N, so we need a fifth letter.

Possible words: 
- ""cornu"" (an anatomical structure)? But let's check: does it have U? And we haven't tested U.
- ""crony""? But ""crony"" has Y? And we haven't tested Y? But note: ""crony"" is C-O-R-N-Y? Actually: positions: C at1, R at2? No: our pattern has O at2? Wait:

In our pattern, position 2 is O? So the word must be C O R N ?

So possible words:
- ""corny"" -> meaning sentimental? And it fits? C-O-R-N-Y? That's five letters? Yes: C at1, O at2, R at3, N at4, Y at5.

But what about ""corns""? We guessed ""corns"" which ends with S? But S got an 'x' so S is absent? So ""corny"" becomes a candidate.

Other options:
- ""corni"" not common?
- ""cornd"" not a word?
- ""corn"" plus a letter: typically Y, T, A, E? But A and E are absent? And S we now know is absent? So Y is likely?

Also, note: we haven't tested Y? So we don't know if Y is present? But since it's the only missing position? And it must form a word? ""Corny"" is a valid English word? And ""corn"" words: ""corny"" is about sentimentality? ""corn"" also has ""cornu"" or ""corna"", but ""corna"" isn't a word? And ""cornu"" has U? Which we haven't tested? So both are candidates? But we don't know about U? However, in one guess we can distinguish.

But note: we need to guess the entire word? Since we have four letters known? We can guess among the possibilities.

But what are the common words?
- ""corny""
- ""cornu"" (less common? might not be in standard word lists)

So the word is very likely ""corny"".

But we need to form a guess? Since we have only one unknown? We don't want to guess random letters? So guess ""corny"" and see?

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other letters? The fifth letter could be a vowel or consonant? But common: Y.

But we have to confirm if there are multiple possibilities? What about letters we haven't tested? But we only care about valid words.

Also, note the feedback from Guess 2: we have C, O, R, N? And missing S? So the word is not ""corns"".

So the fifth letter must be something else.

Valid words: 
- ""corny"": adjective meaning trite or overly sentimental.
- ""cornu"": noun meaning horn-like structure? Less common? But possible?
- ""corni"": not common? 
- ""corne"": not English? 

Assuming ""corny"" is the most likely?

Moreover, we have tried letters: A, E, S are out? So Y is safe? We haven't ruled it out? That is, we don't know if Y is in the word or not? But since it's the last letter? This guess will tell us? Actually, if we guess ""corny"", and if Y is correct? Then we win? If Y is not? Then we get feedback? But we have guesses left? So we can make an informed guess? But let's not miss a possibility? 

But for now? I think ""corny"" is the best guess? Because it's common? 

Other possibilities? B? Then ""cornb"" not a word? D? ""cornd"" not? T? ""cornt"" not? Etc? Most words ending in consonants don't form words? Except ""cornc""? No? 

So either Y or U? But ""cornu"" is less common? And ""corny"" is more common? 

In Wordle, common words are preferred.

Therefore, I'll guess ""corny"".

If it's incorrect? Then we try ""cornu""? But I think ""corny"" is more reasonable? 

So the guess is ""corny""?

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)**  
  This revealed:  
  - The first letter is **C** (position 1).  
  - **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - **A** and **E** are not in the word.  
  - The fourth letter is **N** (position 4).  
  Thus, the secret word pattern is **C _ _ N _** (with R in position 3 or 5).

- **Guess 2: corns → C(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) S(x)**  
  This revealed:  
  - **O** is in position 2 (confirmed ✓).  
  - **R** is in position 3 (confirmed ✓).  
  - **S** is not in the word (x).  
  Thus, the secret word is now **C O R N ?**, where the fifth letter is missing (and must not be A, E, S).

### Analysis
- Positions 1–4 are confirmed as **C, O, R, N**.  
- The fifth letter must complete a valid English word and cannot be **A, E, or S** (ruled out from previous feedback).  
- Common 5-letter words fitting the partial word **CORN_** are:  
  - **corny**: meaning trite or sentimental (common word).  
  - **cornu**: anatomical term for a horn-like structure (less common).  
- **corny** is the most frequent and practical English word in this context.  
- Testing **corny** efficiently confirms/completes the secret word with one guess.  

### Next Guess
Given the established pattern (**C O R N ?**), **corny** is the strongest candidate.  
- If correct, the word is solved.  
- If incorrect, the fifth letter’s feedback (e.g., symbol for Y) will immediately reveal the solution (e.g., **cornu**).  

<guess>corny</guess>",corny,"We have received feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in position 1 and correct.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in position 4 and correct.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: corns -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- C in position 1: correct (as we knew).
- O in position 2: correct! So now we know position 2 is O.
- R in position 3: correct! So position 3 is R.
- N in position 4: correct (as we knew).
- S in position 5: not in the word? Or wait, 'S(x)' means S is not in the word? But the feedback shows 'x' for S, so S is absent?

Therefore, with Guess 2:
- Position 1: C (confirmed)
- Position 2: O (now confirmed)
- Position 3: R (now confirmed)
- Position 4: N (confirmed)
- Position 5: unknown? But S is absent? So the secret word has S? No, the feedback says S(x), so S is not in the word.

Moreover, from previous feedback, A and E are also absent.

So the secret word is: C O R N ? 

We only need to find the fifth letter. It must be a letter that:
- Is not A, E, or S (since these are absent).
- Forms a valid English word with ""CORN"" as the first four letters.

We know the word must be 5 letters: positions 1-4 are C,O,R,N, so we need a fifth letter.

Possible words: 
- ""cornu"" (an anatomical structure)? But let's check: does it have U? And we haven't tested U.
- ""crony""? But ""crony"" has Y? And we haven't tested Y? But note: ""crony"" is C-O-R-N-Y? Actually: positions: C at1, R at2? No: our pattern has O at2? Wait:

In our pattern, position 2 is O? So the word must be C O R N ?

So possible words:
- ""corny"" -> meaning sentimental? And it fits? C-O-R-N-Y? That's five letters? Yes: C at1, O at2, R at3, N at4, Y at5.

But what about ""corns""? We guessed ""corns"" which ends with S? But S got an 'x' so S is absent? So ""corny"" becomes a candidate.

Other options:
- ""corni"" not common?
- ""cornd"" not a word?
- ""corn"" plus a letter: typically Y, T, A, E? But A and E are absent? And S we now know is absent? So Y is likely?

Also, note: we haven't tested Y? So we don't know if Y is present? But since it's the only missing position? And it must form a word? ""Corny"" is a valid English word? And ""corn"" words: ""corny"" is about sentimentality? ""corn"" also has ""cornu"" or ""corna"", but ""corna"" isn't a word? And ""cornu"" has U? Which we haven't tested? So both are candidates? But we don't know about U? However, in one guess we can distinguish.

But note: we need to guess the entire word? Since we have four letters known? We can guess among the possibilities.

But what are the common words?
- ""corny""
- ""cornu"" (less common? might not be in standard word lists)

So the word is very likely ""corny"".

But we need to form a guess? Since we have only one unknown? We don't want to guess random letters? So guess ""corny"" and see?

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other letters? The fifth letter could be a vowel or consonant? But common: Y.

But we have to confirm if there are multiple possibilities? What about letters we haven't tested? But we only care about valid words.

Also, note the feedback from Guess 2: we have C, O, R, N? And missing S? So the word is not ""corns"".

So the fifth letter must be something else.

Valid words: 
- ""corny"": adjective meaning trite or overly sentimental.
- ""cornu"": noun meaning horn-like structure? Less common? But possible?
- ""corni"": not common? 
- ""corne"": not English? 

Assuming ""corny"" is the most likely?

Moreover, we have tried letters: A, E, S are out? So Y is safe? We haven't ruled it out? That is, we don't know if Y is in the word or not? But since it's the last letter? This guess will tell us? Actually, if we guess ""corny"", and if Y is correct? Then we win? If Y is not? Then we get feedback? But we have guesses left? So we can make an informed guess? But let's not miss a possibility? 

But for now? I think ""corny"" is the best guess? Because it's common? 

Other possibilities? B? Then ""cornb"" not a word? D? ""cornd"" not? T? ""cornt"" not? Etc? Most words ending in consonants don't form words? Except ""cornc""? No? 

So either Y or U? But ""cornu"" is less common? And ""corny"" is more common? 

In Wordle, common words are preferred.

Therefore, I'll guess ""corny"".

If it's incorrect? Then we try ""cornu""? But I think ""corny"" is more reasonable?
