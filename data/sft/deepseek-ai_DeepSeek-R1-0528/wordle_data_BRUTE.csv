First, I need to analyze the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" got C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓). That means:

- R is in the word and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is R.

- E is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the feedback is E(✓), but let's check the position. In ""crane"", E is the fifth letter. So E is in the fifth position and correct. So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.

- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

So, from this:

- Position 2: R is fixed. Must be R.

- Position 5: E is fixed. Must be E.

- C, A, N are not in the word. So we know that any letter except C, A, N could be in other positions, but specifically, since A and N are out, and C is out.

Now, positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled.

We have _ R _ _ E as the target word.

Letters not in word: C, A, N.

Other letters are possible.

I need to make a new guess that respects this feedback.

The new guess must:

- Have R in the second position.

- Have E in the fifth position.

- Avoid using C, A, N anywhere, since they are not in the word.

Also, it should be a valid English 5-letter word.

Now, considering common words, I should try to include other common vowels or consonants to test more letters.

The secret word has E and R, so vowels might be limited; E is already in.

Possible vowels: E is used, but there might be another vowel? Position 1,3,4 could have vowels.

But A is out, so vowels like I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Common consonants.

Since position 1 and 5 are fixed in the sense that we know E is at the end, and R is second.

Possible words ending with E: many verbs or nouns.

But with R in second position.

For example: words like ""PRIDE"", but let's see.

""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E.

But we need to avoid C, A, N.

In ""PRIDE"", positions: 1=P, 2=R (good), 3=I, 4=D, 5=E (good).

Now, does this use C, A, N? No, P, I, D, E, R are all not forbidden except that C,A,N are out.

But we don't know if P, I, D are in or not yet.

Feedback will tell us about I and D and P.

Perhaps a better choice is to use different letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

O is a vowel, but A is out.

Let me think of words that start with various letters, have R second, end with E.

Examples:

- BR_ E: like BRINE, BRIDE, BRACE but C and A are out, so BRINE or BRIDE.

BRINE: B, R, I, N, E. But N is not in word? Feedback said N(x), so N is not in word. So BRINE has N, which can't be in secret word. So invalid guess? No, I can guess it, but it would be wasteful because N is already known absent.

Similarly, BRACE has C, which is absent.

So better to avoid C,A,N.

For ""BR_ E"", possible: BRIDE (B,R,I,D,E) or BRISE? Not common, BRUSE? Not word.

BRINE invalid due to N.

Other options: TR_ E, like TRIBE but E is fifth, TR_ E, e.g., TRADE but A is out, TRICE but C out.

TRIPE: T,R,I,P,E all not forbidden.

Similarly, PRICE but C out, so PRIDE or PRIME.

PRIME: P,R,I,M,E.

GR_ E: GRIME, GRIPE, etc.

But let's list possible.

Common possibilities: I can try ""PRIDE"" or ""TRIPE"" to test I and P or T etc.

But perhaps include more new letters.

Since E is at end, E might not be the only vowel, but A is excluded.

Possible secret words: _ R _ _ E. With C,A,N not present.

Options: DRIVE, DRONE but N out, DROVE, DRILL but LL not, single L but DRILE not word.

Common words: PRICE but C out, PRIZE? P,R,I,Z,E.

Yes.

Other: FRAME but A out, FRUIT but T and U, but ends with T, not E? No, position 5 E.

So must end with E.

FROZE? Not E.

Focus on words like: STORE? S,T,O,R,E but position 2 is T? No, for our guess, position 2 must be R, so like S R _ _ E? Not common.

Position 1: consonant or vowel, position 2: R, position 3: vowel or consonant, position 4: something, position 5: E.

Typically, position 3 is often a vowel.

So words with patterns like _ R I _ E or _ R O _ E, etc.

For example: BRIDE, PRICE (C out), PRIDE, TRIPE, GRIPE, STRIE? Not common, SHIRE, WHILE but E not fifth, WHINE but N out.

SHIRE: S,H,I,R,E, position 2 is H? No, for ""_ R _ _ E"", so first letter S, second R? SHIRE is S,H,I,R,E so position 2 is H, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

Correct pattern: first letter, second is R, third letter, fourth, fifth E.

So: _ R ? ? E

Letters: B R I D E, C R E A M but A out, C out, D R O M E? Not E at end, D R I B E? Not word.

Common ones: WRITE? W,R,I,T,E, but position 5 T? No, W,R,I,T,E has fifth as E? W-R-I-T-E, positions: 1=W, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E yes.

Yes, WRITE is a valid word.

Similarly, PRIDE: P,R,I,D,E

TRIPE: T,R,I,P,E

GRIPE: G,R,I,P,E

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E

Etc.

All end with E.

To maximize information, since we have only two known positions, we should guess a word with new letters that aren't used yet, except R and E which are fixed.

R and E are in word, but we know their positions are correct except for R which might be elsewhere? No, only one R, but it could have multiples, but feedback showed R(✓) meaning that specific R is correct.

Similarly for E.

But other Rs? Since R(✓), and no indication of another R, possibility, but we don't know.

Similarly for E.

In this guess, I should avoid repeating letters to test more.

""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, all distinct except we don't care about repeats for now.

But in new guess, since only R and E are known present, and position fixed.

Known present: R and E, with positions fixed: pos2 R, pos5 E.

Known absent: C, A, N.

Other letters: possible.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with common consonants or vowels.

Since position 3 and 4 need vowels? Not necessarily, but often.

Position 1: often consonant.

In English words ending with E, position 3 or 4 is usually vowel.

For example, in WRITE, I is vowel.

PRIDE, I vowel.

DRIVE, I vowel.

GRIPE, I vowel.

Or O, like PROSE, P,R,O,S,E. PROSE: P,R,O,S,E. S is consonant, O vowel.

All good.

Now, which one to choose. I want to test letters that are frequent.

For instance, S, T, L, etc.

In ""PRIDE"", letters P,I,D.

P is frequent, I vowel, D consonant.

In ""TRIPE"", T,R,I,P,E T and P.

But E and R fixed.

Perhaps ""SPIRE"" but position 2 R? S,P,I,R,E has position 2=P? Not R. Must be _ R _ _ E.

So ""SPIRE"" doesn't work.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" has position 2=H.

Not.

""STARE"" S,T,A,R,E but A is out, and position 2=T.

Need position 2=R.

"" CRANE"" was first guess, not helpful.

""GRACE"" but C out.

Another common word: ""PRUNE"" or ""PROBE"" but not E end, or PROBE E at end? P,R,O,B,E yes, but O and B.

But let's see what letters are covered.

I think ""PRIME"" is good: P,R,I,M,E.

P, I, M are new.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" D,R,I,V,E.

D,I,V new.

""WRITE"" W,R,I,T,E. W,I,T new.

I should choose one with T or S, common letters.

S is very common.

Any word with S? But position 2 R, so _ R S _ E? Like ARISE but A out, not.

ERASE E,R,A,S,E, but A out, and E at start.

""ERASE"" has position 1=E,2=R,3=A,4=S,5=E.

But A is out, so not possible.

""CRISE"" not common.

""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E A out.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" C out.

Hard to include S in this pattern.

Position 4 S, like _ R ? S E

Example: PARSE but A out, MERSE not word, VERSE V,E,R,S,E, position 1=V,2=E? Not R second. Verse is V-E-R-S-E so pos2=E.

We need pos2=R.

So WORSE W,O,R,S,E pos2=O? W-O-R-S-E, pos2=O, pos3=R? Not.

It's difficult to have S with R at pos2 and E at pos5.

Another: FORES maybe not, FORES not standard.

Perhaps ""PURSE"", P,U,R,S,E but position? P-U-R-S-E, pos2=U, pos3=R? Not.

pos2 not R.

In ""_ R _ _ E"", with pos2=R, it's hard to have S easily.

Similarly, T: position 4 T, like _ R I T E, which is WRITE, TRITE, etc.

WRITE works.

GRATE but A out.

PRITE not word.

So WRITE: W,R,I,T,E.

Letters: W, R, I, T, E.

R and E known, W, I, T new.

I is a vowel, W and T are consonants.

Since A is out, possible vowels are E (fixed), and I or O or U.

I is common.

Perhaps try with O.

_ R O _ E, like PROSE, GROVE, etc.

GROVE: G,R,O,V,E.

G, O, V new.

But O might be good to test.

Since only E is known vowel, testing another vowel is wise.

In first feedback, A is not present, so secret word might have I or O or U.

Testing I could be good.

Similarly, common consonants like D, L, S, T.

But S is tricky in pos1 or pos3.

For example, pos1 S: S R ? ? E

Like SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E, pos2=H not R.

S R I _ E not common, SRIPE not word.

SUREE not.

STREE not word.

Only option is like ""SERRE"" or rare words.

Not good.

Similarly, position 3 S: _ R S _ E, like URSE? not, ERSE not common, ARSE A out.

ORSE not.

So difficult to include S in this position.

Therefore, I might avoid S for now and focus on other letters.

Similarly for T, in position 4 it can be, like in WRITE.

Or position 1, like T R I _ E, TRICE C out, TRIPE is T,R,I,P,E, pos4=P.

TRIP E, but P.

Same as before.

Perhaps ""TROVE"" but O and V, ends with E? T,R,O,V,E yes.

TROVE.

I think TRIPE is a fine choice: T,R,I,P,E.

Letters: T, I, P new.

Similarly, PRIDE has P,I,D.

To decide: let's consider frequency.

In English, frequent letters: E,T,A,O,I,N,S,H,R. But E and R are known present, A,N absent, so T,O,I,S,H possible.

S we can't easily include, so T,O,I,H.

H can be tested.

e.g., _ R H _ E, like OHRE? not, RHINE? but N out, SHREW ends W.

Not many options.

So perhaps not H.

Similarly O: as in PROSE or TRODE? not.

PROSE: P,R,O,S,E, S is difficult, but let's accept if it's a word.

PROSE is a word: P-R-O-S-E.

Positions: 1=P,2=R,3=O,4=S,5=E.

Yes, and S and O can be tested.

But in feedback, I might get info on O and S.

Similarly, BROSE not common.

Good point.

I could use ""PROSE"" but I think PRISE might be variant, but PROSE is fine.

PROSE: meaning a type of writing.

Valid.

But S in position 4.

Similarly, another word: ""GRISE"" might not be common.

""ROUSE"" but position 2=O, not R.

No.

So PROSE is an option.

But let's compare to TRIPE or WRITE.

Since we have limited options, and to make progress.

Perhaps a word with U.

""PRUDE"" P,R,U,D,E.

U vowel.

But U less frequent.

I think I, O are better vowels to test.

Similarly, consonants like D, L, M, etc.

Back to the feedback.

Secret word: first letter unknown, thikrd unknown, fourth unknown, with R and E fixed.

Since in first guess, E is correctly placed at position 5, and R at position 2.

No other letters present, meaning no duplicates mentioned, but in ""crane"", all letters were tested.

C, A, N absent.

For the new word, I should guess one that has R in position 2, E in position 5, and others new.

Possible words: TRIPE, PRIDE, DRIVE, GRIPE, WRITE, etc.

I'll go with ""WRITE"" because it gives W in position 1, I in position 3, T in position 4, all common letters.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T in pos1, I pos3, P pos4.

Almost same.

""PRIME"" might be better, M instead of T or D.

M is less frequent than T.

Let's check letter frequency.

Common consonants: T, N, S, R, H, D, L, etc. But N excluded, S hard to place, H harder, D is possible, L is possible.

For L: _ R L _ E, like CARLE not, MARLE not, ARLE not, WORLE not.

Few options, like ""PERLE"" or rare, not good.

Similarly, D: _ R I D E, like BRIDE, PRIDE, but we can.

""PRIDE"" has P and D.

""DRIVE"" D R I V E.

V is less common.

So perhaps ""PRIDE"" or ""WRITE"".

""WRITE"" for T.

In Wordle strategies, testing T is often good.

Since S is common but hard to place, save for later.

So I'll go with ""WRITE"".

Guess: W R I T E.

Position 2 R correct, position 5 E correct, as per rule, and W,I,T new.

After this, feedback will tell about W, I, T.

If I is present or not, etc.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" for P and D.

But T might be better.

I think both fine.

I'll choose ""WRITE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""crane"", we know:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form _ R _ _ E, and we must avoid using C, A, or N in the new guess.

To maximize information, the next guess should include new common letters (such as consonants like T, S, L, or vowels like I, O) to test their presence and positions. Avoiding repeated letters from the initial guess is also helpful to cover more possibilities. Words like ""write"" fit the pattern (position 2: R, position 5: E), and it includes letters not yet tested: W (position 1), I (position 3), T (position 4). This helps probe for vowels and high-frequency consonants.

Given this, ""write"" is a strong choice for the second guess.

<guess>write</guess>",write,"First, I need to analyze the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" got C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓). That means:

- R is in the word and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is R.

- E is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the feedback is E(✓), but let's check the position. In ""crane"", E is the fifth letter. So E is in the fifth position and correct. So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.

- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

So, from this:

- Position 2: R is fixed. Must be R.

- Position 5: E is fixed. Must be E.

- C, A, N are not in the word. So we know that any letter except C, A, N could be in other positions, but specifically, since A and N are out, and C is out.

Now, positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled.

We have _ R _ _ E as the target word.

Letters not in word: C, A, N.

Other letters are possible.

I need to make a new guess that respects this feedback.

The new guess must:

- Have R in the second position.

- Have E in the fifth position.

- Avoid using C, A, N anywhere, since they are not in the word.

Also, it should be a valid English 5-letter word.

Now, considering common words, I should try to include other common vowels or consonants to test more letters.

The secret word has E and R, so vowels might be limited; E is already in.

Possible vowels: E is used, but there might be another vowel? Position 1,3,4 could have vowels.

But A is out, so vowels like I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Common consonants.

Since position 1 and 5 are fixed in the sense that we know E is at the end, and R is second.

Possible words ending with E: many verbs or nouns.

But with R in second position.

For example: words like ""PRIDE"", but let's see.

""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E.

But we need to avoid C, A, N.

In ""PRIDE"", positions: 1=P, 2=R (good), 3=I, 4=D, 5=E (good).

Now, does this use C, A, N? No, P, I, D, E, R are all not forbidden except that C,A,N are out.

But we don't know if P, I, D are in or not yet.

Feedback will tell us about I and D and P.

Perhaps a better choice is to use different letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

O is a vowel, but A is out.

Let me think of words that start with various letters, have R second, end with E.

Examples:

- BR_ E: like BRINE, BRIDE, BRACE but C and A are out, so BRINE or BRIDE.

BRINE: B, R, I, N, E. But N is not in word? Feedback said N(x), so N is not in word. So BRINE has N, which can't be in secret word. So invalid guess? No, I can guess it, but it would be wasteful because N is already known absent.

Similarly, BRACE has C, which is absent.

So better to avoid C,A,N.

For ""BR_ E"", possible: BRIDE (B,R,I,D,E) or BRISE? Not common, BRUSE? Not word.

BRINE invalid due to N.

Other options: TR_ E, like TRIBE but E is fifth, TR_ E, e.g., TRADE but A is out, TRICE but C out.

TRIPE: T,R,I,P,E all not forbidden.

Similarly, PRICE but C out, so PRIDE or PRIME.

PRIME: P,R,I,M,E.

GR_ E: GRIME, GRIPE, etc.

But let's list possible.

Common possibilities: I can try ""PRIDE"" or ""TRIPE"" to test I and P or T etc.

But perhaps include more new letters.

Since E is at end, E might not be the only vowel, but A is excluded.

Possible secret words: _ R _ _ E. With C,A,N not present.

Options: DRIVE, DRONE but N out, DROVE, DRILL but LL not, single L but DRILE not word.

Common words: PRICE but C out, PRIZE? P,R,I,Z,E.

Yes.

Other: FRAME but A out, FRUIT but T and U, but ends with T, not E? No, position 5 E.

So must end with E.

FROZE? Not E.

Focus on words like: STORE? S,T,O,R,E but position 2 is T? No, for our guess, position 2 must be R, so like S R _ _ E? Not common.

Position 1: consonant or vowel, position 2: R, position 3: vowel or consonant, position 4: something, position 5: E.

Typically, position 3 is often a vowel.

So words with patterns like _ R I _ E or _ R O _ E, etc.

For example: BRIDE, PRICE (C out), PRIDE, TRIPE, GRIPE, STRIE? Not common, SHIRE, WHILE but E not fifth, WHINE but N out.

SHIRE: S,H,I,R,E, position 2 is H? No, for ""_ R _ _ E"", so first letter S, second R? SHIRE is S,H,I,R,E so position 2 is H, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

Correct pattern: first letter, second is R, third letter, fourth, fifth E.

So: _ R ? ? E

Letters: B R I D E, C R E A M but A out, C out, D R O M E? Not E at end, D R I B E? Not word.

Common ones: WRITE? W,R,I,T,E, but position 5 T? No, W,R,I,T,E has fifth as E? W-R-I-T-E, positions: 1=W, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E yes.

Yes, WRITE is a valid word.

Similarly, PRIDE: P,R,I,D,E

TRIPE: T,R,I,P,E

GRIPE: G,R,I,P,E

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E

Etc.

All end with E.

To maximize information, since we have only two known positions, we should guess a word with new letters that aren't used yet, except R and E which are fixed.

R and E are in word, but we know their positions are correct except for R which might be elsewhere? No, only one R, but it could have multiples, but feedback showed R(✓) meaning that specific R is correct.

Similarly for E.

But other Rs? Since R(✓), and no indication of another R, possibility, but we don't know.

Similarly for E.

In this guess, I should avoid repeating letters to test more.

""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, all distinct except we don't care about repeats for now.

But in new guess, since only R and E are known present, and position fixed.

Known present: R and E, with positions fixed: pos2 R, pos5 E.

Known absent: C, A, N.

Other letters: possible.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with common consonants or vowels.

Since position 3 and 4 need vowels? Not necessarily, but often.

Position 1: often consonant.

In English words ending with E, position 3 or 4 is usually vowel.

For example, in WRITE, I is vowel.

PRIDE, I vowel.

DRIVE, I vowel.

GRIPE, I vowel.

Or O, like PROSE, P,R,O,S,E. PROSE: P,R,O,S,E. S is consonant, O vowel.

All good.

Now, which one to choose. I want to test letters that are frequent.

For instance, S, T, L, etc.

In ""PRIDE"", letters P,I,D.

P is frequent, I vowel, D consonant.

In ""TRIPE"", T,R,I,P,E T and P.

But E and R fixed.

Perhaps ""SPIRE"" but position 2 R? S,P,I,R,E has position 2=P? Not R. Must be _ R _ _ E.

So ""SPIRE"" doesn't work.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" has position 2=H.

Not.

""STARE"" S,T,A,R,E but A is out, and position 2=T.

Need position 2=R.

"" CRANE"" was first guess, not helpful.

""GRACE"" but C out.

Another common word: ""PRUNE"" or ""PROBE"" but not E end, or PROBE E at end? P,R,O,B,E yes, but O and B.

But let's see what letters are covered.

I think ""PRIME"" is good: P,R,I,M,E.

P, I, M are new.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" D,R,I,V,E.

D,I,V new.

""WRITE"" W,R,I,T,E. W,I,T new.

I should choose one with T or S, common letters.

S is very common.

Any word with S? But position 2 R, so _ R S _ E? Like ARISE but A out, not.

ERASE E,R,A,S,E, but A out, and E at start.

""ERASE"" has position 1=E,2=R,3=A,4=S,5=E.

But A is out, so not possible.

""CRISE"" not common.

""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E A out.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" C out.

Hard to include S in this pattern.

Position 4 S, like _ R ? S E

Example: PARSE but A out, MERSE not word, VERSE V,E,R,S,E, position 1=V,2=E? Not R second. Verse is V-E-R-S-E so pos2=E.

We need pos2=R.

So WORSE W,O,R,S,E pos2=O? W-O-R-S-E, pos2=O, pos3=R? Not.

It's difficult to have S with R at pos2 and E at pos5.

Another: FORES maybe not, FORES not standard.

Perhaps ""PURSE"", P,U,R,S,E but position? P-U-R-S-E, pos2=U, pos3=R? Not.

pos2 not R.

In ""_ R _ _ E"", with pos2=R, it's hard to have S easily.

Similarly, T: position 4 T, like _ R I T E, which is WRITE, TRITE, etc.

WRITE works.

GRATE but A out.

PRITE not word.

So WRITE: W,R,I,T,E.

Letters: W, R, I, T, E.

R and E known, W, I, T new.

I is a vowel, W and T are consonants.

Since A is out, possible vowels are E (fixed), and I or O or U.

I is common.

Perhaps try with O.

_ R O _ E, like PROSE, GROVE, etc.

GROVE: G,R,O,V,E.

G, O, V new.

But O might be good to test.

Since only E is known vowel, testing another vowel is wise.

In first feedback, A is not present, so secret word might have I or O or U.

Testing I could be good.

Similarly, common consonants like D, L, S, T.

But S is tricky in pos1 or pos3.

For example, pos1 S: S R ? ? E

Like SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E, pos2=H not R.

S R I _ E not common, SRIPE not word.

SUREE not.

STREE not word.

Only option is like ""SERRE"" or rare words.

Not good.

Similarly, position 3 S: _ R S _ E, like URSE? not, ERSE not common, ARSE A out.

ORSE not.

So difficult to include S in this position.

Therefore, I might avoid S for now and focus on other letters.

Similarly for T, in position 4 it can be, like in WRITE.

Or position 1, like T R I _ E, TRICE C out, TRIPE is T,R,I,P,E, pos4=P.

TRIP E, but P.

Same as before.

Perhaps ""TROVE"" but O and V, ends with E? T,R,O,V,E yes.

TROVE.

I think TRIPE is a fine choice: T,R,I,P,E.

Letters: T, I, P new.

Similarly, PRIDE has P,I,D.

To decide: let's consider frequency.

In English, frequent letters: E,T,A,O,I,N,S,H,R. But E and R are known present, A,N absent, so T,O,I,S,H possible.

S we can't easily include, so T,O,I,H.

H can be tested.

e.g., _ R H _ E, like OHRE? not, RHINE? but N out, SHREW ends W.

Not many options.

So perhaps not H.

Similarly O: as in PROSE or TRODE? not.

PROSE: P,R,O,S,E, S is difficult, but let's accept if it's a word.

PROSE is a word: P-R-O-S-E.

Positions: 1=P,2=R,3=O,4=S,5=E.

Yes, and S and O can be tested.

But in feedback, I might get info on O and S.

Similarly, BROSE not common.

Good point.

I could use ""PROSE"" but I think PRISE might be variant, but PROSE is fine.

PROSE: meaning a type of writing.

Valid.

But S in position 4.

Similarly, another word: ""GRISE"" might not be common.

""ROUSE"" but position 2=O, not R.

No.

So PROSE is an option.

But let's compare to TRIPE or WRITE.

Since we have limited options, and to make progress.

Perhaps a word with U.

""PRUDE"" P,R,U,D,E.

U vowel.

But U less frequent.

I think I, O are better vowels to test.

Similarly, consonants like D, L, M, etc.

Back to the feedback.

Secret word: first letter unknown, thikrd unknown, fourth unknown, with R and E fixed.

Since in first guess, E is correctly placed at position 5, and R at position 2.

No other letters present, meaning no duplicates mentioned, but in ""crane"", all letters were tested.

C, A, N absent.

For the new word, I should guess one that has R in position 2, E in position 5, and others new.

Possible words: TRIPE, PRIDE, DRIVE, GRIPE, WRITE, etc.

I'll go with ""WRITE"" because it gives W in position 1, I in position 3, T in position 4, all common letters.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T in pos1, I pos3, P pos4.

Almost same.

""PRIME"" might be better, M instead of T or D.

M is less frequent than T.

Let's check letter frequency.

Common consonants: T, N, S, R, H, D, L, etc. But N excluded, S hard to place, H harder, D is possible, L is possible.

For L: _ R L _ E, like CARLE not, MARLE not, ARLE not, WORLE not.

Few options, like ""PERLE"" or rare, not good.

Similarly, D: _ R I D E, like BRIDE, PRIDE, but we can.

""PRIDE"" has P and D.

""DRIVE"" D R I V E.

V is less common.

So perhaps ""PRIDE"" or ""WRITE"".

""WRITE"" for T.

In Wordle strategies, testing T is often good.

Since S is common but hard to place, save for later.

So I'll go with ""WRITE"".

Guess: W R I T E.

Position 2 R correct, position 5 E correct, as per rule, and W,I,T new.

After this, feedback will tell about W, I, T.

If I is present or not, etc.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" for P and D.

But T might be better.

I think both fine.

I'll choose ""WRITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""crane"", we know:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form _ R _ _ E, and we must avoid using C, A, or N in the new guess.

To maximize information, the next guess should include new common letters (such as consonants like T, S, L, or vowels like I, O) to test their presence and positions. Avoiding repeated letters from the initial guess is also helpful to cover more possibilities. Words like ""write"" fit the pattern (position 2: R, position 5: E), and it includes letters not yet tested: W (position 1), I (position 3), T (position 4). This helps probe for vowels and high-frequency consonants.

Given this, ""write"" is a strong choice for the second guess.",Guess 2: write -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(x) T(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BRUTE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to analyze the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" got C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓). That means:

- R is in the word and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is R.

- E is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the feedback is E(✓), but let's check the position. In ""crane"", E is the fifth letter. So E is in the fifth position and correct. So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.

- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

So, from this:

- Position 2: R is fixed. Must be R.

- Position 5: E is fixed. Must be E.

- C, A, N are not in the word. So we know that any letter except C, A, N could be in other positions, but specifically, since A and N are out, and C is out.

Now, positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled.

We have _ R _ _ E as the target word.

Letters not in word: C, A, N.

Other letters are possible.

I need to make a new guess that respects this feedback.

The new guess must:

- Have R in the second position.

- Have E in the fifth position.

- Avoid using C, A, N anywhere, since they are not in the word.

Also, it should be a valid English 5-letter word.

Now, considering common words, I should try to include other common vowels or consonants to test more letters.

The secret word has E and R, so vowels might be limited; E is already in.

Possible vowels: E is used, but there might be another vowel? Position 1,3,4 could have vowels.

But A is out, so vowels like I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Common consonants.

Since position 1 and 5 are fixed in the sense that we know E is at the end, and R is second.

Possible words ending with E: many verbs or nouns.

But with R in second position.

For example: words like ""PRIDE"", but let's see.

""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E.

But we need to avoid C, A, N.

In ""PRIDE"", positions: 1=P, 2=R (good), 3=I, 4=D, 5=E (good).

Now, does this use C, A, N? No, P, I, D, E, R are all not forbidden except that C,A,N are out.

But we don't know if P, I, D are in or not yet.

Feedback will tell us about I and D and P.

Perhaps a better choice is to use different letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

O is a vowel, but A is out.

Let me think of words that start with various letters, have R second, end with E.

Examples:

- BR_ E: like BRINE, BRIDE, BRACE but C and A are out, so BRINE or BRIDE.

BRINE: B, R, I, N, E. But N is not in word? Feedback said N(x), so N is not in word. So BRINE has N, which can't be in secret word. So invalid guess? No, I can guess it, but it would be wasteful because N is already known absent.

Similarly, BRACE has C, which is absent.

So better to avoid C,A,N.

For ""BR_ E"", possible: BRIDE (B,R,I,D,E) or BRISE? Not common, BRUSE? Not word.

BRINE invalid due to N.

Other options: TR_ E, like TRIBE but E is fifth, TR_ E, e.g., TRADE but A is out, TRICE but C out.

TRIPE: T,R,I,P,E all not forbidden.

Similarly, PRICE but C out, so PRIDE or PRIME.

PRIME: P,R,I,M,E.

GR_ E: GRIME, GRIPE, etc.

But let's list possible.

Common possibilities: I can try ""PRIDE"" or ""TRIPE"" to test I and P or T etc.

But perhaps include more new letters.

Since E is at end, E might not be the only vowel, but A is excluded.

Possible secret words: _ R _ _ E. With C,A,N not present.

Options: DRIVE, DRONE but N out, DROVE, DRILL but LL not, single L but DRILE not word.

Common words: PRICE but C out, PRIZE? P,R,I,Z,E.

Yes.

Other: FRAME but A out, FRUIT but T and U, but ends with T, not E? No, position 5 E.

So must end with E.

FROZE? Not E.

Focus on words like: STORE? S,T,O,R,E but position 2 is T? No, for our guess, position 2 must be R, so like S R _ _ E? Not common.

Position 1: consonant or vowel, position 2: R, position 3: vowel or consonant, position 4: something, position 5: E.

Typically, position 3 is often a vowel.

So words with patterns like _ R I _ E or _ R O _ E, etc.

For example: BRIDE, PRICE (C out), PRIDE, TRIPE, GRIPE, STRIE? Not common, SHIRE, WHILE but E not fifth, WHINE but N out.

SHIRE: S,H,I,R,E, position 2 is H? No, for ""_ R _ _ E"", so first letter S, second R? SHIRE is S,H,I,R,E so position 2 is H, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

Correct pattern: first letter, second is R, third letter, fourth, fifth E.

So: _ R ? ? E

Letters: B R I D E, C R E A M but A out, C out, D R O M E? Not E at end, D R I B E? Not word.

Common ones: WRITE? W,R,I,T,E, but position 5 T? No, W,R,I,T,E has fifth as E? W-R-I-T-E, positions: 1=W, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E yes.

Yes, WRITE is a valid word.

Similarly, PRIDE: P,R,I,D,E

TRIPE: T,R,I,P,E

GRIPE: G,R,I,P,E

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E

Etc.

All end with E.

To maximize information, since we have only two known positions, we should guess a word with new letters that aren't used yet, except R and E which are fixed.

R and E are in word, but we know their positions are correct except for R which might be elsewhere? No, only one R, but it could have multiples, but feedback showed R(✓) meaning that specific R is correct.

Similarly for E.

But other Rs? Since R(✓), and no indication of another R, possibility, but we don't know.

Similarly for E.

In this guess, I should avoid repeating letters to test more.

""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, all distinct except we don't care about repeats for now.

But in new guess, since only R and E are known present, and position fixed.

Known present: R and E, with positions fixed: pos2 R, pos5 E.

Known absent: C, A, N.

Other letters: possible.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with common consonants or vowels.

Since position 3 and 4 need vowels? Not necessarily, but often.

Position 1: often consonant.

In English words ending with E, position 3 or 4 is usually vowel.

For example, in WRITE, I is vowel.

PRIDE, I vowel.

DRIVE, I vowel.

GRIPE, I vowel.

Or O, like PROSE, P,R,O,S,E. PROSE: P,R,O,S,E. S is consonant, O vowel.

All good.

Now, which one to choose. I want to test letters that are frequent.

For instance, S, T, L, etc.

In ""PRIDE"", letters P,I,D.

P is frequent, I vowel, D consonant.

In ""TRIPE"", T,R,I,P,E T and P.

But E and R fixed.

Perhaps ""SPIRE"" but position 2 R? S,P,I,R,E has position 2=P? Not R. Must be _ R _ _ E.

So ""SPIRE"" doesn't work.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" has position 2=H.

Not.

""STARE"" S,T,A,R,E but A is out, and position 2=T.

Need position 2=R.

"" CRANE"" was first guess, not helpful.

""GRACE"" but C out.

Another common word: ""PRUNE"" or ""PROBE"" but not E end, or PROBE E at end? P,R,O,B,E yes, but O and B.

But let's see what letters are covered.

I think ""PRIME"" is good: P,R,I,M,E.

P, I, M are new.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" D,R,I,V,E.

D,I,V new.

""WRITE"" W,R,I,T,E. W,I,T new.

I should choose one with T or S, common letters.

S is very common.

Any word with S? But position 2 R, so _ R S _ E? Like ARISE but A out, not.

ERASE E,R,A,S,E, but A out, and E at start.

""ERASE"" has position 1=E,2=R,3=A,4=S,5=E.

But A is out, so not possible.

""CRISE"" not common.

""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E A out.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" C out.

Hard to include S in this pattern.

Position 4 S, like _ R ? S E

Example: PARSE but A out, MERSE not word, VERSE V,E,R,S,E, position 1=V,2=E? Not R second. Verse is V-E-R-S-E so pos2=E.

We need pos2=R.

So WORSE W,O,R,S,E pos2=O? W-O-R-S-E, pos2=O, pos3=R? Not.

It's difficult to have S with R at pos2 and E at pos5.

Another: FORES maybe not, FORES not standard.

Perhaps ""PURSE"", P,U,R,S,E but position? P-U-R-S-E, pos2=U, pos3=R? Not.

pos2 not R.

In ""_ R _ _ E"", with pos2=R, it's hard to have S easily.

Similarly, T: position 4 T, like _ R I T E, which is WRITE, TRITE, etc.

WRITE works.

GRATE but A out.

PRITE not word.

So WRITE: W,R,I,T,E.

Letters: W, R, I, T, E.

R and E known, W, I, T new.

I is a vowel, W and T are consonants.

Since A is out, possible vowels are E (fixed), and I or O or U.

I is common.

Perhaps try with O.

_ R O _ E, like PROSE, GROVE, etc.

GROVE: G,R,O,V,E.

G, O, V new.

But O might be good to test.

Since only E is known vowel, testing another vowel is wise.

In first feedback, A is not present, so secret word might have I or O or U.

Testing I could be good.

Similarly, common consonants like D, L, S, T.

But S is tricky in pos1 or pos3.

For example, pos1 S: S R ? ? E

Like SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E, pos2=H not R.

S R I _ E not common, SRIPE not word.

SUREE not.

STREE not word.

Only option is like ""SERRE"" or rare words.

Not good.

Similarly, position 3 S: _ R S _ E, like URSE? not, ERSE not common, ARSE A out.

ORSE not.

So difficult to include S in this position.

Therefore, I might avoid S for now and focus on other letters.

Similarly for T, in position 4 it can be, like in WRITE.

Or position 1, like T R I _ E, TRICE C out, TRIPE is T,R,I,P,E, pos4=P.

TRIP E, but P.

Same as before.

Perhaps ""TROVE"" but O and V, ends with E? T,R,O,V,E yes.

TROVE.

I think TRIPE is a fine choice: T,R,I,P,E.

Letters: T, I, P new.

Similarly, PRIDE has P,I,D.

To decide: let's consider frequency.

In English, frequent letters: E,T,A,O,I,N,S,H,R. But E and R are known present, A,N absent, so T,O,I,S,H possible.

S we can't easily include, so T,O,I,H.

H can be tested.

e.g., _ R H _ E, like OHRE? not, RHINE? but N out, SHREW ends W.

Not many options.

So perhaps not H.

Similarly O: as in PROSE or TRODE? not.

PROSE: P,R,O,S,E, S is difficult, but let's accept if it's a word.

PROSE is a word: P-R-O-S-E.

Positions: 1=P,2=R,3=O,4=S,5=E.

Yes, and S and O can be tested.

But in feedback, I might get info on O and S.

Similarly, BROSE not common.

Good point.

I could use ""PROSE"" but I think PRISE might be variant, but PROSE is fine.

PROSE: meaning a type of writing.

Valid.

But S in position 4.

Similarly, another word: ""GRISE"" might not be common.

""ROUSE"" but position 2=O, not R.

No.

So PROSE is an option.

But let's compare to TRIPE or WRITE.

Since we have limited options, and to make progress.

Perhaps a word with U.

""PRUDE"" P,R,U,D,E.

U vowel.

But U less frequent.

I think I, O are better vowels to test.

Similarly, consonants like D, L, M, etc.

Back to the feedback.

Secret word: first letter unknown, thikrd unknown, fourth unknown, with R and E fixed.

Since in first guess, E is correctly placed at position 5, and R at position 2.

No other letters present, meaning no duplicates mentioned, but in ""crane"", all letters were tested.

C, A, N absent.

For the new word, I should guess one that has R in position 2, E in position 5, and others new.

Possible words: TRIPE, PRIDE, DRIVE, GRIPE, WRITE, etc.

I'll go with ""WRITE"" because it gives W in position 1, I in position 3, T in position 4, all common letters.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T in pos1, I pos3, P pos4.

Almost same.

""PRIME"" might be better, M instead of T or D.

M is less frequent than T.

Let's check letter frequency.

Common consonants: T, N, S, R, H, D, L, etc. But N excluded, S hard to place, H harder, D is possible, L is possible.

For L: _ R L _ E, like CARLE not, MARLE not, ARLE not, WORLE not.

Few options, like ""PERLE"" or rare, not good.

Similarly, D: _ R I D E, like BRIDE, PRIDE, but we can.

""PRIDE"" has P and D.

""DRIVE"" D R I V E.

V is less common.

So perhaps ""PRIDE"" or ""WRITE"".

""WRITE"" for T.

In Wordle strategies, testing T is often good.

Since S is common but hard to place, save for later.

So I'll go with ""WRITE"".

Guess: W R I T E.

Position 2 R correct, position 5 E correct, as per rule, and W,I,T new.

After this, feedback will tell about W, I, T.

If I is present or not, etc.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" for P and D.

But T might be better.

I think both fine.

I'll choose ""WRITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""crane"", we know:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form _ R _ _ E, and we must avoid using C, A, or N in the new guess.

To maximize information, the next guess should include new common letters (such as consonants like T, S, L, or vowels like I, O) to test their presence and positions. Avoiding repeated letters from the initial guess is also helpful to cover more possibilities. Words like ""write"" fit the pattern (position 2: R, position 5: E), and it includes letters not yet tested: W (position 1), I (position 3), T (position 4). This helps probe for vowels and high-frequency consonants.

Given this, ""write"" is a strong choice for the second guess.

That means:\n\n- R is in the word and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is R.\n\n- E is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the feedback is E(✓), but let\'s check the position. In ""crane"", E is the fifth letter. So E is in the fifth position and correct. So the secret word has E as the fifth letter.\n\n- C, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, from this:\n\n- Position 2: R is fixed. Must be R.\n\n- Position 5: E is fixed. Must be E.\n\n- C, A, N are not in the word. So we know that any letter except C, A, N could be in other positions, but specifically, since A and N are out, and C is out.\n\nNow, positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled.\n\nWe have _ R _ _ E as the target word.\n\nLetters not in word: C, A, N.\n\nOther letters are possible.\n\nI need to make a new guess that respects this feedback.\n\nThe new guess must:\n\n- Have R in the second position.\n\n- Have E in the fifth position.\n\n- Avoid using C, A, N anywhere, since they are not in the word.\n\nAlso, it should be a valid English 5-letter word.\n\nNow, considering common words, I should try to include other common vowels or consonants to test more letters.\n\nThe secret word has E and R, so vowels might be limited; E is already in.\n\nPossible vowels: E is used, but there might be another vowel? Position 1,3,4 could have vowels.\n\nBut A is out, so vowels like I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nCommon consonants.\n\nSince position 1 and 5 are fixed in the sense that we know E is at the end, and R is second.\n\nPossible words ending with E: many verbs or nouns.\n\nBut with R in second position.\n\nFor example: words like ""PRIDE"", but let\'s see.\n\n""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E.\n\nBut we need to avoid C, A, N.\n\nIn ""PRIDE"", positions: 1=P, 2=R (good), 3=I, 4=D, 5=E (good).\n\nNow, does this use C, A, N? No, P, I, D, E, R are all not forbidden except that C,A,N are out.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P, I, D are in or not yet.\n\nFeedback will tell us about I and D and P.\n\nPerhaps a better choice is to use different letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nO is a vowel, but A is out.\n\nLet me think of words that start with various letters, have R second, end with E.\n\nExamples:\n\n- BR_ E: like BRINE, BRIDE, BRACE but C and A are out, so BRINE or BRIDE.\n\nBRINE: B, R, I, N, E. But N is not in word? Feedback said N(x), so N is not in word. So BRINE has N, which can\'t be in secret word. So invalid guess? No, I can guess it, but it would be wasteful because N is already known absent.\n\nSimilarly, BRACE has C, which is absent.\n\nSo better to avoid C,A,N.\n\nFor ""BR_ E"", possible: BRIDE (B,R,I,D,E) or BRISE? Not common, BRUSE? Not word.\n\nBRINE invalid due to N.\n\nOther options: TR_ E, like TRIBE but E is fifth, TR_ E, e.g., TRADE but A is out, TRICE but C out.\n\nTRIPE: T,R,I,P,E all not forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, PRICE but C out, so PRIDE or PRIME.\n\nPRIME: P,R,I,M,E.\n\nGR_ E: GRIME, GRIPE, etc.\n\nBut let\'s list possible.\n\nCommon possibilities: I can try ""PRIDE"" or ""TRIPE"" to test I and P or T etc.\n\nBut perhaps include more new letters.\n\nSince E is at end, E might not be the only vowel, but A is excluded.\n\nPossible secret words: _ R _ _ E. With C,A,N not present.\n\nOptions: DRIVE, DRONE but N out, DROVE, DRILL but LL not, single L but DRILE not word.\n\nCommon words: PRICE but C out, PRIZE? P,R,I,Z,E.\n\nYes.\n\nOther: FRAME but A out, FRUIT but T and U, but ends with T, not E? No, position 5 E.\n\nSo must end with E.\n\nFROZE? Not E.\n\nFocus on words like: STORE? S,T,O,R,E but position 2 is T? No, for our guess, position 2 must be R, so like S R _ _ E? Not common.\n\nPosition 1: consonant or vowel, position 2: R, position 3: vowel or consonant, position 4: something, position 5: E.\n\nTypically, position 3 is often a vowel.\n\nSo words with patterns like _ R I _ E or _ R O _ E, etc.\n\nFor example: BRIDE, PRICE (C out), PRIDE, TRIPE, GRIPE, STRIE? Not common, SHIRE, WHILE but E not fifth, WHINE but N out.\n\nSHIRE: S,H,I,R,E, position 2 is H? No, for ""_ R _ _ E"", so first letter S, second R? SHIRE is S,H,I,R,E so position 2 is H, not R. We need position 2 to be R.\n\nCorrect pattern: first letter, second is R, third letter, fourth, fifth E.\n\nSo: _ R ? ? E\n\nLetters: B R I D E, C R E A M but A out, C out, D R O M E? Not E at end, D R I B E? Not word.\n\nCommon ones: WRITE? W,R,I,T,E, but position 5 T? No, W,R,I,T,E has fifth as E? W-R-I-T-E, positions: 1=W, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E yes.\n\nYes, WRITE is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, PRIDE: P,R,I,D,E\n\nTRIPE: T,R,I,P,E\n\nGRIPE: G,R,I,P,E\n\nDRIVE: D,R,I,V,E\n\nEtc.\n\nAll end with E.\n\nTo maximize information, since we have only two known positions, we should guess a word with new letters that aren\'t used yet, except R and E which are fixed.\n\nR and E are in word, but we know their positions are correct except for R which might be elsewhere? No, only one R, but it could have multiples, but feedback showed R(✓) meaning that specific R is correct.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nBut other Rs? Since R(✓), and no indication of another R, possibility, but we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nIn this guess, I should avoid repeating letters to test more.\n\n""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E, all distinct except we don\'t care about repeats for now.\n\nBut in new guess, since only R and E are known present, and position fixed.\n\nKnown present: R and E, with positions fixed: pos2 R, pos5 E.\n\nKnown absent: C, A, N.\n\nOther letters: possible.\n\nTo cover more ground, I could choose a word with common consonants or vowels.\n\nSince position 3 and 4 need vowels? Not necessarily, but often.\n\nPosition 1: often consonant.\n\nIn English words ending with E, position 3 or 4 is usually vowel.\n\nFor example, in WRITE, I is vowel.\n\nPRIDE, I vowel.\n\nDRIVE, I vowel.\n\nGRIPE, I vowel.\n\nOr O, like PROSE, P,R,O,S,E. PROSE: P,R,O,S,E. S is consonant, O vowel.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, which one to choose. I want to test letters that are frequent.\n\nFor instance, S, T, L, etc.\n\nIn ""PRIDE"", letters P,I,D.\n\nP is frequent, I vowel, D consonant.\n\nIn ""TRIPE"", T,R,I,P,E T and P.\n\nBut E and R fixed.\n\nPerhaps ""SPIRE"" but position 2 R? S,P,I,R,E has position 2=P? Not R. Must be _ R _ _ E.\n\nSo ""SPIRE"" doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRE"" has position 2=H.\n\nNot.\n\n""STARE"" S,T,A,R,E but A is out, and position 2=T.\n\nNeed position 2=R.\n\n"" CRANE"" was first guess, not helpful.\n\n""GRACE"" but C out.\n\nAnother common word: ""PRUNE"" or ""PROBE"" but not E end, or PROBE E at end? P,R,O,B,E yes, but O and B.\n\nBut let\'s see what letters are covered.\n\nI think ""PRIME"" is good: P,R,I,M,E.\n\nP, I, M are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIVE"" D,R,I,V,E.\n\nD,I,V new.\n\n""WRITE"" W,R,I,T,E. W,I,T new.\n\nI should choose one with T or S, common letters.\n\nS is very common.\n\nAny word with S? But position 2 R, so _ R S _ E? Like ARISE but A out, not.\n\nERASE E,R,A,S,E, but A out, and E at start.\n\n""ERASE"" has position 1=E,2=R,3=A,4=S,5=E.\n\nBut A is out, so not possible.\n\n""CRISE"" not common.\n\n""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E A out.\n\nPerhaps ""TRICE"" C out.\n\nHard to include S in this pattern.\n\nPosition 4 S, like _ R ? S E\n\nExample: PARSE but A out, MERSE not word, VERSE V,E,R,S,E, position 1=V,2=E? Not R second. Verse is V-E-R-S-E so pos2=E.\n\nWe need pos2=R.\n\nSo WORSE W,O,R,S,E pos2=O? W-O-R-S-E, pos2=O, pos3=R? Not.\n\nIt\'s difficult to have S with R at pos2 and E at pos5.\n\nAnother: FORES maybe not, FORES not standard.\n\nPerhaps ""PURSE"", P,U,R,S,E but position? P-U-R-S-E, pos2=U, pos3=R? Not.\n\npos2 not R.\n\nIn ""_ R _ _ E"", with pos2=R, it\'s hard to have S easily.\n\nSimilarly, T: position 4 T, like _ R I T E, which is WRITE, TRITE, etc.\n\nWRITE works.\n\nGRATE but A out.\n\nPRITE not word.\n\nSo WRITE: W,R,I,T,E.\n\nLetters: W, R, I, T, E.\n\nR and E known, W, I, T new.\n\nI is a vowel, W and T are consonants.\n\nSince A is out, possible vowels are E (fixed), and I or O or U.\n\nI is common.\n\nPerhaps try with O.\n\n_ R O _ E, like PROSE, GROVE, etc.\n\nGROVE: G,R,O,V,E.\n\nG, O, V new.\n\nBut O might be good to test.\n\nSince only E is known vowel, testing another vowel is wise.\n\nIn first feedback, A is not present, so secret word might have I or O or U.\n\nTesting I could be good.\n\nSimilarly, common consonants like D, L, S, T.\n\nBut S is tricky in pos1 or pos3.\n\nFor example, pos1 S: S R ? ? E\n\nLike SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E, pos2=H not R.\n\nS R I _ E not common, SRIPE not word.\n\nSUREE not.\n\nSTREE not word.\n\nOnly option is like ""SERRE"" or rare words.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 S: _ R S _ E, like URSE? not, ERSE not common, ARSE A out.\n\nORSE not.\n\nSo difficult to include S in this position.\n\nTherefore, I might avoid S for now and focus on other letters.\n\nSimilarly for T, in position 4 it can be, like in WRITE.\n\nOr position 1, like T R I _ E, TRICE C out, TRIPE is T,R,I,P,E, pos4=P.\n\nTRIP E, but P.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps ""TROVE"" but O and V, ends with E? T,R,O,V,E yes.\n\nTROVE.\n\nI think TRIPE is a fine choice: T,R,I,P,E.\n\nLetters: T, I, P new.\n\nSimilarly, PRIDE has P,I,D.\n\nTo decide: let\'s consider frequency.\n\nIn English, frequent letters: E,T,A,O,I,N,S,H,R. But E and R are known present, A,N absent, so T,O,I,S,H possible.\n\nS we can\'t easily include, so T,O,I,H.\n\nH can be tested.\n\ne.g., _ R H _ E, like OHRE? not, RHINE? but N out, SHREW ends W.\n\nNot many options.\n\nSo perhaps not H.\n\nSimilarly O: as in PROSE or TRODE? not.\n\nPROSE: P,R,O,S,E, S is difficult, but let\'s accept if it\'s a word.\n\nPROSE is a word: P-R-O-S-E.\n\nPositions: 1=P,2=R,3=O,4=S,5=E.\n\nYes, and S and O can be tested.\n\nBut in feedback, I might get info on O and S.\n\nSimilarly, BROSE not common.\n\nGood point.\n\nI could use ""PROSE"" but I think PRISE might be variant, but PROSE is fine.\n\nPROSE: meaning a type of writing.\n\nValid.\n\nBut S in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""GRISE"" might not be common.\n\n""ROUSE"" but position 2=O, not R.\n\nNo.\n\nSo PROSE is an option.\n\nBut let\'s compare to TRIPE or WRITE.\n\nSince we have limited options, and to make progress.\n\nPerhaps a word with U.\n\n""PRUDE"" P,R,U,D,E.\n\nU vowel.\n\nBut U less frequent.\n\nI think I, O are better vowels to test.\n\nSimilarly, consonants like D, L, M, etc.\n\nBack to the feedback.\n\nSecret word: first letter unknown, thikrd unknown, fourth unknown, with R and E fixed.\n\nSince in first guess, E is correctly placed at position 5, and R at position 2.\n\nNo other letters present, meaning no duplicates mentioned, but in ""crane"", all letters were tested.\n\nC, A, N absent.\n\nFor the new word, I should guess one that has R in position 2, E in position 5, and others new.\n\nPossible words: TRIPE, PRIDE, DRIVE, GRIPE, WRITE, etc.\n\nI\'ll go with ""WRITE"" because it gives W in position 1, I in position 3, T in position 4, all common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPE"" has T in pos1, I pos3, P pos4.\n\nAlmost same.\n\n""PRIME"" might be better, M instead of T or D.\n\nM is less frequent than T.\n\nLet\'s check letter frequency.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, S, R, H, D, L, etc. But N excluded, S hard to place, H harder, D is possible, L is possible.\n\nFor L: _ R L _ E, like CARLE not, MARLE not, ARLE not, WORLE not.\n\nFew options, like ""PERLE"" or rare, not good.\n\nSimilarly, D: _ R I D E, like BRIDE, PRIDE, but we can.\n\n""PRIDE"" has P and D.\n\n""DRIVE"" D R I V E.\n\nV is less common.\n\nSo perhaps ""PRIDE"" or ""WRITE"".\n\n""WRITE"" for T.\n\nIn Wordle strategies, testing T is often good.\n\nSince S is common but hard to place, save for later.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""WRITE"".\n\nGuess: W R I T E.\n\nPosition 2 R correct, position 5 E correct, as per rule, and W,I,T new.\n\nAfter this, feedback will tell about W, I, T.\n\nIf I is present or not, etc.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" for P and D.\n\nBut T might be better.\n\nI think both fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""WRITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""crane"", we know:\n- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form _ R _ _ E, and we must avoid using C, A, or N in the new guess.\n\nTo maximize information, the next guess should include new common letters (such as consonants like T, S, L, or vowels like I, O) to test their presence and positions. Avoiding repeated letters from the initial guess is also helpful to cover more possibilities. Words like ""write"" fit the pattern (position 2: R, position 5: E), and it includes letters not yet tested: W (position 1), I (position 3), T (position 4). This helps probe for vowels and high-frequency consonants.\n\nGiven this, ""write"" is a strong choice for the second guess.\n\n<guess>write</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: write -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(x) T(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""write"" -> W(x) R(✓) I(x) T(✓) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct (as expected).
- T is correct and in position 4 (since T(✓) at position 4 of ""write"").
- W is absent (x).
- I is absent (x).

So, from ""write"":
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- W and I are not in the word.

Now, combining both feedbacks:

Known correct positions:
- Position 2: R
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

So the secret word has the form: _ R _ T E

Known absent letters: C, A, N, W, I

Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and now we add W and I to the absent list.

Therefore, absent letters: C, A, N, W, I

Now, we need to fill position 1 and position 3.

Position 1: must be a letter not in {C, A, N, W, I}
Position 3: must be a letter not in {C, A, N, W, I}

Moreover, the entire word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 1: any consonant or vowel except the absent ones. But note that position 1 is often a consonant, but not always (e.g., ""urine"", but U might be possible).

Common letters that are not absent: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z. But we should consider common ones.

Similarly for position 3.

Now, the word pattern is _ R _ T E

We need to think of common words that fit this pattern and use only available letters.

Examples:
- BRUTE: B R U T E -> positions: 1=B, 2=R, 3=U, 4=T, 5=E. But we don't know about U and B yet.
- GRATE: but A is absent, so no.
- PRATE: A absent.
- FRITE: not a common word.
- DRIVE: but I is absent, so no.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> 1=D, 2=R, 3=O, 4=T? No, in DROVE, position 4 is V, not T. We need position 4 to be T, so the word must have T at position 4.

The pattern is fixed: position 4 is T, so the word must end with ""T E"", but actually it's _ R _ T E, so the last two are T and E, with T at 4 and E at 5.

So words ending in ""TE"" are common, like ""WRITE"" but we tried, or ""ROUTE"", ""SAUTE"", etc.

But let's list possible words:

- BRUTE: B R U T E
- CRUTE: not a word, and C absent.
- DRUTE: not a word.
- FRUTE: not.
- GRUTE: not.
- PRUTE: not.
- TRUTE: not.

- BRUTE is one.

- CHUTE: but C absent and H at position 3? C H U T E, position 1=C (absent), so invalid.

- FLUTE: F L U T E, but position 1=F, 2=L? Not R. Pattern requires position 2=R, so not.

Our pattern has position 2 fixed as R, so we need the second letter to be R.

So only words with R at position 2 and T at position 4.

Another: ""GRATE"" but A absent.

""PRICE"" but C absent and I absent.

""TRICE"" C absent and I absent.

""WRITE"" we tried.

""TRITE"" T R I T E, but I is absent, and also position 1=T, but in TRITE, positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E. But I is absent, so not possible.

Similarly, ""FRITE"" not a word.

""CRATE"" C and A absent.

So what words are there?

Perhaps ""BRUTE"" is one.

""PRUNE"" but N absent and position 4=N? P R U N E, position 4=N, not T.

We need position 4=T.

""ROUTE"": R O U T E, but position 1=R? R O U T E, position 1=R, 2=O, 3=U, 4=T, 5=E. But position 2 is O, not R. We need position 2 to be R, so first letter must be something else.

In ""ROUTE"", position 2 is O.

We need the word to have the second letter R, so first letter can be various.

Another: ""TRUCE"" but C absent and position 4=E? T R U C E, position 4=C, not T.

Not.

Perhaps ""BROTE"" not word.

Let's think of words like ""GRATE"" but A out.

Maybe ""DRATE"" not word.

""SHUTE"" not, and S possible but position.

Another idea: ""ERASE"" but E R A S E, A absent, and position 4=S, not T.

Not.

Perhaps I missed some words.

""BRINE"" but N absent and I absent.

""PRONE"" P R O N E, position 4=N, not T.

""TRONE"" T R O N E, position 4=N? T R O N E, positions: 1=T,2=R,3=O,4=N,5=E. Position 4 is N, not T. And N absent.

Not.

""GROPE"" G R O P E, position 4=P, not T.

""TROPE"" T R O P E, position 4=P.

Not T.

""TROVE"" T R O V E, position 4=V.

Not.

""PROVE"" P R O V E, position 4=V.

Not.

""BRIDE"" B R I D E, position 4=D, not T. And I absent.

Not.

""TRIDE"" not word.

""STRIP"" but ends with P, not E.

We need E at end.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" but C and I absent.

I think I need to consider that position 3 might be a vowel or consonant.

Common words with pattern _ R _ T E:

- BRUTE: B R U T E
- PRUDE: P R U D E, but position 4=D, not T. P R U D E, position 4=D.

Not.

- CRWTH: not, and C absent.

- WRATH: W absent and A absent.

- FRITH: not common, and position 4=H? F R I T H, but I absent and ends with H.

Not.

Perhaps ""ARETE"" but A absent and position 2=R? A R E T E, position 2=R, 3=E, 4=T, 5=E. But A absent, and E at position 3? But E is already at 5, but it could be duplicate? Feedback didn't show duplicate E in first guess? In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but if there is another E, it might not be indicated if not in the guess.

In ""crane"", we had E at position 5, and it was marked correct, but if there is an E at position 3, it wouldn't be known because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, in ""write"", we have E at 5 correct, but no E at other positions guessed.

So secret word could have multiple E's.

For example, ""ARETE"" but A is absent, so not.

""ERASE"" A absent.

""URATE"" U R A T E, A absent.

Not.

""OVATE"" O V A T E, A absent and position 2=V? O V A T E, position 2=V, not R.

Not.

I think ""BRUTE"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""GRATE"" is out due to A.

Perhaps ""TRUCE"" out.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending with ""TE"" and second letter R.

Using common knowledge:

- brute
- crate (but C and A out)
- frate (not common)
- grate (A out)
- prate (A out)
- trite (I out)
- write (we tried, and I out)

But brute is one.

Also, ""droit"" not ending with E.

""Route"" has position 2=O.

Another: ""feste"" not, second letter E.

Perhaps ""brite"" not standard.

Or ""prite"" not.

I think ""BRUTE"" is the most common.

But let's confirm: B-R-U-T-E, which is a word.

Similarly, ""PRUTE"" not.

""DRUSE"" not, position 4=S.

Not.

So probably ""BRUTE"" is a candidate.

But we have position 3 to fill, which is U in this case.

U is a vowel, and since A and I are out, U or O or Y might be possible.

Y as vowel, like in ""TRYST"" but not E end.

For position 3, it could be a consonant, but in this pattern, it's often a vowel.

For example, ""ERST"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""WROTE"" W R O T E, but W is absent, so not possible.

W is absent.

Similarly, ""TRODE"" not E end.

""PROTE"" not word.

""BROME"" B R O M E, position 4=M, not T.

Not.

So back to ""BRUTE"".

Perhaps ""CREST"" but C absent and position 4=S, not T.

Not.

I think we have to go with ""BRUTE"" or similar.

But is there a word with O? Like ""PROTE"" not.

""ROTCE"" not.

Another possibility: ""TRADE"" but A absent.

So I think ""BRUTE"" is a good guess.

But let's see if there are others.

""FRATE"" is not common, but ""FRATER"" is 6 letters.

""GRITH"" not.

Perhaps ""URBAN"" but not E end.

I think for now, ""BRUTE"" is acceptable.

In ""BRUTE"", we have B and U to test.

B is a common consonant, U is a vowel.

If not, we can try other.

But we have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""PRUNE"" but N absent and position 4=N.

Not.

""DRONE"" N absent.

""PHONE"" position 2=H.

Not.

So I think ""BRUTE"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's double-check the feedback.

From guess 2, T is correct at position 4, so the word has T at 4.

And E at 5.

R at 2.

Absent: C,A,N,W,I.

So for position 1 and 3, letters not in absent list.

Position 1: possible B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z

But common: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,S,U,V,Y

Position 3: similarly, but must form a word.

With pattern _ R _ T E

Words:
- brute (B and U)
- chute (C absent)
- flute (position 2=L)
- route (position 2=O)
- suite (position 2=U? S U I T E, position 2=U, not R)
- quite (Q U I T E, position 2=U)
- trite (I absent)
- write (tried)

Also, ""dirty"" not E end.

""forte"" F O R T E, but position 2=O, not R. F-O-R-T-E, position 2=O.

Not.

""grate"" A out.

So indeed, ""BRUTE"" seems to be the only common word.

""PRUDE"" is P R U D E, but position 4=D, not T.

Not.

""CRUDE"" C absent and position 4=D.

Not.

""TRUED"" not word.

So I think ""BRUTE"" is the best bet.

Perhaps ""GRUFE"" not word.

Or ""BRUSK"" not E end.

So I'll go with ""BRUTE"".

But in ""BRUTE"", U is at position 3.

If U is not in the word, we'll know.

Similarly, B at position 1.

After this, we can narrow down.

Perhaps there is a word with S.

For example, ""ERST"" not 5 letters.

""FIRST"" position 2=I? F-I-R-S-T, position 2=I, not R.

Not.

""BURSE"" B U R S E, position 2=U, not R.

Not.

""PRESE"" P R E S E, but position 3=E, and E is at 5, but position 3 E might be possible.

""PRESE"" is not common, but ""PRESET"" is 6 letters.

""PRESE"" might be accepted? But let's see, P-R-E-S-E, positions: 1=P,2=R,3=E,4=S,5=E.

But position 3=E, and we have E at position 5, so duplicate E possible.

But in feedback from ""crane"", we only know E at 5 is present, but not about other positions.

Similarly, in ""write"", no E at position 3.

So ""PRESE"" could be a word? I think ""prese"" is not standard English. More common is ""press"" or ""prees"" not.

""PRISE"" P R I S E, but I absent.

Not.

So not.

Therefore, ""BRUTE"" is the word to guess.

So next guess: ""BRUTE""

<guess>brute</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""write""** → Feedback: W(x), R(✓), I(x), T(✓), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - R (position 2) and E (position 5) are confirmed correct (as expected).  
  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - W and I are not in the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **Position 2 = R, Position 4 = T, Position 5 = E**, so the word structure is: `_ R _ T E`.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, W, I (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: Position 1 and Position 3.
- Position 1 must be a letter not in the absent list (common possibilities: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, Y, etc.).
- Position 3 must also be a letter not in the absent list, and it should form a valid English word with the fixed letters.

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The goal is to test new common letters for positions 1 and 3 while adhering to the pattern `_ R _ T E`.
- After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""brute"", ""prude"", ""grate"" – but ""grate"" has A which is absent, ""prude"" has D at position 4 instead of T), ""brute"" is a strong candidate:
  - It fits the pattern: B (position 1), R (position 2), U (position 3), T (position 4), E (position 5).
  - It tests new letters: B (common consonant) and U (vowel, since A and I are absent, U is a plausible vowel to test).
  - If ""brute"" is incorrect, the feedback will provide information about B and U, narrowing down possibilities for future guesses (e.g., if B is absent, position 1 could be D, G, P, etc.; if U is absent, position 3 could be O, L, S, etc.).

Given the above, ""brute"" is a valid and strategic guess for this step.

<guess>brute</guess>",brute,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""write"" -> W(x) R(✓) I(x) T(✓) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct (as expected).
- T is correct and in position 4 (since T(✓) at position 4 of ""write"").
- W is absent (x).
- I is absent (x).

So, from ""write"":
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- W and I are not in the word.

Now, combining both feedbacks:

Known correct positions:
- Position 2: R
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

So the secret word has the form: _ R _ T E

Known absent letters: C, A, N, W, I

Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and now we add W and I to the absent list.

Therefore, absent letters: C, A, N, W, I

Now, we need to fill position 1 and position 3.

Position 1: must be a letter not in {C, A, N, W, I}
Position 3: must be a letter not in {C, A, N, W, I}

Moreover, the entire word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 1: any consonant or vowel except the absent ones. But note that position 1 is often a consonant, but not always (e.g., ""urine"", but U might be possible).

Common letters that are not absent: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z. But we should consider common ones.

Similarly for position 3.

Now, the word pattern is _ R _ T E

We need to think of common words that fit this pattern and use only available letters.

Examples:
- BRUTE: B R U T E -> positions: 1=B, 2=R, 3=U, 4=T, 5=E. But we don't know about U and B yet.
- GRATE: but A is absent, so no.
- PRATE: A absent.
- FRITE: not a common word.
- DRIVE: but I is absent, so no.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> 1=D, 2=R, 3=O, 4=T? No, in DROVE, position 4 is V, not T. We need position 4 to be T, so the word must have T at position 4.

The pattern is fixed: position 4 is T, so the word must end with ""T E"", but actually it's _ R _ T E, so the last two are T and E, with T at 4 and E at 5.

So words ending in ""TE"" are common, like ""WRITE"" but we tried, or ""ROUTE"", ""SAUTE"", etc.

But let's list possible words:

- BRUTE: B R U T E
- CRUTE: not a word, and C absent.
- DRUTE: not a word.
- FRUTE: not.
- GRUTE: not.
- PRUTE: not.
- TRUTE: not.

- BRUTE is one.

- CHUTE: but C absent and H at position 3? C H U T E, position 1=C (absent), so invalid.

- FLUTE: F L U T E, but position 1=F, 2=L? Not R. Pattern requires position 2=R, so not.

Our pattern has position 2 fixed as R, so we need the second letter to be R.

So only words with R at position 2 and T at position 4.

Another: ""GRATE"" but A absent.

""PRICE"" but C absent and I absent.

""TRICE"" C absent and I absent.

""WRITE"" we tried.

""TRITE"" T R I T E, but I is absent, and also position 1=T, but in TRITE, positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E. But I is absent, so not possible.

Similarly, ""FRITE"" not a word.

""CRATE"" C and A absent.

So what words are there?

Perhaps ""BRUTE"" is one.

""PRUNE"" but N absent and position 4=N? P R U N E, position 4=N, not T.

We need position 4=T.

""ROUTE"": R O U T E, but position 1=R? R O U T E, position 1=R, 2=O, 3=U, 4=T, 5=E. But position 2 is O, not R. We need position 2 to be R, so first letter must be something else.

In ""ROUTE"", position 2 is O.

We need the word to have the second letter R, so first letter can be various.

Another: ""TRUCE"" but C absent and position 4=E? T R U C E, position 4=C, not T.

Not.

Perhaps ""BROTE"" not word.

Let's think of words like ""GRATE"" but A out.

Maybe ""DRATE"" not word.

""SHUTE"" not, and S possible but position.

Another idea: ""ERASE"" but E R A S E, A absent, and position 4=S, not T.

Not.

Perhaps I missed some words.

""BRINE"" but N absent and I absent.

""PRONE"" P R O N E, position 4=N, not T.

""TRONE"" T R O N E, position 4=N? T R O N E, positions: 1=T,2=R,3=O,4=N,5=E. Position 4 is N, not T. And N absent.

Not.

""GROPE"" G R O P E, position 4=P, not T.

""TROPE"" T R O P E, position 4=P.

Not T.

""TROVE"" T R O V E, position 4=V.

Not.

""PROVE"" P R O V E, position 4=V.

Not.

""BRIDE"" B R I D E, position 4=D, not T. And I absent.

Not.

""TRIDE"" not word.

""STRIP"" but ends with P, not E.

We need E at end.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" but C and I absent.

I think I need to consider that position 3 might be a vowel or consonant.

Common words with pattern _ R _ T E:

- BRUTE: B R U T E
- PRUDE: P R U D E, but position 4=D, not T. P R U D E, position 4=D.

Not.

- CRWTH: not, and C absent.

- WRATH: W absent and A absent.

- FRITH: not common, and position 4=H? F R I T H, but I absent and ends with H.

Not.

Perhaps ""ARETE"" but A absent and position 2=R? A R E T E, position 2=R, 3=E, 4=T, 5=E. But A absent, and E at position 3? But E is already at 5, but it could be duplicate? Feedback didn't show duplicate E in first guess? In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but if there is another E, it might not be indicated if not in the guess.

In ""crane"", we had E at position 5, and it was marked correct, but if there is an E at position 3, it wouldn't be known because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, in ""write"", we have E at 5 correct, but no E at other positions guessed.

So secret word could have multiple E's.

For example, ""ARETE"" but A is absent, so not.

""ERASE"" A absent.

""URATE"" U R A T E, A absent.

Not.

""OVATE"" O V A T E, A absent and position 2=V? O V A T E, position 2=V, not R.

Not.

I think ""BRUTE"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""GRATE"" is out due to A.

Perhaps ""TRUCE"" out.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending with ""TE"" and second letter R.

Using common knowledge:

- brute
- crate (but C and A out)
- frate (not common)
- grate (A out)
- prate (A out)
- trite (I out)
- write (we tried, and I out)

But brute is one.

Also, ""droit"" not ending with E.

""Route"" has position 2=O.

Another: ""feste"" not, second letter E.

Perhaps ""brite"" not standard.

Or ""prite"" not.

I think ""BRUTE"" is the most common.

But let's confirm: B-R-U-T-E, which is a word.

Similarly, ""PRUTE"" not.

""DRUSE"" not, position 4=S.

Not.

So probably ""BRUTE"" is a candidate.

But we have position 3 to fill, which is U in this case.

U is a vowel, and since A and I are out, U or O or Y might be possible.

Y as vowel, like in ""TRYST"" but not E end.

For position 3, it could be a consonant, but in this pattern, it's often a vowel.

For example, ""ERST"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""WROTE"" W R O T E, but W is absent, so not possible.

W is absent.

Similarly, ""TRODE"" not E end.

""PROTE"" not word.

""BROME"" B R O M E, position 4=M, not T.

Not.

So back to ""BRUTE"".

Perhaps ""CREST"" but C absent and position 4=S, not T.

Not.

I think we have to go with ""BRUTE"" or similar.

But is there a word with O? Like ""PROTE"" not.

""ROTCE"" not.

Another possibility: ""TRADE"" but A absent.

So I think ""BRUTE"" is a good guess.

But let's see if there are others.

""FRATE"" is not common, but ""FRATER"" is 6 letters.

""GRITH"" not.

Perhaps ""URBAN"" but not E end.

I think for now, ""BRUTE"" is acceptable.

In ""BRUTE"", we have B and U to test.

B is a common consonant, U is a vowel.

If not, we can try other.

But we have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""PRUNE"" but N absent and position 4=N.

Not.

""DRONE"" N absent.

""PHONE"" position 2=H.

Not.

So I think ""BRUTE"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's double-check the feedback.

From guess 2, T is correct at position 4, so the word has T at 4.

And E at 5.

R at 2.

Absent: C,A,N,W,I.

So for position 1 and 3, letters not in absent list.

Position 1: possible B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z

But common: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,S,U,V,Y

Position 3: similarly, but must form a word.

With pattern _ R _ T E

Words:
- brute (B and U)
- chute (C absent)
- flute (position 2=L)
- route (position 2=O)
- suite (position 2=U? S U I T E, position 2=U, not R)
- quite (Q U I T E, position 2=U)
- trite (I absent)
- write (tried)

Also, ""dirty"" not E end.

""forte"" F O R T E, but position 2=O, not R. F-O-R-T-E, position 2=O.

Not.

""grate"" A out.

So indeed, ""BRUTE"" seems to be the only common word.

""PRUDE"" is P R U D E, but position 4=D, not T.

Not.

""CRUDE"" C absent and position 4=D.

Not.

""TRUED"" not word.

So I think ""BRUTE"" is the best bet.

Perhaps ""GRUFE"" not word.

Or ""BRUSK"" not E end.

So I'll go with ""BRUTE"".

But in ""BRUTE"", U is at position 3.

If U is not in the word, we'll know.

Similarly, B at position 1.

After this, we can narrow down.

Perhaps there is a word with S.

For example, ""ERST"" not 5 letters.

""FIRST"" position 2=I? F-I-R-S-T, position 2=I, not R.

Not.

""BURSE"" B U R S E, position 2=U, not R.

Not.

""PRESE"" P R E S E, but position 3=E, and E is at 5, but position 3 E might be possible.

""PRESE"" is not common, but ""PRESET"" is 6 letters.

""PRESE"" might be accepted? But let's see, P-R-E-S-E, positions: 1=P,2=R,3=E,4=S,5=E.

But position 3=E, and we have E at position 5, so duplicate E possible.

But in feedback from ""crane"", we only know E at 5 is present, but not about other positions.

Similarly, in ""write"", no E at position 3.

So ""PRESE"" could be a word? I think ""prese"" is not standard English. More common is ""press"" or ""prees"" not.

""PRISE"" P R I S E, but I absent.

Not.

So not.

Therefore, ""BRUTE"" is the word to guess.

So next guess: ""BRUTE""
