We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback:
  - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letter N is in the secret word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
  - Includes the letter N, but not in the 4th position.
  - Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Since N is in the word, we should try to place it in a different position. The possible positions for N are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it cannot be in 4).

We also want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

Let's think of common 5-letter words that include N and avoid C, R, A, E.

Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has N and uses other common letters.

For example:
  - We could try ""LIONS"", but note that we have to avoid R (which is absent) and S is common. However, ""LIONS"" has S at the end and N in the third position? Let's check: L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""LIONS"", the positions are: L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know N cannot be in the 4th position. So we avoid putting N in the 4th.

We need a word with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to think of words with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about O, I, S, Y yet. But note: we must avoid A, E, R, C.

""NOISY"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters.

But we can also consider other words.

Another idea: since we have only one known letter (N) and we know it's not in the 4th, we might want to test multiple new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a different position and also includes other common letters.

Let me list some words:
  - N in position 1: ""NATAL"" -> but has A (absent) -> invalid.
  - ""NOTES"" -> has E (absent) and T, S. But E is absent -> invalid.
  - ""NOUNS"" -> has O, U, N, S. But N appears twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we can use it. But note: we have to avoid A, E, R, C. ""NOUNS"": N(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But wait, we cannot put N in the 4th position? Because our feedback says N is in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, we already know it's wrong. So that would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in the 4th.

Therefore, for ""NOUNS"", we have N in 1st and 4th. The 4th is known to be wrong, so we are effectively only testing N in the 1st and the other letters. But we might get confused if the word has two N's? It's possible, but we don't know. So it's better to avoid putting N in the 4th again.

So let's avoid the 4th position for N.

Another word: ""SONIC"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.

""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we cannot put N in the 4th. So avoid.

""JOINT"": same issue.

""MINTS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). Here N is in the 3rd position. This seems good. It avoids the absent letters: no C, R, A, E. And we are testing M, I, T, S as well.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has M, I, T, S. This is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""WINDS"": W(1), I(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). Also avoids the absent letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""SUNNY"" but has two N's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting N in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if the word has two N's. And we are avoiding the 4th? Actually, in ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But we are putting N in the 4th again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste. So avoid.

Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.

""PUNCH"" -> same.

""FUNGI"" -> has G and I, but no absent letters? Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5). But we are putting N in the 3rd and avoiding the 4th? Actually, we are putting N in the 3rd and G in the 4th. This is acceptable. But we don't know about F, U, G, I.

However, we have two candidates: ""MINTS"" and ""WINDS"" and ""FUNGI"".

We can also consider ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). Again, N in 3rd.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

In ""MINTS"": we have M, I, N, T, S -> all common and we are testing 5 new letters (except N which we know is present). Also, note that we are testing N in the 3rd position.

In ""WINDS"": W, I, N, D, S -> W is less common, but D is common.

In ""FUNGI"": F, U, N, G, I -> F and G are less common than T and S.

So ""MINTS"" seems better because it uses more common consonants.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

So I think ""MINTS"" is a good second guess.

Let me confirm: 
  M: new, position 1
  I: new, position 2
  N: known to be in the word, but we are testing it in position 3 (which might be correct or not)
  T: new, position 4
  S: new, position 5

We are not repeating any known absent letters.

Therefore, we choose ""MINTS"".

But wait: the feedback for the first guess said N is in the word but not in the 4th position. In ""MINTS"", we are putting N in the 3rd, which is a different position. So that's good.

So our second guess: ""MINTS""

<guess>mints</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **N** is **present** but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains **N** (must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The word **excludes C, R, A, E**.
- We have **5 new tries** remaining.

### Strategy for the second guess:
1. **Include N** in a position other than 4th (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Avoid C, R, A, E** entirely.
3. Prioritize **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, D, M) to maximize information.
4. Choose a word with **no repeating letters** to cover more ground.

Selected **""MINTS""** because:
- Places **N in the 3rd position** (new slot to test).
- Uses **high-frequency letters**: M, I, T, S (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Tests multiple positions at once.

Let me confirm: 
  M: new, position 1

Therefore, for ""NOUNS"", we have N in 1st and 4th. The 4th is known to be wrong, so we are effectively only testing N in the 1st and the other letters. But we might get confused if the word has two N's? It's possible, but we don't know. So it's better to avoid putting N in the 4th again.

So let's avoid the 4th position for N.

Another word: ""SONIC"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.

""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we cannot put N in the 4th. So avoid.

""JOINT"": same issue.

""MINTS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). Here N is in the 3rd position. This seems good. It avoids the absent letters: no C, R, A, E. And we are testing M, I, T, S as well.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has M, I, T, S. This is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""WINDS"": W(1), I(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). Also avoids the absent letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""SUNNY"" but has two N's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting N in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if the word has two N's. And we are avoiding the 4th? Actually, in ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But we are putting N in the 4th again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste. So avoid.

Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.

""PUNCH"" -> same.

""FUNGI"" -> has G and I, but no absent letters? Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5). But we are putting N in the 3rd and avoiding the 4th? Actually, we are putting N in the 3rd and G in the 4th. This is acceptable. But we don't know about F, U, G, I.

However, we have two candidates: ""MINTS"" and ""WINDS"" and ""FUNGI"".

We can also consider ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). Again, N in 3rd.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

In ""MINTS"": we have M, I, N, T, S -> all common and we are testing 5 new letters (except N which we know is present). Also, note that we are testing N in the 3rd position.

In ""WINDS"": W, I, N, D, S -> W is less common, but D is common.

In ""FUNGI"": F, U, N, G, I -> F and G are less common than T and S.

So ""MINTS"" seems better because it uses more common consonants.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

So I think ""MINTS"" is a good second guess.

Let me confirm: 
  M: new, position 1
  I: new, position 2
  N: known to be in the word, but we are testing it in position 3 (which might be correct or not)
  T: new, position 4
  S: new, position 5

We are not repeating any known absent letters.

Therefore, we choose ""MINTS"".

But wait: the feedback for the first guess said N is in the word but not in the 4th position. In ""MINTS"", we are putting N in the 3rd, which is a different position. So that's good.

So our second guess: ""MINTS""

<guess>mints</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **N** is **present** but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains **N** (must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The word **excludes C, R, A, E**.
- We have **5 new tries** remaining.

### Strategy for the second guess:
1. **Include N** in a position other than 4th (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Avoid C, R, A, E** entirely.
3. Prioritize **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, D, M) to maximize information.
4. Choose a word with **no repeating letters** to cover more ground.

Selected **""MINTS""** because:
- Places **N in the 3rd position** (new slot to test).
- Uses **high-frequency letters**: M, I, T, S (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Tests multiple positions at once.

We have two sets of feedback:

**Guess 1: ""crane""**
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: x → not in word
- N: - → in word but wrong position (not 4th)
- E: x → not in word

**Absent letters (definitely not in word)**: C, R, A, E

**Present letters (in word but position unknown)**:
- N (must be in positions 1,2,3, or 5)

**Guess 2: ""mints""**
- M: x → not in word
- I: ✓ → in word AND correct position (position 2)
- N: ✓ → in word AND correct position (position 3)
- T: x → not in word
- S: x → not in word

**New absent letters**: M, T, S → added to absent list: C, R, A, E, M, T, S

**New present and correct position**:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓) → we had already known N was in the word, but now we know it is fixed in position 3.

### Summary of known information:
1. **Correctly positioned letters**:
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: N
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, T, S
3. **Word structure so far**: _ I N _ _
   - Positions to fill: 1, 4, 5
4. **Known present letters not yet positioned**? We only know that N is present and now fixed. Previously, no other present letters were revealed besides N from the first guess, and now we have I and N fixed.

From the first guess, we only had N as present (but wrong position), and now in the second guess, that N is confirmed to be in position 3. Therefore, there are no other known present letters from previous guesses (since the first guess had no other present letters, and the second only confirmed I and N in their positions with the rest absent).

Therefore, the secret word has letters at positions 2 and 3 as I and N respectively. The rest positions 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

### Constraints:
- Available letters: All letters except C, R, A, E, M, T, S (and also not I, N because they are already placed? Actually, I and N are already used in their positions but could appear again? Wait, the rules don't say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are allowed? But so far, no indication.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, T, S.

But note: I and N are used in the word, but they could appear again? However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. For example, in the first guess, if there was a duplicate, the feedback might show two responses for that letter? But typically, Wordle-style games allow duplicate letters. So we cannot assume the word has unique letters. However, since we have no evidence of duplicates, it's safer to avoid them unless necessary.

But for this guess, we are not forced.

### Steps to form the next guess:
We know the word has the pattern: _ I N _ _ 

We need to fill the blanks (positions 1, 4, 5) with letters that are:
- Not in the absent list: so avoid C,R,A,E,M,T,S.
- Should include any known present letters? Currently, none besides what we have fixed.

But note: we have no other known present letters. So positions 1,4,5 must be letters chosen from the remaining alphabet.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And also, we can use I and N? But perhaps not necessary because they are already placed? Actually, the word might have duplicates? But without feedback indicating presence, we can avoid for now.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern _ I N _ _ and uses only available letters.

Additionally, common letters in English should be prioritized.

Common letters: L, O, P, U, etc.

We need a word that begins with an available letter, has I in second, N in third, and then two more available letters.

Forming such words:

Possible words: 
- Ending might be common patterns: e.g., D, L, K, O, U, etc.

Examples:
- ""DINKS"" -> but S is absent? In ""DINKS"": D(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> S is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINGO"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Available: D is available, G is available, O is available. So ""DINGO"" avoids the absent letters? Let check absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So D,G,O are okay.

But note: we must ensure the word is a valid English word.

Similarly, other words:
- ""WINKS"" -> W(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5). S is absent -> invalid.
- ""HINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""FINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.

We must avoid S at the end. So words ending with S are problematic.

Looking for words without the absent letters.

Another word: ""LINED"": but E is absent -> invalid.
""PINED"": E absent -> invalid.

What about ""BINGO""? B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Letters: B,G,O -> all not in the absent list? Yes: absent letters are C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So B,G,O are available.

""BINGO"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DINGY"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). But Y is available? Yes.

But we want as much new information as possible. We are testing positions 1,4,5.

We already know the word has I and N fixed. So for positions 1,4,5 we are going to test new letters.

In ""BINGO"": position 1=B, position 4=G, position 5=O.

In ""DINGY"": position 1=D, position 4=G, position 5=Y.

Which one tests more common letters? B, G, O vs D, G, Y.

G is common, O is more common than Y? So ""BINGO"" might be better.

We also have ""JINGO"" -> J is acceptable? J is allowed? Absent letters don't include J. So it's valid. J(1),I(2),N(3),G(4),O(5). But J is less common.

""LINGO"": L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). This is very good: L and G,O are common.

""LINGO"" is a word and uses L which is very common.

Similarly, ""PINGO"" is a word? Actually, ""PINGO"" might be accepted? But let's see: P I N G O.

But ""PINGO"" is not common. ""LINGO"" is better.

Another word: ""MINCE"" but M and E are absent -> invalid.

So ""BINGO"", ""LINGO"", ""DINGO"", etc.

Also, ""VINYL"": V(1),I(2),N(3),Y(4),L(5). This tests V,Y,L.

But L is at the end? And we have Y in the middle.

We want to maximize the chance of getting ✓ or - for the new positions.

Common beginnings and endings for English words? For position 1: common are B,D,H,L,P,W, etc. For position 5: common vowels or consonants? Often vowels are at the end? But note, we can use vowels? The absent vowels are A,E. So available vowels? I,O,U (but I is already used? But we can reuse? Wait: no, we cannot assume no duplicates. But in this case, using O might be good.

But note: we have O available.

So words ending with O are good? Like ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"".

Alternatives: words ending with L, like ""DAINT"": but T is absent -> invalid.

""FAINT"" - A and T absent -> invalid.

So best choices: ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"", etc.

We also have ""HINGE"" but E is absent -> invalid.

Similarly, ""KINGDOM"" is too long.

5-letter: ""DOING"" -> D(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But wait, this would require I in position 3? But we have I in position 2? Our pattern is _ I N _ _. So position 3 is N. In ""DOING"", N is in fourth? So that doesn't match the pattern.

We must have the pattern: letter1=I (but no: position 2 must be I), position 3 is N. So ""DOING"" doesn't fit because it would be D O I N G, so position2=O? But we need I in position2.

We cannot use words that don't have I in second and N in third.

So back to words like ""LINGO"".

Also, ""OINKY"" is not a word.

Another: ""WINES"" but S absent -> invalid.

So between ""BINGO"" and ""LINGO"": let's choose ""LINGO"" because L is more common than B? Actually, both are common. But ""LINGO"" is a very common word.

We could consider ""PINKO"" - P(1),I(2),N(3),K(4),O(5). This uses P,K,O. K and O are available? Absent letters: K is not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So K is okay? Yes.

""PINKO"" is a word? It might be accepted? But less common than ""LINGO"".

We are at third guess, so we have tries. But I think ""LINGO"" is better.

So I choose ""LINGO"".

Expected pattern: L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)

Letters tested: L, G, O -> all new and available.

So if the secret word is ""LINGO"", we'll win. If not, we get feedback on L, G, O.

Thus, we go with ""LINGO"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing previous feedback**:
   - **First Guess ""crane""**:
     - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → Absent letters: C, R, A, E. Present letter: N (not in position 4).
   - **Second Guess ""mints""**:
     - M(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x), S(x) → Absent letters added: M, T, S. Correct positions confirmed: I in position 2, N in position 3.
   - **Summary**:
     - Absent letters (10 total): C, R, A, E, M, T, S.
     - Known correct positions: Position 2 = I, Position 3 = N.
     - Word structure: `_ I N _ _` (positions 1, 4, and 5 unknown).
     - No other known present letters (only I and N confirmed).
     - All unknown positions (1, 4, 5) must use letters **not** in the absent list (available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

2. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Focus on filling positions 1, 4, and 5 with common available letters to test multiple options simultaneously.
   - Avoid reusing absent letters to prevent wasted guesses.
   - Prioritize high-frequency English letters (e.g., L, G, O) to maximize information gain.
   - Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ I N _ _`.

3. **Evaluating candidate words**:
   - **""lingo""**: Valid pattern (L in position 1, G in position 4, O in position 5). Uses common letters (L, G, O), all unavailable. High information potential.
   - **""bingo""**: Also valid (B, G, O) but less common starting consonants (B vs L).
   - **""dingy""**: Valid but includes Y (less common end letter) and repeats some letters tested in ""lingo"".
   - **Final choice**: ""lingo"" best balances common letter usage and test coverage.

4. **Expected information gain**:
   - Tests L (position 1), G (position 4), and O (position 5).
   - Feedback will determine if any of these are correct or misplaced, narrowing options for positions 1/4/5.
   - Reveals if duplicates exist in the secret word (e.g., if L/O/G appear elsewhere).

<guess>lingo</guess>",lingo,"We have two sets of feedback:

**Guess 1: ""crane""**
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: x → not in word
- N: - → in word but wrong position (not 4th)
- E: x → not in word

**Absent letters (definitely not in word)**: C, R, A, E

**Present letters (in word but position unknown)**:
- N (must be in positions 1,2,3, or 5)

**Guess 2: ""mints""**
- M: x → not in word
- I: ✓ → in word AND correct position (position 2)
- N: ✓ → in word AND correct position (position 3)

   - Positions to fill: 1, 4, 5
4. **Known present letters not yet positioned**? We only know that N is present and now fixed. Previously, no other present letters were revealed besides N from the first guess, and now we have I and N fixed.

From the first guess, we only had N as present (but wrong position), and now in the second guess, that N is confirmed to be in position 3. Therefore, there are no other known present letters from previous guesses (since the first guess had no other present letters, and the second only confirmed I and N in their positions with the rest absent).

Therefore, the secret word has letters at positions 2 and 3 as I and N respectively. The rest positions 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

### Constraints:
- Available letters: All letters except C, R, A, E, M, T, S (and also not I, N because they are already placed? Actually, I and N are already used in their positions but could appear again? Wait, the rules don't say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are allowed? But so far, no indication.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, T, S.

But note: I and N are used in the word, but they could appear again? However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. For example, in the first guess, if there was a duplicate, the feedback might show two responses for that letter? But typically, Wordle-style games allow duplicate letters. So we cannot assume the word has unique letters. However, since we have no evidence of duplicates, it's safer to avoid them unless necessary.

But for this guess, we are not forced.

### Steps to form the next guess:
We know the word has the pattern: _ I N _ _ 

We need to fill the blanks (positions 1, 4, 5) with letters that are:
- Not in the absent list: so avoid C,R,A,E,M,T,S.
- Should include any known present letters? Currently, none besides what we have fixed.

But note: we have no other known present letters. So positions 1,4,5 must be letters chosen from the remaining alphabet.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And also, we can use I and N? But perhaps not necessary because they are already placed? Actually, the word might have duplicates? But without feedback indicating presence, we can avoid for now.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern _ I N _ _ and uses only available letters.

Additionally, common letters in English should be prioritized.

Common letters: L, O, P, U, etc.

We need a word that begins with an available letter, has I in second, N in third, and then two more available letters.

Forming such words:

Possible words: 
- Ending might be common patterns: e.g., D, L, K, O, U, etc.

Examples:
- ""DINKS"" -> but S is absent? In ""DINKS"": D(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> S is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINGO"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Available: D is available, G is available, O is available. So ""DINGO"" avoids the absent letters? Let check absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So D,G,O are okay.

But note: we must ensure the word is a valid English word.

Similarly, other words:
- ""WINKS"" -> W(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5). S is absent -> invalid.
- ""HINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""FINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.

We must avoid S at the end. So words ending with S are problematic.

Looking for words without the absent letters.

Another word: ""LINED"": but E is absent -> invalid.
""PINED"": E absent -> invalid.

What about ""BINGO""? B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Letters: B,G,O -> all not in the absent list? Yes: absent letters are C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So B,G,O are available.

""BINGO"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DINGY"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). But Y is available? Yes.

But we want as much new information as possible. We are testing positions 1,4,5.

We already know the word has I and N fixed. So for positions 1,4,5 we are going to test new letters.

In ""BINGO"": position 1=B, position 4=G, position 5=O.

In ""DINGY"": position 1=D, position 4=G, position 5=Y.

Which one tests more common letters? B, G, O vs D, G, Y.

G is common, O is more common than Y? So ""BINGO"" might be better.

We also have ""JINGO"" -> J is acceptable? J is allowed? Absent letters don't include J. So it's valid. J(1),I(2),N(3),G(4),O(5). But J is less common.

""LINGO"": L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). This is very good: L and G,O are common.

""LINGO"" is a word and uses L which is very common.

Similarly, ""PINGO"" is a word? Actually, ""PINGO"" might be accepted? But let's see: P I N G O.

But ""PINGO"" is not common. ""LINGO"" is better.

Another word: ""MINCE"" but M and E are absent -> invalid.

So ""BINGO"", ""LINGO"", ""DINGO"", etc.

Also, ""VINYL"": V(1),I(2),N(3),Y(4),L(5). This tests V,Y,L.

But L is at the end? And we have Y in the middle.

We want to maximize the chance of getting ✓ or - for the new positions.

Common beginnings and endings for English words? For position 1: common are B,D,H,L,P,W, etc. For position 5: common vowels or consonants? Often vowels are at the end? But note, we can use vowels? The absent vowels are A,E. So available vowels? I,O,U (but I is already used? But we can reuse? Wait: no, we cannot assume no duplicates. But in this case, using O might be good.

But note: we have O available.

So words ending with O are good? Like ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"".

Alternatives: words ending with L, like ""DAINT"": but T is absent -> invalid.

""FAINT"" - A and T absent -> invalid.

So best choices: ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"", etc.

We also have ""HINGE"" but E is absent -> invalid.

Similarly, ""KINGDOM"" is too long.

5-letter: ""DOING"" -> D(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But wait, this would require I in position 3? But we have I in position 2? Our pattern is _ I N _ _. So position 3 is N. In ""DOING"", N is in fourth? So that doesn't match the pattern.

We must have the pattern: letter1=I (but no: position 2 must be I), position 3 is N. So ""DOING"" doesn't fit because it would be D O I N G, so position2=O? But we need I in position2.

We cannot use words that don't have I in second and N in third.

So back to words like ""LINGO"".

Also, ""OINKY"" is not a word.

Another: ""WINES"" but S absent -> invalid.

So between ""BINGO"" and ""LINGO"": let's choose ""LINGO"" because L is more common than B? Actually, both are common. But ""LINGO"" is a very common word.

We could consider ""PINKO"" - P(1),I(2),N(3),K(4),O(5). This uses P,K,O. K and O are available? Absent letters: K is not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So K is okay? Yes.

""PINKO"" is a word? It might be accepted? But less common than ""LINGO"".

We are at third guess, so we have tries. But I think ""LINGO"" is better.

So I choose ""LINGO"".

Expected pattern: L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)

Letters tested: L, G, O -> all new and available.

So if the secret word is ""LINGO"", we'll win. If not, we get feedback on L, G, O.

Thus, we go with ""LINGO"".

<guess>lingo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing previous feedback**:
   - **First Guess ""crane""**:
     - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → Absent letters: C, R, A, E. Present letter: N (not in position 4).
   - **Second Guess ""mints""**:
     - M(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x), S(x) → Absent letters added: M, T, S. Correct positions confirmed: I in position 2, N in position 3.
   - **Summary**:
     - Absent letters (10 total): C, R, A, E, M, T, S.
     - Known correct positions: Position 2 = I, Position 3 = N.
     - Word structure: `_ I N _ _` (positions 1, 4, and 5 unknown).
     - No other known present letters (only I and N confirmed).
     - All unknown positions (1, 4, 5) must use letters **not** in the absent list (available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

2. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Focus on filling positions 1, 4, and 5 with common available letters to test multiple options simultaneously.
   - Avoid reusing absent letters to prevent wasted guesses.
   - Prioritize high-frequency English letters (e.g., L, G, O) to maximize information gain.
   - Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ I N _ _`.

3. **Evaluating candidate words**:
   - **""lingo""**: Valid pattern (L in position 1, G in position 4, O in position 5). Uses common letters (L, G, O), all unavailable. High information potential.
   - **""bingo""**: Also valid (B, G, O) but less common starting consonants (B vs L).
   - **""dingy""**: Valid but includes Y (less common end letter) and repeats some letters tested in ""lingo"".
   - **Final choice**: ""lingo"" best balances common letter usage and test coverage.

4. **Expected information gain**:
   - Tests L (position 1), G (position 4), and O (position 5).
   - Feedback will determine if any of these are correct or misplaced, narrowing options for positions 1/4/5.
   - Reveals if duplicates exist in the secret word (e.g., if L/O/G appear elsewhere).",Guess 3: lingo -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,DINGY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback:
  - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letter N is in the secret word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
  - Includes the letter N, but not in the 4th position.
  - Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Since N is in the word, we should try to place it in a different position. The possible positions for N are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it cannot be in 4).

We also want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

Let's think of common 5-letter words that include N and avoid C, R, A, E.

Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has N and uses other common letters.

For example:
  - We could try ""LIONS"", but note that we have to avoid R (which is absent) and S is common. However, ""LIONS"" has S at the end and N in the third position? Let's check: L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""LIONS"", the positions are: L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know N cannot be in the 4th position. So we avoid putting N in the 4th.

We need a word with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to think of words with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about O, I, S, Y yet. But note: we must avoid A, E, R, C.

""NOISY"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters.

But we can also consider other words.

Another idea: since we have only one known letter (N) and we know it's not in the 4th, we might want to test multiple new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a different position and also includes other common letters.

Let me list some words:
  - N in position 1: ""NATAL"" -> but has A (absent) -> invalid.
  - ""NOTES"" -> has E (absent) and T, S. But E is absent -> invalid.
  - ""NOUNS"" -> has O, U, N, S. But N appears twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we can use it. But note: we have to avoid A, E, R, C. ""NOUNS"": N(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But wait, we cannot put N in the 4th position? Because our feedback says N is in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, we already know it's wrong. So that would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in the 4th.

Therefore, for ""NOUNS"", we have N in 1st and 4th. The 4th is known to be wrong, so we are effectively only testing N in the 1st and the other letters. But we might get confused if the word has two N's? It's possible, but we don't know. So it's better to avoid putting N in the 4th again.

So let's avoid the 4th position for N.

Another word: ""SONIC"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.

""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we cannot put N in the 4th. So avoid.

""JOINT"": same issue.

""MINTS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). Here N is in the 3rd position. This seems good. It avoids the absent letters: no C, R, A, E. And we are testing M, I, T, S as well.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has M, I, T, S. This is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""WINDS"": W(1), I(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). Also avoids the absent letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""SUNNY"" but has two N's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting N in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if the word has two N's. And we are avoiding the 4th? Actually, in ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But we are putting N in the 4th again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste. So avoid.

Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.

""PUNCH"" -> same.

""FUNGI"" -> has G and I, but no absent letters? Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5). But we are putting N in the 3rd and avoiding the 4th? Actually, we are putting N in the 3rd and G in the 4th. This is acceptable. But we don't know about F, U, G, I.

However, we have two candidates: ""MINTS"" and ""WINDS"" and ""FUNGI"".

We can also consider ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). Again, N in 3rd.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

In ""MINTS"": we have M, I, N, T, S -> all common and we are testing 5 new letters (except N which we know is present). Also, note that we are testing N in the 3rd position.

In ""WINDS"": W, I, N, D, S -> W is less common, but D is common.

In ""FUNGI"": F, U, N, G, I -> F and G are less common than T and S.

So ""MINTS"" seems better because it uses more common consonants.

But note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

So I think ""MINTS"" is a good second guess.

Let me confirm: 
  M: new, position 1
  I: new, position 2
  N: known to be in the word, but we are testing it in position 3 (which might be correct or not)
  T: new, position 4
  S: new, position 5

We are not repeating any known absent letters.

Therefore, we choose ""MINTS"".

But wait: the feedback for the first guess said N is in the word but not in the 4th position. In ""MINTS"", we are putting N in the 3rd, which is a different position. So that's good.

So our second guess: ""MINTS""

<guess>mints</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **N** is **present** but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains **N** (must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The word **excludes C, R, A, E**.
- We have **5 new tries** remaining.

### Strategy for the second guess:
1. **Include N** in a position other than 4th (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Avoid C, R, A, E** entirely.
3. Prioritize **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, D, M) to maximize information.
4. Choose a word with **no repeating letters** to cover more ground.

Selected **""MINTS""** because:
- Places **N in the 3rd position** (new slot to test).
- Uses **high-frequency letters**: M, I, T, S (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Tests multiple positions at once.

**New present and correct position**:

### Summary of known information:
1. **Correctly positioned letters**:
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: N
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, T, S

4. **Known present letters not yet positioned**? We only know that N is present and now fixed. Previously, no other present letters were revealed besides N from the first guess, and now we have I and N fixed.

From the first guess, we only had N as present (but wrong position), and now in the second guess, that N is confirmed to be in position 3.

- Should include any known present letters? Currently, none besides what we have fixed.

But note: we have no other known present letters. So positions 1,4,5 must be letters chosen from the remaining alphabet.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And also, we can use I and N? But perhaps not necessary because they are already placed? Actually, the word might have duplicates? But without feedback indicating presence, we can avoid for now.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern _ I N _ _ and uses only available letters.

Common letters: L, O, P, U, etc.

We need a word that begins with an available letter, has I in second, N in third, and then two more available letters.

Forming such words:

- Ending might be common patterns: e.g., D, L, K, O, U, etc.

Examples:
- ""DINKS"" -> but S is absent? In ""DINKS"": D(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> S is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINGO"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Available: D is available, G is available, O is available. So ""DINGO"" avoids the absent letters? Let check absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So D,G,O are okay.

- ""HINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""FINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.

We must avoid S at the end. So words ending with S are problematic.

Looking for words without the absent letters.

Another word: ""LINED"": but E is absent -> invalid.
""PINED"": E absent -> invalid.

What about ""BINGO""? B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Letters: B,G,O -> all not in the absent list? Yes: absent letters are C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So B,G,O are available.

""BINGO"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DINGY"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). But Y is available? Yes.

But we want as much new information as possible. We are testing positions 1,4,5.

We already know the word has I and N fixed. So for positions 1,4,5 we are going to test new letters.

In ""BINGO"": position 1=B, position 4=G, position 5=O.

In ""DINGY"": position 1=D, position 4=G, position 5=Y.

Which one tests more common letters? B, G, O vs D, G, Y.

G is common, O is more common than Y? So ""BINGO"" might be better.

We also have ""JINGO"" -> J is acceptable? J is allowed? Absent letters don't include J. So it's valid. J(1),I(2),N(3),G(4),O(5). But J is less common.

But L is at the end? And we have Y in the middle.

Common beginnings and endings for English words? For position 1: common are B,D,H,L,P,W, etc. For position 5: common vowels or consonants? Often vowels are at the end? But note, we can use vowels? The absent vowels are A,E. So available vowels? I,O,U (but I is already used? But we can reuse? Wait: no, we cannot assume no duplicates. But in this case, using O might be good.

But note: we have O available.

So words ending with O are good? Like ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"".

Alternatives: words ending with L, like ""DAINT"": but T is absent -> invalid.

""FAINT"" - A and T absent -> invalid.

So best choices: ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"", etc.

We also have ""HINGE"" but E is absent -> invalid.

Similarly, ""KINGDOM"" is too long.

5-letter: ""DOING"" -> D(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But wait, this would require I in position 3? But we have I in position 2? Our pattern is _ I N _ _. So position 3 is N. In ""DOING"", N is in fourth? So that doesn't match the pattern.

We must have the pattern: letter1=I (but no: position 2 must be I), position 3 is N. So ""DOING"" doesn't fit because it would be D O I N G, so position2=O? But we need I in position2.

We cannot use words that don't have I in second and N in third.

So back to words like ""LINGO"".

Also, ""OINKY"" is not a word.

Another: ""WINES"" but S absent -> invalid.

So between ""BINGO"" and ""LINGO"": let's choose ""LINGO"" because L is more common than B? Actually, both are common. But ""LINGO"" is a very common word.

We could consider ""PINKO"" - P(1),I(2),N(3),K(4),O(5). This uses P,K,O. K and O are available? Absent letters: K is not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So K is okay? Yes.

""PINKO"" is a word? It might be accepted? But less common than ""LINGO"".

We are at third guess, so we have tries. But I think ""LINGO"" is better.

So I choose ""LINGO"".

Expected pattern: L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)

Letters tested: L, G, O -> all new and available.

So if the secret word is ""LINGO"", we'll win. If not, we get feedback on L, G, O.

Thus, we go with ""LINGO"".

<guess>lingo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing previous feedback**:
   - **First Guess ""crane""**:
     - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → Absent letters: C, R, A, E. Present letter: N (not in position 4).
   - **Second Guess ""mints""**:
     - M(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x), S(x) → Absent letters added: M, T, S. Correct positions confirmed: I in position 2, N in position 3.
   - **Summary**:
     - Absent letters (10 total): C, R, A, E, M, T, S.
     - Known correct positions: Position 2 = I, Position 3 = N.
     - Word structure: `_ I N _ _` (positions 1, 4, and 5 unknown).
     - No other known present letters (only I and N confirmed).
     - All unknown positions (1, 4, 5) must use letters **not** in the absent list (available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

2. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Focus on filling positions 1, 4, and 5 with common available letters to test multiple options simultaneously.
   - Avoid reusing absent letters to prevent wasted guesses.
   - Prioritize high-frequency English letters (e.g., L, G, O) to maximize information gain.
   - Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ I N _ _`.

3. **Evaluating candidate words**:
   - **""lingo""**: Valid pattern (L in position 1, G in position 4, O in position 5). Uses common letters (L, G, O), all unavailable. High information potential.
   - **""bingo""**: Also valid (B, G, O) but less common starting consonants (B vs L).
   - **""dingy""**: Valid but includes Y (less common end letter) and repeats some letters tested in ""lingo"".
   - **Final choice**: ""lingo"" best balances common letter usage and test coverage.

4. **Expected information gain**:
   - Tests L (position 1), G (position 4), and O (position 5).
   - Feedback will determine if any of these are correct or misplaced, narrowing options for positions 1/4/5.
   - Reveals if duplicates exist in the secret word (e.g., if L/O/G appear elsewhere).

Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n  - Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (since they are absent).\n  - Includes the letter N, but not in the 4th position.\n  - Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\nSince N is in the word, we should try to place it in a different position. The possible positions for N are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it cannot be in 4).\n\nWe also want to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E.\n\nLet\'s think of common 5-letter words that include N and avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nSome common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has N and uses other common letters.\n\nFor example:\n  - We could try ""LIONS"", but note that we have to avoid R (which is absent) and S is common. However, ""LIONS"" has S at the end and N in the third position? Let\'s check: L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""LIONS"", the positions are: L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know N cannot be in the 4th position. So we avoid putting N in the 4th.\n\nWe need a word with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words with N in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don\'t know about O, I, S, Y yet. But note: we must avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n""NOISY"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nAnother idea: since we have only one known letter (N) and we know it\'s not in the 4th, we might want to test multiple new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a different position and also includes other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words:\n  - N in position 1: ""NATAL"" -> but has A (absent) -> invalid.\n  - ""NOTES"" -> has E (absent) and T, S. But E is absent -> invalid.\n  - ""NOUNS"" -> has O, U, N, S. But N appears twice? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we can use it. But note: we have to avoid A, E, R, C. ""NOUNS"": N(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But wait, we cannot put N in the 4th position? Because our feedback says N is in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, we already know it\'s wrong. So that would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in the 4th.\n\nTherefore, for ""NOUNS"", we have N in 1st and 4th. The 4th is known to be wrong, so we are effectively only testing N in the 1st and the other letters. But we might get confused if the word has two N\'s? It\'s possible, but we don\'t know. So it\'s better to avoid putting N in the 4th again.\n\nSo let\'s avoid the 4th position for N.\n\nAnother word: ""SONIC"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.\n\n""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we cannot put N in the 4th. So avoid.\n\n""JOINT"": same issue.\n\n""MINTS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). Here N is in the 3rd position. This seems good. It avoids the absent letters: no C, R, A, E. And we are testing M, I, T, S as well.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has M, I, T, S. This is a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""WINDS"": W(1), I(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). Also avoids the absent letters.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""SUNNY"" but has two N\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting N in the 3rd and 5th? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. And we are avoiding the 4th? Actually, in ""SUNNY"": S(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But we are putting N in the 4th again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste. So avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""BUNCH"" -> has C (absent) -> invalid.\n\n""PUNCH"" -> same.\n\n""FUNGI"" -> has G and I, but no absent letters? Let\'s check: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5). But we are putting N in the 3rd and avoiding the 4th? Actually, we are putting N in the 3rd and G in the 4th. This is acceptable. But we don\'t know about F, U, G, I.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""MINTS"" and ""WINDS"" and ""FUNGI"".\n\nWe can also consider ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). Again, N in 3rd.\n\nBut note: we want to maximize the information. We should try to include as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nIn ""MINTS"": we have M, I, N, T, S -> all common and we are testing 5 new letters (except N which we know is present). Also, note that we are testing N in the 3rd position.\n\nIn ""WINDS"": W, I, N, D, S -> W is less common, but D is common.\n\nIn ""FUNGI"": F, U, N, G, I -> F and G are less common than T and S.\n\nSo ""MINTS"" seems better because it uses more common consonants.\n\nBut note: we are avoiding the absent letters: C, R, A, E.\n\nSo I think ""MINTS"" is a good second guess.\n\nLet me confirm: \n  M: new, position 1\n  I: new, position 2\n  N: known to be in the word, but we are testing it in position 3 (which might be correct or not)\n  T: new, position 4\n  S: new, position 5\n\nWe are not repeating any known absent letters.\n\nTherefore, we choose ""MINTS"".\n\nBut wait: the feedback for the first guess said N is in the word but not in the 4th position. In ""MINTS"", we are putting N in the 3rd, which is a different position. So that\'s good.\n\nSo our second guess: ""MINTS""\n\n<guess>mints</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **N** is **present** but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains **N** (must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The word **excludes C, R, A, E**.\n- We have **5 new tries** remaining.\n\n### Strategy for the second guess:\n1. **Include N** in a position other than 4th (test positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n2. **Avoid C, R, A, E** entirely.\n3.

We only know that N is present and now fixed. Previously, no other present letters were revealed besides N from the first guess, and now we have I and N fixed.\n\nFrom the first guess, we only had N as present (but wrong position), and now in the second guess, that N is confirmed to be in position 3. Therefore, there are no other known present letters from previous guesses (since the first guess had no other present letters, and the second only confirmed I and N in their positions with the rest absent).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has letters at positions 2 and 3 as I and N respectively. The rest positions 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Available letters: All letters except C, R, A, E, M, T, S (and also not I, N because they are already placed? Actually, I and N are already used in their positions but could appear again? Wait, the rules don\'t say the word has unique letters. So duplicates are allowed? But so far, no indication.\n\nWe must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, T, S.\n\nBut note: I and N are used in the word, but they could appear again? However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. For example, in the first guess, if there was a duplicate, the feedback might show two responses for that letter? But typically, Wordle-style games allow duplicate letters. So we cannot assume the word has unique letters. However, since we have no evidence of duplicates, it\'s safer to avoid them unless necessary.\n\nBut for this guess, we are not forced.\n\n### Steps to form the next guess:\nWe know the word has the pattern: _ I N _ _ \n\nWe need to fill the blanks (positions 1, 4, 5) with letters that are:\n- Not in the absent list: so avoid C,R,A,E,M,T,S.\n- Should include any known present letters? Currently, none besides what we have fixed.\n\nBut note: we have no other known present letters. So positions 1,4,5 must be letters chosen from the remaining alphabet.\n\nAvailable letters: All letters except C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nAnd also, we can use I and N? But perhaps not necessary because they are already placed? Actually, the word might have duplicates? But without feedback indicating presence, we can avoid for now.\n\nWe should choose a word that fits the pattern _ I N _ _ and uses only available letters.\n\nAdditionally, common letters in English should be prioritized.\n\nCommon letters: L, O, P, U, etc.\n\nWe need a word that begins with an available letter, has I in second, N in third, and then two more available letters.\n\nForming such words:\n\nPossible words: \n- Ending might be common patterns: e.g., D, L, K, O, U, etc.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DINKS"" -> but S is absent? In ""DINKS"": D(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> S is absent -> invalid.\n- ""DINGO"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Available: D is available, G is available, O is available. So ""DINGO"" avoids the absent letters? Let check absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So D,G,O are okay.\n\nBut note: we must ensure the word is a valid English word.\n\nSimilarly, other words:\n- ""WINKS"" -> W(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5). S is absent -> invalid.\n- ""HINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.\n- ""FINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.\n- ""KINDS"" -> S absent -> invalid.\n\nWe must avoid S at the end. So words ending with S are problematic.\n\nLooking for words without the absent letters.\n\nAnother word: ""LINED"": but E is absent -> invalid.\n""PINED"": E absent -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""BINGO""? B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Letters: B,G,O -> all not in the absent list? Yes: absent letters are C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So B,G,O are available.\n\n""BINGO"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""DINGY"" -> D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). But Y is available? Yes.\n\nBut we want as much new information as possible. We are testing positions 1,4,5.\n\nWe already know the word has I and N fixed. So for positions 1,4,5 we are going to test new letters.\n\nIn ""BINGO"": position 1=B, position 4=G, position 5=O.\n\nIn ""DINGY"": position 1=D, position 4=G, position 5=Y.\n\nWhich one tests more common letters? B, G, O vs D, G, Y.\n\nG is common, O is more common than Y? So ""BINGO"" might be better.\n\nWe also have ""JINGO"" -> J is acceptable? J is allowed? Absent letters don\'t include J. So it\'s valid. J(1),I(2),N(3),G(4),O(5). But J is less common.\n\n""LINGO"": L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). This is very good: L and G,O are common.\n\n""LINGO"" is a word and uses L which is very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""PINGO"" is a word? Actually, ""PINGO"" might be accepted? But let\'s see: P I N G O.\n\nBut ""PINGO"" is not common. ""LINGO"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""MINCE"" but M and E are absent -> invalid.\n\nSo ""BINGO"", ""LINGO"", ""DINGO"", etc.\n\nAlso, ""VINYL"": V(1),I(2),N(3),Y(4),L(5). This tests V,Y,L.\n\nBut L is at the end? And we have Y in the middle.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance of getting ✓ or - for the new positions.\n\nCommon beginnings and endings for English words? For position 1: common are B,D,H,L,P,W, etc. For position 5: common vowels or consonants? Often vowels are at the end? But note, we can use vowels? The absent vowels are A,E. So available vowels? I,O,U (but I is already used? But we can reuse? Wait: no, we cannot assume no duplicates. But in this case, using O might be good.\n\nBut note: we have O available.\n\nSo words ending with O are good? Like ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"".\n\nAlternatives: words ending with L, like ""DAINT"": but T is absent -> invalid.\n\n""FAINT"" - A and T absent -> invalid.\n\nSo best choices: ""LINGO"", ""BINGO"", etc.\n\nWe also have ""HINGE"" but E is absent -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""KINGDOM"" is too long.\n\n5-letter: ""DOING"" -> D(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But wait, this would require I in position 3? But we have I in position 2? Our pattern is _ I N _ _. So position 3 is N. In ""DOING"", N is in fourth? So that doesn\'t match the pattern.\n\nWe must have the pattern: letter1=I (but no: position 2 must be I), position 3 is N. So ""DOING"" doesn\'t fit because it would be D O I N G, so position2=O? But we need I in position2.\n\nWe cannot use words that don\'t have I in second and N in third.\n\nSo back to words like ""LINGO"".\n\nAlso, ""OINKY"" is not a word.\n\nAnother: ""WINES"" but S absent -> invalid.\n\nSo between ""BINGO"" and ""LINGO"": let\'s choose ""LINGO"" because L is more common than B? Actually, both are common. But ""LINGO"" is a very common word.\n\nWe could consider ""PINKO"" - P(1),I(2),N(3),K(4),O(5). This uses P,K,O. K and O are available? Absent letters: K is not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,M,T,S. So K is okay? Yes.\n\n""PINKO"" is a word? It might be accepted? But less common than ""LINGO"".\n\nWe are at third guess, so we have tries. But I think ""LINGO"" is better.\n\nSo I choose ""LINGO"".\n\nExpected pattern: L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)\n\nLetters tested: L, G, O -> all new and available.\n\nSo if the secret word is ""LINGO"", we\'ll win. If not, we get feedback on L, G, O.\n\nThus, we go with ""LINGO"".\n\n<guess>lingo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyzing previous feedback**:\n   - **First Guess ""crane""**:\n     - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → Absent letters: C, R, A, E.

We know the word is of the form: [letter1] I N G [letter5]

The absent letters are: A, C, E, L, M, O, R, S, T.

Therefore, the available letters for positions 1 and 5 are the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding the absent ones and the known present letters (I, N, G) if we assume no duplicates? But note, we don't have evidence of duplicates, but we cannot rule it out. However, since we have three letters already and two positions left, it's possible to have duplicates, but we haven't seen any indication so far.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicates. However, for now, we can try to avoid using I, N, G in the remaining positions unless necessary.

Available letters: 
All letters except: A, C, E, I, G, L, M, N, O, R, S, T.

But note: I, G, N are in the word, but they might appear again? But we don't know. However, for the purpose of testing new letters, we should try to use letters that we haven't tested yet.

The full set of absent letters: A, C, E, L, M, O, R, S, T.

The known present letters that are fixed: I (pos2), N (pos3), G (pos4). So for positions 1 and 5, we can use any letter not in the absent list and not necessarily avoiding I, N, G? But since we are trying to find the word, we can try to use new letters to get information.

But we only have two positions left, so we can try to guess the entire word.

The available letters for positions 1 and 5: 
The alphabet without A, C, E, L, M, O, R, S, T.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that is _ I N G _ 

So the word must be: [letter] I N G [letter]

We can list possible words:

- Ending with B: ? e.g., ""KINGB"" not a word.
- D: ""DINGY"" but Y is available? But ""DINGY"" has D in position 1 and Y in position 5? But in our pattern, position 1 and 5 are open. However, in ""DINGY"", the letters are D-I-N-G-Y, so position 1=D, position 5=Y. But we have to check if D and Y are available? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

But note: in guess 3, we used ""lingo"" and got L and O absent. So D and Y are available.

But is ""DINGY"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, other words:
- ""WINGY"" - not common, but might be accepted? But let's stick to common words.
- ""HINGE"" - but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""BINGE"" - E absent -> invalid.
- ""ZINGY"" - Z-I-N-G-Y -> Z and Y available? Yes. ""ZINGY"" is a word.

But we have to consider that we are at the fourth guess, and we have two positions. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

But note: we have only two positions to fill, so we can try a word that uses two new letters to test both at once.

We also have the possibility that the word might be ""KING"" something, but we need 5 letters.

Another common word: ""DOING"" - but O is absent -> invalid.

""GOING"" - G is already in position 4? But we are putting G in position 4? In ""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G -> but this doesn't match our pattern because position 2 is O? But we need position 2 to be I. So it doesn't fit.

We must have the pattern: ? I N G ?

So the word must have I in second, N in third, G in fourth.

So ""DINGY"" is one option: D-I-N-G-Y.

""ZINGY"": Z-I-N-G-Y.

""JINGO"": J-I-N-G-O -> but O is absent -> invalid.

""PINGO"": P-I-N-G-O -> O absent -> invalid.

""WINGY"": W-I-N-G-Y -> is this a word? It might be accepted as a variant, but ""WINGY"" is not common.

""BINGO"": B-I-N-G-O -> O absent -> invalid.

""KING"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""THING"" - T is absent -> invalid.

""FLING"" - F-L-I-N-G -> L is absent -> invalid.

""BRING"" - B-R-I-N-G -> R is absent -> invalid.

So the only common words I can think of are ""DINGY"" and ""ZINGY"".

But ""DINGY"" is more common.

Another word: ""HING"" is not 5 letters.

""VINYL"" - V-I-N-Y-L -> but L is absent -> invalid.

""MINNY"" - M is absent -> invalid.

""PINNY"" - P-I-N-N-Y -> but we have two N's? And we know N is in position 3, so if we put N in position 4? But we have G fixed in position 4 from the last feedback. So we cannot have N in position 4. So ""PINNY"" would have N in position 3 and 4? But we have G in position 4, so it doesn't fit.

We must have G in position 4.

So back to ""DINGY"" and ""ZINGY"".

But there is also ""SINGE"" - S and E absent -> invalid.

""TINGS"" - T and S absent -> invalid.

""RINGS"" - R and S absent -> invalid.

So the only options are words like ""DINGY"", ""ZINGY"", or perhaps ""KING"" with a suffix? But 5-letter.

Another word: ""WINGDING"" is too long.

Perhaps ""DEIGN"" - D-E-I-G-N -> but E is absent and also the pattern: D(1), E(2) but we need I in position 2 -> invalid.

""DYING"" - D-Y-I-N-G -> pattern: D(1), Y(2), I(3)? But we need I in position 2 and N in position 3. Here I is in position 3? So it doesn't match.

So we must have the second letter I and third N.

Therefore, the only common words I can think of are ""DINGY"" and ""ZINGY"".

But let's check: ""DINGY"" is an adjective meaning gloomy or drab. ""ZINGY"" means lively or energetic.

Both are valid.

We also have ""PING"" as a root, but with what? ""PINGO"" is not allowed because of O.

""JING"" not a word.

So between ""DINGY"" and ""ZINGY"", we should choose one.

But note: we have not tested D, Y, Z, etc.

We can choose ""DINGY"" because it uses more common letters? Or ""ZINGY"" because Z is less common and might be riskier.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: ""HING"" is not 5 letters, but ""HINNY"" - H-I-N-N-Y -> but we have two N's? And position 4 is G, not N. So it doesn't fit.

Therefore, we must go with either ""DINGY"" or ""ZINGY"".

I think ""DINGY"" is more common, so I'll go with that.

But let's see the feedback we got: in guess 3, we have G as correct in position 4, so we are confident.

So the word is either ""DINGY"" or ""ZINGY"" or perhaps another word we haven't thought of.

But we can try ""DINGY"".

If it's not, we get feedback and then we can adjust.

So guess: ""DINGY""

But wait, in ""DINGY"", the letters are D, I, N, G, Y.

We know I, N, G are fixed. So we are testing D in position 1 and Y in position 5.

If the secret word is ""DINGY"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on D and Y.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the fourth.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we can't test more than two new letters.

Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses different letters to cover more possibilities? But we don't have many options.

For example, if we try ""ZINGY"", we test Z and Y.

But we don't know which one.

Perhaps we can think of other words: what about ""BINGY""? Not a word.

""WINGY"" - might be accepted? But let's not.

""KING"" is 4 letters.

I think ""DINGY"" is the best shot.

But let's list all possible words from the available letters:

Position 1: B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 5: B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But the word must be a valid English word.

Common words:
- dingy
- zingy
- wingy (less common)
- jingy (not common)
- pingy (not common)

Also, ""doing"" is invalid because O is absent.

""dying"" doesn't fit pattern.

So I think ""dingy"" and ""zingy"" are the main options.

Perhaps ""vying"" but V-Y-I-N-G -> position 2 is Y? But we need I in position 2 -> invalid.

So I'll go with ""dingy"".

But note: in the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates, and ""dingy"" has no duplicates.

Similarly, ""zingy"" has no duplicates.

So let's choose ""dingy"".

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correctly positioned letters**:  
  - Position 2: I  
  - Position 3: N  
  - Position 4: G  
- **Absent letters (total)**: A, C, E, L, M, O, R, S, T (9 letters).  
- **Word pattern**: `[letter1] I N G [letter5]`  
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 5**: B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters not absent or already placed).  
- **Strategy for this guess**:  
  - Only positions 1 and 5 are unknown.  
  - Prioritize common English words fitting the pattern `_ I N G _` using available letters.  
  - Avoid absent letters and reuse of I/N/G unless necessary (no duplicates indicated yet).

### Evaluation of Candidate Words:
- **""dingy""**:  
  - D (position 1), Y (position 5).  
  - Valid word, uses common letters D and Y (both untested).  
  - Tests position 1 with D and position 5 with Y.  
- **""zingy""**:  
  - Z (position 1), Y (position 5).  
  - Valid but less common; Z is low-frequency.  
- **Other options**:  
  - ""wingy"" (uncommon), ""bingy"" (invalid), ""jingo"" (invalid due to O), ""hinge"" (invalid due to E).  
- **Best choice**: **""dingy""**  
  - Maximizes information by testing two new common letters (D and Y).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle; if not, feedback on D/Y will pinpoint the solution.
