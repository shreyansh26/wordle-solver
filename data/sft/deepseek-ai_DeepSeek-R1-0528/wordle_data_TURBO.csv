We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We received feedback for guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2).
 - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 Also, since R is present but not in the second position, it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we don't have any other letters known, we need to pick a word that:
 - Excludes the letters C, A, N, E (as they are not in the word).
 - Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - Tries to cover other common letters to get more feedback.

 Our first guess had vowels: A and E, but both are absent. So the word likely has other vowels: like O, I, U? Or sometimes Y.

 Common vowels to try: O, I, U.

 Also, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 We must avoid: C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of a word that includes R (not in the second position) and has other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - R could be at the start: first position? Or third, fourth, or fifth.

 We also want to confirm or rule out other vowels and consonants.

 Consider starting with a word that puts R in different positions and uses common remaining letters.

 Example words:
 - ""ROUST"": R at position 1, but feedback says R is not in position 2? Our R was in position 2 and is wrong, so R should not be in position 2, but could be in 1? 
   However, note: if R were in the first position in the secret word, then when we put R in the second position (as in ""crane""), it would show as '-' because it exists but in the wrong place. So it's still possible for R to be in the first position.

 But wait: in ""crane"", R is in the second position and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not here. So R could be in position 1, 3,4,5.

 Let me choose a word where R is in a different position, say position 1.

 Possible words: ""ROBOT""? But O appears twice and might not be efficient.

 Since we know the word doesn't have A or E, it might have other vowels: I, O, U.

 Another idea: ""PRIOR"" - but has two R's, which might be inefficient for gathering information.

 However, let's aim for a word with new letters.

 Let's list letters we haven't tried: we tried C,R,A,N,E. We avoid those except R.

 Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 But we want common ones.

 How about: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S.

 But note: R is in the second position? Wait, we must avoid R in the second position because our feedback said R is present but not in the second position? No, we can use R in a different position? Actually, in our next guess, we can put R in any position except the second? But we don't have to avoid the second, because we already know that if we put it in the second it will be a miss, so we can put it elsewhere.

 Actually, we can put R again? But we know R is present so we should reuse R to find its position.

 However, we cannot put R in the second position because we already know that's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but we know that if we put it in the second again, we will get the same '-' ? And we want to discover the correct position.

 So it's better to try R in a different position.

 Therefore, let me choose a word with R in the first position? Or third? etc.

 I'll choose R in the first position to test.

 Candidate: ""RISKY"" -> R,I,S,K,Y. But we don't know if these letters exist.

 Another: ""ROAST"" -> but A was absent? Wait, we have A as absent, so avoid A. ""ROAST"" has A, which we know is absent. So skip.

 How about ""ROUND""? Has R,O,U,N,D -> but N was absent in the first guess? Wait, we know N is absent.

 Similarly, avoid N and A and E and C.

 Okay, ""ROUND"": N is present? No, because we got N(x) in crane.

 So ""ROUND"" has N which we know is absent -> invalid.

 Let's pick a word without A,N,E,C and try R in a different position.

 Example: ""SPRIG"" -> S,P,R,I,G. S,P,R,I,G.

 But let's check if it has any forbidden letters? No A,N,E,C. Okay.

 However, it has R in the third position? We can try that.

 But note: we want to cover common letters. ""SPRIG"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Alternatively: ""STORM""? S,T,O,R,M.

 Also: no forbidden letters? Yes.

 But O: we don't know about O.

 Let me choose ""STORM"": S,T,O,R,M.

 How about ""TROMP""? That might not be very common.

 I think ""STORM"" is a good candidate: it has common letters and positions R in the fourth (so not second).

 So I'll guess ""STORM"".

 But wait: we know R is in the word and we are putting R in the fourth? That should help us see if R belongs there.

 Alternative: ""PROUD""? -> Has O,U,D. But avoids forbidden letters? Yes? C, A, N, E are forbidden? But U and O are new.

 However, let me stick with ""STORM"".

 Steps:
 - S: we don't know.
 - T: we don't know.
 - O: we don't know.
 - R: we know is present, but if we put it in fourth, we might get a '-' or '✓' depending on the secret word.
 - M: we don't know.

 This will give us feedback on S, T, O, M, and R's position (if we get R ✓ then we know it's fourth; if we get '-' it could be elsewhere).

 So, I'll go with ""STORM"".

 But note: we must not use forbidden letters: C,A,N,E. None of S,T,O,R,M are forbidden? Correct.

 Therefore: guess ""STORM"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)):
- The secret word contains the letter **R** but not in the second position.
- The letters **C, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word must use other vowels (e.g., O, I, U) or consonants since A and E are absent.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Including **R** in a new position (not the second) to test its location.
- Avoiding forbidden letters: **C, A, N, E**.
- Covering common letters (like **S, T, O, M**) for additional feedback.

**Selected word: ""STORM""**

- The letters **C, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word must use other vowels (e.g., O, I, U) or consonants since A and E are absent.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Including **R** in a new position (not the second) to test its location.
- Avoiding forbidden letters: **C, A, N, E**.
- Covering common letters (like **S, T, O, M**) for additional feedback.

**Selected word: ""STORM""**  
- Places R in the fourth position (new location).
- Tests vowels (O) and consonants (S, T, M) not covered in the first guess.
- Avoids forbidden letters while prioritizing high-frequency characters.

So the word likely has other vowels: like O, I, U? Or sometimes Y.\n\n Common vowels to try: O, I, U.\n\n Also, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\n We must avoid: C, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes R (not in the second position) and has other common letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n - R could be at the start: first position? Or third, fourth, or fifth.\n\n We also want to confirm or rule out other vowels and consonants.\n\n Consider starting with a word that puts R in different positions and uses common remaining letters.\n\n Example words:\n - ""ROUST"": R at position 1, but feedback says R is not in position 2? Our R was in position 2 and is wrong, so R should not be in position 2, but could be in 1? \n   However, note: if R were in the first position in the secret word, then when we put R in the second position (as in ""crane""), it would show as \'-\' because it exists but in the wrong place. So it\'s still possible for R to be in the first position.\n\n But wait: in ""crane"", R is in the second position and we got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not here. So R could be in position 1, 3,4,5.\n\n Let me choose a word where R is in a different position, say position 1.\n\n Possible words: ""ROBOT""? But O appears twice and might not be efficient.\n\n Since we know the word doesn\'t have A or E, it might have other vowels: I, O, U.\n\n Another idea: ""PRIOR"" - but has two R\'s, which might be inefficient for gathering information.\n\n However, let\'s aim for a word with new letters.\n\n Let\'s list letters we haven\'t tried: we tried C,R,A,N,E. We avoid those except R.\n\n Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n But we want common ones.\n\n How about: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S.\n\n But note: R is in the second position? Wait, we must avoid R in the second position because our feedback said R is present but not in the second position? No, we can use R in a different position? Actually, in our next guess, we can put R in any position except the second? But we don\'t have to avoid the second, because we already know that if we put it in the second it will be a miss, so we can put it elsewhere.\n\n Actually, we can put R again? But we know R is present so we should reuse R to find its position.\n\n However, we cannot put R in the second position because we already know that\'s not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but we know that if we put it in the second again, we will get the same \'-\' ? And we want to discover the correct position.\n\n So it\'s better to try R in a different position.\n\n Therefore, let me choose a word with R in the first position? Or third? etc.\n\n I\'ll choose R in the first position to test.\n\n Candidate: ""RISKY"" -> R,I,S,K,Y. But we don\'t know if these letters exist.\n\n Another: ""ROAST"" -> but A was absent? Wait, we have A as absent, so avoid A. ""ROAST"" has A, which we know is absent. So skip.\n\n How about ""ROUND""? Has R,O,U,N,D -> but N was absent in the first guess? Wait, we know N is absent.\n\n Similarly, avoid N and A and E and C.\n\n Okay, ""ROUND"": N is present? No, because we got N(x) in crane.\n\n So ""ROUND"" has N which we know is absent -> invalid.\n\n Let\'s pick a word without A,N,E,C and try R in a different position.\n\n Example: ""SPRIG"" -> S,P,R,I,G. S,P,R,I,G.\n\n But let\'s check if it has any forbidden letters? No A,N,E,C. Okay.\n\n However, it has R in the third position? We can try that.\n\n But note: we want to cover common letters. ""SPRIG"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively: ""STORM""? S,T,O,R,M.\n\n Also: no forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n But O: we don\'t know about O.\n\n Let me choose ""STORM"": S,T,O,R,M.\n\n How about ""TROMP""? That might not be very common.\n\n I think ""STORM"" is a good candidate: it has common letters and positions R in the fourth (so not second).\n\n So I\'ll guess ""STORM"".\n\n But wait: we know R is in the word and we are putting R in the fourth? That should help us see if R belongs there.\n\n Alternative: ""PROUD""? -> Has O,U,D. But avoids forbidden letters? Yes? C, A, N, E are forbidden? But U and O are new.\n\n However, let me stick with ""STORM"".\n\n Steps:\n - S: we don\'t know.\n - T: we don\'t know.\n - O: we don\'t know.\n - R: we know is present, but if we put it in fourth, we might get a \'-\' or \'✓\' depending on the secret word.\n - M: we don\'t know.\n\n This will give us feedback on S, T, O, M, and R\'s position (if we get R ✓ then we know it\'s fourth; if we get \'-\' it could be elsewhere).\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STORM"".\n\n But note: we must not use forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: storm -> S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ""storm"", positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So:
  S at pos1: x → not in word
  T at pos2: (-) → in word but not at position 2
  O at pos3: (-) → in word but not at position 3
  R at pos4: (-) → in word but not at position 4 (we already knew R is not at 2 from guess1, now also not at 4)
  M at pos5: x → not in word

So from both guesses:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, M

Letters that are in the word:
- R: but not at pos2 (from guess1) and not at pos4 (from guess2). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be at pos1, pos3, or pos5.
- T: in the word but not at pos2.
- O: in the word but not at pos3.

Also, T and O are new letters we now know are present.

Now, we need to consider the positions:

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Possible positions for T: any except 2? But note in ""storm"" it was at pos2 and was wrong position, so T could be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know.

Possible positions for O: any except 3? Could be at 1,2,4,5.

We also need to form a valid 5-letter word using R, T, O and other letters, but avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Since we know R is in the word (and must be placed at pos1,3, or5), and T and O are in the word.

Moreover, the secret word must contain at least these: R, T, O.

But there might be two more letters? Since it's 5 letters.

We don't know if there are more distinct letters.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test R in a new position (since in guess1 we tried pos2, guess2 pos4, so now we can try pos1 or pos3 or pos5).
- Test O and T in new positions.
- Include other common letters that we haven't tested: e.g., I, L, P, U, etc.

But avoid letters we know are absent: C,A,N,E,S,M.

Let me think of words that have R at position 1? Since we haven't tested R at position 1.

Also, if R is at position 1, then we can check if it's correct?

Similarly, we know O and T are present.

So candidate: words starting with R, that also contain T and O, and avoid forbidden letters.

For example: ""ROBOT"", but we know O is present? But ""ROBOT"" has O, and T? Yes, but also B? And it has O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O at position 2 and 4? Wait, positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). 

However, we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-', which means O is present but not at position 3. So O cannot be at position 3? But in this word, O is at 2 and 4? We don't know yet about those.

But also, we have to avoid letters: E? No E in ""ROBOT"". S,M? No problem.

However, note: we also tried R at position 2 and 4? Wait no: in guess1 R was at 2, in guess2 at 4? And both wrong.

But in ""ROBOT"":
- Position 1: R → which we haven't tried yet? So if secret has R at position 1, we get ✓.
- Position 2: O → we don't know about position 2, but O is present so if it's correct we get ✓, else '-'.
- Position 3: B → new letter.
- Position 4: O → again O? But the same as above? Or if O appears only once?
- Position 5: T → which we know is present, so if at position 5, ✓ or '-'.

But note: we must not reuse known absent letters? B is new? Okay.

Another thing: the word ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But the feedback handles duplicates? If there is only one O in the secret, then only one O might be marked.

But let me think of other words.

Another candidate: ""PRIOR""? But has A? No, ""PRIOR"" letters: P,R,I,O,R. Avoids forbidden? Yes? But repeated R? Not forbidden? But we know R is present.

But position: R might be at 1? Then R(1): try.

""TROOP""? T at 1? Then R at 2? Wait, position 1: T, position 2: R? But R cannot be at position 2? We already know R at position 2 is incorrect? Because in guess1 R at pos2 got '-' meaning not there.

So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we know that position won't be R? Similarly, position 4? We know R is not at position 4 from guess2? So R can only be at 1,3,5.

Therefore, any guess with R must have it at 1,3, or5.

Similarly, for T: we haven't ruled out any positions except position 2? Because in guess2 T at position 2 was marked as '-' meaning not at position 2? So T cannot be at position 2? But position 1,3,4,5 are possible.

For O: cannot be at position 3? Because in guess2 O at pos3 was marked '-', so not at position 3? So O can be at 1,2,4,5? Similarly.

So for next guess:

We want to try R at position 1? Or 3? Or 5? Let me choose position 1 to test.

Then, since O and T must be in the word, we can place them accordingly.

Also, we need two more letters? And avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

So, we must choose words that start with R, have O and T somewhere, and two new consonants or vowels.

Common English words: 

""ROTATE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. Cannot use E.

""ROUND""? Has N? N is forbidden? We know N is not in the word? So avoid.

""ROGUE""? Has E and U? U is not forbidden? But E is forbidden. So skip.

""RHYTHM""? Has H,Y,T,H,M? M is forbidden? We know M is not in the word? So skip.

""DOUBT""? Starts with D? But we want R at start.

Better: let's consider R followed by a vowel? Then a consonant? Etc.

Word: ""RUSTY""? R(1),U(2),S(3)? But S: we know S is absent? From guess2 S was at position1 and got x? So S is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use S? Oh, I forgot: S is forbidden? Yes, from guess2 S(x). So S is absent.

Similarly, M is absent? So in ""RUSTY"", S is there? Skip.

So avoid S.

We need a word that avoids C,A,N,E,S,M, but has R first, and O and T.

So: R something O something T? Or mixed.

Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" as I thought? But has O twice? But O is allowed multiple times? Only if the secret has two Os? Well possible? But let's see.

""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5)

In this guess:
- R at pos1: we can test R's position? If R is at pos1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- O at pos2: if O is in secret and at pos2, ✓ else '-'.
- B at pos3: new letter → feedback will tell if present and position.
- O at pos4: but O again? And if there is only one O, then one might be marked differently? But the feedback rules: for each letter independently? Actually, no: if the secret has duplicate letters? Well, the rules are per occurrence? But standard wordle rules: I think each feedback corresponds to each position independently? But if there is only one O, then the first O might be marked and the second might be absent etc.

Suppose secret has only one O: then if we guess O at position 2 and it's correct? But in ""ROBOT"" we have two O's? The feedback might mark one O correctly and mark the other as absent? But let me see.

Actually, in the example given at the start: secret ""BRISK"", guess ""STORM"" → feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at pos1? But S is not duplicated.

For duplicates: if secret has only one O and we guess two O's, then one O might get ✓ or '-' and the other will get x? But standard Wordle: yes. For example, secret CHESS guess TEASE: first E gets '-' because CHESS has E only in the fourth position? So the E at pos2 would be '-' only if the secret has an E not at pos2? And the E at pos4 would be ✓? But I'm confusing.

But for our purpose, ""ROBOT"" might be okay? Alternatively, choose a word without duplicates.

To avoid confusion? But valid words are allowed? So I'll use ""ROBOT"".

But let me think of a word with distinct letters? But R, T, O must be included? And avoid forbidden: so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but O and T are already known? So we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)

Common: L, D, B, H, etc.

Word: ""RIGHT"" → but no O? We must include O? Wait no, we know O is present? We don't have to include O? We can test other letters? But since we know O is present, we should try to locate it? Similarly for T.

But we have a constraint: O and T are in the word? So we can choose a word without O? But that would be inefficient? Because we won't get information on O? Or if we don't include O, then we might get feedback that O is present? But we already know O is present? So that feedback would be redundant? Actually, we already know O is present? So we can skip? But then we won't get position info? So it's better to place O in different position? Similarly for T and R.

But for R, we must place at 1,3, or5? Since we haven't tried at 1,5? We tried at 2 and 4? So positions 1,3,5 available.

Similarly, O: we tried at 3 and it was wrong? So we haven't tried O at other positions: 1,2,4,5? Similarly T: we tried at position 2? So positions 1,3,4,5 available? But for T, we can place in positions 1,3,4,5.

So, let me choose a word that places:
- R at position 1? Then O and T elsewhere? Avoid positions we know are wrong for each? But we don't know their correct positions except that they can't be at the positions we already tried? Only for O we know it's not at 3? Similarly T not at 2? But we can place at other positions? And R at 1,3, or5.

I think ""PROUD""? But starts with P? We want R at 1? Then ""RO"" something.

How about ""ROBOT""? Despite duplicate.

Another: ""ROUTE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Skip.

""ROOST""? O at position 2 and 3? Position 3: we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-'? But if O were at position 3 in secret, we would get ✓? But we got '-'? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, in ""ROOST"", if O at position 3, it would be wrong? But ""ROOST"" has O at 2,3,4? Too many duplicates.

Better choose a word without duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters.

Word: ""BUILT"" → no R? Must include R? Because R is in the word? So we cannot omit R? We should include it to test position? Because we don't have its position yet.

Let me list: we know R, T, O are in the word? So we must choose a word with R, T, O and two other letters? But we have only 5 letters? Secret has 5 letters? So it must have exactly R,T,O and two more? Or even duplicates? But let's proceed.

I'll pick ""RATION""? But has A and N? Both forbidden? Skip.

""PORTY""? Not a word.

""DROIT""? Not common.

Valid English word: ""TRIED""? But has E? Forbidden.

Can I use L? ""LORRY""? Has L,O,R,R,Y? But R at position 3 and4? But position 4 is already ruled out for R? So if in ""LORRY"" R is at pos3? And we put R there? Also, we tried R at pos2 and4? Not at pos3? So it's new? And O at pos2? We haven't tried O at pos2? So can.

But ""LORRY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? Letters: L,O,R,R,Y? No C,A,N,E,S,M? Okay? So it has duplicate R? Should be fine.

Alternatively, ""GROUP""? Has G,R,O,U,P? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And R at position2? But R at position2 is not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position2? From guess1: R at pos2 got '-'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position2? So we cannot put R at position2 because it will never be correct? Similarly position4: guess2 R at pos4 got '-'? So must put R at 1,3,5? Therefore, ""GROUP"" has R at position2? Wrong? So we avoid such words? Must have R at 1,3, or5.

Therefore, ""GROUP"" is invalid? For testing? No: we can still guess it? But we know R at position2 will give '-'? So it's a waste? Because we know the state? So it's better to put R in a new position: 1,3, or5.

So words like ""GROUP"" with R at2: not useful? Similarly ""FROST"" has R at2? Skip? But ""FROST"" has S? Absent? Skip.

Let's find words with R at position1? 

Possible: ""RABID""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""RADIO""? A forbidden? Skip.

""RIFLE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""RIGHT""? I,G,H,T? But no O? We know O is present? So if we don't include O, we might not cover it? But we can still guess? But then we won't know about O's position? Which is bad? We should include O? So ""RIGHT"" doesn't have O? Skip.

""ROUGE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And letters: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). Also has O at pos2? And W,D,Y new? So we can try.

""ROWDY"": 
- R at position1? Good? If R is at1, we get ✓.
- O at position2? If O is at2, ✓? But we don't know? We haven't tried O at position2? Only tried at pos3? So possible? If not, and O is elsewhere, '-'.
- W at position3? New? Will get feedback.
- D at position4? New? Feedback.
- Y at position5? New? Feedback.

Also, contains O? And T? Wait, no T? But we know T is in the word? Does ""ROWDY"" have T? No. But wait, we know T is present? So if the secret has T, but our guess has no T, then we might not get information on T? Worse: if we don't include T, the feedback will not cover T? But we know T must be in the word? So we should prioritize including T? To find its position? Otherwise, we wasted a guess without testing T.

So must include T? Yes, because we have limited guesses? Only 6 tries? So we need to test T's position as well.

Therefore, the guess must include R (position 1,3,5), O, and T? And two new letters? Avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Now, let's choose a word with these letters.

For example, ""PROUT""? Not a word.

""TROUT""? But R at position2? We cannot put R at position2? Because we know R is not at position2? So ""TROUT"" has R at position2? Skip? Because it will waste R position.

Better: ""T"" first? Then R? But R must be at3 or5? Etc.

Assume R at position1? Then include T and O.

Example: ""ROTATED"" too long.

5-letter: ""RATION"" forbidden... ""ROUTE"" has E? Skip.

""GRUNT""? Has N? Forbidden? Skip.

""TRUCK""? Has C? Forbidden? Skip.

""PROD"" too short.

Think of ""BROTH"": B,R,O,T,H? Letters: B,R,O,T,H. Avoids forbidden? No A,C,E,N,S,M? B, H not used. And R(1), O(2), T(4)... positions: B(1)? Wait, if we want R at1? How about ""BROTH"" is B,R,O,T,H -> so position1=B, position2=R? But R: position2? We know R is not at position2!? So B at1, R at2: R at position2 which we know is no good? So we get '-' for R? But we want to try R at a new position? So not helpful.

How about R at position1? So structure: R _ _ _ _

Must include T and O? And two new letters? Avoid forbidden.

So: R followed by a letter, then O? T? Etc.

Candidates: ""ROTAL""? Not a word.

""ROTAS""? But S? Forbidden? Skip.

""ROTHY""? Not a word.

""ROTIS""? Not common.

""ROULETTE""? Too long.

""TOURS""? Starts with T? T at position1? No R at start? So R must be at1? Or we can put R at position3? Or5?

Let's change: put R at position3? Or5?

For example, word with T first? Then we can put R later.

Example: ""TORUS"" T(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), S(5)? But S forbidden? Skip.

""VIRUS""? V,I,R,U,S? S forbidden? Skip.

""GUILD""? No R? But R required.

""POWER""? But no T? And P,O,W,E,R? E forbidden? Skip.

Struggling?

How about these words:

""O"" and ""T"" must be included? So let me search: words with R,T,O and avoid C,A,N,E,S?m=M forbidden.

""BORTY""? Not valid.

""DIRTY"" has D,I,R,T,Y? But no O? Skip.

""DOUGHT""? Not a word.

""HORST"" has S? Skip.

""FRORT""? Not common.

I think I found: ""TORCH""? But C forbidden? Skip.

""BIRTH""? No O? Skip.

Wait, maybe ""THROW""? T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). Has O and T? But O at position4? And R at position3? Let's check:

Positions for R: position3? We haven't tried position3? So new? Similarly O at position4? We haven't tried O at position4? Only tried at position3? So position4 is new? T at position1? We tried T at position2? But not position1? So can.

Also, letters: T, H, R, O, W? All not forbidden? C,A,N,E,S,M are absent okay? So valid word: ""THROW"".

This places:
- T at position1: if T is at1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- H at position2: new char.
- R at position3: if R is at3, ✓ else '-'.
- O at position4: new position for O? We know O is not at3? But at4? Try.
- W at position5: new char.

And it will test all required letters: R, T, O (and H and new).

So I think ""THROW"" is good.

Also, if R is at position3, we can understand? Similarly for T at1 and O at4.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: storm** → S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  This means:  
  - T is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - O is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 4 (confirming it cannot be in positions 2 or 4).  
  - S and M are not in the secret word.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: R, T, O  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out).  
  - T cannot be at position 2.  
  - O cannot be at position 3.  
- The secret word contains exactly the letters R, T, O, and two additional unknown letters (from the unused letter pool: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc., avoiding absent letters).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on placing R, T, and O in new positions to narrow down their locations:  
  - Test R in position 3 (since positions 1 and 5 haven't been tested yet; position 3 is a high-probability option).  
  - Test T in position 1 and O in position 4 (new positions for both).  
- Include two new common letters (e.g., H, W) to maximize feedback coverage.  
- Choose a valid word that fits these constraints:  
  - Avoids absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M.  
  - Includes R, T, O.  

Selected word: **THROW**  
- T at position 1: Tests if T is in position 1.  
- H at position 2: New letter to probe.  
- R at position 3: Tests R in a new position.  
- O at position 4: Tests O in a new position.  
- W at position 5: New letter to probe.  
- Avoids all forbidden letters and efficiently covers R, T, O positioning.

<guess>throw</guess>",throw,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: storm -> S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ""storm"", positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So:
  S at pos1: x → not in word
  T at pos2: (-) → in word but not at position 2
  O at pos3: (-) → in word but not at position 3
  R at pos4: (-) → in word but not at position 4 (we already knew R is not at 2 from guess1, now also not at 4)
  M at pos5: x → not in word

So from both guesses:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, M

Letters that are in the word:
- R: but not at pos2 (from guess1) and not at pos4 (from guess2). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be at pos1, pos3, or pos5.
- T: in the word but not at pos2.
- O: in the word but not at pos3.

Also, T and O are new letters we now know are present.

Now, we need to consider the positions:

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Possible positions for T: any except 2? But note in ""storm"" it was at pos2 and was wrong position, so T could be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know.

Possible positions for O: any except 3? Could be at 1,2,4,5.

We also need to form a valid 5-letter word using R, T, O and other letters, but avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Since we know R is in the word (and must be placed at pos1,3, or5), and T and O are in the word.

Moreover, the secret word must contain at least these: R, T, O.

But there might be two more letters? Since it's 5 letters.

We don't know if there are more distinct letters.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test R in a new position (since in guess1 we tried pos2, guess2 pos4, so now we can try pos1 or pos3 or pos5).
- Test O and T in new positions.
- Include other common letters that we haven't tested: e.g., I, L, P, U, etc.

But avoid letters we know are absent: C,A,N,E,S,M.

Let me think of words that have R at position 1? Since we haven't tested R at position 1.

Also, if R is at position 1, then we can check if it's correct?

Similarly, we know O and T are present.

So candidate: words starting with R, that also contain T and O, and avoid forbidden letters.

For example: ""ROBOT"", but we know O is present? But ""ROBOT"" has O, and T? Yes, but also B? And it has O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O at position 2 and 4? Wait, positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). 

However, we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-', which means O is present but not at position 3. So O cannot be at position 3? But in this word, O is at 2 and 4? We don't know yet about those.

But also, we have to avoid letters: E? No E in ""ROBOT"". S,M? No problem.

However, note: we also tried R at position 2 and 4? Wait no: in guess1 R was at 2, in guess2 at 4? And both wrong.

But in ""ROBOT"":
- Position 1: R → which we haven't tried yet? So if secret has R at position 1, we get ✓.
- Position 2: O → we don't know about position 2, but O is present so if it's correct we get ✓, else '-'.
- Position 3: B → new letter.
- Position 4: O → again O? But the same as above? Or if O appears only once?
- Position 5: T → which we know is present, so if at position 5, ✓ or '-'.

But note: we must not reuse known absent letters? B is new? Okay.

Another thing: the word ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But the feedback handles duplicates? If there is only one O in the secret, then only one O might be marked.

But let me think of other words.

Another candidate: ""PRIOR""? But has A? No, ""PRIOR"" letters: P,R,I,O,R. Avoids forbidden? Yes? But repeated R? Not forbidden? But we know R is present.

But position: R might be at 1? Then R(1): try.

""TROOP""? T at 1? Then R at 2? Wait, position 1: T, position 2: R? But R cannot be at position 2? We already know R at position 2 is incorrect? Because in guess1 R at pos2 got '-' meaning not there.

So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we know that position won't be R? Similarly, position 4? We know R is not at position 4 from guess2? So R can only be at 1,3,5.

Therefore, any guess with R must have it at 1,3, or5.

Similarly, for T: we haven't ruled out any positions except position 2? Because in guess2 T at position 2 was marked as '-' meaning not at position 2? So T cannot be at position 2? But position 1,3,4,5 are possible.

For O: cannot be at position 3? Because in guess2 O at pos3 was marked '-', so not at position 3? So O can be at 1,2,4,5? Similarly.

So for next guess:

We want to try R at position 1? Or 3? Or 5? Let me choose position 1 to test.

Then, since O and T must be in the word, we can place them accordingly.

Also, we need two more letters? And avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

So, we must choose words that start with R, have O and T somewhere, and two new consonants or vowels.

Common English words: 

""ROTATE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. Cannot use E.

""ROUND""? Has N? N is forbidden? We know N is not in the word? So avoid.

""ROGUE""? Has E and U? U is not forbidden? But E is forbidden. So skip.

""RHYTHM""? Has H,Y,T,H,M? M is forbidden? We know M is not in the word? So skip.

""DOUBT""? Starts with D? But we want R at start.

Better: let's consider R followed by a vowel? Then a consonant? Etc.

Word: ""RUSTY""? R(1),U(2),S(3)? But S: we know S is absent? From guess2 S was at position1 and got x? So S is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use S? Oh, I forgot: S is forbidden? Yes, from guess2 S(x). So S is absent.

Similarly, M is absent? So in ""RUSTY"", S is there? Skip.

So avoid S.

We need a word that avoids C,A,N,E,S,M, but has R first, and O and T.

So: R something O something T? Or mixed.

Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" as I thought? But has O twice? But O is allowed multiple times? Only if the secret has two Os? Well possible? But let's see.

""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5)

In this guess:
- R at pos1: we can test R's position? If R is at pos1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- O at pos2: if O is in secret and at pos2, ✓ else '-'.
- B at pos3: new letter → feedback will tell if present and position.
- O at pos4: but O again? And if there is only one O, then one might be marked differently? But the feedback rules: for each letter independently? Actually, no: if the secret has duplicate letters? Well, the rules are per occurrence? But standard wordle rules: I think each feedback corresponds to each position independently? But if there is only one O, then the first O might be marked and the second might be absent etc.

Suppose secret has only one O: then if we guess O at position 2 and it's correct? But in ""ROBOT"" we have two O's? The feedback might mark one O correctly and mark the other as absent? But let me see.

Actually, in the example given at the start: secret ""BRISK"", guess ""STORM"" → feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at pos1? But S is not duplicated.

For duplicates: if secret has only one O and we guess two O's, then one O might get ✓ or '-' and the other will get x? But standard Wordle: yes. For example, secret CHESS guess TEASE: first E gets '-' because CHESS has E only in the fourth position? So the E at pos2 would be '-' only if the secret has an E not at pos2? And the E at pos4 would be ✓? But I'm confusing.

But for our purpose, ""ROBOT"" might be okay? Alternatively, choose a word without duplicates.

To avoid confusion? But valid words are allowed? So I'll use ""ROBOT"".

But let me think of a word with distinct letters? But R, T, O must be included? And avoid forbidden: so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but O and T are already known? So we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)

Common: L, D, B, H, etc.

Word: ""RIGHT"" → but no O? We must include O? Wait no, we know O is present? We don't have to include O? We can test other letters? But since we know O is present, we should try to locate it? Similarly for T.

But we have a constraint: O and T are in the word? So we can choose a word without O? But that would be inefficient? Because we won't get information on O? Or if we don't include O, then we might get feedback that O is present? But we already know O is present? So that feedback would be redundant? Actually, we already know O is present? So we can skip? But then we won't get position info? So it's better to place O in different position? Similarly for T and R.

But for R, we must place at 1,3, or5? Since we haven't tried at 1,5? We tried at 2 and 4? So positions 1,3,5 available.

Similarly, O: we tried at 3 and it was wrong? So we haven't tried O at other positions: 1,2,4,5? Similarly T: we tried at position 2? So positions 1,3,4,5 available? But for T, we can place in positions 1,3,4,5.

So, let me choose a word that places:
- R at position 1? Then O and T elsewhere? Avoid positions we know are wrong for each? But we don't know their correct positions except that they can't be at the positions we already tried? Only for O we know it's not at 3? Similarly T not at 2? But we can place at other positions? And R at 1,3, or5.

I think ""PROUD""? But starts with P? We want R at 1? Then ""RO"" something.

How about ""ROBOT""? Despite duplicate.

Another: ""ROUTE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Skip.

""ROOST""? O at position 2 and 3? Position 3: we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-'? But if O were at position 3 in secret, we would get ✓? But we got '-'? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, in ""ROOST"", if O at position 3, it would be wrong? But ""ROOST"" has O at 2,3,4? Too many duplicates.

Better choose a word without duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters.

Word: ""BUILT"" → no R? Must include R? Because R is in the word? So we cannot omit R? We should include it to test position? Because we don't have its position yet.

Let me list: we know R, T, O are in the word? So we must choose a word with R, T, O and two other letters? But we have only 5 letters? Secret has 5 letters? So it must have exactly R,T,O and two more? Or even duplicates? But let's proceed.

I'll pick ""RATION""? But has A and N? Both forbidden? Skip.

""PORTY""? Not a word.

""DROIT""? Not common.

Valid English word: ""TRIED""? But has E? Forbidden.

Can I use L? ""LORRY""? Has L,O,R,R,Y? But R at position 3 and4? But position 4 is already ruled out for R? So if in ""LORRY"" R is at pos3? And we put R there? Also, we tried R at pos2 and4? Not at pos3? So it's new? And O at pos2? We haven't tried O at pos2? So can.

But ""LORRY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? Letters: L,O,R,R,Y? No C,A,N,E,S,M? Okay? So it has duplicate R? Should be fine.

Alternatively, ""GROUP""? Has G,R,O,U,P? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And R at position2? But R at position2 is not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position2? From guess1: R at pos2 got '-'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position2? So we cannot put R at position2 because it will never be correct? Similarly position4: guess2 R at pos4 got '-'? So must put R at 1,3,5? Therefore, ""GROUP"" has R at position2? Wrong? So we avoid such words? Must have R at 1,3, or5.

Therefore, ""GROUP"" is invalid? For testing? No: we can still guess it? But we know R at position2 will give '-'? So it's a waste? Because we know the state? So it's better to put R in a new position: 1,3, or5.

So words like ""GROUP"" with R at2: not useful? Similarly ""FROST"" has R at2? Skip? But ""FROST"" has S? Absent? Skip.

Let's find words with R at position1? 

Possible: ""RABID""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""RADIO""? A forbidden? Skip.

""RIFLE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""RIGHT""? I,G,H,T? But no O? We know O is present? So if we don't include O, we might not cover it? But we can still guess? But then we won't know about O's position? Which is bad? We should include O? So ""RIGHT"" doesn't have O? Skip.

""ROUGE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And letters: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). Also has O at pos2? And W,D,Y new? So we can try.

""ROWDY"": 
- R at position1? Good? If R is at1, we get ✓.
- O at position2? If O is at2, ✓? But we don't know? We haven't tried O at position2? Only tried at pos3? So possible? If not, and O is elsewhere, '-'.
- W at position3? New? Will get feedback.
- D at position4? New? Feedback.
- Y at position5? New? Feedback.

Also, contains O? And T? Wait, no T? But we know T is in the word? Does ""ROWDY"" have T? No. But wait, we know T is present? So if the secret has T, but our guess has no T, then we might not get information on T? Worse: if we don't include T, the feedback will not cover T? But we know T must be in the word? So we should prioritize including T? To find its position? Otherwise, we wasted a guess without testing T.

So must include T? Yes, because we have limited guesses? Only 6 tries? So we need to test T's position as well.

Therefore, the guess must include R (position 1,3,5), O, and T? And two new letters? Avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Now, let's choose a word with these letters.

For example, ""PROUT""? Not a word.

""TROUT""? But R at position2? We cannot put R at position2? Because we know R is not at position2? So ""TROUT"" has R at position2? Skip? Because it will waste R position.

Better: ""T"" first? Then R? But R must be at3 or5? Etc.

Assume R at position1? Then include T and O.

Example: ""ROTATED"" too long.

5-letter: ""RATION"" forbidden... ""ROUTE"" has E? Skip.

""GRUNT""? Has N? Forbidden? Skip.

""TRUCK""? Has C? Forbidden? Skip.

""PROD"" too short.

Think of ""BROTH"": B,R,O,T,H? Letters: B,R,O,T,H. Avoids forbidden? No A,C,E,N,S,M? B, H not used. And R(1), O(2), T(4)... positions: B(1)? Wait, if we want R at1? How about ""BROTH"" is B,R,O,T,H -> so position1=B, position2=R? But R: position2? We know R is not at position2!? So B at1, R at2: R at position2 which we know is no good? So we get '-' for R? But we want to try R at a new position? So not helpful.

How about R at position1? So structure: R _ _ _ _

Must include T and O? And two new letters? Avoid forbidden.

So: R followed by a letter, then O? T? Etc.

Candidates: ""ROTAL""? Not a word.

""ROTAS""? But S? Forbidden? Skip.

""ROTHY""? Not a word.

""ROTIS""? Not common.

""ROULETTE""? Too long.

""TOURS""? Starts with T? T at position1? No R at start? So R must be at1? Or we can put R at position3? Or5?

Let's change: put R at position3? Or5?

For example, word with T first? Then we can put R later.

Example: ""TORUS"" T(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), S(5)? But S forbidden? Skip.

""VIRUS""? V,I,R,U,S? S forbidden? Skip.

""GUILD""? No R? But R required.

""POWER""? But no T? And P,O,W,E,R? E forbidden? Skip.

Struggling?

How about these words:

""O"" and ""T"" must be included? So let me search: words with R,T,O and avoid C,A,N,E,S?m=M forbidden.

""BORTY""? Not valid.

""DIRTY"" has D,I,R,T,Y? But no O? Skip.

""DOUGHT""? Not a word.

""HORST"" has S? Skip.

""FRORT""? Not common.

I think I found: ""TORCH""? But C forbidden? Skip.

""BIRTH""? No O? Skip.

Wait, maybe ""THROW""? T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). Has O and T? But O at position4? And R at position3? Let's check:

Positions for R: position3? We haven't tried position3? So new? Similarly O at position4? We haven't tried O at position4? Only tried at position3? So position4 is new? T at position1? We tried T at position2? But not position1? So can.

Also, letters: T, H, R, O, W? All not forbidden? C,A,N,E,S,M are absent okay? So valid word: ""THROW"".

This places:
- T at position1: if T is at1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- H at position2: new char.
- R at position3: if R is at3, ✓ else '-'.
- O at position4: new position for O? We know O is not at3? But at4? Try.
- W at position5: new char.

And it will test all required letters: R, T, O (and H and new).

So I think ""THROW"" is good.

Also, if R is at position3, we can understand? Similarly for T at1 and O at4.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,TURBO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2).
 - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 Also, since R is present but not in the second position, it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we don't have any other letters known, we need to pick a word that:
 - Excludes the letters C, A, N, E (as they are not in the word).
 - Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - Tries to cover other common letters to get more feedback.

 Our first guess had vowels: A and E, but both are absent. So the word likely has other vowels: like O, I, U? Or sometimes Y.

 Common vowels to try: O, I, U.

 Also, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 We must avoid: C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of a word that includes R (not in the second position) and has other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - R could be at the start: first position? Or third, fourth, or fifth.

 We also want to confirm or rule out other vowels and consonants.

 Consider starting with a word that puts R in different positions and uses common remaining letters.

 Example words:
 - ""ROUST"": R at position 1, but feedback says R is not in position 2? Our R was in position 2 and is wrong, so R should not be in position 2, but could be in 1? 
   However, note: if R were in the first position in the secret word, then when we put R in the second position (as in ""crane""), it would show as '-' because it exists but in the wrong place. So it's still possible for R to be in the first position.

 But wait: in ""crane"", R is in the second position and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not here. So R could be in position 1, 3,4,5.

 Let me choose a word where R is in a different position, say position 1.

 Possible words: ""ROBOT""? But O appears twice and might not be efficient.

 Since we know the word doesn't have A or E, it might have other vowels: I, O, U.

 Another idea: ""PRIOR"" - but has two R's, which might be inefficient for gathering information.

 However, let's aim for a word with new letters.

 Let's list letters we haven't tried: we tried C,R,A,N,E. We avoid those except R.

 Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 But we want common ones.

 How about: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S.

 But note: R is in the second position? Wait, we must avoid R in the second position because our feedback said R is present but not in the second position? No, we can use R in a different position? Actually, in our next guess, we can put R in any position except the second? But we don't have to avoid the second, because we already know that if we put it in the second it will be a miss, so we can put it elsewhere.

 Actually, we can put R again? But we know R is present so we should reuse R to find its position.

 However, we cannot put R in the second position because we already know that's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but we know that if we put it in the second again, we will get the same '-' ? And we want to discover the correct position.

 So it's better to try R in a different position.

 Therefore, let me choose a word with R in the first position? Or third? etc.

 I'll choose R in the first position to test.

 Candidate: ""RISKY"" -> R,I,S,K,Y. But we don't know if these letters exist.

 Another: ""ROAST"" -> but A was absent? Wait, we have A as absent, so avoid A. ""ROAST"" has A, which we know is absent. So skip.

 How about ""ROUND""? Has R,O,U,N,D -> but N was absent in the first guess? Wait, we know N is absent.

 Similarly, avoid N and A and E and C.

 Okay, ""ROUND"": N is present? No, because we got N(x) in crane.

 So ""ROUND"" has N which we know is absent -> invalid.

 Let's pick a word without A,N,E,C and try R in a different position.

 Example: ""SPRIG"" -> S,P,R,I,G. S,P,R,I,G.

 But let's check if it has any forbidden letters? No A,N,E,C. Okay.

 However, it has R in the third position? We can try that.

 But note: we want to cover common letters. ""SPRIG"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Alternatively: ""STORM""? S,T,O,R,M.

 Also: no forbidden letters? Yes.

 But O: we don't know about O.

 Let me choose ""STORM"": S,T,O,R,M.

 How about ""TROMP""? That might not be very common.

 I think ""STORM"" is a good candidate: it has common letters and positions R in the fourth (so not second).

 So I'll guess ""STORM"".

 But wait: we know R is in the word and we are putting R in the fourth? That should help us see if R belongs there.

 Alternative: ""PROUD""? -> Has O,U,D. But avoids forbidden letters? Yes? C, A, N, E are forbidden? But U and O are new.

 However, let me stick with ""STORM"".

 Steps:
 - S: we don't know.
 - T: we don't know.
 - O: we don't know.
 - R: we know is present, but if we put it in fourth, we might get a '-' or '✓' depending on the secret word.
 - M: we don't know.

 This will give us feedback on S, T, O, M, and R's position (if we get R ✓ then we know it's fourth; if we get '-' it could be elsewhere).

 So, I'll go with ""STORM"".

 But note: we must not use forbidden letters: C,A,N,E. None of S,T,O,R,M are forbidden? Correct.

 Therefore: guess ""STORM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)):
- The secret word contains the letter **R** but not in the second position.
- The letters **C, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word must use other vowels (e.g., O, I, U) or consonants since A and E are absent.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Including **R** in a new position (not the second) to test its location.
- Avoiding forbidden letters: **C, A, N, E**.
- Covering common letters (like **S, T, O, M**) for additional feedback.

**Selected word: ""STORM""**  
- Places R in the fourth position (new location).
- Tests vowels (O) and consonants (S, T, M) not covered in the first guess.
- Avoids forbidden letters while prioritizing high-frequency characters.

<guess>storm</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: storm -> S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ""storm"", positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So:
  S at pos1: x → not in word
  T at pos2: (-) → in word but not at position 2
  O at pos3: (-) → in word but not at position 3
  R at pos4: (-) → in word but not at position 4 (we already knew R is not at 2 from guess1, now also not at 4)
  M at pos5: x → not in word

So from both guesses:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, M

Letters that are in the word:
- R: but not at pos2 (from guess1) and not at pos4 (from guess2). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be at pos1, pos3, or pos5.
- T: in the word but not at pos2.
- O: in the word but not at pos3.

Also, T and O are new letters we now know are present.

Now, we need to consider the positions:

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Possible positions for T: any except 2? But note in ""storm"" it was at pos2 and was wrong position, so T could be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know.

Possible positions for O: any except 3? Could be at 1,2,4,5.

We also need to form a valid 5-letter word using R, T, O and other letters, but avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Since we know R is in the word (and must be placed at pos1,3, or5), and T and O are in the word.

Moreover, the secret word must contain at least these: R, T, O.

But there might be two more letters? Since it's 5 letters.

We don't know if there are more distinct letters.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test R in a new position (since in guess1 we tried pos2, guess2 pos4, so now we can try pos1 or pos3 or pos5).
- Test O and T in new positions.
- Include other common letters that we haven't tested: e.g., I, L, P, U, etc.

But avoid letters we know are absent: C,A,N,E,S,M.

Let me think of words that have R at position 1? Since we haven't tested R at position 1.

Also, if R is at position 1, then we can check if it's correct?

Similarly, we know O and T are present.

So candidate: words starting with R, that also contain T and O, and avoid forbidden letters.

For example: ""ROBOT"", but we know O is present? But ""ROBOT"" has O, and T? Yes, but also B? And it has O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O at position 2 and 4? Wait, positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). 

However, we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-', which means O is present but not at position 3. So O cannot be at position 3? But in this word, O is at 2 and 4? We don't know yet about those.

But also, we have to avoid letters: E? No E in ""ROBOT"". S,M? No problem.

However, note: we also tried R at position 2 and 4? Wait no: in guess1 R was at 2, in guess2 at 4? And both wrong.

But in ""ROBOT"":
- Position 1: R → which we haven't tried yet? So if secret has R at position 1, we get ✓.
- Position 2: O → we don't know about position 2, but O is present so if it's correct we get ✓, else '-'.
- Position 3: B → new letter.
- Position 4: O → again O? But the same as above? Or if O appears only once?
- Position 5: T → which we know is present, so if at position 5, ✓ or '-'.

But note: we must not reuse known absent letters? B is new? Okay.

Another thing: the word ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But the feedback handles duplicates? If there is only one O in the secret, then only one O might be marked.

But let me think of other words.

Another candidate: ""PRIOR""? But has A? No, ""PRIOR"" letters: P,R,I,O,R. Avoids forbidden? Yes? But repeated R? Not forbidden? But we know R is present.

But position: R might be at 1? Then R(1): try.

""TROOP""? T at 1? Then R at 2? Wait, position 1: T, position 2: R? But R cannot be at position 2? We already know R at position 2 is incorrect? Because in guess1 R at pos2 got '-' meaning not there.

So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we know that position won't be R? Similarly, position 4? We know R is not at position 4 from guess2? So R can only be at 1,3,5.

Therefore, any guess with R must have it at 1,3, or5.

Similarly, for T: we haven't ruled out any positions except position 2? Because in guess2 T at position 2 was marked as '-' meaning not at position 2? So T cannot be at position 2? But position 1,3,4,5 are possible.

For O: cannot be at position 3? Because in guess2 O at pos3 was marked '-', so not at position 3? So O can be at 1,2,4,5? Similarly.

So for next guess:

We want to try R at position 1? Or 3? Or 5? Let me choose position 1 to test.

Then, since O and T must be in the word, we can place them accordingly.

Also, we need two more letters? And avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

So, we must choose words that start with R, have O and T somewhere, and two new consonants or vowels.

Common English words: 

""ROTATE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. Cannot use E.

""ROUND""? Has N? N is forbidden? We know N is not in the word? So avoid.

""ROGUE""? Has E and U? U is not forbidden? But E is forbidden. So skip.

""RHYTHM""? Has H,Y,T,H,M? M is forbidden? We know M is not in the word? So skip.

""DOUBT""? Starts with D? But we want R at start.

Better: let's consider R followed by a vowel? Then a consonant? Etc.

Word: ""RUSTY""? R(1),U(2),S(3)? But S: we know S is absent? From guess2 S was at position1 and got x? So S is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use S? Oh, I forgot: S is forbidden? Yes, from guess2 S(x). So S is absent.

Similarly, M is absent? So in ""RUSTY"", S is there? Skip.

So avoid S.

We need a word that avoids C,A,N,E,S,M, but has R first, and O and T.

So: R something O something T? Or mixed.

Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" as I thought? But has O twice? But O is allowed multiple times? Only if the secret has two Os? Well possible? But let's see.

""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5)

In this guess:
- R at pos1: we can test R's position? If R is at pos1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- O at pos2: if O is in secret and at pos2, ✓ else '-'.
- B at pos3: new letter → feedback will tell if present and position.
- O at pos4: but O again? And if there is only one O, then one might be marked differently? But the feedback rules: for each letter independently? Actually, no: if the secret has duplicate letters? Well, the rules are per occurrence? But standard wordle rules: I think each feedback corresponds to each position independently? But if there is only one O, then the first O might be marked and the second might be absent etc.

Suppose secret has only one O: then if we guess O at position 2 and it's correct? But in ""ROBOT"" we have two O's? The feedback might mark one O correctly and mark the other as absent? But let me see.

Actually, in the example given at the start: secret ""BRISK"", guess ""STORM"" → feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at pos1? But S is not duplicated.

For duplicates: if secret has only one O and we guess two O's, then one O might get ✓ or '-' and the other will get x? But standard Wordle: yes. For example, secret CHESS guess TEASE: first E gets '-' because CHESS has E only in the fourth position? So the E at pos2 would be '-' only if the secret has an E not at pos2? And the E at pos4 would be ✓? But I'm confusing.

But for our purpose, ""ROBOT"" might be okay? Alternatively, choose a word without duplicates.

To avoid confusion? But valid words are allowed? So I'll use ""ROBOT"".

But let me think of a word with distinct letters? But R, T, O must be included? And avoid forbidden: so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but O and T are already known? So we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)

Common: L, D, B, H, etc.

Word: ""RIGHT"" → but no O? We must include O? Wait no, we know O is present? We don't have to include O? We can test other letters? But since we know O is present, we should try to locate it? Similarly for T.

But we have a constraint: O and T are in the word? So we can choose a word without O? But that would be inefficient? Because we won't get information on O? Or if we don't include O, then we might get feedback that O is present? But we already know O is present? So that feedback would be redundant? Actually, we already know O is present? So we can skip? But then we won't get position info? So it's better to place O in different position? Similarly for T and R.

But for R, we must place at 1,3, or5? Since we haven't tried at 1,5? We tried at 2 and 4? So positions 1,3,5 available.

Similarly, O: we tried at 3 and it was wrong? So we haven't tried O at other positions: 1,2,4,5? Similarly T: we tried at position 2? So positions 1,3,4,5 available? But for T, we can place in positions 1,3,4,5.

So, let me choose a word that places:
- R at position 1? Then O and T elsewhere? Avoid positions we know are wrong for each? But we don't know their correct positions except that they can't be at the positions we already tried? Only for O we know it's not at 3? Similarly T not at 2? But we can place at other positions? And R at 1,3, or5.

I think ""PROUD""? But starts with P? We want R at 1? Then ""RO"" something.

How about ""ROBOT""? Despite duplicate.

Another: ""ROUTE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Skip.

""ROOST""? O at position 2 and 3? Position 3: we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-'? But if O were at position 3 in secret, we would get ✓? But we got '-'? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, in ""ROOST"", if O at position 3, it would be wrong? But ""ROOST"" has O at 2,3,4? Too many duplicates.

Better choose a word without duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters.

Word: ""BUILT"" → no R? Must include R? Because R is in the word? So we cannot omit R? We should include it to test position? Because we don't have its position yet.

Let me list: we know R, T, O are in the word? So we must choose a word with R, T, O and two other letters? But we have only 5 letters? Secret has 5 letters? So it must have exactly R,T,O and two more? Or even duplicates? But let's proceed.

I'll pick ""RATION""? But has A and N? Both forbidden? Skip.

""PORTY""? Not a word.

""DROIT""? Not common.

Valid English word: ""TRIED""? But has E? Forbidden.

Can I use L? ""LORRY""? Has L,O,R,R,Y? But R at position 3 and4? But position 4 is already ruled out for R? So if in ""LORRY"" R is at pos3? And we put R there? Also, we tried R at pos2 and4? Not at pos3? So it's new? And O at pos2? We haven't tried O at pos2? So can.

But ""LORRY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? Letters: L,O,R,R,Y? No C,A,N,E,S,M? Okay? So it has duplicate R? Should be fine.

Alternatively, ""GROUP""? Has G,R,O,U,P? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And R at position2? But R at position2 is not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position2? From guess1: R at pos2 got '-'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position2? So we cannot put R at position2 because it will never be correct? Similarly position4: guess2 R at pos4 got '-'? So must put R at 1,3,5? Therefore, ""GROUP"" has R at position2? Wrong? So we avoid such words? Must have R at 1,3, or5.

Therefore, ""GROUP"" is invalid? For testing? No: we can still guess it? But we know R at position2 will give '-'? So it's a waste? Because we know the state? So it's better to put R in a new position: 1,3, or5.

So words like ""GROUP"" with R at2: not useful? Similarly ""FROST"" has R at2? Skip? But ""FROST"" has S? Absent? Skip.

Let's find words with R at position1? 

Possible: ""RABID""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""RADIO""? A forbidden? Skip.

""RIFLE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""RIGHT""? I,G,H,T? But no O? We know O is present? So if we don't include O, we might not cover it? But we can still guess? But then we won't know about O's position? Which is bad? We should include O? So ""RIGHT"" doesn't have O? Skip.

""ROUGE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And letters: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). Also has O at pos2? And W,D,Y new? So we can try.

""ROWDY"": 
- R at position1? Good? If R is at1, we get ✓.
- O at position2? If O is at2, ✓? But we don't know? We haven't tried O at position2? Only tried at pos3? So possible? If not, and O is elsewhere, '-'.
- W at position3? New? Will get feedback.
- D at position4? New? Feedback.
- Y at position5? New? Feedback.

Also, contains O? And T? Wait, no T? But we know T is in the word? Does ""ROWDY"" have T? No. But wait, we know T is present? So if the secret has T, but our guess has no T, then we might not get information on T? Worse: if we don't include T, the feedback will not cover T? But we know T must be in the word? So we should prioritize including T? To find its position? Otherwise, we wasted a guess without testing T.

So must include T? Yes, because we have limited guesses? Only 6 tries? So we need to test T's position as well.

Therefore, the guess must include R (position 1,3,5), O, and T? And two new letters? Avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Now, let's choose a word with these letters.

For example, ""PROUT""? Not a word.

""TROUT""? But R at position2? We cannot put R at position2? Because we know R is not at position2? So ""TROUT"" has R at position2? Skip? Because it will waste R position.

Better: ""T"" first? Then R? But R must be at3 or5? Etc.

Assume R at position1? Then include T and O.

Example: ""ROTATED"" too long.

5-letter: ""RATION"" forbidden... ""ROUTE"" has E? Skip.

""GRUNT""? Has N? Forbidden? Skip.

""TRUCK""? Has C? Forbidden? Skip.

""PROD"" too short.

Think of ""BROTH"": B,R,O,T,H? Letters: B,R,O,T,H. Avoids forbidden? No A,C,E,N,S,M? B, H not used. And R(1), O(2), T(4)... positions: B(1)? Wait, if we want R at1? How about ""BROTH"" is B,R,O,T,H -> so position1=B, position2=R? But R: position2? We know R is not at position2!? So B at1, R at2: R at position2 which we know is no good? So we get '-' for R? But we want to try R at a new position? So not helpful.

How about R at position1? So structure: R _ _ _ _

Must include T and O? And two new letters? Avoid forbidden.

So: R followed by a letter, then O? T? Etc.

Candidates: ""ROTAL""? Not a word.

""ROTAS""? But S? Forbidden? Skip.

""ROTHY""? Not a word.

""ROTIS""? Not common.

""ROULETTE""? Too long.

""TOURS""? Starts with T? T at position1? No R at start? So R must be at1? Or we can put R at position3? Or5?

Let's change: put R at position3? Or5?

For example, word with T first? Then we can put R later.

Example: ""TORUS"" T(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), S(5)? But S forbidden? Skip.

""VIRUS""? V,I,R,U,S? S forbidden? Skip.

""GUILD""? No R? But R required.

""POWER""? But no T? And P,O,W,E,R? E forbidden? Skip.

Struggling?

How about these words:

""O"" and ""T"" must be included? So let me search: words with R,T,O and avoid C,A,N,E,S?m=M forbidden.

""BORTY""? Not valid.

""DIRTY"" has D,I,R,T,Y? But no O? Skip.

""DOUGHT""? Not a word.

""HORST"" has S? Skip.

""FRORT""? Not common.

I think I found: ""TORCH""? But C forbidden? Skip.

""BIRTH""? No O? Skip.

Wait, maybe ""THROW""? T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). Has O and T? But O at position4? And R at position3? Let's check:

Positions for R: position3? We haven't tried position3? So new? Similarly O at position4? We haven't tried O at position4? Only tried at position3? So position4 is new? T at position1? We tried T at position2? But not position1? So can.

Also, letters: T, H, R, O, W? All not forbidden? C,A,N,E,S,M are absent okay? So valid word: ""THROW"".

This places:
- T at position1: if T is at1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- H at position2: new char.
- R at position3: if R is at3, ✓ else '-'.
- O at position4: new position for O? We know O is not at3? But at4? Try.
- W at position5: new char.

And it will test all required letters: R, T, O (and H and new).

So I think ""THROW"" is good.

Also, if R is at position3, we can understand? Similarly for T at1 and O at4.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

Response: <guess>throw</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: storm** → S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  This means:  
  - T is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - O is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 4 (confirming it cannot be in positions 2 or 4).  
  - S and M are not in the secret word.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: R, T, O  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out).  
  - T cannot be at position 2.  
  - O cannot be at position 3.  
- The secret word contains exactly the letters R, T, O, and two additional unknown letters (from the unused letter pool: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc., avoiding absent letters).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on placing R, T, and O in new positions to narrow down their locations:  
  - Test R in position 3 (since positions 1 and 5 haven't been tested yet; position 3 is a high-probability option).  
  - Test T in position 1 and O in position 4 (new positions for both).  
- Include two new common letters (e.g., H, W) to maximize feedback coverage.  
- Choose a valid word that fits these constraints:  
  - Avoids absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M.  
  - Includes R, T, O.  

Selected word: **THROW**  
- T at position 1: Tests if T is in position 1.  
- H at position 2: New letter to probe.  
- R at position 3: Tests R in a new position.  
- O at position 4: Tests O in a new position.  
- W at position 5: New letter to probe.  
- Avoids all forbidden letters and efficiently covers R, T, O positioning.

It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We received feedback for guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\n This means:\n - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2).\n - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n So, we know:\n - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.\n - The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.\n\n Also, since R is present but not in the second position, it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Since we don\'t have any other letters known, we need to pick a word that:\n - Excludes the letters C, A, N, E (as they are not in the word).\n - Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.\n - Tries to cover other common letters to get more feedback.\n\n Our first guess had vowels: A and E, but both are absent. So the word likely has other vowels: like O, I, U? Or sometimes Y.\n\n Common vowels to try: O, I, U.\n\n Also, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\n We must avoid: C, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes R (not in the second position) and has other common letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n - R could be at the start: first position? Or third, fourth, or fifth.\n\n We also want to confirm or rule out other vowels and consonants.\n\n Consider starting with a word that puts R in different positions and uses common remaining letters.\n\n Example words:\n - ""ROUST"": R at position 1, but feedback says R is not in position 2? Our R was in position 2 and is wrong, so R should not be in position 2, but could be in 1? \n   However, note: if R were in the first position in the secret word, then when we put R in the second position (as in ""crane""), it would show as \'-\' because it exists but in the wrong place. So it\'s still possible for R to be in the first position.\n\n But wait: in ""crane"", R is in the second position and we got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not here. So R could be in position 1, 3,4,5.\n\n Let me choose a word where R is in a different position, say position 1.\n\n Possible words: ""ROBOT""? But O appears twice and might not be efficient.\n\n Since we know the word doesn\'t have A or E, it might have other vowels: I, O, U.\n\n Another idea: ""PRIOR"" - but has two R\'s, which might be inefficient for gathering information.\n\n However, let\'s aim for a word with new letters.\n\n Let\'s list letters we haven\'t tried: we tried C,R,A,N,E. We avoid those except R.\n\n Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n But we want common ones.\n\n How about: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S.\n\n But note: R is in the second position? Wait, we must avoid R in the second position because our feedback said R is present but not in the second position? No, we can use R in a different position? Actually, in our next guess, we can put R in any position except the second? But we don\'t have to avoid the second, because we already know that if we put it in the second it will be a miss, so we can put it elsewhere.\n\n Actually, we can put R again? But we know R is present so we should reuse R to find its position.\n\n However, we cannot put R in the second position because we already know that\'s not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but we know that if we put it in the second again, we will get the same \'-\' ? And we want to discover the correct position.\n\n So it\'s better to try R in a different position.\n\n Therefore, let me choose a word with R in the first position? Or third? etc.\n\n I\'ll choose R in the first position to test.\n\n Candidate: ""RISKY"" -> R,I,S,K,Y. But we don\'t know if these letters exist.\n\n Another: ""ROAST"" -> but A was absent? Wait, we have A as absent, so avoid A. ""ROAST"" has A, which we know is absent. So skip.\n\n How about ""ROUND""? Has R,O,U,N,D -> but N was absent in the first guess? Wait, we know N is absent.\n\n Similarly, avoid N and A and E and C.\n\n Okay, ""ROUND"": N is present? No, because we got N(x) in crane.\n\n So ""ROUND"" has N which we know is absent -> invalid.\n\n Let\'s pick a word without A,N,E,C and try R in a different position.\n\n Example: ""SPRIG"" -> S,P,R,I,G. S,P,R,I,G.\n\n But let\'s check if it has any forbidden letters? No A,N,E,C. Okay.\n\n However, it has R in the third position? We can try that.\n\n But note: we want to cover common letters. ""SPRIG"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively: ""STORM""? S,T,O,R,M.\n\n Also: no forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n But O: we don\'t know about O.\n\n Let me choose ""STORM"": S,T,O,R,M.\n\n How about ""TROMP""? That might not be very common.\n\n I think ""STORM"" is a good candidate: it has common letters and positions R in the fourth (so not second).\n\n So I\'ll guess ""STORM"".\n\n But wait: we know R is in the word and we are putting R in the fourth? That should help us see if R belongs there.\n\n Alternative: ""PROUD""? -> Has O,U,D. But avoids forbidden letters? Yes? C, A, N, E are forbidden? But U and O are new.\n\n However, let me stick with ""STORM"".\n\n Steps:\n - S: we don\'t know.\n - T: we don\'t know.\n - O: we don\'t know.\n - R: we know is present, but if we put it in fourth, we might get a \'-\' or \'✓\' depending on the secret word.\n - M: we don\'t know.\n\n This will give us feedback on S, T, O, M, and R\'s position (if we get R ✓ then we know it\'s fourth; if we get \'-\' it could be elsewhere).\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STORM"".\n\n But note: we must not use forbidden letters: C,A,N,E. None of S,T,O,R,M are forbidden? Correct.\n\n Therefore: guess ""STORM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)):\n- The secret word contains the letter **R** but not in the second position.\n- The letters **C, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.\n- The secret word must use other vowels (e.g., O, I, U) or consonants since A and E are absent.\n\nFor the next guess, prioritize:\n- Including **R** in a new position (not the second) to test its location.\n- Avoiding forbidden letters: **C, A, N, E**.\n- Covering common letters (like **S, T, O, M**) for additional feedback.\n\n**Selected word: ""STORM""**  \n- Places R in the fourth position (new location).\n- Tests vowels (O) and consonants (S, T, M) not covered in the first guess.\n- Avoids forbidden letters while prioritizing high-frequency characters.\n\n<guess>storm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: storm -> S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)\nMeaning:\n- T is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ""storm"", positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So:\n  S at pos1: x → not in word\n  T at pos2: (-) → in word but not at position 2\n  O at pos3: (-) → in word but not at position 3\n  R at pos4: (-) → in word but not at position 4 (we already knew R is not at 2 from guess1, now also not at 4)\n  M at pos5: x → not in word\n\nSo from both guesses:\n\nLetters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, M\n\nLetters that are in the word:\n- R: but not at pos2 (from guess1) and not at pos4 (from guess2). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be at pos1, pos3, or pos5.\n- T: in the word but not at pos2.\n- O: in the word but not at pos3.\n\nAlso, T and O are new letters we now know are present.\n\nNow, we need to consider the positions:\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).\n\nPossible positions for T: any except 2? But note in ""storm"" it was at pos2 and was wrong position, so T could be at 1,3,4,5? But we don\'t know.\n\nPossible positions for O: any except 3? Could be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nWe also need to form a valid 5-letter word using R, T, O and other letters, but avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nSince we know R is in the word (and must be placed at pos1,3, or5), and T and O are in the word.\n\nMoreover, the secret word must contain at least these: R, T, O.\n\nBut there might be two more letters? Since it\'s 5 letters.\n\nWe don\'t know if there are more distinct letters.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to:\n- Test R in a new position (since in guess1 we tried pos2, guess2 pos4, so now we can try pos1 or pos3 or pos5).\n- Test O and T in new positions.\n- Include other common letters that we haven\'t tested: e.g., I, L, P, U, etc.\n\nBut avoid letters we know are absent: C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nLet me think of words that have R at position 1? Since we haven\'t tested R at position 1.\n\nAlso, if R is at position 1, then we can check if it\'s correct?\n\nSimilarly, we know O and T are present.\n\nSo candidate: words starting with R, that also contain T and O, and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nFor example: ""ROBOT"", but we know O is present? But ""ROBOT"" has O, and T? Yes, but also B? And it has O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O at position 2 and 4? Wait, positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). \n\nHowever, we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got \'-\', which means O is present but not at position 3. So O cannot be at position 3? But in this word, O is at 2 and 4? We don\'t know yet about those.\n\nBut also, we have to avoid letters: E? No E in ""ROBOT"". S,M? No problem.\n\nHowever, note: we also tried R at position 2 and 4? Wait no: in guess1 R was at 2, in guess2 at 4? And both wrong.\n\nBut in ""ROBOT"":\n- Position 1: R → which we haven\'t tried yet? So if secret has R at position 1, we get ✓.\n- Position 2: O → we don\'t know about position 2, but O is present so if it\'s correct we get ✓, else \'-\'.\n- Position 3: B → new letter.\n- Position 4: O → again O? But the same as above? Or if O appears only once?\n- Position 5: T → which we know is present, so if at position 5, ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nBut note: we must not reuse known absent letters? B is new? Okay.\n\nAnother thing: the word ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But the feedback handles duplicates? If there is only one O in the secret, then only one O might be marked.\n\nBut let me think of other words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRIOR""? But has A? No, ""PRIOR"" letters: P,R,I,O,R. Avoids forbidden? Yes? But repeated R? Not forbidden? But we know R is present.\n\nBut position: R might be at 1? Then R(1): try.\n\n""TROOP""? T at 1? Then R at 2? Wait, position 1: T, position 2: R? But R cannot be at position 2? We already know R at position 2 is incorrect? Because in guess1 R at pos2 got \'-\' meaning not there.\n\nSo we cannot put R at position 2? Because we know that position won\'t be R? Similarly, position 4? We know R is not at position 4 from guess2? So R can only be at 1,3,5.\n\nTherefore, any guess with R must have it at 1,3, or5.\n\nSimilarly, for T: we haven\'t ruled out any positions except position 2? Because in guess2 T at position 2 was marked as \'-\' meaning not at position 2? So T cannot be at position 2? But position 1,3,4,5 are possible.\n\nFor O: cannot be at position 3? Because in guess2 O at pos3 was marked \'-\', so not at position 3? So O can be at 1,2,4,5? Similarly.\n\nSo for next guess:\n\nWe want to try R at position 1? Or 3? Or 5? Let me choose position 1 to test.\n\nThen, since O and T must be in the word, we can place them accordingly.\n\nAlso, we need two more letters? And avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nSo, we must choose words that start with R, have O and T somewhere, and two new consonants or vowels.\n\nCommon English words: \n\n""ROTATE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. Cannot use E.\n\n""ROUND""? Has N? N is forbidden? We know N is not in the word? So avoid.\n\n""ROGUE""? Has E and U? U is not forbidden? But E is forbidden. So skip.\n\n""RHYTHM""? Has H,Y,T,H,M? M is forbidden? We know M is not in the word? So skip.\n\n""DOUBT""? Starts with D? But we want R at start.\n\nBetter: let\'s consider R followed by a vowel? Then a consonant? Etc.\n\nWord: ""RUSTY""? R(1),U(2),S(3)? But S: we know S is absent? From guess2 S was at position1 and got x? So S is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use S? Oh, I forgot: S is forbidden? Yes, from guess2 S(x). So S is absent.\n\nSimilarly, M is absent? So in ""RUSTY"", S is there? Skip.\n\nSo avoid S.\n\nWe need a word that avoids C,A,N,E,S,M, but has R first, and O and T.\n\nSo: R something O something T? Or mixed.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROBOT"" as I thought? But has O twice? But O is allowed multiple times? Only if the secret has two Os? Well possible? But let\'s see.\n\n""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5)\n\nIn this guess:\n- R at pos1: we can test R\'s position? If R is at pos1, we get ✓ else \'-\'.\n- O at pos2: if O is in secret and at pos2, ✓ else \'-\'.\n- B at pos3: new letter → feedback will tell if present and position.\n- O at pos4: but O again? And if there is only one O, then one might be marked differently? But the feedback rules: for each letter independently? Actually, no: if the secret has duplicate letters? Well, the rules are per occurrence? But standard wordle rules: I think each feedback corresponds to each position independently? But if there is only one O, then the first O might be marked and the second might be absent etc.\n\nSuppose secret has only one O: then if we guess O at position 2 and it\'s correct? But in ""ROBOT"" we have two O\'s? The feedback might mark one O correctly and mark the other as absent? But let me see.\n\nActually, in the example given at the start: secret ""BRISK"", guess ""STORM"" → feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at pos1? But S is not duplicated.\n\nFor duplicates: if secret has only one O and we guess two O\'s, then one O might get ✓ or \'-\' and the other will get x? But standard Wordle: yes. For example, secret CHESS guess TEASE: first E gets \'-\' because CHESS has E only in the fourth position? So the E at pos2 would be \'-\' only if the secret has an E not at pos2? And the E at pos4 would be ✓? But I\'m confusing.\n\nBut for our purpose, ""ROBOT"" might be okay? Alternatively, choose a word without duplicates.\n\nTo avoid confusion? But valid words are allowed? So I\'ll use ""ROBOT"".\n\nBut let me think of a word with distinct letters? But R, T, O must be included? And avoid forbidden: so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but O and T are already known? So we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)\n\nCommon: L, D, B, H, etc.\n\nWord: ""RIGHT"" → but no O? We must include O? Wait no, we know O is present? We don\'t have to include O? We can test other letters? But since we know O is present, we should try to locate it? Similarly for T.\n\nBut we have a constraint: O and T are in the word? So we can choose a word without O? But that would be inefficient? Because we won\'t get information on O? Or if we don\'t include O, then we might get feedback that O is present? But we already know O is present? So that feedback would be redundant? Actually, we already know O is present? So we can skip? But then we won\'t get position info? So it\'s better to place O in different position? Similarly for T and R.\n\nBut for R, we must place at 1,3, or5? Since we haven\'t tried at 1,5? We tried at 2 and 4? So positions 1,3,5 available.\n\nSimilarly, O: we tried at 3 and it was wrong? So we haven\'t tried O at other positions: 1,2,4,5? Similarly T: we tried at position 2? So positions 1,3,4,5 available? But for T, we can place in positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nSo, let me choose a word that places:\n- R at position 1? Then O and T elsewhere? Avoid positions we know are wrong for each? But we don\'t know their correct positions except that they can\'t be at the positions we already tried? Only for O we know it\'s not at 3? Similarly T not at 2? But we can place at other positions? And R at 1,3, or5.\n\nI think ""PROUD""? But starts with P? We want R at 1? Then ""RO"" something.\n\nHow about ""ROBOT""? Despite duplicate.\n\nAnother: ""ROUTE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""ROOST""? O at position 2 and 3? Position 3: we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got \'-\'? But if O were at position 3 in secret, we would get ✓? But we got \'-\'? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, in ""ROOST"", if O at position 3, it would be wrong? But ""ROOST"" has O at 2,3,4? Too many duplicates.\n\nBetter choose a word without duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters.\n\nWord: ""BUILT"" → no R? Must include R? Because R is in the word? So we cannot omit R? We should include it to test position? Because we don\'t have its position yet.\n\nLet me list: we know R, T, O are in the word? So we must choose a word with R, T, O and two other letters? But we have only 5 letters? Secret has 5 letters? So it must have exactly R,T,O and two more? Or even duplicates? But let\'s proceed.\n\nI\'ll pick ""RATION""? But has A and N? Both forbidden? Skip.\n\n""PORTY""? Not a word.\n\n""DROIT""? Not common.\n\nValid English word: ""TRIED""? But has E? Forbidden.\n\nCan I use L? ""LORRY""? Has L,O,R,R,Y? But R at position 3 and4? But position 4 is already ruled out for R? So if in ""LORRY"" R is at pos3? And we put R there? Also, we tried R at pos2 and4? Not at pos3? So it\'s new? And O at pos2? We haven\'t tried O at pos2? So can.\n\nBut ""LORRY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? Letters: L,O,R,R,Y? No C,A,N,E,S,M? Okay? So it has duplicate R? Should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, ""GROUP""? Has G,R,O,U,P? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And R at position2? But R at position2 is not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position2? From guess1: R at pos2 got \'-\'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position2? So we cannot put R at position2 because it will never be correct? Similarly position4: guess2 R at pos4 got \'-\'? So must put R at 1,3,5? Therefore, ""GROUP"" has R at position2? Wrong? So we avoid such words? Must have R at 1,3, or5.\n\nTherefore, ""GROUP"" is invalid? For testing? No: we can still guess it? But we know R at position2 will give \'-\'? So it\'s a waste? Because we know the state? So it\'s better to put R in a new position: 1,3, or5.\n\nSo words like ""GROUP"" with R at2: not useful? Similarly ""FROST"" has R at2? Skip? But ""FROST"" has S? Absent? Skip.\n\nLet\'s find words with R at position1? \n\nPossible: ""RABID""? But A forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RADIO""? A forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RIFLE""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RIGHT""? I,G,H,T? But no O? We know O is present? So if we don\'t include O, we might not cover it? But we can still guess? But then we won\'t know about O\'s position? Which is bad? We should include O? So ""RIGHT"" doesn\'t have O? Skip.\n\n""ROUGE""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And letters: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). Also has O at pos2? And W,D,Y new? So we can try.\n\n""ROWDY"": \n- R at position1? Good? If R is at1, we get ✓.\n- O at position2? If O is at2, ✓? But we don\'t know? We haven\'t tried O at position2? Only tried at pos3? So possible? If not, and O is elsewhere, \'-\'.\n- W at position3? New? Will get feedback.\n- D at position4? New? Feedback.\n- Y at position5? New? Feedback.\n\nAlso, contains O? And T? Wait, no T? But we know T is in the word? Does ""ROWDY"" have T? No. But wait, we know T is present? So if the secret has T, but our guess has no T, then we might not get information on T? Worse: if we don\'t include T, the feedback will not cover T? But we know T must be in the word? So we should prioritize including T? To find its position? Otherwise, we wasted a guess without testing T.\n\nSo must include T? Yes, because we have limited guesses? Only 6 tries? So we need to test T\'s position as well.\n\nTherefore, the guess must include R (position 1,3,5), O, and T? And two new letters? Avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nNow, let\'s choose a word with these letters.\n\nFor example, ""PROUT""? Not a word.\n\n""TROUT""? But R at position2? We cannot put R at position2? Because we know R is not at position2? So ""TROUT"" has R at position2? Skip? Because it will waste R position.\n\nBetter: ""T"" first? Then R? But R must be at3 or5? Etc.\n\nAssume R at position1? Then include T and O.\n\nExample: ""ROTATED"" too long.\n\n5-letter: ""RATION"" forbidden... ""ROUTE"" has E? Skip.\n\n""GRUNT""? Has N? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""TRUCK""? Has C? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""PROD"" too short.\n\nThink of ""BROTH"": B,R,O,T,H? Letters: B,R,O,T,H. Avoids forbidden? No A,C,E,N,S,M? B, H not used. And R(1), O(2), T(4)... positions: B(1)? Wait, if we want R at1? How about ""BROTH"" is B,R,O,T,H -> so position1=B, position2=R? But R: position2? We know R is not at position2!? So B at1, R at2: R at position2 which we know is no good? So we get \'-\' for R? But we want to try R at a new position? So not helpful.\n\nHow about R at position1? So structure: R _ _ _ _\n\nMust include T and O? And two new letters? Avoid forbidden.\n\nSo: R followed by a letter, then O? T? Etc.\n\nCandidates: ""ROTAL""? Not a word.\n\n""ROTAS""? But S? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""ROTHY""? Not a word.\n\n""ROTIS""? Not common.\n\n""ROULETTE""? Too long.\n\n""TOURS""? Starts with T? T at position1? No R at start? So R must be at1? Or we can put R at position3? Or5?\n\nLet\'s change: put R at position3? Or5?\n\nFor example, word with T first? Then we can put R later.\n\nExample: ""TORUS"" T(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), S(5)? But S forbidden? Skip.\n\n""VIRUS""? V,I,R,U,S? S forbidden? Skip.\n\n""GUILD""? No R? But R required.\n\n""POWER""? But no T? And P,O,W,E,R? E forbidden? Skip.\n\nStruggling?\n\nHow about these words:\n\n""O"" and ""T"" must be included? So let me search: words with R,T,O and avoid C,A,N,E,S?m=M forbidden.\n\n""BORTY""? Not valid.\n\n""DIRTY"" has D,I,R,T,Y? But no O? Skip.\n\n""DOUGHT""? Not a word.\n\n""HORST"" has S? Skip.\n\n""FRORT""? Not common.\n\nI think I found: ""TORCH""? But C forbidden? Skip.\n\n""BIRTH""? No O? Skip.\n\nWait, maybe ""THROW""? T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). Has O and T? But O at position4? And R at position3? Let\'s check:\n\nPositions for R: position3? We haven\'t tried position3? So new? Similarly O at position4? We haven\'t tried O at position4? Only tried at position3? So position4 is new? T at position1? We tried T at position2? But not position1? So can.\n\nAlso, letters: T, H, R, O, W? All not forbidden? C,A,N,E,S,M are absent okay? So valid word: ""THROW"".\n\nThis places:\n- T at position1: if T is at1, we get ✓ else \'-\'.\n- H at position2: new char.\n- R at position3: if R is at3, ✓ else \'-\'.\n- O at position4: new position for O?

We have feedback from Guess 3: throw -> T(✓) H(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x)

This tells us:
- T is in the correct position (position 1): so the secret word starts with T.
- R is in the correct position (position 3): so the third letter is R.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as '-'). 
- H and W are not in the word (H(x), W(x)).

Recall from previous feedback:
- In guess 1: R(-) meant R is in the word but not position 2 (but now we know it's at position 3).
- In guess 2: T(-) meant T is in word but not position 2 (now we know it's at position 1) and O(-) meant O in word but not position 3 (which we knew because position 3 was R, so O couldn't be there).

So currently, we know:
- The secret word is: T _ R _ _ 
- The word contains O, but not in position 4 (and we know it's not in position 3 because that's R). So O must be in position 2 or 5? Because positions 1,3,4 are known? Position 1 is T, 3 is R. Position 4 we tried O and it was wrong. So O must be in position 2 or 5.

But wait, from guess 1: we had R at position 2? And it was '-', meaning O if in position 2 would not conflict? So yes, O can be at position 2.

Similarly, from guess 2: O was tried at position 3? And got '-', so O cannot be at position 3? But position 3 is R? So irrelevant? Anyway.

Also, we know the letters not in the word: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W (from previous guesses).

So missing letters: position 2, 4, and 5? Since:
Position 1: T (fixed)
Position 2: ? but cannot be O? Or could be? It might be O? Or another letter?
Position 3: R (fixed)
Position 4: ? and we know O is not at 4? So not O? But O is in the word? So O must be at position 5? Unless it's at position 2? Let me clarify.

Position 2: we haven't tried O at position 2? So it could be O? But we did nothing prohibitive? Similarly position 5? Could be O?

But now, from guess 3: O tried at position 4? Got '-', meaning O is in the word but not at position 4? And since it's not at position 3? Then O must be at position 2 or 5? Yes.

However, can O be at position 2? Since in guess 1 we had R at position 2? And we didn't place O at position 2? Yes? We never tried O in position 2? So?

But we also have to account for what letters are available? We know the secret word must include O? And positions: if O is in position 2, then we have T O R _ _? Or if in position 5: T _ R _ O?

But also, there's one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters? So the secret word has T, R, O, and two other letters? But we already have positions: for 1 and 3, and O in 2 or 5? So actually, only one unknown letter? Wait, no: we only know three letters? T,R,O? But the secret word has other letters? We haven't known the other letters? Or did we?

Wait, no: we only know T,R,O are present? And that C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? But we also had guess 2: which had O and R? So at least T,R,O? But there are two more letters? Because between position 2,4,5? And O occupying one? So one more letter? Actually two? Let's see:

If O is at position 2? Then T O R _ _ ? Then position 4 and 5 are unknown? So two more letters? But we know O is already used? And we need to place two other letters? But we don't know them? Similarly, if O at position 5? T _ R _ O? Then position 2 and 4 are unknown? Two more letters? So two more letters.

But actually, the secret word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily? So duplicates are possible? So O might appear twice? But unlikely? Common case?

First, let's list the known information:
- First letter: T
- Third letter: R
- The secret contains the letter O? And O is not at 3 or 4? So O must be at 2 or 5? 
- Also, the remaining positions: 
  If O at position 2? Then positions 4 and 5: need two more letters? 
  If O at position 5? Then positions 2 and 4: need two more letters? 
- Avoid forbidden letters: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W? So we must choose from remaining alphabet: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z? Not very constrained? But we can use common letters.

Moreover, we have to make a valid English word? 

Now, for the next guess, we want to confirm the position of O? And find the other letters? 

But we have two scenarios: 
Case 1: O is at position 2? Then word is T O R _ _
Case 2: O is at position 5? Then word is T _ R _ O

In Case 1: T O R _ _ ? Then we must fill positions 4 and 5? With two letters from available set? And form valid word? Examples: TORUS? But S forbidden? Skip. TORCH? C forbidden? Etc.

In Case 2: T _ R _ O? Fill position 2 and 4? Examples: WORDY? But W forbidden? Avoid. FUNKY? But F,U,N,K? N forbidden? Etc.

Actually, we haven't tested many letters? So it's better to choose a word that covers common letters and helps distinguish? But since O might be at 2 or 5, we could try a word without O? But we know O is present? So why not? Actually we have already O? If we don't include O, the feedback will show '-' only if the secret has O? But not where we put it? But we already know O is present? So if we omit O, we get no new info? Which is bad? So we should include O? In a position that might be correct? Or in a new position? But we have only positions 2 and 5? We haven't tried O in position 5? Or position 2? 

Guess 3 we tried O at position 4? So we haven't tried O at position 2 or 5? 

So we can choose:
Option A: guess a word with O at position 2? Then if O is at position 2? We get ✓? Else '-'? And similarly? 

Option B: guess a word with O at position 5? To test that?

Additionally, we need to cover other positions? Since positions 4 and 5 or 2 and 4? Have unknown letters.

But with only 3 guesses left? We need to be efficient.

So for your guess, you can choose to try O in position 2? Or position 5? Or even try O in both? Impossible? Haha.

Actually, we can guess one. But then we risk? Or we can guess a word that tests O at position 2? And covers common letters? 

For example, for Case 1: if O at position 2? T O R _ _? We can guess ""TORID""? But not common? Or ""TORAL""? Etc.

But also possible: O not at position 2? Then our guess might have O at 2? Which is wrong position? So we get '-'.

So let's prepare a guess that accepts that.

I think we should try O in position 5? Because we haven't tried O away from the start? 

Candidate: T _ R _ O

Need to fill position 2 and 4? With common letters? Avoid forbidden?

Possible: ""TARDO""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""TERRA""? E forbidden? Skip.

""TIRES""? S and E forbidden? Skip.

""DIRTY""? D,I,R,T,Y? But we have T I R D Y? Or T at position1? R at position3? O at position5? But ""DIRTY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? But what about the middle? Position2: D? Position4: T? But T is already at position1? Duplicate? If the secret has duplicate T? Possible? But in our case? We might allow.

But ""DIRTY"" letters: D,I,R,T,Y? Positions: D(2), I(3)? Wait no: secret has position 3 as R? So if we guess ""DIRTY"": D(1)position? But we position1 must be T? So cannot be D? Therefore: when we guess, position1 should be T? Because we know T must be at1? And position3 must be R? Because R is fixed? So we must guess T at position1 and R at position3? 

Therefore, guessing: Position1: T, position3: R? Position5: O? Then position2: ? and position4: ?

For position2 and4? Any letters from the available set? Avoiding forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W.

Available: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z.

But we want to cover common letters? Or to get feedback.

For example, use I and L? ""T I R L O""? Not valid.

""T U R F O""? ""Turfo""? Not a word? Valid English word.

""TIRO""? 4 letters? 5-letter word needed.

Possible words: ""THIRO""? H forbidden? Skip? ""TIGRO"" not valid.

I know: ""TIERS""? E forbidden? Skip.

""LYRES""? S forbidden.

Think of: ""TYROS""? T Y R O S? But S forbidden? Skip? But S is absent? So avoid.

But S forbidden? Cannot.

Another: ""BIROS""? S forbidden? Skip.

""KEROS""? K,E,R,O,S? E forbidden? Skip.

""FJORD""? But F,J,O,R,D? Position: F at1? But our position1 must be T? Not F? But we have T at position1? So we must start with T.

Therefore, guess format must be: T ? R ? O? Fill in positions 2 and 4.

Potential letters for position 2: vowel? To form a word? Like I or U? And position4: consonant?

Examples:
- T I R _ O? What? TIRL? Not 5? 
- T U R _ O? Like ""TURO""? Not? 

""TUROP""? Not.

Actually, English words: ""BURRO""? But position1 must be T? Can't.

Perhaps a word like ""TERRO""? E forbidden? Skip.

Use different letters: ""PYRRO""? Not word.

Valid word: ""TAROT""? Has A? Forbidden? Skip.

""TEARY""? E forbidden? Skip.

Maybe ""DUCKY""? Not.

I found: ""THROB""? But H forbidden? And position5 must be O? Rather B? No? Our guess must have O at position5? So we know O must be present? So in the secret? Therefore, in our guess we should put O in position5? To see if it's correct? Otherwise, we must not omit O.

But we have position constraints.

Alternatively, we can try O in position2 in this guess? But I was planning O at5.

If we try O at position2? Then the word format: T O R ? ? ? Then positions 4 and5? And O at position2? Which if O is at position2? We get ✓? Else '-'? So we can test.

Then, for positions 4 and5: unknown? We can then probe these positions? But with common letters.

Also, the word must include the letter O? And we put it at position2? Which might be the right spot? Or not? 

But for the secret, if O is at position5? Not at2? Then our guess will show O as '-'? Meaning in the word? But not at position2? So we can then infer O is at position5? Etc.

Let's do that? Then the next guess can resolve.

Therefore, guess: Position1: T, position2: O, position3: R, position4: I, position5: D? But is ""TORID"" a word? Yes? It means something like dry etc.

But T O R I D? Now, we also probe I and D? Which are new.

If O is at position2? We get O ✓? Then we know? And I and D? 

But if O is at position5? Then our O at2 will be '-', and we might get a '-' or ✓ for R? But R is fixed? And we know T and R are fixed? So O at position2: if present but wrong? Or if the secret is T?R?O with O at5, but has no duplicate O? Then O at position2 would be marked 'x'? But wait, we know O is present? So if we put O at position2, and O is at position5? Then O is in the word? But not at position2? So we get '-' for O at2? Similarly, at other? Then we also get feedback on I and D? But we might have duplicates? 

But standard rule: each letter feedback is independent? If the secret has one O? Then when we put O at position2 and O is at position5? Then we get:
- T: ✓ (since position1 T)
- O at2: '-' because O exists but not at2
- R: ✓ (position3)
- I: to be determined? If I in word and position4? 
- D: ... 

But let me pick ""TORID"": T,O,R,I,D? Avoids forbidden? Letters except forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? TORID uses T,O,R,I,D? All legal? Yes.

But we know O is present? So if O is in secret at position2? Then O will be ✓? Else if it's at position5? Then O will show '-'? Then we know O is at position5? So it's good.

So let's guess ""TORID"".

But is TORID valid? Yes? Adjective meaning dry etc.

Alternatively, ""PILEI""? Not.

So I'll go with ""TORID"".

### Previous Feedback Summary:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → R is in the word but not position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  → T and O are in the word but not at positions 2 or 3; R is not at position 4; S and M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (throw)**: T(✓), H(x), R(✓), O(-), W(x)  
  → T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word but not position 4; H and W are absent.

### Key Inferences:
- **Secret word pattern**: `T _ R _ _` (T at position 1, R at position 3).
- **Confirmed letters in word**: T, R, O (O must be in one of the remaining spots: 2 or 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - O cannot be at position 4 (from guess 3) or position 3 (impossible due to R).
  - Positions 2 and 5 are unknown except that one must be O.
- The word has two remaining unknown letters (unless O occupies one spot).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize testing the position of O (either position 2 or 5) to resolve ambiguity.
- Include O in position 2 to test if it is correct. If not, O must be at position 5.
- Fill positions 4 and 5 with common unused consonants to gather feedback on new letters (e.g., I and D).
- Avoid absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W. Choose from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Select a valid English word fitting the constraints.

**Chosen word: ""TORID""**  
- Positions: T(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), D(5).  
- Tests O at position 2: 
  - If ✓, O is confirmed at position 2.
  - If (-), O must be at position 5.
- Probes new letters (I and D) at positions 4 and 5.
- Efficiently uses common unused letters without forbidden characters.

Let's do that? Then the next guess can resolve.

Therefore, guess: Position1: T, position2: O, position3: R, position4: I, position5: D? But is ""TORID"" a word? Yes? It means something like dry etc.

But T O R I D? Now, we also probe I and D? Which are new.

If O is at position2? We get O ✓? Then we know? And I and D? 

But if O is at position5? Then our O at2 will be '-', and we might get a '-' or ✓ for R? But R is fixed? And we know T and R are fixed? So O at position2: if present but wrong? Or if the secret is T?R?O with O at5, but has no duplicate O? Then O at position2 would be marked 'x'? But wait, we know O is present? So if we put O at position2, and O is at position5? Then O is in the word? But not at position2? So we get '-' for O at2? Similarly, at other? Then we also get feedback on I and D? But we might have duplicates? 

But standard rule: each letter feedback is independent? If the secret has one O? Then when we put O at position2 and O is at position5? Then we get:
- T: ✓ (since position1 T)
- O at2: '-' because O exists but not at2
- R: ✓ (position3)
- I: to be determined? If I in word and position4? 
- D: ... 

But let me pick ""TORID"": T,O,R,I,D? Avoids forbidden? Letters except forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? TORID uses T,O,R,I,D? All legal? Yes.

But we know O is present? So if O is in secret at position2? Then O will be ✓? Else if it's at position5? Then O will show '-'? Then we know O is at position5? So it's good.

So let's guess ""TORID"".

But is TORID valid? Yes? Adjective meaning dry etc.

Alternatively, ""PILEI""? Not.

So I'll go with ""TORID"".### Previous Feedback Summary:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → R is in the word but not position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  → T and O are in the word but not at positions 2 or 3; R is not at position 4; S and M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (throw)**: T(✓), H(x), R(✓), O(-), W(x)  
  → T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word but not position 4; H and W are absent.

### Key Inferences:
- **Secret word pattern**: `T _ R _ _` (T at position 1, R at position 3).
- **Confirmed letters in word**: T, R, O (O must be in one of the remaining spots: 2 or 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - O cannot be at position 4 (from guess 3) or position 3 (impossible due to R).
  - Positions 2 and 5 are unknown except that one must be O.
- The word has two remaining unknown letters (unless O occupies one spot).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize testing the position of O (either position 2 or 5) to resolve ambiguity.
- Include O in position 2 to test if it is correct. If not, O must be at position 5.
- Fill positions 4 and 5 with common unused consonants to gather feedback on new letters (e.g., I and D).
- Avoid absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W. Choose from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Select a valid English word fitting the constraints.

**Chosen word: ""TORID""**  
- Positions: T(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), D(5).  
- Tests O at position 2: 
  - If ✓, O is confirmed at position 2.
  - If (-), O must be at position 5.
- Probes new letters (I and D) at positions 4 and 5.
- Efficiently uses common unused letters without forbidden characters.",Guess 4: torid -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(-) R(✓) I(x) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,TURBO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2).
 - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 Also, since R is present but not in the second position, it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we don't have any other letters known, we need to pick a word that:
 - Excludes the letters C, A, N, E (as they are not in the word).
 - Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - Tries to cover other common letters to get more feedback.

 Our first guess had vowels: A and E, but both are absent. So the word likely has other vowels: like O, I, U? Or sometimes Y.

 Common vowels to try: O, I, U.

 Also, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 We must avoid: C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of a word that includes R (not in the second position) and has other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - R could be at the start: first position? Or third, fourth, or fifth.

 We also want to confirm or rule out other vowels and consonants.

 Consider starting with a word that puts R in different positions and uses common remaining letters.

 Example words:
 - ""ROUST"": R at position 1, but feedback says R is not in position 2? Our R was in position 2 and is wrong, so R should not be in position 2, but could be in 1? 
   However, note: if R were in the first position in the secret word, then when we put R in the second position (as in ""crane""), it would show as '-' because it exists but in the wrong place. So it's still possible for R to be in the first position.

 But wait: in ""crane"", R is in the second position and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not here. So R could be in position 1, 3,4,5.

 Let me choose a word where R is in a different position, say position 1.

 Possible words: ""ROBOT""? But O appears twice and might not be efficient.

 Since we know the word doesn't have A or E, it might have other vowels: I, O, U.

 Another idea: ""PRIOR"" - but has two R's, which might be inefficient for gathering information.

 However, let's aim for a word with new letters.

 Let's list letters we haven't tried: we tried C,R,A,N,E. We avoid those except R.

 Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 But we want common ones.

 How about: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S.

 But note: R is in the second position? Wait, we must avoid R in the second position because our feedback said R is present but not in the second position? No, we can use R in a different position? Actually, in our next guess, we can put R in any position except the second? But we don't have to avoid the second, because we already know that if we put it in the second it will be a miss, so we can put it elsewhere.

 Actually, we can put R again? But we know R is present so we should reuse R to find its position.

 However, we cannot put R in the second position because we already know that's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but we know that if we put it in the second again, we will get the same '-' ? And we want to discover the correct position.

 So it's better to try R in a different position.

 Therefore, let me choose a word with R in the first position? Or third? etc.

 I'll choose R in the first position to test.

 Candidate: ""RISKY"" -> R,I,S,K,Y. But we don't know if these letters exist.

 Another: ""ROAST"" -> but A was absent? Wait, we have A as absent, so avoid A. ""ROAST"" has A, which we know is absent. So skip.

 How about ""ROUND""? Has R,O,U,N,D -> but N was absent in the first guess? Wait, we know N is absent.

 Similarly, avoid N and A and E and C.

 Okay, ""ROUND"": N is present? No, because we got N(x) in crane.

 So ""ROUND"" has N which we know is absent -> invalid.

 Let's pick a word without A,N,E,C and try R in a different position.

 Example: ""SPRIG"" -> S,P,R,I,G. S,P,R,I,G.

 But let's check if it has any forbidden letters? No A,N,E,C. Okay.

 However, it has R in the third position? We can try that.

 But note: we want to cover common letters. ""SPRIG"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Alternatively: ""STORM""? S,T,O,R,M.

 Also: no forbidden letters? Yes.

 But O: we don't know about O.

 Let me choose ""STORM"": S,T,O,R,M.

 How about ""TROMP""? That might not be very common.

 I think ""STORM"" is a good candidate: it has common letters and positions R in the fourth (so not second).

 So I'll guess ""STORM"".

 But wait: we know R is in the word and we are putting R in the fourth? That should help us see if R belongs there.

 Alternative: ""PROUD""? -> Has O,U,D. But avoids forbidden letters? Yes? C, A, N, E are forbidden? But U and O are new.

 However, let me stick with ""STORM"".

 Steps:
 - S: we don't know.
 - T: we don't know.
 - O: we don't know.
 - R: we know is present, but if we put it in fourth, we might get a '-' or '✓' depending on the secret word.
 - M: we don't know.

 This will give us feedback on S, T, O, M, and R's position (if we get R ✓ then we know it's fourth; if we get '-' it could be elsewhere).

 So, I'll go with ""STORM"".

 But note: we must not use forbidden letters: C,A,N,E. None of S,T,O,R,M are forbidden? Correct.

 Therefore: guess ""STORM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)):
- The secret word contains the letter **R** but not in the second position.
- The letters **C, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.
- The secret word must use other vowels (e.g., O, I, U) or consonants since A and E are absent.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Including **R** in a new position (not the second) to test its location.
- Avoiding forbidden letters: **C, A, N, E**.
- Covering common letters (like **S, T, O, M**) for additional feedback.

**Selected word: ""STORM""**  
- Places R in the fourth position (new location).
- Tests vowels (O) and consonants (S, T, M) not covered in the first guess.
- Avoids forbidden letters while prioritizing high-frequency characters.

<guess>storm</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: storm -> S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ""storm"", positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So:
  S at pos1: x → not in word
  T at pos2: (-) → in word but not at position 2
  O at pos3: (-) → in word but not at position 3
  R at pos4: (-) → in word but not at position 4 (we already knew R is not at 2 from guess1, now also not at 4)
  M at pos5: x → not in word

So from both guesses:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, M

Letters that are in the word:
- R: but not at pos2 (from guess1) and not at pos4 (from guess2). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be at pos1, pos3, or pos5.
- T: in the word but not at pos2.
- O: in the word but not at pos3.

Also, T and O are new letters we now know are present.

Now, we need to consider the positions:

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).

Possible positions for T: any except 2? But note in ""storm"" it was at pos2 and was wrong position, so T could be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know.

Possible positions for O: any except 3? Could be at 1,2,4,5.

We also need to form a valid 5-letter word using R, T, O and other letters, but avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Since we know R is in the word (and must be placed at pos1,3, or5), and T and O are in the word.

Moreover, the secret word must contain at least these: R, T, O.

But there might be two more letters? Since it's 5 letters.

We don't know if there are more distinct letters.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test R in a new position (since in guess1 we tried pos2, guess2 pos4, so now we can try pos1 or pos3 or pos5).
- Test O and T in new positions.
- Include other common letters that we haven't tested: e.g., I, L, P, U, etc.

But avoid letters we know are absent: C,A,N,E,S,M.

Let me think of words that have R at position 1? Since we haven't tested R at position 1.

Also, if R is at position 1, then we can check if it's correct?

Similarly, we know O and T are present.

So candidate: words starting with R, that also contain T and O, and avoid forbidden letters.

For example: ""ROBOT"", but we know O is present? But ""ROBOT"" has O, and T? Yes, but also B? And it has O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O at position 2 and 4? Wait, positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). 

However, we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-', which means O is present but not at position 3. So O cannot be at position 3? But in this word, O is at 2 and 4? We don't know yet about those.

But also, we have to avoid letters: E? No E in ""ROBOT"". S,M? No problem.

However, note: we also tried R at position 2 and 4? Wait no: in guess1 R was at 2, in guess2 at 4? And both wrong.

But in ""ROBOT"":
- Position 1: R → which we haven't tried yet? So if secret has R at position 1, we get ✓.
- Position 2: O → we don't know about position 2, but O is present so if it's correct we get ✓, else '-'.
- Position 3: B → new letter.
- Position 4: O → again O? But the same as above? Or if O appears only once?
- Position 5: T → which we know is present, so if at position 5, ✓ or '-'.

But note: we must not reuse known absent letters? B is new? Okay.

Another thing: the word ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But the feedback handles duplicates? If there is only one O in the secret, then only one O might be marked.

But let me think of other words.

Another candidate: ""PRIOR""? But has A? No, ""PRIOR"" letters: P,R,I,O,R. Avoids forbidden? Yes? But repeated R? Not forbidden? But we know R is present.

But position: R might be at 1? Then R(1): try.

""TROOP""? T at 1? Then R at 2? Wait, position 1: T, position 2: R? But R cannot be at position 2? We already know R at position 2 is incorrect? Because in guess1 R at pos2 got '-' meaning not there.

So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we know that position won't be R? Similarly, position 4? We know R is not at position 4 from guess2? So R can only be at 1,3,5.

Therefore, any guess with R must have it at 1,3, or5.

Similarly, for T: we haven't ruled out any positions except position 2? Because in guess2 T at position 2 was marked as '-' meaning not at position 2? So T cannot be at position 2? But position 1,3,4,5 are possible.

For O: cannot be at position 3? Because in guess2 O at pos3 was marked '-', so not at position 3? So O can be at 1,2,4,5? Similarly.

So for next guess:

We want to try R at position 1? Or 3? Or 5? Let me choose position 1 to test.

Then, since O and T must be in the word, we can place them accordingly.

Also, we need two more letters? And avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

So, we must choose words that start with R, have O and T somewhere, and two new consonants or vowels.

Common English words: 

""ROTATE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. Cannot use E.

""ROUND""? Has N? N is forbidden? We know N is not in the word? So avoid.

""ROGUE""? Has E and U? U is not forbidden? But E is forbidden. So skip.

""RHYTHM""? Has H,Y,T,H,M? M is forbidden? We know M is not in the word? So skip.

""DOUBT""? Starts with D? But we want R at start.

Better: let's consider R followed by a vowel? Then a consonant? Etc.

Word: ""RUSTY""? R(1),U(2),S(3)? But S: we know S is absent? From guess2 S was at position1 and got x? So S is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use S? Oh, I forgot: S is forbidden? Yes, from guess2 S(x). So S is absent.

Similarly, M is absent? So in ""RUSTY"", S is there? Skip.

So avoid S.

We need a word that avoids C,A,N,E,S,M, but has R first, and O and T.

So: R something O something T? Or mixed.

Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" as I thought? But has O twice? But O is allowed multiple times? Only if the secret has two Os? Well possible? But let's see.

""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5)

In this guess:
- R at pos1: we can test R's position? If R is at pos1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- O at pos2: if O is in secret and at pos2, ✓ else '-'.
- B at pos3: new letter → feedback will tell if present and position.
- O at pos4: but O again? And if there is only one O, then one might be marked differently? But the feedback rules: for each letter independently? Actually, no: if the secret has duplicate letters? Well, the rules are per occurrence? But standard wordle rules: I think each feedback corresponds to each position independently? But if there is only one O, then the first O might be marked and the second might be absent etc.

Suppose secret has only one O: then if we guess O at position 2 and it's correct? But in ""ROBOT"" we have two O's? The feedback might mark one O correctly and mark the other as absent? But let me see.

Actually, in the example given at the start: secret ""BRISK"", guess ""STORM"" → feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at pos1? But S is not duplicated.

For duplicates: if secret has only one O and we guess two O's, then one O might get ✓ or '-' and the other will get x? But standard Wordle: yes. For example, secret CHESS guess TEASE: first E gets '-' because CHESS has E only in the fourth position? So the E at pos2 would be '-' only if the secret has an E not at pos2? And the E at pos4 would be ✓? But I'm confusing.

But for our purpose, ""ROBOT"" might be okay? Alternatively, choose a word without duplicates.

To avoid confusion? But valid words are allowed? So I'll use ""ROBOT"".

But let me think of a word with distinct letters? But R, T, O must be included? And avoid forbidden: so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but O and T are already known? So we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)

Common: L, D, B, H, etc.

Word: ""RIGHT"" → but no O? We must include O? Wait no, we know O is present? We don't have to include O? We can test other letters? But since we know O is present, we should try to locate it? Similarly for T.

But we have a constraint: O and T are in the word? So we can choose a word without O? But that would be inefficient? Because we won't get information on O? Or if we don't include O, then we might get feedback that O is present? But we already know O is present? So that feedback would be redundant? Actually, we already know O is present? So we can skip? But then we won't get position info? So it's better to place O in different position? Similarly for T and R.

But for R, we must place at 1,3, or5? Since we haven't tried at 1,5? We tried at 2 and 4? So positions 1,3,5 available.

Similarly, O: we tried at 3 and it was wrong? So we haven't tried O at other positions: 1,2,4,5? Similarly T: we tried at position 2? So positions 1,3,4,5 available? But for T, we can place in positions 1,3,4,5.

So, let me choose a word that places:
- R at position 1? Then O and T elsewhere? Avoid positions we know are wrong for each? But we don't know their correct positions except that they can't be at the positions we already tried? Only for O we know it's not at 3? Similarly T not at 2? But we can place at other positions? And R at 1,3, or5.

I think ""PROUD""? But starts with P? We want R at 1? Then ""RO"" something.

How about ""ROBOT""? Despite duplicate.

Another: ""ROUTE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Skip.

""ROOST""? O at position 2 and 3? Position 3: we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got '-'? But if O were at position 3 in secret, we would get ✓? But we got '-'? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, in ""ROOST"", if O at position 3, it would be wrong? But ""ROOST"" has O at 2,3,4? Too many duplicates.

Better choose a word without duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters.

Word: ""BUILT"" → no R? Must include R? Because R is in the word? So we cannot omit R? We should include it to test position? Because we don't have its position yet.

Let me list: we know R, T, O are in the word? So we must choose a word with R, T, O and two other letters? But we have only 5 letters? Secret has 5 letters? So it must have exactly R,T,O and two more? Or even duplicates? But let's proceed.

I'll pick ""RATION""? But has A and N? Both forbidden? Skip.

""PORTY""? Not a word.

""DROIT""? Not common.

Valid English word: ""TRIED""? But has E? Forbidden.

Can I use L? ""LORRY""? Has L,O,R,R,Y? But R at position 3 and4? But position 4 is already ruled out for R? So if in ""LORRY"" R is at pos3? And we put R there? Also, we tried R at pos2 and4? Not at pos3? So it's new? And O at pos2? We haven't tried O at pos2? So can.

But ""LORRY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? Letters: L,O,R,R,Y? No C,A,N,E,S,M? Okay? So it has duplicate R? Should be fine.

Alternatively, ""GROUP""? Has G,R,O,U,P? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And R at position2? But R at position2 is not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position2? From guess1: R at pos2 got '-'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position2? So we cannot put R at position2 because it will never be correct? Similarly position4: guess2 R at pos4 got '-'? So must put R at 1,3,5? Therefore, ""GROUP"" has R at position2? Wrong? So we avoid such words? Must have R at 1,3, or5.

Therefore, ""GROUP"" is invalid? For testing? No: we can still guess it? But we know R at position2 will give '-'? So it's a waste? Because we know the state? So it's better to put R in a new position: 1,3, or5.

So words like ""GROUP"" with R at2: not useful? Similarly ""FROST"" has R at2? Skip? But ""FROST"" has S? Absent? Skip.

Let's find words with R at position1? 

Possible: ""RABID""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""RADIO""? A forbidden? Skip.

""RIFLE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""RIGHT""? I,G,H,T? But no O? We know O is present? So if we don't include O, we might not cover it? But we can still guess? But then we won't know about O's position? Which is bad? We should include O? So ""RIGHT"" doesn't have O? Skip.

""ROUGE""? E forbidden? Skip.

""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And letters: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). Also has O at pos2? And W,D,Y new? So we can try.

""ROWDY"": 
- R at position1? Good? If R is at1, we get ✓.
- O at position2? If O is at2, ✓? But we don't know? We haven't tried O at position2? Only tried at pos3? So possible? If not, and O is elsewhere, '-'.
- W at position3? New? Will get feedback.
- D at position4? New? Feedback.
- Y at position5? New? Feedback.

Also, contains O? And T? Wait, no T? But we know T is in the word? Does ""ROWDY"" have T? No. But wait, we know T is present? So if the secret has T, but our guess has no T, then we might not get information on T? Worse: if we don't include T, the feedback will not cover T? But we know T must be in the word? So we should prioritize including T? To find its position? Otherwise, we wasted a guess without testing T.

So must include T? Yes, because we have limited guesses? Only 6 tries? So we need to test T's position as well.

Therefore, the guess must include R (position 1,3,5), O, and T? And two new letters? Avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.

Now, let's choose a word with these letters.

For example, ""PROUT""? Not a word.

""TROUT""? But R at position2? We cannot put R at position2? Because we know R is not at position2? So ""TROUT"" has R at position2? Skip? Because it will waste R position.

Better: ""T"" first? Then R? But R must be at3 or5? Etc.

Assume R at position1? Then include T and O.

Example: ""ROTATED"" too long.

5-letter: ""RATION"" forbidden... ""ROUTE"" has E? Skip.

""GRUNT""? Has N? Forbidden? Skip.

""TRUCK""? Has C? Forbidden? Skip.

""PROD"" too short.

Think of ""BROTH"": B,R,O,T,H? Letters: B,R,O,T,H. Avoids forbidden? No A,C,E,N,S,M? B, H not used. And R(1), O(2), T(4)... positions: B(1)? Wait, if we want R at1? How about ""BROTH"" is B,R,O,T,H -> so position1=B, position2=R? But R: position2? We know R is not at position2!? So B at1, R at2: R at position2 which we know is no good? So we get '-' for R? But we want to try R at a new position? So not helpful.

How about R at position1? So structure: R _ _ _ _

Must include T and O? And two new letters? Avoid forbidden.

So: R followed by a letter, then O? T? Etc.

Candidates: ""ROTAL""? Not a word.

""ROTAS""? But S? Forbidden? Skip.

""ROTHY""? Not a word.

""ROTIS""? Not common.

""ROULETTE""? Too long.

""TOURS""? Starts with T? T at position1? No R at start? So R must be at1? Or we can put R at position3? Or5?

Let's change: put R at position3? Or5?

For example, word with T first? Then we can put R later.

Example: ""TORUS"" T(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), S(5)? But S forbidden? Skip.

""VIRUS""? V,I,R,U,S? S forbidden? Skip.

""GUILD""? No R? But R required.

""POWER""? But no T? And P,O,W,E,R? E forbidden? Skip.

Struggling?

How about these words:

""O"" and ""T"" must be included? So let me search: words with R,T,O and avoid C,A,N,E,S?m=M forbidden.

""BORTY""? Not valid.

""DIRTY"" has D,I,R,T,Y? But no O? Skip.

""DOUGHT""? Not a word.

""HORST"" has S? Skip.

""FRORT""? Not common.

I think I found: ""TORCH""? But C forbidden? Skip.

""BIRTH""? No O? Skip.

Wait, maybe ""THROW""? T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). Has O and T? But O at position4? And R at position3? Let's check:

Positions for R: position3? We haven't tried position3? So new? Similarly O at position4? We haven't tried O at position4? Only tried at position3? So position4 is new? T at position1? We tried T at position2? But not position1? So can.

Also, letters: T, H, R, O, W? All not forbidden? C,A,N,E,S,M are absent okay? So valid word: ""THROW"".

This places:
- T at position1: if T is at1, we get ✓ else '-'.
- H at position2: new char.
- R at position3: if R is at3, ✓ else '-'.
- O at position4: new position for O? We know O is not at3? But at4? Try.
- W at position5: new char.

And it will test all required letters: R, T, O (and H and new).

So I think ""THROW"" is good.

Also, if R is at position3, we can understand? Similarly for T at1 and O at4.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

Response: <guess>throw</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: storm** → S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  This means:  
  - T is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - O is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 4 (confirming it cannot be in positions 2 or 4).  
  - S and M are not in the secret word.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: R, T, O  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out).  
  - T cannot be at position 2.  
  - O cannot be at position 3.  
- The secret word contains exactly the letters R, T, O, and two additional unknown letters (from the unused letter pool: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc., avoiding absent letters).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on placing R, T, and O in new positions to narrow down their locations:  
  - Test R in position 3 (since positions 1 and 5 haven't been tested yet; position 3 is a high-probability option).  
  - Test T in position 1 and O in position 4 (new positions for both).  
- Include two new common letters (e.g., H, W) to maximize feedback coverage.  
- Choose a valid word that fits these constraints:  
  - Avoids absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M.  
  - Includes R, T, O.  

Selected word: **THROW**  
- T at position 1: Tests if T is in position 1.  
- H at position 2: New letter to probe.  
- R at position 3: Tests R in a new position.  
- O at position 4: Tests O in a new position.  
- W at position 5: New letter to probe.  
- Avoids all forbidden letters and efficiently covers R, T, O positioning.

<guess>throw</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)
Guess 3: throw -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: throw -> T(✓) H(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x)

This tells us:
- T is in the correct position (position 1): so the secret word starts with T.
- R is in the correct position (position 3): so the third letter is R.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as '-'). 
- H and W are not in the word (H(x), W(x)).

Recall from previous feedback:
- In guess 1: R(-) meant R is in the word but not position 2 (but now we know it's at position 3).
- In guess 2: T(-) meant T is in word but not position 2 (now we know it's at position 1) and O(-) meant O in word but not position 3 (which we knew because position 3 was R, so O couldn't be there).

So currently, we know:
- The secret word is: T _ R _ _ 
- The word contains O, but not in position 4 (and we know it's not in position 3 because that's R). So O must be in position 2 or 5? Because positions 1,3,4 are known? Position 1 is T, 3 is R. Position 4 we tried O and it was wrong. So O must be in position 2 or 5.

But wait, from guess 1: we had R at position 2? And it was '-', meaning O if in position 2 would not conflict? So yes, O can be at position 2.

Similarly, from guess 2: O was tried at position 3? And got '-', so O cannot be at position 3? But position 3 is R? So irrelevant? Anyway.

Also, we know the letters not in the word: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W (from previous guesses).

So missing letters: position 2, 4, and 5? Since:
Position 1: T (fixed)
Position 2: ? but cannot be O? Or could be? It might be O? Or another letter?
Position 3: R (fixed)
Position 4: ? and we know O is not at 4? So not O? But O is in the word? So O must be at position 5? Unless it's at position 2? Let me clarify.

Position 2: we haven't tried O at position 2? So it could be O? But we did nothing prohibitive? Similarly position 5? Could be O?

But now, from guess 3: O tried at position 4? Got '-', meaning O is in the word but not at position 4? And since it's not at position 3? Then O must be at position 2 or 5? Yes.

However, can O be at position 2? Since in guess 1 we had R at position 2? And we didn't place O at position 2? Yes? We never tried O in position 2? So?

But we also have to account for what letters are available? We know the secret word must include O? And positions: if O is in position 2, then we have T O R _ _? Or if in position 5: T _ R _ O?

But also, there's one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters? So the secret word has T, R, O, and two other letters? But we already have positions: for 1 and 3, and O in 2 or 5? So actually, only one unknown letter? Wait, no: we only know three letters? T,R,O? But the secret word has other letters? We haven't known the other letters? Or did we?

Wait, no: we only know T,R,O are present? And that C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? But we also had guess 2: which had O and R? So at least T,R,O? But there are two more letters? Because between position 2,4,5? And O occupying one? So one more letter? Actually two? Let's see:

If O is at position 2? Then T O R _ _ ? Then position 4 and 5 are unknown? So two more letters? But we know O is already used? And we need to place two other letters? But we don't know them? Similarly, if O at position 5? T _ R _ O? Then position 2 and 4 are unknown? Two more letters? So two more letters.

But actually, the secret word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily? So duplicates are possible? So O might appear twice? But unlikely? Common case?

First, let's list the known information:
- First letter: T
- Third letter: R
- The secret contains the letter O? And O is not at 3 or 4? So O must be at 2 or 5? 
- Also, the remaining positions: 
  If O at position 2? Then positions 4 and 5: need two more letters? 
  If O at position 5? Then positions 2 and 4: need two more letters? 
- Avoid forbidden letters: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W? So we must choose from remaining alphabet: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z? Not very constrained? But we can use common letters.

Moreover, we have to make a valid English word? 

Now, for the next guess, we want to confirm the position of O? And find the other letters? 

But we have two scenarios: 
Case 1: O is at position 2? Then word is T O R _ _
Case 2: O is at position 5? Then word is T _ R _ O

In Case 1: T O R _ _ ? Then we must fill positions 4 and 5? With two letters from available set? And form valid word? Examples: TORUS? But S forbidden? Skip. TORCH? C forbidden? Etc.

In Case 2: T _ R _ O? Fill position 2 and 4? Examples: WORDY? But W forbidden? Avoid. FUNKY? But F,U,N,K? N forbidden? Etc.

Actually, we haven't tested many letters? So it's better to choose a word that covers common letters and helps distinguish? But since O might be at 2 or 5, we could try a word without O? But we know O is present? So why not? Actually we have already O? If we don't include O, the feedback will show '-' only if the secret has O? But not where we put it? But we already know O is present? So if we omit O, we get no new info? Which is bad? So we should include O? In a position that might be correct? Or in a new position? But we have only positions 2 and 5? We haven't tried O in position 5? Or position 2? 

Guess 3 we tried O at position 4? So we haven't tried O at position 2 or 5? 

So we can choose:
Option A: guess a word with O at position 2? Then if O is at position 2? We get ✓? Else '-'? And similarly? 

Option B: guess a word with O at position 5? To test that?

Additionally, we need to cover other positions? Since positions 4 and 5 or 2 and 4? Have unknown letters.

But with only 3 guesses left? We need to be efficient.

So for your guess, you can choose to try O in position 2? Or position 5? Or even try O in both? Impossible? Haha.

Actually, we can guess one. But then we risk? Or we can guess a word that tests O at position 2? And covers common letters? 

For example, for Case 1: if O at position 2? T O R _ _? We can guess ""TORID""? But not common? Or ""TORAL""? Etc.

But also possible: O not at position 2? Then our guess might have O at 2? Which is wrong position? So we get '-'.

So let's prepare a guess that accepts that.

I think we should try O in position 5? Because we haven't tried O away from the start? 

Candidate: T _ R _ O

Need to fill position 2 and 4? With common letters? Avoid forbidden?

Possible: ""TARDO""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""TERRA""? E forbidden? Skip.

""TIRES""? S and E forbidden? Skip.

""DIRTY""? D,I,R,T,Y? But we have T I R D Y? Or T at position1? R at position3? O at position5? But ""DIRTY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? But what about the middle? Position2: D? Position4: T? But T is already at position1? Duplicate? If the secret has duplicate T? Possible? But in our case? We might allow.

But ""DIRTY"" letters: D,I,R,T,Y? Positions: D(2), I(3)? Wait no: secret has position 3 as R? So if we guess ""DIRTY"": D(1)position? But we position1 must be T? So cannot be D? Therefore: when we guess, position1 should be T? Because we know T must be at1? And position3 must be R? Because R is fixed? So we must guess T at position1 and R at position3? 

Therefore, guessing: Position1: T, position3: R? Position5: O? Then position2: ? and position4: ?

For position2 and4? Any letters from the available set? Avoiding forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W.

Available: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z.

But we want to cover common letters? Or to get feedback.

For example, use I and L? ""T I R L O""? Not valid.

""T U R F O""? ""Turfo""? Not a word? Valid English word.

""TIRO""? 4 letters? 5-letter word needed.

Possible words: ""THIRO""? H forbidden? Skip? ""TIGRO"" not valid.

I know: ""TIERS""? E forbidden? Skip.

""LYRES""? S forbidden.

Think of: ""TYROS""? T Y R O S? But S forbidden? Skip? But S is absent? So avoid.

But S forbidden? Cannot.

Another: ""BIROS""? S forbidden? Skip.

""KEROS""? K,E,R,O,S? E forbidden? Skip.

""FJORD""? But F,J,O,R,D? Position: F at1? But our position1 must be T? Not F? But we have T at position1? So we must start with T.

Therefore, guess format must be: T ? R ? O? Fill in positions 2 and 4.

Potential letters for position 2: vowel? To form a word? Like I or U? And position4: consonant?

Examples:
- T I R _ O? What? TIRL? Not 5? 
- T U R _ O? Like ""TURO""? Not? 

""TUROP""? Not.

Actually, English words: ""BURRO""? But position1 must be T? Can't.

Perhaps a word like ""TERRO""? E forbidden? Skip.

Use different letters: ""PYRRO""? Not word.

Valid word: ""TAROT""? Has A? Forbidden? Skip.

""TEARY""? E forbidden? Skip.

Maybe ""DUCKY""? Not.

I found: ""THROB""? But H forbidden? And position5 must be O? Rather B? No? Our guess must have O at position5? So we know O must be present? So in the secret? Therefore, in our guess we should put O in position5? To see if it's correct? Otherwise, we must not omit O.

But we have position constraints.

Alternatively, we can try O in position2 in this guess? But I was planning O at5.

If we try O at position2? Then the word format: T O R ? ? ? Then positions 4 and5? And O at position2? Which if O is at position2? We get ✓? Else '-'? So we can test.

Then, for positions 4 and5: unknown? We can then probe these positions? But with common letters.

Also, the word must include the letter O? And we put it at position2? Which might be the right spot? Or not? 

But for the secret, if O is at position5? Not at2? Then our guess will show O as '-'? Meaning in the word? But not at position2? So we can then infer O is at position5? Etc.

Let's do that? Then the next guess can resolve.

Therefore, guess: Position1: T, position2: O, position3: R, position4: I, position5: D? But is ""TORID"" a word? Yes? It means something like dry etc.

But T O R I D? Now, we also probe I and D? Which are new.

If O is at position2? We get O ✓? Then we know? And I and D? 

But if O is at position5? Then our O at2 will be '-', and we might get a '-' or ✓ for R? But R is fixed? And we know T and R are fixed? So O at position2: if present but wrong? Or if the secret is T?R?O with O at5, but has no duplicate O? Then O at position2 would be marked 'x'? But wait, we know O is present? So if we put O at position2, and O is at position5? Then O is in the word? But not at position2? So we get '-' for O at2? Similarly, at other? Then we also get feedback on I and D? But we might have duplicates? 

But standard rule: each letter feedback is independent? If the secret has one O? Then when we put O at position2 and O is at position5? Then we get:
- T: ✓ (since position1 T)
- O at2: '-' because O exists but not at2
- R: ✓ (position3)
- I: to be determined? If I in word and position4? 
- D: ... 

But let me pick ""TORID"": T,O,R,I,D? Avoids forbidden? Letters except forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? TORID uses T,O,R,I,D? All legal? Yes.

But we know O is present? So if O is in secret at position2? Then O will be ✓? Else if it's at position5? Then O will show '-'? Then we know O is at position5? So it's good.

So let's guess ""TORID"".

But is TORID valid? Yes? Adjective meaning dry etc.

Alternatively, ""PILEI""? Not.

So I'll go with ""TORID"".### Previous Feedback Summary:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → R is in the word but not position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  → T and O are in the word but not at positions 2 or 3; R is not at position 4; S and M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (throw)**: T(✓), H(x), R(✓), O(-), W(x)  
  → T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word but not position 4; H and W are absent.

### Key Inferences:
- **Secret word pattern**: `T _ R _ _` (T at position 1, R at position 3).
- **Confirmed letters in word**: T, R, O (O must be in one of the remaining spots: 2 or 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - O cannot be at position 4 (from guess 3) or position 3 (impossible due to R).
  - Positions 2 and 5 are unknown except that one must be O.
- The word has two remaining unknown letters (unless O occupies one spot).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize testing the position of O (either position 2 or 5) to resolve ambiguity.
- Include O in position 2 to test if it is correct. If not, O must be at position 5.
- Fill positions 4 and 5 with common unused consonants to gather feedback on new letters (e.g., I and D).
- Avoid absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W. Choose from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Select a valid English word fitting the constraints.

**Chosen word: ""TORID""**  
- Positions: T(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), D(5).  
- Tests O at position 2: 
  - If ✓, O is confirmed at position 2.
  - If (-), O must be at position 5.
- Probes new letters (I and D) at positions 4 and 5.
- Efficiently uses common unused letters without forbidden characters.

Yes.\n\n But O: we don\'t know about O.\n\n Let me choose ""STORM"": S,T,O,R,M.\n\n How about ""TROMP""? That might not be very common.\n\n I think ""STORM"" is a good candidate: it has common letters and positions R in the fourth (so not second).\n\n So I\'ll guess ""STORM"".\n\n But wait: we know R is in the word and we are putting R in the fourth? That should help us see if R belongs there.\n\n Alternative: ""PROUD""? -> Has O,U,D. But avoids forbidden letters? Yes? C, A, N, E are forbidden? But U and O are new.\n\n However, let me stick with ""STORM"".\n\n Steps:\n - S: we don\'t know.\n - T: we don\'t know.\n - O: we don\'t know.\n - R: we know is present, but if we put it in fourth, we might get a \'-\' or \'✓\' depending on the secret word.\n - M: we don\'t know.\n\n This will give us feedback on S, T, O, M, and R\'s position (if we get R ✓ then we know it\'s fourth; if we get \'-\' it could be elsewhere).\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STORM"".\n\n But note: we must not use forbidden letters: C,A,N,E. None of S,T,O,R,M are forbidden? Correct.\n\n Therefore: guess ""STORM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)):\n- The secret word contains the letter **R** but not in the second position.\n- The letters **C, A, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.\n- The secret word must use other vowels (e.g., O, I, U) or consonants since A and E are absent.\n\nFor the next guess, prioritize:\n- Including **R** in a new position (not the second) to test its location.\n- Avoiding forbidden letters: **C, A, N, E**.\n- Covering common letters (like **S, T, O, M**) for additional feedback.\n\n**Selected word: ""STORM""**  \n- Places R in the fourth position (new location).\n- Tests vowels (O) and consonants (S, T, M) not covered in the first guess.\n- Avoids forbidden letters while prioritizing high-frequency characters.\n\n<guess>storm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: storm -> S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)\nMeaning:\n- T is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ""storm"", positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So:\n  S at pos1: x → not in word\n  T at pos2: (-) → in word but not at position 2\n  O at pos3: (-) → in word but not at position 3\n  R at pos4: (-) → in word but not at position 4 (we already knew R is not at 2 from guess1, now also not at 4)\n  M at pos5: x → not in word\n\nSo from both guesses:\n\nLetters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, M\n\nLetters that are in the word:\n- R: but not at pos2 (from guess1) and not at pos4 (from guess2). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be at pos1, pos3, or pos5.\n- T: in the word but not at pos2.\n- O: in the word but not at pos3.\n\nAlso, T and O are new letters we now know are present.\n\nNow, we need to consider the positions:\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).\n\nPossible positions for T: any except 2? But note in ""storm"" it was at pos2 and was wrong position, so T could be at 1,3,4,5? But we don\'t know.\n\nPossible positions for O: any except 3? Could be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nWe also need to form a valid 5-letter word using R, T, O and other letters, but avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nSince we know R is in the word (and must be placed at pos1,3, or5), and T and O are in the word.\n\nMoreover, the secret word must contain at least these: R, T, O.\n\nBut there might be two more letters? Since it\'s 5 letters.\n\nWe don\'t know if there are more distinct letters.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to:\n- Test R in a new position (since in guess1 we tried pos2, guess2 pos4, so now we can try pos1 or pos3 or pos5).\n- Test O and T in new positions.\n- Include other common letters that we haven\'t tested: e.g., I, L, P, U, etc.\n\nBut avoid letters we know are absent: C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nLet me think of words that have R at position 1? Since we haven\'t tested R at position 1.\n\nAlso, if R is at position 1, then we can check if it\'s correct?\n\nSimilarly, we know O and T are present.\n\nSo candidate: words starting with R, that also contain T and O, and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nFor example: ""ROBOT"", but we know O is present? But ""ROBOT"" has O, and T? Yes, but also B? And it has O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O at position 2 and 4? Wait, positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). \n\nHowever, we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got \'-\', which means O is present but not at position 3. So O cannot be at position 3? But in this word, O is at 2 and 4? We don\'t know yet about those.\n\nBut also, we have to avoid letters: E? No E in ""ROBOT"". S,M? No problem.\n\nHowever, note: we also tried R at position 2 and 4? Wait no: in guess1 R was at 2, in guess2 at 4? And both wrong.\n\nBut in ""ROBOT"":\n- Position 1: R → which we haven\'t tried yet? So if secret has R at position 1, we get ✓.\n- Position 2: O → we don\'t know about position 2, but O is present so if it\'s correct we get ✓, else \'-\'.\n- Position 3: B → new letter.\n- Position 4: O → again O? But the same as above? Or if O appears only once?\n- Position 5: T → which we know is present, so if at position 5, ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nBut note: we must not reuse known absent letters? B is new? Okay.\n\nAnother thing: the word ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But the feedback handles duplicates? If there is only one O in the secret, then only one O might be marked.\n\nBut let me think of other words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRIOR""? But has A? No, ""PRIOR"" letters: P,R,I,O,R. Avoids forbidden? Yes? But repeated R? Not forbidden? But we know R is present.\n\nBut position: R might be at 1? Then R(1): try.\n\n""TROOP""? T at 1? Then R at 2? Wait, position 1: T, position 2: R? But R cannot be at position 2? We already know R at position 2 is incorrect? Because in guess1 R at pos2 got \'-\' meaning not there.\n\nSo we cannot put R at position 2? Because we know that position won\'t be R? Similarly, position 4? We know R is not at position 4 from guess2? So R can only be at 1,3,5.\n\nTherefore, any guess with R must have it at 1,3, or5.\n\nSimilarly, for T: we haven\'t ruled out any positions except position 2? Because in guess2 T at position 2 was marked as \'-\' meaning not at position 2? So T cannot be at position 2? But position 1,3,4,5 are possible.\n\nFor O: cannot be at position 3? Because in guess2 O at pos3 was marked \'-\', so not at position 3? So O can be at 1,2,4,5? Similarly.\n\nSo for next guess:\n\nWe want to try R at position 1? Or 3? Or 5? Let me choose position 1 to test.\n\nThen, since O and T must be in the word, we can place them accordingly.\n\nAlso, we need two more letters? And avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nSo, we must choose words that start with R, have O and T somewhere, and two new consonants or vowels.\n\nCommon English words: \n\n""ROTATE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. Cannot use E.\n\n""ROUND""? Has N? N is forbidden? We know N is not in the word? So avoid.\n\n""ROGUE""? Has E and U? U is not forbidden? But E is forbidden. So skip.\n\n""RHYTHM""? Has H,Y,T,H,M? M is forbidden? We know M is not in the word? So skip.\n\n""DOUBT""? Starts with D? But we want R at start.\n\nBetter: let\'s consider R followed by a vowel? Then a consonant? Etc.\n\nWord: ""RUSTY""? R(1),U(2),S(3)? But S: we know S is absent? From guess2 S was at position1 and got x? So S is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use S? Oh, I forgot: S is forbidden? Yes, from guess2 S(x). So S is absent.\n\nSimilarly, M is absent? So in ""RUSTY"", S is there? Skip.\n\nSo avoid S.\n\nWe need a word that avoids C,A,N,E,S,M, but has R first, and O and T.\n\nSo: R something O something T? Or mixed.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROBOT"" as I thought? But has O twice? But O is allowed multiple times? Only if the secret has two Os? Well possible? But let\'s see.\n\n""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5)\n\nIn this guess:\n- R at pos1: we can test R\'s position? If R is at pos1, we get ✓ else \'-\'.\n- O at pos2: if O is in secret and at pos2, ✓ else \'-\'.\n- B at pos3: new letter → feedback will tell if present and position.\n- O at pos4: but O again? And if there is only one O, then one might be marked differently? But the feedback rules: for each letter independently? Actually, no: if the secret has duplicate letters? Well, the rules are per occurrence? But standard wordle rules: I think each feedback corresponds to each position independently? But if there is only one O, then the first O might be marked and the second might be absent etc.\n\nSuppose secret has only one O: then if we guess O at position 2 and it\'s correct? But in ""ROBOT"" we have two O\'s? The feedback might mark one O correctly and mark the other as absent? But let me see.\n\nActually, in the example given at the start: secret ""BRISK"", guess ""STORM"" → feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at pos1? But S is not duplicated.\n\nFor duplicates: if secret has only one O and we guess two O\'s, then one O might get ✓ or \'-\' and the other will get x? But standard Wordle: yes. For example, secret CHESS guess TEASE: first E gets \'-\' because CHESS has E only in the fourth position? So the E at pos2 would be \'-\' only if the secret has an E not at pos2? And the E at pos4 would be ✓? But I\'m confusing.\n\nBut for our purpose, ""ROBOT"" might be okay? Alternatively, choose a word without duplicates.\n\nTo avoid confusion? But valid words are allowed? So I\'ll use ""ROBOT"".\n\nBut let me think of a word with distinct letters? But R, T, O must be included? And avoid forbidden: so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but O and T are already known? So we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)\n\nCommon: L, D, B, H, etc.\n\nWord: ""RIGHT"" → but no O? We must include O? Wait no, we know O is present? We don\'t have to include O? We can test other letters? But since we know O is present, we should try to locate it? Similarly for T.\n\nBut we have a constraint: O and T are in the word? So we can choose a word without O? But that would be inefficient? Because we won\'t get information on O? Or if we don\'t include O, then we might get feedback that O is present? But we already know O is present? So that feedback would be redundant? Actually, we already know O is present? So we can skip? But then we won\'t get position info? So it\'s better to place O in different position? Similarly for T and R.\n\nBut for R, we must place at 1,3, or5? Since we haven\'t tried at 1,5? We tried at 2 and 4? So positions 1,3,5 available.\n\nSimilarly, O: we tried at 3 and it was wrong? So we haven\'t tried O at other positions: 1,2,4,5? Similarly T: we tried at position 2? So positions 1,3,4,5 available? But for T, we can place in positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nSo, let me choose a word that places:\n- R at position 1? Then O and T elsewhere? Avoid positions we know are wrong for each? But we don\'t know their correct positions except that they can\'t be at the positions we already tried? Only for O we know it\'s not at 3? Similarly T not at 2? But we can place at other positions? And R at 1,3, or5.\n\nI think ""PROUD""? But starts with P? We want R at 1? Then ""RO"" something.\n\nHow about ""ROBOT""? Despite duplicate.\n\nAnother: ""ROUTE""? Has E? E is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""ROOST""? O at position 2 and 3? Position 3: we tried O at position 3 in guess2 and got \'-\'? But if O were at position 3 in secret, we would get ✓? But we got \'-\'? So O cannot be at position 3? Therefore, in ""ROOST"", if O at position 3, it would be wrong? But ""ROOST"" has O at 2,3,4? Too many duplicates.\n\nBetter choose a word without duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters.\n\nWord: ""BUILT"" → no R? Must include R? Because R is in the word? So we cannot omit R? We should include it to test position? Because we don\'t have its position yet.\n\nLet me list: we know R, T, O are in the word? So we must choose a word with R, T, O and two other letters? But we have only 5 letters? Secret has 5 letters? So it must have exactly R,T,O and two more? Or even duplicates? But let\'s proceed.\n\nI\'ll pick ""RATION""? But has A and N? Both forbidden? Skip.\n\n""PORTY""? Not a word.\n\n""DROIT""? Not common.\n\nValid English word: ""TRIED""? But has E? Forbidden.\n\nCan I use L? ""LORRY""? Has L,O,R,R,Y? But R at position 3 and4? But position 4 is already ruled out for R? So if in ""LORRY"" R is at pos3? And we put R there? Also, we tried R at pos2 and4? Not at pos3? So it\'s new? And O at pos2? We haven\'t tried O at pos2? So can.\n\nBut ""LORRY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? Letters: L,O,R,R,Y? No C,A,N,E,S,M? Okay? So it has duplicate R? Should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, ""GROUP""? Has G,R,O,U,P? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And R at position2? But R at position2 is not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position2? From guess1: R at pos2 got \'-\'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position2? So we cannot put R at position2 because it will never be correct? Similarly position4: guess2 R at pos4 got \'-\'? So must put R at 1,3,5? Therefore, ""GROUP"" has R at position2? Wrong? So we avoid such words? Must have R at 1,3, or5.\n\nTherefore, ""GROUP"" is invalid? For testing? No: we can still guess it? But we know R at position2 will give \'-\'? So it\'s a waste? Because we know the state? So it\'s better to put R in a new position: 1,3, or5.\n\nSo words like ""GROUP"" with R at2: not useful? Similarly ""FROST"" has R at2? Skip? But ""FROST"" has S? Absent? Skip.\n\nLet\'s find words with R at position1? \n\nPossible: ""RABID""? But A forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RADIO""? A forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RIFLE""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RIGHT""? I,G,H,T? But no O? We know O is present? So if we don\'t include O, we might not cover it? But we can still guess? But then we won\'t know about O\'s position? Which is bad? We should include O? So ""RIGHT"" doesn\'t have O? Skip.\n\n""ROUGE""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes? And letters: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). Also has O at pos2? And W,D,Y new? So we can try.\n\n""ROWDY"": \n- R at position1? Good? If R is at1, we get ✓.\n- O at position2? If O is at2, ✓? But we don\'t know? We haven\'t tried O at position2? Only tried at pos3? So possible? If not, and O is elsewhere, \'-\'.\n- W at position3? New? Will get feedback.\n- D at position4? New? Feedback.\n- Y at position5? New? Feedback.\n\nAlso, contains O? And T? Wait, no T? But we know T is in the word? Does ""ROWDY"" have T? No. But wait, we know T is present? So if the secret has T, but our guess has no T, then we might not get information on T? Worse: if we don\'t include T, the feedback will not cover T? But we know T must be in the word? So we should prioritize including T? To find its position? Otherwise, we wasted a guess without testing T.\n\nSo must include T? Yes, because we have limited guesses? Only 6 tries? So we need to test T\'s position as well.\n\nTherefore, the guess must include R (position 1,3,5), O, and T? And two new letters? Avoid C,A,N,E,S,M.\n\nNow, let\'s choose a word with these letters.\n\nFor example, ""PROUT""? Not a word.\n\n""TROUT""? But R at position2? We cannot put R at position2? Because we know R is not at position2? So ""TROUT"" has R at position2? Skip? Because it will waste R position.\n\nBetter: ""T"" first? Then R? But R must be at3 or5? Etc.\n\nAssume R at position1? Then include T and O.\n\nExample: ""ROTATED"" too long.\n\n5-letter: ""RATION"" forbidden... ""ROUTE"" has E? Skip.\n\n""GRUNT""? Has N? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""TRUCK""? Has C? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""PROD"" too short.\n\nThink of ""BROTH"": B,R,O,T,H? Letters: B,R,O,T,H. Avoids forbidden? No A,C,E,N,S,M? B, H not used. And R(1), O(2), T(4)... positions: B(1)? Wait, if we want R at1? How about ""BROTH"" is B,R,O,T,H -> so position1=B, position2=R? But R: position2? We know R is not at position2!? So B at1, R at2: R at position2 which we know is no good? So we get \'-\' for R? But we want to try R at a new position? So not helpful.\n\nHow about R at position1? So structure: R _ _ _ _\n\nMust include T and O? And two new letters? Avoid forbidden.\n\nSo: R followed by a letter, then O? T? Etc.\n\nCandidates: ""ROTAL""? Not a word.\n\n""ROTAS""? But S? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""ROTHY""? Not a word.\n\n""ROTIS""? Not common.\n\n""ROULETTE""? Too long.\n\n""TOURS""? Starts with T? T at position1? No R at start? So R must be at1? Or we can put R at position3? Or5?\n\nLet\'s change: put R at position3? Or5?\n\nFor example, word with T first? Then we can put R later.\n\nExample: ""TORUS"" T(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), S(5)? But S forbidden? Skip.\n\n""VIRUS""? V,I,R,U,S? S forbidden? Skip.\n\n""GUILD""? No R? But R required.\n\n""POWER""? But no T? And P,O,W,E,R? E forbidden? Skip.\n\nStruggling?\n\nHow about these words:\n\n""O"" and ""T"" must be included? So let me search: words with R,T,O and avoid C,A,N,E,S?m=M forbidden.\n\n""BORTY""? Not valid.\n\n""DIRTY"" has D,I,R,T,Y? But no O? Skip.\n\n""DOUGHT""? Not a word.\n\n""HORST"" has S? Skip.\n\n""FRORT""? Not common.\n\nI think I found: ""TORCH""? But C forbidden? Skip.\n\n""BIRTH""? No O? Skip.\n\nWait, maybe ""THROW""? T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). Has O and T? But O at position4? And R at position3? Let\'s check:\n\nPositions for R: position3? We haven\'t tried position3? So new? Similarly O at position4? We haven\'t tried O at position4? Only tried at position3? So position4 is new? T at position1? We tried T at position2? But not position1? So can.\n\nAlso, letters: T, H, R, O, W? All not forbidden? C,A,N,E,S,M are absent okay? So valid word: ""THROW"".\n\nThis places:\n- T at position1: if T is at1, we get ✓ else \'-\'.\n- H at position2: new char.\n- R at position3: if R is at3, ✓ else \'-\'.\n- O at position4: new position for O? We know O is not at3? But at4? Try.\n- W at position5: new char.\n\nAnd it will test all required letters: R, T, O (and H and new).\n\nSo I think ""THROW"" is good.\n\nAlso, if R is at position3, we can understand? Similarly for T at1 and O at4.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""THROW"".\n\nResponse: <guess>throw</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n\n- **Guess 2: storm** → S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - T is in the secret word but not in position 2.  \n  - O is in the secret word but not in position 3.  \n  - R is in the secret word but not in position 4 (confirming it cannot be in positions 2 or 4).  \n  - S and M are not in the secret word.\n\n### Key Inferences:\n- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: R, T, O  \n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - R must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out).  \n  - T cannot be at position 2.  \n  - O cannot be at position 3.  \n- The secret word contains exactly the letters R, T, O, and two additional unknown letters (from the unused letter pool: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc., avoiding absent letters).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Focus on placing R, T, and O in new positions to narrow down their locations:  \n  - Test R in position 3 (since positions 1 and 5 haven\'t been tested yet; position 3 is a high-probability option).  \n  - Test T in position 1 and O in position 4 (new positions for both).  \n- Include two new common letters (e.g., H, W) to maximize feedback coverage.  \n- Choose a valid word that fits these constraints:  \n  - Avoids absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, M.  \n  - Includes R, T, O.  \n\nSelected word: **THROW**  \n- T at position 1: Tests if T is in position 1.  \n- H at position 2: New letter to probe.  \n- R at position 3: Tests R in a new position.  \n- O at position 4: Tests O in a new position.  \n- W at position 5: New letter to probe.  \n- Avoids all forbidden letters and efficiently covers R, T, O positioning.\n\n<guess>throw</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)\nGuess 3: throw -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: throw -> T(✓) H(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x)\n\nThis tells us:\n- T is in the correct position (position 1): so the secret word starts with T.\n- R is in the correct position (position 3): so the third letter is R.\n- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it\'s marked as \'-\'). \n- H and W are not in the word (H(x), W(x)).\n\nRecall from previous feedback:\n- In guess 1: R(-) meant R is in the word but not position 2 (but now we know it\'s at position 3).\n- In guess 2: T(-) meant T is in word but not position 2 (now we know it\'s at position 1) and O(-) meant O in word but not position 3 (which we knew because position 3 was R, so O couldn\'t be there).\n\nSo currently, we know:\n- The secret word is: T _ R _ _ \n- The word contains O, but not in position 4 (and we know it\'s not in position 3 because that\'s R). So O must be in position 2 or 5? Because positions 1,3,4 are known? Position 1 is T, 3 is R. Position 4 we tried O and it was wrong. So O must be in position 2 or 5.\n\nBut wait, from guess 1: we had R at position 2? And it was \'-\', meaning O if in position 2 would not conflict? So yes, O can be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, from guess 2: O was tried at position 3? And got \'-\', so O cannot be at position 3? But position 3 is R? So irrelevant? Anyway.\n\nAlso, we know the letters not in the word: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W (from previous guesses).\n\nSo missing letters: position 2, 4, and 5? Since:\nPosition 1: T (fixed)\nPosition 2: ? but cannot be O? Or could be? It might be O? Or another letter?\nPosition 3: R (fixed)\nPosition 4: ? and we know O is not at 4? So not O? But O is in the word? So O must be at position 5? Unless it\'s at position 2? Let me clarify.\n\nPosition 2: we haven\'t tried O at position 2? So it could be O? But we did nothing prohibitive? Similarly position 5? Could be O?\n\nBut now, from guess 3: O tried at position 4? Got \'-\', meaning O is in the word but not at position 4? And since it\'s not at position 3? Then O must be at position 2 or 5? Yes.\n\nHowever, can O be at position 2? Since in guess 1 we had R at position 2? And we didn\'t place O at position 2? Yes? We never tried O in position 2? So?\n\nBut we also have to account for what letters are available? We know the secret word must include O? And positions: if O is in position 2, then we have T O R _ _? Or if in position 5: T _ R _ O?\n\nBut also, there\'s one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters? So the secret word has T, R, O, and two other letters? But we already have positions: for 1 and 3, and O in 2 or 5? So actually, only one unknown letter? Wait, no: we only know three letters? T,R,O? But the secret word has other letters? We haven\'t known the other letters? Or did we?\n\nWait, no: we only know T,R,O are present? And that C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? But we also had guess 2: which had O and R? So at least T,R,O? But there are two more letters? Because between position 2,4,5? And O occupying one? So one more letter? Actually two? Let\'s see:\n\nIf O is at position 2? Then T O R _ _ ? Then position 4 and 5 are unknown? So two more letters? But we know O is already used? And we need to place two other letters? But we don\'t know them? Similarly, if O at position 5? T _ R _ O? Then position 2 and 4 are unknown? Two more letters? So two more letters.\n\nBut actually, the secret word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily? So duplicates are possible? So O might appear twice? But unlikely? Common case?\n\nFirst, let\'s list the known information:\n- First letter: T\n- Third letter: R\n- The secret contains the letter O? And O is not at 3 or 4? So O must be at 2 or 5? \n- Also, the remaining positions: \n  If O at position 2? Then positions 4 and 5: need two more letters? \n  If O at position 5? Then positions 2 and 4: need two more letters? \n- Avoid forbidden letters: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W? So we must choose from remaining alphabet: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z? Not very constrained? But we can use common letters.\n\nMoreover, we have to make a valid English word? \n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to confirm the position of O? And find the other letters? \n\nBut we have two scenarios: \nCase 1: O is at position 2? Then word is T O R _ _\nCase 2: O is at position 5? Then word is T _ R _ O\n\nIn Case 1: T O R _ _ ? Then we must fill positions 4 and 5? With two letters from available set? And form valid word? Examples: TORUS? But S forbidden? Skip. TORCH? C forbidden? Etc.\n\nIn Case 2: T _ R _ O? Fill position 2 and 4? Examples: WORDY? But W forbidden? Avoid. FUNKY? But F,U,N,K? N forbidden? Etc.\n\nActually, we haven\'t tested many letters? So it\'s better to choose a word that covers common letters and helps distinguish? But since O might be at 2 or 5, we could try a word without O? But we know O is present? So why not? Actually we have already O? If we don\'t include O, the feedback will show \'-\' only if the secret has O? But not where we put it? But we already know O is present? So if we omit O, we get no new info? Which is bad? So we should include O? In a position that might be correct? Or in a new position? But we have only positions 2 and 5? We haven\'t tried O in position 5? Or position 2? \n\nGuess 3 we tried O at position 4? So we haven\'t tried O at position 2 or 5? \n\nSo we can choose:\nOption A: guess a word with O at position 2? Then if O is at position 2? We get ✓? Else \'-\'? And similarly? \n\nOption B: guess a word with O at position 5? To test that?\n\nAdditionally, we need to cover other positions? Since positions 4 and 5 or 2 and 4? Have unknown letters.\n\nBut with only 3 guesses left? We need to be efficient.\n\nSo for your guess, you can choose to try O in position 2? Or position 5? Or even try O in both? Impossible? Haha.\n\nActually, we can guess one. But then we risk? Or we can guess a word that tests O at position 2? And covers common letters? \n\nFor example, for Case 1: if O at position 2? T O R _ _? We can guess ""TORID""? But not common? Or ""TORAL""? Etc.\n\nBut also possible: O not at position 2? Then our guess might have O at 2? Which is wrong position? So we get \'-\'.\n\nSo let\'s prepare a guess that accepts that.\n\nI think we should try O in position 5? Because we haven\'t tried O away from the start? \n\nCandidate: T _ R _ O\n\nNeed to fill position 2 and 4? With common letters? Avoid forbidden?\n\nPossible: ""TARDO""? But A forbidden? Skip.\n\n""TERRA""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""TIRES""? S and E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""DIRTY""? D,I,R,T,Y? But we have T I R D Y? Or T at position1? R at position3? O at position5? But ""DIRTY"" has Y? And avoids forbidden? But what about the middle? Position2: D? Position4: T? But T is already at position1? Duplicate? If the secret has duplicate T? Possible? But in our case? We might allow.\n\nBut ""DIRTY"" letters: D,I,R,T,Y? Positions: D(2), I(3)? Wait no: secret has position 3 as R? So if we guess ""DIRTY"": D(1)position? But we position1 must be T? So cannot be D? Therefore: when we guess, position1 should be T? Because we know T must be at1? And position3 must be R? Because R is fixed? So we must guess T at position1 and R at position3? \n\nTherefore, guessing: Position1: T, position3: R? Position5: O? Then position2: ? and position4: ?\n\nFor position2 and4? Any letters from the available set? Avoiding forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W.\n\nAvailable: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we want to cover common letters? Or to get feedback.\n\nFor example, use I and L? ""T I R L O""? Not valid.\n\n""T U R F O""? ""Turfo""? Not a word? Valid English word.\n\n""TIRO""? 4 letters? 5-letter word needed.\n\nPossible words: ""THIRO""? H forbidden? Skip? ""TIGRO"" not valid.\n\nI know: ""TIERS""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""LYRES""? S forbidden.\n\nThink of: ""TYROS""? T Y R O S? But S forbidden? Skip? But S is absent? So avoid.\n\nBut S forbidden? Cannot.\n\nAnother: ""BIROS""? S forbidden? Skip.\n\n""KEROS""? K,E,R,O,S? E forbidden? Skip.\n\n""FJORD""? But F,J,O,R,D? Position: F at1? But our position1 must be T? Not F? But we have T at position1? So we must start with T.\n\nTherefore, guess format must be: T ? R ? O? Fill in positions 2 and 4.\n\nPotential letters for position 2: vowel? To form a word? Like I or U? And position4: consonant?\n\nExamples:\n- T I R _ O? What? TIRL? Not 5? \n- T U R _ O? Like ""TURO""? Not? \n\n""TUROP""? Not.\n\nActually, English words: ""BURRO""? But position1 must be T? Can\'t.\n\nPerhaps a word like ""TERRO""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\nUse different letters: ""PYRRO""? Not word.\n\nValid word: ""TAROT""? Has A? Forbidden? Skip.\n\n""TEARY""? E forbidden? Skip.\n\nMaybe ""DUCKY""? Not.\n\nI found: ""THROB""? But H forbidden? And position5 must be O? Rather B? No? Our guess must have O at position5? So we know O must be present? So in the secret? Therefore, in our guess we should put O in position5? To see if it\'s correct? Otherwise, we must not omit O.\n\nBut we have position constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can try O in position2 in this guess? But I was planning O at5.\n\nIf we try O at position2? Then the word format: T O R ? ? ? Then positions 4 and5? And O at position2? Which if O is at position2? We get ✓? Else \'-\'? So we can test.\n\nThen, for positions 4 and5: unknown? We can then probe these positions? But with common letters.\n\nAlso, the word must include the letter O? And we put it at position2? Which might be the right spot? Or not? \n\nBut for the secret, if O is at position5? Not at2? Then our guess will show O as \'-\'? Meaning in the word? But not at position2? So we can then infer O is at position5? Etc.\n\nLet\'s do that? Then the next guess can resolve.\n\nTherefore, guess: Position1: T, position2: O, position3: R, position4: I, position5: D? But is ""TORID"" a word? Yes? It means something like dry etc.\n\nBut T O R I D? Now, we also probe I and D? Which are new.\n\nIf O is at position2? We get O ✓? Then we know? And I and D? \n\nBut if O is at position5? Then our O at2 will be \'-\', and we might get a \'-\' or ✓ for R? But R is fixed? And we know T and R are fixed? So O at position2: if present but wrong? Or if the secret is T?R?O with O at5, but has no duplicate O? Then O at position2 would be marked \'x\'? But wait, we know O is present? So if we put O at position2, and O is at position5? Then O is in the word? But not at position2? So we get \'-\' for O at2? Similarly, at other? Then we also get feedback on I and D? But we might have duplicates? \n\nBut standard rule: each letter feedback is independent? If the secret has one O? Then when we put O at position2 and O is at position5? Then we get:\n- T: ✓ (since position1 T)\n- O at2: \'-\' because O exists but not at2\n- R: ✓ (position3)\n- I: to be determined? If I in word and position4? \n- D: ... \n\nBut let me pick ""TORID"": T,O,R,I,D? Avoids forbidden? Letters except forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W are absent? TORID uses T,O,R,I,D? All legal? Yes.\n\nBut we know O is present? So if O is in secret at position2? Then O will be ✓? Else if it\'s at position5? Then O will show \'-\'? Then we know O is at position5? So it\'s good.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""TORID"".\n\nBut is TORID valid? Yes? Adjective meaning dry etc.\n\nAlternatively, ""PILEI""? Not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TORID"".### Previous Feedback Summary:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  → R is in the word but not position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  \n  → T and O are in the word but not at positions 2 or 3; R is not at position 4; S and M are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (throw)**: T(✓), H(x), R(✓), O(-), W(x)  \n  → T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word but not position 4; H and W are absent.\n\n### Key Inferences:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `T _ R _ _` (T at position 1, R at position 3).\n- **Confirmed letters in word**: T, R, O (O must be in one of the remaining spots: 2 or 5).\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W.\n- **Position constraints**: \n  - O cannot be at position 4 (from guess 3) or position 3 (impossible due to R).\n  - Positions 2 and 5 are unknown except that one must be O.\n- The word has two remaining unknown letters (unless O occupies one spot).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Prioritize testing the position of O (either position 2 or 5) to resolve ambiguity.\n- Include O in position 2 to test if it is correct.

We have feedback from Guess 4: torid -> T(✓) O(-) R(✓) I(x) D(x)

This means:
- T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3 (as we already knew).
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (since we got '-' for O at position 2).
- I and D are not in the word (I(x), D(x)).

Now, combining with previous feedback:
- We know O must be in the word, and the only remaining position is position 5 (since position 4 is still open, but we haven't tested O at 5, and position 2 is now ruled out for O).
- From Guess 3, O was not at position 4, and now from Guess 4, O is not at position 2. Also, position 3 is R, so O must be at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has O at position 5.

So the pattern is: T _ R _ O

We also know that the letter at position 2 and position 4 are unknown, but we have constraints:
- The letter at position 2: cannot be C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D (from absent letters: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W,I,D).
- Similarly, position 4: same absent letters.

Moreover, we have two positions to fill: 2 and 4, with two letters that are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters so far: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, K, L, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: B, F, G, K, L, P, U, Y).

We need to form a word: T ? R ? O

Common words: 
- ""TURBO"": T, U, R, B, O -> positions: T(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), O(5). 
  - Check letters: U and B are not forbidden? Yes, available.
- ""THUMB"": but H is forbidden? H is absent, so skip.
- ""TROOP"": O at position 4? But we have O at position 5? And ""TROOP"" has O at 4 and 5? But we are putting O at 5? Also, T R O O P? But O at position 4? And we have position 4 as unknown? But in ""TROOP"", position 4 is O? But we know O is at position 5? So if we put O at position 4? It would be wrong? But also, we have duplicate O? However, the secret might have only one O? But we don't know? But from feedback, we have O only at position 5? So if the secret has O only at position 5, then O at position 4 would be marked as absent? Or if the secret has two O's? But we don't know? But in previous feedback, we only know one O? So it might be only one? But possible two? But to be safe, avoid duplicates? Or test?

But ""TURBO"" is a good candidate: uses U and B, both common.

Another word: ""TAROT""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""TERRY""? E forbidden? Skip.

""TYROS""? S forbidden? Skip.

""FUROR""? But F,U,R,O,R? R at position 3? But we have R at 3? So T?R?O? Not starting with T? We need T at start.

""TURBO"" seems perfect.

But let's confirm: T U R B O? Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:R, 4:B, 5:O? And O at 5? Yes.

Also, we haven't used U or B? So we can get feedback on them.

If we guess ""TURBO"", then:
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- U: if U is in the word and at position 2? Then ✓? Else if in word but wrong position? Or absent?
- R: ✓ (position 3)
- B: if B is in the word and at position 4? Then ✓? Else?
- O: ✓ (position 5) because we know O is at 5? But wait, we are putting O at position 5? And we know O must be at position 5? So it should be ✓? But if the secret has O at 5? Then yes.

But the secret word is T?R?O? With O at 5? So O at position 5 is correct? So we will get ✓ for O? Regardless? So the only unknowns are U and B? But we can get feedback on them.

But what if the secret word has U at position 2? Then U will be ✓? Similarly for B at position 4? If not, we get feedback.

But we have only one guess left? After this? Or we have two? We are at guess 4? So next is guess 5? And we have 6 tries? So we can do this.

But if ""TURBO"" is the secret? Then we win? Else we get feedback on U and B? And then we can guess the last one? But we have only one more guess? So we need to cover possibilities.

But let's see: if we guess ""TURBO"", and it's not the secret? Then we get feedback on U and B? For example, if U is not in the word? Then we know position 2 is not U? Similarly for B? Then we can try another word? With the remaining letters? But we have only one guess left? So we might not solve? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? But we have limited letters.

Another candidate: ""TULIP""? But I and P? I is forbidden? From guess4 I(x)? So I is absent? Skip.

""TUBAL""? But A and L? A forbidden? Skip.

""TUMOR""? M and O? M forbidden? Skip.

""TURFY""? F and Y? But Y? And F? Available? But ""TURFY"" is a word? Meaning covered with turf? But let's see: T U R F Y? But we need O at position 5? But we are putting Y at 5? Not O? But we must put O at position 5? Because we know O is at 5? So we cannot put Y at 5? We must put O at 5.

Therefore, the guess must have O at position 5? So we cannot change that? So the format is fixed: T ? R ? O? With ? at 2 and 4.

So we must choose two letters for positions 2 and 4? From available letters.

We can choose ""TURBO"": U at 2, B at 4.

Or ""TURKO""? Not a word? Or ""TURPS""? Not common? ""TURFS""? S forbidden? Skip.

""TYROS""? S forbidden? Skip.

""GYROS""? G,Y,R,O,S? S forbidden? Skip.

""PYROS""? Same.

""KAROO""? K,A,R,O,O? A forbidden? Skip.

""BROOD""? B,R,O,O,D? D forbidden? Skip.

So ""TURBO"" seems the best common word.

We can also consider ""TUPRO""? Not word.

""TURBO"" is a valid English word? Yes, as in turbocharger? Or turbo.

So I'll go with ""TURBO"".

But note: in the secret word, if position 2 is U and position 4 is B? Then we win? Else, we get feedback on U and B? And then we can use the last guess to correct.

But we have only one guess left? After this? So if we don't get it, we might lose? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are more likely? But we don't know.

Another word: ""TABOR""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""TIGER""? I and E forbidden? Skip.

So ""TURBO"" is a good choice.

Therefore, guess ""TURBO"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → R is in the word (not position 2); C, A, N, E absent.
- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  → T and O are in the word (not positions 2 or 3); R not at position 4; S, M absent.
- **Guess 3 (throw)**: T(✓), H(x), R(✓), O(-), W(x)  
  → T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word (not position 4); H, W absent.
- **Guess 4 (torid)**: T(✓), O(-), R(✓), I(x), D(x)  
  → T and R remain correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word but not at position 2; I, D absent.

### Key Inferences:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `T _ R _ O`  
   - Position 1: **T** (confirmed).  
   - Position 3: **R** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5: **O** (must be here, as it cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 4).  
2. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 2: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D).  
   - Position 4: Unknown letter (same exclusions).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D.  
4. **Remaining letters**: B, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc. (focus on common consonants like B, L, P, U).  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Goal**: Test the most probable letters for positions 2 and 4 while adhering to the pattern `T _ R _ O`.  
- **Priority**: Use high-frequency letters (e.g., U, L, B, P) to maximize information.  
- **Word choice**: ""**TURBO**"" fits perfectly:  
  - T(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), O(5).  
  - Tests U (position 2) and B (position 4), both common and untested.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on U/B will reveal the solution in the final guess.  

<guess>turbo</guess>",turbo,"We have feedback from Guess 4: torid -> T(✓) O(-) R(✓) I(x) D(x)

This means:
- T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3 (as we already knew).
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (since we got '-' for O at position 2).
- I and D are not in the word (I(x), D(x)).

Now, combining with previous feedback:
- We know O must be in the word, and the only remaining position is position 5 (since position 4 is still open, but we haven't tested O at 5, and position 2 is now ruled out for O).
- From Guess 3, O was not at position 4, and now from Guess 4, O is not at position 2. Also, position 3 is R, so O must be at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has O at position 5.

So the pattern is: T _ R _ O

We also know that the letter at position 2 and position 4 are unknown, but we have constraints:
- The letter at position 2: cannot be C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D (from absent letters: C,A,N,E,S,M,H,W,I,D).
- Similarly, position 4: same absent letters.

But ""TURBO"" is a good candidate: uses U and B, both common.

Another word: ""TAROT""? But A forbidden? Skip.

Therefore, the guess must have O at position 5? So we cannot change that? So the format is fixed: T ? R ? O? With ? at 2 and 4.

So we must choose two letters for positions 2 and 4? From available letters.

We can choose ""TURBO"": U at 2, B at 4.

Or ""TURKO""? Not a word? Or ""TURPS""? Not common? ""TURFS""? S forbidden? Skip.

""PYROS""? Same.

""KAROO""? K,A,R,O,O? A forbidden? Skip.

""BROOD""? B,R,O,O,D? D forbidden? Skip.

So ""TURBO"" seems the best common word.

We can also consider ""TUPRO""? Not word.

""TURBO"" is a valid English word? Yes, as in turbocharger? Or turbo.

So I'll go with ""TURBO"".

But note: in the secret word, if position 2 is U and position 4 is B? Then we win? Else, we get feedback on U and B? And then we can use the last guess to correct.

But we have only one guess left? After this? So if we don't get it, we might lose? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are more likely? But we don't know.

Another word: ""TABOR""? But A forbidden? Skip.

""TIGER""? I and E forbidden? Skip.

So ""TURBO"" is a good choice.

Therefore, guess ""TURBO"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → R is in the word (not position 2); C, A, N, E absent.
- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S(x), T(-), O(-), R(-), M(x)  
  → T and O are in the word (not positions 2 or 3); R not at position 4; S, M absent.
- **Guess 3 (throw)**: T(✓), H(x), R(✓), O(-), W(x)  
  → T and R are correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word (not position 4); H, W absent.
- **Guess 4 (torid)**: T(✓), O(-), R(✓), I(x), D(x)  
  → T and R remain correct at positions 1 and 3; O is in the word but not at position 2; I, D absent.

### Key Inferences:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `T _ R _ O`  
   - Position 1: **T** (confirmed).  
   - Position 3: **R** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5: **O** (must be here, as it cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 4).  
2. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 2: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D).  
   - Position 4: Unknown letter (same exclusions).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, M, H, W, I, D.  
4. **Remaining letters**: B, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc. (focus on common consonants like B, L, P, U).  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Goal**: Test the most probable letters for positions 2 and 4 while adhering to the pattern `T _ R _ O`.  
- **Priority**: Use high-frequency letters (e.g., U, L, B, P) to maximize information.  
- **Word choice**: ""**TURBO**"" fits perfectly:  
  - T(1), U(2), R(3), B(4), O(5).  
  - Tests U (position 2) and B (position 4), both common and untested.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on U/B will reveal the solution in the final guess.",Guess 5: turbo -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(✓) R(✓) B(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
