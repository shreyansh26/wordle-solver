 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another option is ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""CRANE"".

 Since it's the first guess, any word should be fine as long as it has distinct letters.

Since this is the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opener because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of identifying correct letters and positions.
- Common letters like E, R, and A appear frequently in English words.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is not in the secret word at all.
- N is in the word and in the correct position! The fourth letter is N.
- E is not in the secret word at all.

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has the letter N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N _ 

Now, since we know C, R, A, E are absent, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We must guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has common letters and includes N in the fourth position.

Potential words: 
- We need the fourth letter to be N: ...N..
- And the word must not contain C, R, A, E.

Considerations:
- We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Possible words: 
""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T -> but N is the fourth letter? Let's check: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T. Yes.

But note: in feedback, we had A missing, but O and I might be present? We don't know.

Another word: ""JOINT"" - but J is less common.

Another: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T.

But note: U might be less common.

Another: ""BLUNT"" - but B, L, U, N, T -> but we have 5 letters and N is at position 4? B-L-U-N-T -> 1=B,2=L,3=U,4=N,5=T. Yes.

But ""BLUNT"" has two new consonants and two vowels? Actually U is a vowel.

To maximize vowels: we know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So including O or I might be good.

We also haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

Looking at ""POINT"": 
- It contains P, O, I, T, N. 
- N is at position 4, and the fifth letter is T, which we haven't tested.

""POINT"" seems good because it has three new vowels/consonants? Actually, O and I are vowels, P and T are consonants.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" doesn't have N at the end? No, because we need fourth letter N.

Another word: ""STINK"" - S, T, I, N, K -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K.

That's another possibility.

Or ""SHINY"" - S, H, I, N, Y -> but Y is at the end.

Since we don't know about Y, but let's think about common words.

Note: We don't know if the secret word has vowels. We have eliminated A and E, but it must have vowels (unless using Y or others).

So, potential vowels are I, O, U, Y.

Including at least one vowel is good.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests O and I as vowels, and P and T as consonants. Also, N is fixed.

This seems efficient.

Other words: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"" has S and T but fourth letter is not N? M-O-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, so no. We need fourth letter N.

""PAINT"" has A, which we know is missing, so invalid.

We know A is missing, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, avoid C, R, E.

So, ""POINT"" seems a good guess.

But we have used P, O, I, T, N.

We know N is in the word and correct position, so we expect ✓ for N, and for others we will see.

We want to maximize the chance of getting some correct and also identify presence.

Another word: ""CLINT"" but C is forbidden (we know it's absent).

So, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated? And fourth letter N, so S-T-I-N-T. This has repeated T, which might be less efficient unless it's in the word.

Since we don't know, perhaps ""POINT"" is better for distinct letters.

""POINT"" has all distinct: P, O, I, N, T.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" - J is less common.

""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> U might be less common.

""MINTS"" - M, I, N, T, S -> but that has N at position 3? M-I-N-T-S: 1=M,2=I,3=N,4=T,5=S -> no, fourth letter is T, not N.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, a list of words ending with ""..N.""? Actually, fourth letter N, so the word pattern is ? ? ? N ?.

Words: 
- POINT
- STUNG - S,T,U,N,G -> last letter G? But pattern _ _ _ N _, and we haven't tested U, G. But G is less common.
- BLIND - B,L,I,N,D -> fourth letter N? B-L-I-N-D -> position 4 is N? Actually: 1=B,2=L,3=I,4=N,5=D. Yes. But has I and D.
- BLIND has D and we haven't tested B,L,I,D. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.

Compare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.

Another word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.

So we must avoid E.

Therefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.

But Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""POINT"".

But let's confirm: our constraints:
- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.
- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.

So, we'll go with ""POINT"".
</think>
<thoughts>
Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):

- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? 
- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.

For the second guess:
- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).
- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

The word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:
- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).
- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.
- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Testing ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N's placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.

- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has common letters and includes N in the fourth position.

Potential words: 
- We need the fourth letter to be N: ...N..
- And the word must not contain C, R, A, E.

Considerations:
- We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Possible words: 
""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T -> but N is the fourth letter? Let's check: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T. Yes.

But note: in feedback, we had A missing, but O and I might be present? We don't know.

Another word: ""JOINT"" - but J is less common.

Another: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T.

But note: U might be less common.

Another: ""BLUNT"" - but B, L, U, N, T -> but we have 5 letters and N is at position 4? B-L-U-N-T -> 1=B,2=L,3=U,4=N,5=T. Yes.

But ""BLUNT"" has two new consonants and two vowels? Actually U is a vowel.

To maximize vowels: we know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So including O or I might be good.

We also haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

Looking at ""POINT"": 
- It contains P, O, I, T, N. 
- N is at position 4, and the fifth letter is T, which we haven't tested.

""POINT"" seems good because it has three new vowels/consonants? Actually, O and I are vowels, P and T are consonants.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" doesn't have N at the end? No, because we need fourth letter N.

Another word: ""STINK"" - S, T, I, N, K -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K.

That's another possibility.

Or ""SHINY"" - S, H, I, N, Y -> but Y is at the end.

Since we don't know about Y, but let's think about common words.

Note: We don't know if the secret word has vowels. We have eliminated A and E, but it must have vowels (unless using Y or others).

So, potential vowels are I, O, U, Y.

Including at least one vowel is good.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests O and I as vowels, and P and T as consonants. Also, N is fixed.

This seems efficient.

Other words: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"" has S and T but fourth letter is not N? M-O-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, so no. We need fourth letter N.

""PAINT"" has A, which we know is missing, so invalid.

We know A is missing, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, avoid C, R, E.

So, ""POINT"" seems a good guess.

But we have used P, O, I, T, N.

We know N is in the word and correct position, so we expect ✓ for N, and for others we will see.

We want to maximize the chance of getting some correct and also identify presence.

Another word: ""CLINT"" but C is forbidden (we know it's absent).

So, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated? And fourth letter N, so S-T-I-N-T. This has repeated T, which might be less efficient unless it's in the word.

Since we don't know, perhaps ""POINT"" is better for distinct letters.

""POINT"" has all distinct: P, O, I, N, T.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" - J is less common.

""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> U might be less common.

""MINTS"" - M, I, N, T, S -> but that has N at position 3? M-I-N-T-S: 1=M,2=I,3=N,4=T,5=S -> no, fourth letter is T, not N.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, a list of words ending with ""..N.""? Actually, fourth letter N, so the word pattern is ? ? ? N ?.

Words: 
- POINT
- STUNG - S,T,U,N,G -> last letter G? But pattern _ _ _ N _, and we haven't tested U, G. But G is less common.
- BLIND - B,L,I,N,D -> fourth letter N? B-L-I-N-D -> position 4 is N? Actually: 1=B,2=L,3=I,4=N,5=D. Yes. But has I and D.
- BLIND has D and we haven't tested B,L,I,D. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.

Compare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.

Another word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.

So we must avoid E.

Therefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.

But Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""POINT"".

But let's confirm: our constraints:
- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.
- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.

So, we'll go with ""POINT"".<thoughts>
Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):

- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? 
- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.

For the second guess:
- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).
- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

The word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:
- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).
- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.
- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Testing ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N's placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.

We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): 
  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2? Let's note positions: 
    ""point"" is P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
    So O is at position 2: ✓ means the second letter is O.
  - I(x) and T(x): I and T are absent from the word.
  - P(x): P is absent.

Now we know:
- Second letter is O.
- Fourth letter is N.
- The word is of form: _ O _ N _
- Letters present: only O and N (and their positions are fixed).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from both guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: ? O ? N ?

And avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Since we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Common letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.

Let's list some possible words:

We need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.

Consider:

- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don't know if U or D are present.

We also have the constraints from previous missing letters.

Another: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.

""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven't tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don't have S. So S is possible.

But let's list words that fit: ?O?N?

Possible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.

Also, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.

Other words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O's? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn't have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn't be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.

Recall the rules:
- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.
- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.
- Not present gets x.

In ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

The O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?

Let me clarify with an example.

Suppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?
- F: ✓ (position 1)
- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?
But secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.

But if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:
- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.
- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.
- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": 
  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓
  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓
  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.

Actually, each letter is evaluated individually.

In Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.

But in our case, for ""point"", we have:
- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Therefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it's correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn't put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it's at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O's, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn't guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.

The key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.

Specifically, in ""point"":
- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? 

Looking at the rules:
- ✓: letter in word and correct position.
- -: letter in word but wrong position.
- x: letter NOT in the word.

So for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.

Similarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.

Similarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.

Also, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So secret word is: _ O _ N _

And only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).

Now, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Remaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words with pattern _ O _ N _

List of words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.

Other words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.

""LOUNS"" not a word.

""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.

But the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.

Position 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren't told about another O because we didn't guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn't supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?

Actually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:

- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.

But in our case, for ""point"", we didn't guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.

However, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that's possible.

In this feedback, since we didn't guess O elsewhere, we don't know about other O's.

For example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O's.

But in our next guess, we could encounter that.

But in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.

Possible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.

""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.

""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.

No, so avoid R.

Words without absent letters.

Consider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.

Similarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Also, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.

Full 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Another possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.

But we have N already at position 4.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.

T is out.

Similarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.

Possible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.

Also ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.

Or ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".

But ""LOONS"" has two O's.

Now, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.

We need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.

For example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.

This would test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.

But U is common to both.

Since the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.

But to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.

In this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.

But position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.

We need a word that distinguishes possibilities.

But we don't have many possibilities.

List: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Possible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.

Are there others without U?

For example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.

What about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.

Position 4 must be N.

Perhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.

Another: ""CONUS"" — C is out.

So almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.

Except words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.

In that case, position 3 is O.

Also, ""BOWNS"" not a word.

""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.

No.

""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.

Is ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.

And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Yes: downy.

But it has W at position 3.

Similarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.

So possible words:
- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound
- With O at position 3: goons, loons
- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.

""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.

Since we haven't guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.

But to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.

For example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.

But if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.

Similarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.

But we have many guesses left (4 more), so it's okay to guess one possibility.

To maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.

I think ""sound"" is a common word.

Similarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.

If we get feedback, we might know.

So let's go with ""sound"".

But note: we could choose something that tests other letters.

If we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.

But since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.

Therefore, I'll guess ""sound"".

Also, avoiding letters we haven't seen.

So, guess: ""sound""

But check letters: S,O,U,N,D.

O and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.

Position: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.

So.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:
  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.
  - P, I, and T are not in the word.
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _
  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).
- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.

To maximize information gain:
- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).
- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:
  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).
  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).

<thoughts>
- Pattern deduced: _ O _ N _
- Known absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Testing ""sound"" ensures O and N positions are confirmed while probing new letters S, U, D
- Common word with high information potential
</thoughts>

<guess>sound</guess>",sound,"We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): 
  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2? Let's note positions: 
    ""point"" is P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
    So O is at position 2: ✓ means the second letter is O.
  - I(x) and T(x): I and T are absent from the word.
  - P(x): P is absent.

Now we know:
- Second letter is O.
- Fourth letter is N.
- The word is of form: _ O _ N _
- Letters present: only O and N (and their positions are fixed).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from both guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: ? O ? N ?

And avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Since we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Common letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.

Let's list some possible words:

We need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.

Consider:

- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don't know if U or D are present.

We also have the constraints from previous missing letters.

Another: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.

""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven't tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don't have S. So S is possible.

But let's list words that fit: ?O?N?

Possible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.

Also, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.

Other words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O's? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn't have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn't be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.

Recall the rules:
- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.
- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.
- Not present gets x.

In ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

The O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?

Let me clarify with an example.

Suppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?
- F: ✓ (position 1)
- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?
But secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.

But if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:
- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.
- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.
- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": 
  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓
  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓
  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.

Actually, each letter is evaluated individually.

In Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.

But in our case, for ""point"", we have:
- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Therefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it's correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn't put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it's at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O's, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn't guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.

The key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.

Specifically, in ""point"":
- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? 

Looking at the rules:
- ✓: letter in word and correct position.
- -: letter in word but wrong position.
- x: letter NOT in the word.

So for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.

Similarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.

Similarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.

Also, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So secret word is: _ O _ N _

And only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).

Now, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Remaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words with pattern _ O _ N _

List of words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.

Other words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.

""LOUNS"" not a word.

""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.

But the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.

Position 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren't told about another O because we didn't guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn't supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?

Actually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:

- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.

But in our case, for ""point"", we didn't guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.

However, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that's possible.

In this feedback, since we didn't guess O elsewhere, we don't know about other O's.

For example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O's.

But in our next guess, we could encounter that.

But in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.

Possible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.

""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.

""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.

No, so avoid R.

Words without absent letters.

Consider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.

Similarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Also, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.

Full 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Another possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.

But we have N already at position 4.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.

T is out.

Similarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.

Possible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.

Also ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.

Or ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".

But ""LOONS"" has two O's.

Now, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.

We need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.

For example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.

This would test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.

But U is common to both.

Since the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.

But to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.

In this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.

But position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.

We need a word that distinguishes possibilities.

But we don't have many possibilities.

List: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Possible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.

Are there others without U?

For example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.

What about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.

Position 4 must be N.

Perhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.

Another: ""CONUS"" — C is out.

So almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.

Except words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.

In that case, position 3 is O.

Also, ""BOWNS"" not a word.

""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.

No.

""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.

Is ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.

And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Yes: downy.

But it has W at position 3.

Similarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.

So possible words:
- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound
- With O at position 3: goons, loons
- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.

""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.

Since we haven't guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.

But to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.

For example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.

But if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.

Similarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.

But we have many guesses left (4 more), so it's okay to guess one possibility.

To maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.

I think ""sound"" is a common word.

Similarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.

If we get feedback, we might know.

So let's go with ""sound"".

But note: we could choose something that tests other letters.

If we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.

But since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.

Therefore, I'll guess ""sound"".

Also, avoiding letters we haven't seen.

So, guess: ""sound""

But check letters: S,O,U,N,D.

O and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.

Position: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.

So.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:
  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.
  - P, I, and T are not in the word.
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _
  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).
- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.

To maximize information gain:
- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).
- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:
  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).
  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).

<thoughts>

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. I need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another option is ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""CRANE"".

 Since it's the first guess, any word should be fine as long as it has distinct letters.

 My choice: CRANE

 Format the response as per instructions.<thoughts>
Since this is the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opener because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of identifying correct letters and positions.
- Common letters like E, R, and A appear frequently in English words.
After this guess, the feedback (✓, -, x) will provide clues about which letters are in the secret word and their positions, allowing me to refine subsequent guesses.
</thoughts>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is not in the secret word at all.
- N is in the word and in the correct position! The fourth letter is N.
- E is not in the secret word at all.

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has the letter N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N _ 

Now, since we know C, R, A, E are absent, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We must guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has common letters and includes N in the fourth position.

Potential words: 
- We need the fourth letter to be N: ...N..
- And the word must not contain C, R, A, E.

Considerations:
- We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Possible words: 
""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T -> but N is the fourth letter? Let's check: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T. Yes.

But note: in feedback, we had A missing, but O and I might be present? We don't know.

Another word: ""JOINT"" - but J is less common.

Another: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T.

But note: U might be less common.

Another: ""BLUNT"" - but B, L, U, N, T -> but we have 5 letters and N is at position 4? B-L-U-N-T -> 1=B,2=L,3=U,4=N,5=T. Yes.

But ""BLUNT"" has two new consonants and two vowels? Actually U is a vowel.

To maximize vowels: we know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So including O or I might be good.

We also haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

Looking at ""POINT"": 
- It contains P, O, I, T, N. 
- N is at position 4, and the fifth letter is T, which we haven't tested.

""POINT"" seems good because it has three new vowels/consonants? Actually, O and I are vowels, P and T are consonants.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" doesn't have N at the end? No, because we need fourth letter N.

Another word: ""STINK"" - S, T, I, N, K -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K.

That's another possibility.

Or ""SHINY"" - S, H, I, N, Y -> but Y is at the end.

Since we don't know about Y, but let's think about common words.

Note: We don't know if the secret word has vowels. We have eliminated A and E, but it must have vowels (unless using Y or others).

So, potential vowels are I, O, U, Y.

Including at least one vowel is good.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests O and I as vowels, and P and T as consonants. Also, N is fixed.

This seems efficient.

Other words: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"" has S and T but fourth letter is not N? M-O-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, so no. We need fourth letter N.

""PAINT"" has A, which we know is missing, so invalid.

We know A is missing, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, avoid C, R, E.

So, ""POINT"" seems a good guess.

But we have used P, O, I, T, N.

We know N is in the word and correct position, so we expect ✓ for N, and for others we will see.

We want to maximize the chance of getting some correct and also identify presence.

Another word: ""CLINT"" but C is forbidden (we know it's absent).

So, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated? And fourth letter N, so S-T-I-N-T. This has repeated T, which might be less efficient unless it's in the word.

Since we don't know, perhaps ""POINT"" is better for distinct letters.

""POINT"" has all distinct: P, O, I, N, T.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" - J is less common.

""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> U might be less common.

""MINTS"" - M, I, N, T, S -> but that has N at position 3? M-I-N-T-S: 1=M,2=I,3=N,4=T,5=S -> no, fourth letter is T, not N.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, a list of words ending with ""..N.""? Actually, fourth letter N, so the word pattern is ? ? ? N ?.

Words: 
- POINT
- STUNG - S,T,U,N,G -> last letter G? But pattern _ _ _ N _, and we haven't tested U, G. But G is less common.
- BLIND - B,L,I,N,D -> fourth letter N? B-L-I-N-D -> position 4 is N? Actually: 1=B,2=L,3=I,4=N,5=D. Yes. But has I and D.
- BLIND has D and we haven't tested B,L,I,D. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.

Compare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.

Another word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.

So we must avoid E.

Therefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.

But Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""POINT"".

But let's confirm: our constraints:
- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.
- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.

So, we'll go with ""POINT"".<thoughts>
Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):

- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? 
- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.

For the second guess:
- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).
- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

The word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:
- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).
- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.
- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Testing ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N's placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): 
  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2? Let's note positions: 
    ""point"" is P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
    So O is at position 2: ✓ means the second letter is O.
  - I(x) and T(x): I and T are absent from the word.
  - P(x): P is absent.

Now we know:
- Second letter is O.
- Fourth letter is N.
- The word is of form: _ O _ N _
- Letters present: only O and N (and their positions are fixed).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from both guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: ? O ? N ?

And avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Since we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Common letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.

Let's list some possible words:

We need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.

Consider:

- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don't know if U or D are present.

We also have the constraints from previous missing letters.

Another: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.

""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven't tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don't have S. So S is possible.

But let's list words that fit: ?O?N?

Possible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.

Also, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.

Other words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O's? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn't have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn't be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.

Recall the rules:
- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.
- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.
- Not present gets x.

In ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

The O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?

Let me clarify with an example.

Suppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?
- F: ✓ (position 1)
- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?
But secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.

But if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:
- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.
- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.
- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": 
  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓
  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓
  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.

Actually, each letter is evaluated individually.

In Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.

But in our case, for ""point"", we have:
- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Therefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it's correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn't put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it's at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O's, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn't guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.

The key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.

Specifically, in ""point"":
- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? 

Looking at the rules:
- ✓: letter in word and correct position.
- -: letter in word but wrong position.
- x: letter NOT in the word.

So for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.

Similarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.

Similarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.

Also, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So secret word is: _ O _ N _

And only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).

Now, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Remaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words with pattern _ O _ N _

List of words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.

Other words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.

""LOUNS"" not a word.

""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.

But the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.

Position 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren't told about another O because we didn't guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn't supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?

Actually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:

- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.

But in our case, for ""point"", we didn't guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.

However, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that's possible.

In this feedback, since we didn't guess O elsewhere, we don't know about other O's.

For example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O's.

But in our next guess, we could encounter that.

But in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.

Possible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.

""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.

""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.

No, so avoid R.

Words without absent letters.

Consider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.

Similarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Also, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.

Full 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Another possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.

But we have N already at position 4.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.

T is out.

Similarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.

Possible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.

Also ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.

Or ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".

But ""LOONS"" has two O's.

Now, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.

We need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.

For example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.

This would test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.

But U is common to both.

Since the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.

But to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.

In this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.

But position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.

We need a word that distinguishes possibilities.

But we don't have many possibilities.

List: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Possible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.

Are there others without U?

For example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.

What about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.

Position 4 must be N.

Perhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.

Another: ""CONUS"" — C is out.

So almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.

Except words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.

In that case, position 3 is O.

Also, ""BOWNS"" not a word.

""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.

No.

""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.

Is ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.

And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Yes: downy.

But it has W at position 3.

Similarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.

So possible words:
- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound
- With O at position 3: goons, loons
- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.

""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.

Since we haven't guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.

But to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.

For example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.

But if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.

Similarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.

But we have many guesses left (4 more), so it's okay to guess one possibility.

To maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.

I think ""sound"" is a common word.

Similarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.

If we get feedback, we might know.

So let's go with ""sound"".

But note: we could choose something that tests other letters.

If we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.

But since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.

Therefore, I'll guess ""sound"".

Also, avoiding letters we haven't seen.

So, guess: ""sound""

But check letters: S,O,U,N,D.

O and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.

Position: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.

So.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:
  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.
  - P, I, and T are not in the word.
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _
  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).
- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.

To maximize information gain:
- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).
- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:
  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).
  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).

<thoughts>
- Pattern deduced: _ O _ N _
- Known absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Testing ""sound"" ensures O and N positions are confirmed while probing new letters S, U, D
- Common word with high information potential

Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.\n\nBut ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.\n\nCompare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.\n\nAlternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.\n\nAnother word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.\n\nSo we must avoid E.\n\nTherefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.\n\nBut Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.\n\nWe have to guess: I\'ll go with ""POINT"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: our constraints:\n- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.\n- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.\n\nSo, we\'ll go with ""POINT"".<thoughts>\nBased on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):\n\n- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? \n- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).\n- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.\n- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThe word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:\n- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).\n- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.\n- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nTesting ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N\'s placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""point""):\n- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): \n  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2?

O ? N ?\n\nAnd avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.\n\nSince we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nThe word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.\n\nLet\'s list some possible words:\n\nWe need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.\n\nConsider:\n\n- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don\'t know if U or D are present.\n\nWe also have the constraints from previous missing letters.\n\nAnother: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.\n\n""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven\'t tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don\'t have S. So S is possible.\n\nBut let\'s list words that fit: ?O?N?\n\nPossible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.\n\nAlso, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.\n\nOther words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O\'s? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn\'t have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn\'t be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.\n\nRecall the rules:\n- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.\n- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.\n- Not present gets x.\n\nIn ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n\nThe O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?\n\nLet me clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?\n- F: ✓ (position 1)\n- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?\nBut secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.\n\nBut if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:\n- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.\n- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.\n- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": \n  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓\n  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓\n  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.\n\nActually, each letter is evaluated individually.\n\nIn Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.\n\nBut in our case, for ""point"", we have:\n- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n\nTherefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it\'s correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn\'t put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it\'s at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O\'s, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn\'t guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.\n\nThe key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.\n\nSpecifically, in ""point"":\n- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? \n\nLooking at the rules:\n- ✓: letter in word and correct position.\n- -: letter in word but wrong position.\n- x: letter NOT in the word.\n\nSo for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.\n\nSimilarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.\n\nSo secret word is: _ O _ N _\n\nAnd only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).\n\nNow, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nRemaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words with pattern _ O _ N _\n\nList of words:\n- BOUND (B O U N D)\n- FOUND (F O U N D)\n- MOUND (M O U N D)\n- SOUND (S O U N D)\n- WOUND (W O U N D)\n- HOUND (H O U N D)\n- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.\n\nOther words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.\n\n""LOUNS"" not a word.\n\n""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.\n\nBut the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.\n\nPosition 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren\'t told about another O because we didn\'t guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn\'t supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?\n\nActually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:\n\n- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.\n\nBut in our case, for ""point"", we didn\'t guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.\n\nHowever, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that\'s possible.\n\nIn this feedback, since we didn\'t guess O elsewhere, we don\'t know about other O\'s.\n\nFor example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O\'s.\n\nBut in our next guess, we could encounter that.\n\nBut in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.\n\nPossible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.\n\n""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.\n\n""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.\n\nNo, so avoid R.\n\nWords without absent letters.\n\nConsider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\nAlso, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.\n\nFull 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.\n\nBut we have N already at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.\n\nT is out.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.\n\nPossible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.\n\nAlso ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.\n\nOr ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".\n\nBut ""LOONS"" has two O\'s.\n\nNow, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.\n\nWe need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.\n\nFor example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.\n\nThis would test S, U, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.\n\nBut U is common to both.\n\nSince the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.\n\nIn this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.\n\nBut position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.\n\nWe need a word that distinguishes possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t have many possibilities.\n\nList: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nPossible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.\n\nAre there others without U?\n\nFor example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.\n\nWhat about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.\n\nPosition 4 must be N.\n\nPerhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.\n\nAnother: ""CONUS"" — C is out.\n\nSo almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.\n\nExcept words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.\n\nIn that case, position 3 is O.\n\nAlso, ""BOWNS"" not a word.\n\n""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.\n\nIs ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nYes: downy.\n\nBut it has W at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.\n\nSo possible words:\n- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound\n- With O at position 3: goons, loons\n- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.\n\n""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.\n\nSince we haven\'t guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.\n\nBut to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.\n\nFor example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.\n\nBut if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.\n\nBut we have many guesses left (4 more), so it\'s okay to guess one possibility.\n\nTo maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.\n\nI think ""sound"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback, we might know.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""sound"".\n\nBut note: we could choose something that tests other letters.\n\nIf we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.\n\nBut since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""sound"".\n\nAlso, avoiding letters we haven\'t seen.\n\nSo, guess: ""sound""\n\nBut check letters: S,O,U,N,D.\n\nO and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.\n\nPosition: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.\n\nSo.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:\n  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.\n  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.\n- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:\n  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.\n  - P, I, and T are not in the word.\n- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _\n  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).\n- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nFor the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.\n\nTo maximize information gain:\n- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).\n- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:\n  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).\n  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.\n  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).\n\n<thoughts>\n- Pattern deduced: _ O _ N _\n- Known absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T\n- Testing ""sound"" ensures O and N positions are confirmed while probing new letters S, U, D\n- Common word with high information potential\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>sound</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)

This means:
- O(✓) at position 2: confirmed correct.
- N(✓) at position 4: confirmed correct.
- S(x) at position 1: S is not in the word at all.
- U(✓) at position 3: U is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
- D(✓) at position 5: D is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

Therefore:
- Secret word is O at position 2, U at position 3, N at position 4, D at position 5.
- Position 1 must be filled with the only unknown letter.
- Pattern: ? O U N D

Also, from the letter feedback:
- S is absent (x).
- But O, U, N, D are all present and correctly placed.

Moreover, we know from previous guesses that C,R,A,E,P,I,T are absent.

So the secret word is exactly ?OUND.

Now, we need a 5-letter word that ends with ""OUND"" but position 1 must not be excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S (just found).

Possible words: bound, found, hound, mound, wound, etc.

But the first letter: must be one of B,F,H,M,W,G,L, etc. excluding the absent letters.

Common ones: B,F,H,M,W,G,L,K, etc.

Since we are at guess 4, we might guess one of them.

However, note: we have almost the entire word except the first letter.

Guessing any of bound, found, hound, mound, wound would work.

But we need to choose one to guess.

Since we don't know position 1, we need to test a letter.

The previous feedback shows that the secret word is structured as ?OUND (letters O, U, N, D confirmed in positions 2-5, with position 1 unknown). Letters C, R, A, E, P, I, T, and S are absent. Possible words include **bound**, **found**, **hound**, **mound**, and **wound**. 

For this guess, **bound** is chosen to test if **B** is the missing letter at position 1. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will eliminate **B** and point toward other options (like **found** or **hound**).

- S(x) at position 1: S is not in the word at all.
- U(✓) at position 3: U is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.

Therefore:

Also, from the letter feedback:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. I need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another option is ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""CRANE"".

 Since it's the first guess, any word should be fine as long as it has distinct letters.

 My choice: CRANE

 Format the response as per instructions.<thoughts>
Since this is the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opener because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of identifying correct letters and positions.
- Common letters like E, R, and A appear frequently in English words.
After this guess, the feedback (✓, -, x) will provide clues about which letters are in the secret word and their positions, allowing me to refine subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is not in the secret word at all.
- N is in the word and in the correct position! The fourth letter is N.
- E is not in the secret word at all.

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has the letter N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N _ 

Now, since we know C, R, A, E are absent, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We must guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has common letters and includes N in the fourth position.

Potential words: 
- We need the fourth letter to be N: ...N..
- And the word must not contain C, R, A, E.

Considerations:
- We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Possible words: 
""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T -> but N is the fourth letter? Let's check: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T. Yes.

But note: in feedback, we had A missing, but O and I might be present? We don't know.

Another word: ""JOINT"" - but J is less common.

Another: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T.

But note: U might be less common.

Another: ""BLUNT"" - but B, L, U, N, T -> but we have 5 letters and N is at position 4? B-L-U-N-T -> 1=B,2=L,3=U,4=N,5=T. Yes.

But ""BLUNT"" has two new consonants and two vowels? Actually U is a vowel.

To maximize vowels: we know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So including O or I might be good.

We also haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

Looking at ""POINT"": 
- It contains P, O, I, T, N. 
- N is at position 4, and the fifth letter is T, which we haven't tested.

""POINT"" seems good because it has three new vowels/consonants? Actually, O and I are vowels, P and T are consonants.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" doesn't have N at the end? No, because we need fourth letter N.

Another word: ""STINK"" - S, T, I, N, K -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K.

That's another possibility.

Or ""SHINY"" - S, H, I, N, Y -> but Y is at the end.

Since we don't know about Y, but let's think about common words.

Note: We don't know if the secret word has vowels. We have eliminated A and E, but it must have vowels (unless using Y or others).

So, potential vowels are I, O, U, Y.

Including at least one vowel is good.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests O and I as vowels, and P and T as consonants. Also, N is fixed.

This seems efficient.

Other words: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"" has S and T but fourth letter is not N? M-O-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, so no. We need fourth letter N.

""PAINT"" has A, which we know is missing, so invalid.

We know A is missing, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, avoid C, R, E.

So, ""POINT"" seems a good guess.

But we have used P, O, I, T, N.

We know N is in the word and correct position, so we expect ✓ for N, and for others we will see.

We want to maximize the chance of getting some correct and also identify presence.

Another word: ""CLINT"" but C is forbidden (we know it's absent).

So, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated? And fourth letter N, so S-T-I-N-T. This has repeated T, which might be less efficient unless it's in the word.

Since we don't know, perhaps ""POINT"" is better for distinct letters.

""POINT"" has all distinct: P, O, I, N, T.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" - J is less common.

""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> U might be less common.

""MINTS"" - M, I, N, T, S -> but that has N at position 3? M-I-N-T-S: 1=M,2=I,3=N,4=T,5=S -> no, fourth letter is T, not N.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, a list of words ending with ""..N.""? Actually, fourth letter N, so the word pattern is ? ? ? N ?.

Words: 
- POINT
- STUNG - S,T,U,N,G -> last letter G? But pattern _ _ _ N _, and we haven't tested U, G. But G is less common.
- BLIND - B,L,I,N,D -> fourth letter N? B-L-I-N-D -> position 4 is N? Actually: 1=B,2=L,3=I,4=N,5=D. Yes. But has I and D.
- BLIND has D and we haven't tested B,L,I,D. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.

Compare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.

Another word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.

So we must avoid E.

Therefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.

But Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""POINT"".

But let's confirm: our constraints:
- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.
- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.

So, we'll go with ""POINT"".<thoughts>
Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):

- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? 
- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.

For the second guess:
- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).
- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

The word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:
- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).
- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.
- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Testing ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N's placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): 
  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2? Let's note positions: 
    ""point"" is P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
    So O is at position 2: ✓ means the second letter is O.
  - I(x) and T(x): I and T are absent from the word.
  - P(x): P is absent.

Now we know:
- Second letter is O.
- Fourth letter is N.
- The word is of form: _ O _ N _
- Letters present: only O and N (and their positions are fixed).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from both guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: ? O ? N ?

And avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Since we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Common letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.

Let's list some possible words:

We need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.

Consider:

- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don't know if U or D are present.

We also have the constraints from previous missing letters.

Another: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.

""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven't tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don't have S. So S is possible.

But let's list words that fit: ?O?N?

Possible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.

Also, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.

Other words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O's? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn't have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn't be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.

Recall the rules:
- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.
- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.
- Not present gets x.

In ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

The O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?

Let me clarify with an example.

Suppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?
- F: ✓ (position 1)
- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?
But secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.

But if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:
- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.
- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.
- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": 
  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓
  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓
  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.

Actually, each letter is evaluated individually.

In Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.

But in our case, for ""point"", we have:
- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Therefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it's correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn't put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it's at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O's, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn't guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.

The key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.

Specifically, in ""point"":
- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? 

Looking at the rules:
- ✓: letter in word and correct position.
- -: letter in word but wrong position.
- x: letter NOT in the word.

So for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.

Similarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.

Similarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.

Also, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So secret word is: _ O _ N _

And only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).

Now, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Remaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words with pattern _ O _ N _

List of words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.

Other words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.

""LOUNS"" not a word.

""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.

But the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.

Position 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren't told about another O because we didn't guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn't supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?

Actually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:

- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.

But in our case, for ""point"", we didn't guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.

However, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that's possible.

In this feedback, since we didn't guess O elsewhere, we don't know about other O's.

For example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O's.

But in our next guess, we could encounter that.

But in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.

Possible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.

""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.

""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.

No, so avoid R.

Words without absent letters.

Consider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.

Similarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Also, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.

Full 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Another possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.

But we have N already at position 4.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.

T is out.

Similarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.

Possible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.

Also ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.

Or ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".

But ""LOONS"" has two O's.

Now, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.

We need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.

For example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.

This would test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.

But U is common to both.

Since the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.

But to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.

In this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.

But position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.

We need a word that distinguishes possibilities.

But we don't have many possibilities.

List: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Possible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.

Are there others without U?

For example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.

What about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.

Position 4 must be N.

Perhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.

Another: ""CONUS"" — C is out.

So almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.

Except words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.

In that case, position 3 is O.

Also, ""BOWNS"" not a word.

""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.

No.

""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.

Is ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.

And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Yes: downy.

But it has W at position 3.

Similarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.

So possible words:
- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound
- With O at position 3: goons, loons
- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.

""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.

Since we haven't guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.

But to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.

For example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.

But if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.

Similarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.

But we have many guesses left (4 more), so it's okay to guess one possibility.

To maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.

I think ""sound"" is a common word.

Similarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.

If we get feedback, we might know.

So let's go with ""sound"".

But note: we could choose something that tests other letters.

If we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.

But since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.

Therefore, I'll guess ""sound"".

Also, avoiding letters we haven't seen.

So, guess: ""sound""

But check letters: S,O,U,N,D.

O and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.

Position: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.

So.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:
  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.
  - P, I, and T are not in the word.
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _
  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).
- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.

To maximize information gain:
- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).
- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:
  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).
  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).

<thoughts>
- Pattern deduced: _ O _ N _
- Known absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Testing ""sound"" ensures O and N positions are confirmed while probing new letters S, U, D
- Common word with high information potential
</thoughts>

<guess>sound</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)

This means:
- O(✓) at position 2: confirmed correct.
- N(✓) at position 4: confirmed correct.
- S(x) at position 1: S is not in the word at all.
- U(✓) at position 3: U is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
- D(✓) at position 5: D is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

Therefore:
- Secret word is O at position 2, U at position 3, N at position 4, D at position 5.
- Position 1 must be filled with the only unknown letter.
- Pattern: ? O U N D

Also, from the letter feedback:
- S is absent (x).
- But O, U, N, D are all present and correctly placed.

Moreover, we know from previous guesses that C,R,A,E,P,I,T are absent.

So the secret word is exactly ?OUND.

Now, we need a 5-letter word that ends with ""OUND"" but position 1 must not be excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S (just found).

Possible words: bound, found, hound, mound, wound, etc.

But the first letter: must be one of B,F,H,M,W,G,L, etc. excluding the absent letters.

Common ones: B,F,H,M,W,G,L,K, etc.

Since we are at guess 4, we might guess one of them.

However, note: we have almost the entire word except the first letter.

Guessing any of bound, found, hound, mound, wound would work.

But we need to choose one to guess.

Since we don't know position 1, we need to test a letter.

But we have only position 1 unknown.

We can guess systematically.

List: words like bound, found, hound, mound, pound but pound has P absent? P is absent.

Pound not allowed.

Similarly, round has R, absent.

Sound we guessed and S absent.

Wound: W O U N D

Found: F O U N D

Hound: H O U N D

Mound: M O U N D

Bound: B O U N D

Gound: not common? G O U N D? Uncommon word.

Lound: not a word.

So, likely W, F, H, M, B.

We need to choose one.

To be safe, we can pick a common one.

Guess ""bound"" for example.

Feedback will tell if correct or not.

If B is absent, then we know, else if correct, we win.

Similarly for others.

Thus, we can guess ""bound"".

Given the history, we might want to maximize info, but since only one letter unknown, we can guess one.

I'll go with ""bound"".<thoughts>
- Secret word pattern: ? O U N D
- Confirmed letters: O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5)
- Absent letters per feedback: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S
- Remaining possibilities: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, etc. (first letter not excluded)
- Choosing a common candidate like ""bound"" tests B at position 1.
- If correct (B✓), it solves the word; if not (Bx), it narrows to other options (e.g., FOUND, HOUND).
</thoughts>

<guess>bound</guess>The previous feedback shows that the secret word is structured as ?OUND (letters O, U, N, D confirmed in positions 2-5, with position 1 unknown). Letters C, R, A, E, P, I, T, and S are absent. Possible words include **bound**, **found**, **hound**, **mound**, and **wound**. 

For this guess, **bound** is chosen to test if **B** is the missing letter at position 1. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will eliminate **B** and point toward other options (like **found** or **hound**).

The fourth letter is N.\n- E is not in the secret word at all.\n\nSo, from this we know:\n- The secret word has the letter N as the fourth letter (position 4).\n- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N _ \n\nNow, since we know C, R, A, E are absent, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.\n\nWe must guess a 5-letter word that:\n- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has common letters and includes N in the fourth position.\n\nPotential words: \n- We need the fourth letter to be N: ...N..\n- And the word must not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nConsiderations:\n- We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nPossible words: \n""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T -> but N is the fourth letter? Let\'s check: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T. Yes.\n\nBut note: in feedback, we had A missing, but O and I might be present? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINT"" - but J is less common.\n\nAnother: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T.\n\nBut note: U might be less common.\n\nAnother: ""BLUNT"" - but B, L, U, N, T -> but we have 5 letters and N is at position 4? B-L-U-N-T -> 1=B,2=L,3=U,4=N,5=T. Yes.\n\nBut ""BLUNT"" has two new consonants and two vowels? Actually U is a vowel.\n\nTo maximize vowels: we know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So including O or I might be good.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nLooking at ""POINT"": \n- It contains P, O, I, T, N. \n- N is at position 4, and the fifth letter is T, which we haven\'t tested.\n\n""POINT"" seems good because it has three new vowels/consonants? Actually, O and I are vowels, P and T are consonants.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPLIT"" doesn\'t have N at the end? No, because we need fourth letter N.\n\nAnother word: ""STINK"" - S, T, I, N, K -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K.\n\nThat\'s another possibility.\n\nOr ""SHINY"" - S, H, I, N, Y -> but Y is at the end.\n\nSince we don\'t know about Y, but let\'s think about common words.\n\nNote: We don\'t know if the secret word has vowels. We have eliminated A and E, but it must have vowels (unless using Y or others).\n\nSo, potential vowels are I, O, U, Y.\n\nIncluding at least one vowel is good.\n\n""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests O and I as vowels, and P and T as consonants. Also, N is fixed.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nOther words: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"" has S and T but fourth letter is not N? M-O-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, so no. We need fourth letter N.\n\n""PAINT"" has A, which we know is missing, so invalid.\n\nWe know A is missing, so we cannot use A.\n\nSimilarly, avoid C, R, E.\n\nSo, ""POINT"" seems a good guess.\n\nBut we have used P, O, I, T, N.\n\nWe know N is in the word and correct position, so we expect ✓ for N, and for others we will see.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance of getting some correct and also identify presence.\n\nAnother word: ""CLINT"" but C is forbidden (we know it\'s absent).\n\nSo, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated? And fourth letter N, so S-T-I-N-T. This has repeated T, which might be less efficient unless it\'s in the word.\n\nSince we don\'t know, perhaps ""POINT"" is better for distinct letters.\n\n""POINT"" has all distinct: P, O, I, N, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" - J is less common.\n\n""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> U might be less common.\n\n""MINTS"" - M, I, N, T, S -> but that has N at position 3? M-I-N-T-S: 1=M,2=I,3=N,4=T,5=S -> no, fourth letter is T, not N.\n\nWe need position 4 to be N.\n\nSo, a list of words ending with ""..N.""? Actually, fourth letter N, so the word pattern is ? ? ? N ?.\n\nWords: \n- POINT\n- STUNG - S,T,U,N,G -> last letter G? But pattern _ _ _ N _, and we haven\'t tested U, G. But G is less common.\n- BLIND - B,L,I,N,D -> fourth letter N? B-L-I-N-D -> position 4 is N? Actually: 1=B,2=L,3=I,4=N,5=D. Yes. But has I and D.\n- BLIND has D and we haven\'t tested B,L,I,D. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.\n\nBut ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.\n\nCompare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.\n\nAlternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.\n\nAnother word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.\n\nSo we must avoid E.\n\nTherefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.\n\nBut Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.\n\nWe have to guess: I\'ll go with ""POINT"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: our constraints:\n- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.\n- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.\n\nSo, we\'ll go with ""POINT"".<thoughts>\nBased on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):\n\n- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? \n- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).\n- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.\n- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThe word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:\n- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).\n- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.\n- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nTesting ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N\'s placement.

We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.\n\nLet\'s list some possible words:\n\nWe need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.\n\nConsider:\n\n- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don\'t know if U or D are present.\n\nWe also have the constraints from previous missing letters.\n\nAnother: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.\n\n""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven\'t tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don\'t have S. So S is possible.\n\nBut let\'s list words that fit: ?O?N?\n\nPossible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.\n\nAlso, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.\n\nOther words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O\'s? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn\'t have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn\'t be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.\n\nRecall the rules:\n- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.\n- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.\n- Not present gets x.\n\nIn ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n\nThe O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?\n\nLet me clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?\n- F: ✓ (position 1)\n- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?\nBut secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.\n\nBut if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:\n- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.\n- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.\n- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": \n  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓\n  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓\n  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.\n\nActually, each letter is evaluated individually.\n\nIn Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.\n\nBut in our case, for ""point"", we have:\n- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n\nTherefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it\'s correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn\'t put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it\'s at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O\'s, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn\'t guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.\n\nThe key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.\n\nSpecifically, in ""point"":\n- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? \n\nLooking at the rules:\n- ✓: letter in word and correct position.\n- -: letter in word but wrong position.\n- x: letter NOT in the word.\n\nSo for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.\n\nSimilarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.\n\nSo secret word is: _ O _ N _\n\nAnd only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).\n\nNow, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nRemaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words with pattern _ O _ N _\n\nList of words:\n- BOUND (B O U N D)\n- FOUND (F O U N D)\n- MOUND (M O U N D)\n- SOUND (S O U N D)\n- WOUND (W O U N D)\n- HOUND (H O U N D)\n- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.\n\nOther words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.\n\n""LOUNS"" not a word.\n\n""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.\n\nBut the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.\n\nPosition 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren\'t told about another O because we didn\'t guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn\'t supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?\n\nActually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:\n\n- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.\n\nBut in our case, for ""point"", we didn\'t guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.\n\nHowever, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that\'s possible.\n\nIn this feedback, since we didn\'t guess O elsewhere, we don\'t know about other O\'s.\n\nFor example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O\'s.\n\nBut in our next guess, we could encounter that.\n\nBut in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.\n\nPossible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.\n\n""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.\n\n""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.\n\nNo, so avoid R.\n\nWords without absent letters.\n\nConsider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\nAlso, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.\n\nFull 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.\n\nBut we have N already at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.\n\nT is out.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.\n\nPossible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.\n\nAlso ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.\n\nOr ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".\n\nBut ""LOONS"" has two O\'s.\n\nNow, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.\n\nWe need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.\n\nFor example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.\n\nThis would test S, U, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.\n\nBut U is common to both.\n\nSince the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.\n\nIn this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.\n\nBut position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.\n\nWe need a word that distinguishes possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t have many possibilities.\n\nList: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nPossible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.\n\nAre there others without U?\n\nFor example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.\n\nWhat about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.\n\nPosition 4 must be N.\n\nPerhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.\n\nAnother: ""CONUS"" — C is out.\n\nSo almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.\n\nExcept words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.\n\nIn that case, position 3 is O.\n\nAlso, ""BOWNS"" not a word.\n\n""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.\n\nIs ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nYes: downy.\n\nBut it has W at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.\n\nSo possible words:\n- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound\n- With O at position 3: goons, loons\n- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.\n\n""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.\n\nSince we haven\'t guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.\n\nBut to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.\n\nFor example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.\n\nBut if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.\n\nBut we have many guesses left (4 more), so it\'s okay to guess one possibility.\n\nTo maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.\n\nI think ""sound"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback, we might know.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""sound"".\n\nBut note: we could choose something that tests other letters.\n\nIf we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common?

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. I need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another option is ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""CRANE"".

 Since it's the first guess, any word should be fine as long as it has distinct letters.

 My choice: CRANE

 Format the response as per instructions.<thoughts>
Since this is the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opener because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of identifying correct letters and positions.
- Common letters like E, R, and A appear frequently in English words.
After this guess, the feedback (✓, -, x) will provide clues about which letters are in the secret word and their positions, allowing me to refine subsequent guesses.
</thoughts>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is not in the secret word at all.
- N is in the word and in the correct position! The fourth letter is N.
- E is not in the secret word at all.

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has the letter N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N _ 

Now, since we know C, R, A, E are absent, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We must guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has common letters and includes N in the fourth position.

Potential words: 
- We need the fourth letter to be N: ...N..
- And the word must not contain C, R, A, E.

Considerations:
- We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Possible words: 
""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T -> but N is the fourth letter? Let's check: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T. Yes.

But note: in feedback, we had A missing, but O and I might be present? We don't know.

Another word: ""JOINT"" - but J is less common.

Another: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> positions: 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T.

But note: U might be less common.

Another: ""BLUNT"" - but B, L, U, N, T -> but we have 5 letters and N is at position 4? B-L-U-N-T -> 1=B,2=L,3=U,4=N,5=T. Yes.

But ""BLUNT"" has two new consonants and two vowels? Actually U is a vowel.

To maximize vowels: we know A and E are out, so vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So including O or I might be good.

We also haven't tested S, T, L, D, etc.

Looking at ""POINT"": 
- It contains P, O, I, T, N. 
- N is at position 4, and the fifth letter is T, which we haven't tested.

""POINT"" seems good because it has three new vowels/consonants? Actually, O and I are vowels, P and T are consonants.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" doesn't have N at the end? No, because we need fourth letter N.

Another word: ""STINK"" - S, T, I, N, K -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K.

That's another possibility.

Or ""SHINY"" - S, H, I, N, Y -> but Y is at the end.

Since we don't know about Y, but let's think about common words.

Note: We don't know if the secret word has vowels. We have eliminated A and E, but it must have vowels (unless using Y or others).

So, potential vowels are I, O, U, Y.

Including at least one vowel is good.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests O and I as vowels, and P and T as consonants. Also, N is fixed.

This seems efficient.

Other words: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"" has S and T but fourth letter is not N? M-O-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, so no. We need fourth letter N.

""PAINT"" has A, which we know is missing, so invalid.

We know A is missing, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, avoid C, R, E.

So, ""POINT"" seems a good guess.

But we have used P, O, I, T, N.

We know N is in the word and correct position, so we expect ✓ for N, and for others we will see.

We want to maximize the chance of getting some correct and also identify presence.

Another word: ""CLINT"" but C is forbidden (we know it's absent).

So, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated? And fourth letter N, so S-T-I-N-T. This has repeated T, which might be less efficient unless it's in the word.

Since we don't know, perhaps ""POINT"" is better for distinct letters.

""POINT"" has all distinct: P, O, I, N, T.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" - J is less common.

""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T -> U might be less common.

""MINTS"" - M, I, N, T, S -> but that has N at position 3? M-I-N-T-S: 1=M,2=I,3=N,4=T,5=S -> no, fourth letter is T, not N.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, a list of words ending with ""..N.""? Actually, fourth letter N, so the word pattern is ? ? ? N ?.

Words: 
- POINT
- STUNG - S,T,U,N,G -> last letter G? But pattern _ _ _ N _, and we haven't tested U, G. But G is less common.
- BLIND - B,L,I,N,D -> fourth letter N? B-L-I-N-D -> position 4 is N? Actually: 1=B,2=L,3=I,4=N,5=D. Yes. But has I and D.
- BLIND has D and we haven't tested B,L,I,D. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

""BLIND"" is B,L,I,N,D -> avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""BLIND"" has I as a vowel.

Compare ""POINT"" vs ""BLIND"": both test different sets.

Alternatively, ""STINT"": S,T,I,N,T -> has T twice, so repeating T might not be efficient? Actually, if T is in the word, we might get information, but since T appears twice, it might be messy.

Another word: ""SHINE"" - but has E, which we know is absent.

So we must avoid E.

Therefore, ""SHINY"" - S,H,I,N,Y -> fourth letter N? S-H-I-N-Y -> 1=S,2=H,3=I,4=N,5=Y -> yes.

But Y might be a vowel or consonant? We can test it.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""POINT"".

But let's confirm: our constraints:
- Must have N at position 4 -> yes for ""POINT"": P O I N T -> 4=N.
- Must not contain C,R,A,E -> ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> none of the forbidden letters.

So, we'll go with ""POINT"".<thoughts>
Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):

- Letters C, R, A, and E are NOT in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter N is in the secret word and CORRECTLY placed in position 4 (marked ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word has the pattern: ? ? ? N ? 
- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.

For the second guess:
- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).
- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

The word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:
- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).
- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.
- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Testing ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N's placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): 
  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2? Let's note positions: 
    ""point"" is P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
    So O is at position 2: ✓ means the second letter is O.
  - I(x) and T(x): I and T are absent from the word.
  - P(x): P is absent.

Now we know:
- Second letter is O.
- Fourth letter is N.
- The word is of form: _ O _ N _
- Letters present: only O and N (and their positions are fixed).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from both guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: ? O ? N ?

And avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Since we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Common letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.

Let's list some possible words:

We need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.

Consider:

- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don't know if U or D are present.

We also have the constraints from previous missing letters.

Another: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.

""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven't tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don't have S. So S is possible.

But let's list words that fit: ?O?N?

Possible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.

Also, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.

Other words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O's? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn't have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn't be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.

Recall the rules:
- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.
- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.
- Not present gets x.

In ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

The O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?

Let me clarify with an example.

Suppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?
- F: ✓ (position 1)
- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?
But secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.

But if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:
- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.
- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.
- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": 
  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓
  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓
  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.

Actually, each letter is evaluated individually.

In Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.

But in our case, for ""point"", we have:
- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Therefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it's correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn't put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it's at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O's, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn't guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.

The key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.

Specifically, in ""point"":
- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? 

Looking at the rules:
- ✓: letter in word and correct position.
- -: letter in word but wrong position.
- x: letter NOT in the word.

So for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.

Similarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.

Similarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.

Also, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So secret word is: _ O _ N _

And only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).

Now, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Remaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words with pattern _ O _ N _

List of words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.

Other words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.

""LOUNS"" not a word.

""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.

But the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.

Position 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren't told about another O because we didn't guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn't supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?

Actually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:

- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.

But in our case, for ""point"", we didn't guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.

However, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that's possible.

In this feedback, since we didn't guess O elsewhere, we don't know about other O's.

For example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O's.

But in our next guess, we could encounter that.

But in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.

Possible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.

""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.

""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.

No, so avoid R.

Words without absent letters.

Consider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.

Similarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Also, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.

Full 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

Another possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.

But we have N already at position 4.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.

T is out.

Similarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.

Possible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.

Also ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.

Or ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".

But ""LOONS"" has two O's.

Now, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.

We need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.

For example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.

This would test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.

But U is common to both.

Since the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.

But to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.

In this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.

But position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.

We need a word that distinguishes possibilities.

But we don't have many possibilities.

List: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Possible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.

Are there others without U?

For example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.

What about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.

Position 4 must be N.

Perhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.

Another: ""CONUS"" — C is out.

So almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.

Except words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.

In that case, position 3 is O.

Also, ""BOWNS"" not a word.

""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.

No.

""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.

Is ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.

And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

Yes: downy.

But it has W at position 3.

Similarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.

So possible words:
- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound
- With O at position 3: goons, loons
- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.

""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.

Since we haven't guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.

But to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.

For example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.

But if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.

Similarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.

But we have many guesses left (4 more), so it's okay to guess one possibility.

To maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.

I think ""sound"" is a common word.

Similarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.

If we get feedback, we might know.

So let's go with ""sound"".

But note: we could choose something that tests other letters.

If we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.

But since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.

Therefore, I'll guess ""sound"".

Also, avoiding letters we haven't seen.

So, guess: ""sound""

But check letters: S,O,U,N,D.

O and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.

Position: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.

So.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:
  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.
  - P, I, and T are not in the word.
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _
  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).
- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.

To maximize information gain:
- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).
- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:
  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).
  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).

<thoughts>
- Pattern deduced: _ O _ N _
- Known absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Testing ""sound"" ensures O and N positions are confirmed while probing new letters S, U, D
- Common word with high information potential

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)

This means:
- O(✓) at position 2: confirmed correct.
- N(✓) at position 4: confirmed correct.
- S(x) at position 1: S is not in the word at all.
- U(✓) at position 3: U is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
- D(✓) at position 5: D is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

Therefore:
- Secret word is O at position 2, U at position 3, N at position 4, D at position 5.
- Position 1 must be filled with the only unknown letter.
- Pattern: ? O U N D

Also, from the letter feedback:
- S is absent (x).
- But O, U, N, D are all present and correctly placed.

Moreover, we know from previous guesses that C,R,A,E,P,I,T are absent.

So the secret word is exactly ?OUND.

Now, we need a 5-letter word that ends with ""OUND"" but position 1 must not be excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S (just found).

Possible words: bound, found, hound, mound, wound, etc.

But the first letter: must be one of B,F,H,M,W,G,L, etc. excluding the absent letters.

Common ones: B,F,H,M,W,G,L,K, etc.

Since we are at guess 4, we might guess one of them.

However, note: we have almost the entire word except the first letter.

Guessing any of bound, found, hound, mound, wound would work.

But we need to choose one to guess.

Since we don't know position 1, we need to test a letter.

But we have only position 1 unknown.

We can guess systematically.

List: words like bound, found, hound, mound, pound but pound has P absent? P is absent.

Pound not allowed.

Similarly, round has R, absent.

Sound we guessed and S absent.

Wound: W O U N D

Found: F O U N D

Hound: H O U N D

Mound: M O U N D

Bound: B O U N D

Gound: not common? G O U N D? Uncommon word.

Lound: not a word.

So, likely W, F, H, M, B.

We need to choose one.

To be safe, we can pick a common one.

Guess ""bound"" for example.

Feedback will tell if correct or not.

If B is absent, then we know, else if correct, we win.

Similarly for others.

Thus, we can guess ""bound"".

Given the history, we might want to maximize info, but since only one letter unknown, we can guess one.

I'll go with ""bound"".<thoughts>
- Secret word pattern: ? O U N D
- Confirmed letters: O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5)
- Absent letters per feedback: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S
- Remaining possibilities: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, etc. (first letter not excluded)
- Choosing a common candidate like ""bound"" tests B at position 1.
- If correct (B✓), it solves the word; if not (Bx), it narrows to other options (e.g., FOUND, HOUND).
</thoughts>

<guess>bound</guess>The previous feedback shows that the secret word is structured as ?OUND (letters O, U, N, D confirmed in positions 2-5, with position 1 unknown). Letters C, R, A, E, P, I, T, and S are absent. Possible words include **bound**, **found**, **hound**, **mound**, and **wound**. 

For this guess, **bound** is chosen to test if **B** is the missing letter at position 1. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will eliminate **B** and point toward other options (like **found** or **hound**).

<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 4: bound -> B(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)
This means:
- B(x): B is not in the word at all. Therefore, our previous guess ""bound"" is incorrect because B is absent.
- O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(✓): These letters are confirmed correct at positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.

Therefore, the secret word remains: ? O U N D, with the first letter still unknown.

But now we know B is absent.

Previously known absent: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S (and now B).

So absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,B.

Therefore, for position 1, we cannot use these.

Remaining possibilities: F, H, M, W, G, K, L, Y, etc.

But we must find a valid English word: found, hound, mound, wound.

Also, gound is a word? Medical term, but possibly rare. Or ""kound"" not a word.

So likely: FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND.

We need to guess one.

Let's eliminate systematically.

We could guess ""found"" next.

Then, if F is correct, we win. Else if F is absent, we know.

Similarly.

To make a guess.

""hound"" tests H.

I think ""found"" is common.

So I'll guess ""found"".<thoughts>
The secret word is confirmed to be _OUND with letters O,U,N,D fixed in positions 2-5. 
Absent letters now include: B, C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S.
Remaining possibilities: FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND.
Choosing ""found"" tests F at position 1. If correct (F✓), it solves the word; if not (Fx), it eliminates F, leaving HOUND, MOUND, or WOUND.
</thoughts>

<guess>found</guess>Based on the feedback from ""bound"":
- **B(x)**: B is absent from the secret word.
- **O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(✓)**: These confirm the pattern `? O U N D` (positions 2-5: `O`, `U`, `N`, `D`).

**Absent letters**: B, C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S (all excluded based on cumulative feedback).  
**Remaining possibilities**: `FOUND`, `HOUND`, `MOUND`, `WOUND` (all valid 5-letter words fitting `?OUND` and avoiding absent letters).

For the next guess:
- **Strategy**: Test `FOUND` to isolate `F` as the first-letter candidate. If correct (✓), it wins; if incorrect (`x`), it eliminates `F`, narrowing options to `HOUND`, `MOUND`, or `WOUND`.

<thoughts>
- Secret pattern: ? O U N D

N ? \n- The word must NOT include C, R, A, or E.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Focus on maximizing new information by using common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D, P, M).\n- Ensure the fourth letter is ""N"" to maintain the known position.\n- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThe word ""POINT"" fits these requirements:\n- Position 4 is ""N"" (as required).\n- Uses new common letters: P, O, I, T.\n- All letters are distinct and untested (no repeats).\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nTesting ""POINT"" will reveal if any of O, I, or T/P are present and their positions, while confirming N\'s placement. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities in future guesses.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x): So N is in the correct position (4th letter), and C, R, A, E are absent.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""point""):\n- P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x): \n  - O is in the word and correctly placed (position 2? Let\'s note positions: \n    ""point"" is P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). \n    So O is at position 2: ✓ means the second letter is O.\n  - I(x) and T(x): I and T are absent from the word.\n  - P(x): P is absent.\n\nNow we know:\n- Second letter is O.\n- Fourth letter is N.\n- The word is of form: _ O _ N _\n- Letters present: only O and N (and their positions are fixed).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from both guesses).\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: ? O ? N ?\n\nAnd avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.\n\nSince we know positions for O and N, we need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: we might consider B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nThe word must include vowels? We know A, E, I are absent, so the vowel possibilities are O (already used), U, and sometimes Y. So positions 1,3,5 could be consonants or U/Y as vowels.\n\nLet\'s list some possible words:\n\nWe need a word with second letter O and fourth letter N.\n\nConsider:\n\n- BOUND: B O U N D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Check absent: U and D not tested? But absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T — U and D are okay. So maybe? But we don\'t know if U or D are present.\n\nWe also have the constraints from previous missing letters.\n\nAnother: ""MOUND"" — M O U N D -> similar.\n\n""SOUND"" — S O U N D -> S is not in absent list? We haven\'t tested S earlier? Only from ""crane"" and ""point"" we don\'t have S. So S is possible.\n\nBut let\'s list words that fit: ?O?N?\n\nPossible words: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, LOUNS? (no), etc.\n\nAlso, words like ""JOINS"" — but position? J O I N S — third letter I is absent (we know I is absent) so invalid, because I cannot be there.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" we already guessed? Not exactly, but we guessed ""point"", so ""joint"" would have I, which is absent.\n\nOther words: ""GOONS"" — G O O N S — but two O\'s? Pattern: first G, second O (same), third O no — third letter is O? The pattern requires the second letter O and fourth N, so third can be any letter? But in ""GOONS"": G(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5). But we know O is already at position 2, and O is a letter, so if the word has another O, it might be possible? But from feedback from ""point"", O was at position 2 and we got ✓ for O. But there could be another O? However, in the ""point"" guess, we had O at position 2, but the other positions didn\'t have O, so if there was another O, when we guessed ""point"", the second O wouldn\'t be marked unless it was correct? The feedback only marks letters present in the word.\n\nRecall the rules:\n- A letter in the correct position gets ✓.\n- A letter present but in wrong position gets -.\n- Not present gets x.\n\nIn ""point"", we had: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n\nThe O is ✓, so the O at position 2 is correct. If the secret word had another O, say at a different position, then when guessing ""point"", if that position was incorrect for O but there was another O, we might have seen a ""-"" for O? But no, because O at position 2 is already used correctly? Typically, if there is only one O, it would be marked correctly. But if there are multiple, the first occurrence might take the ✓, and others might be marked if available?\n\nLet me clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose secret word is ""FOULS"", and we guess ""FOCUS"", what happens?\n- F: ✓ (position 1)\n- O: ✓ (position 2) — assuming same position?\nBut secret is F O U L S, and guess is F O C U S? So O at pos2 is correct.\n\nBut if secret is ""BOOKS"", and guess ""BOOBS"", then:\n- B? At pos1: secret B, so ✓.\n- O at pos2: secret O, so ✓.\n- O at pos3: secret O? secret ""BOOKS"": pos1=B, pos2=O, pos3=O? So for guess ""BOOBS"": \n  - Pos1: B vs B -> ✓\n  - Pos2: O vs O -> ✓\n  - Pos3: O vs ? (secret has O at pos3? So O is present but in position 3? However, in the guess, pos3 is O, secret has O at pos3? So it should be ✓ for pos3 also? Only if matched.\n\nActually, each letter is evaluated individually.\n\nIn Wordle-type games, the feedback is per letter: the counts matter. If a letter appears multiple times, feedback might use markers only for as many times as it appears.\n\nBut in our case, for ""point"", we have:\n- Feedback P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n\nTherefore, O is present only once? Or at least, for position 2, it\'s correct. Any other O would not be marked in this guess because we didn\'t put O elsewhere? But since we only have one O and it\'s at correct position, if the secret word has multiple O\'s, say in position 1 or 3 or 5, then it might not be reflected because we didn\'t guess an O there. However, the feedback shows that for the letters we guessed, they are marked individually.\n\nThe key point: from the ""(x)"", it means for the position we guessed, that letter is not present? Or for letters that are not in the word at all.\n\nSpecifically, in ""point"":\n- For position 3, we guessed I -> (x), meaning that I is not in the word at all, because if it was present but elsewhere, we would see ""-""? \n\nLooking at the rules:\n- ✓: letter in word and correct position.\n- -: letter in word but wrong position.\n- x: letter NOT in the word.\n\nSo for letter I at position 3: (x) -> I is not in the word at all.\n\nSimilarly for T at position 5: (x) means T is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, for P at position 1: (x) means P is not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word does NOT contain P, I, T.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know it does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.\n\nSo secret word is: _ O _ N _\n\nAnd only the letters O and N are known present (with positions fixed).\n\nNow, we must fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nRemaining possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,S,U,V,W,Y... etc.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words with pattern _ O _ N _\n\nList of words:\n- BOUND (B O U N D)\n- FOUND (F O U N D)\n- MOUND (M O U N D)\n- SOUND (S O U N D)\n- WOUND (W O U N D)\n- HOUND (H O U N D)\n- POUND (but P is absent? No, P is absent, so cannot use POUND) P is out.\n\nOther words: ""JOINS"" not because of I and no? Position: J O I N S — but I is absent.\n\n""LOUNS"" not a word.\n\n""GOONS"": G O O N S — second O at position 3.\n\nBut the pattern: position 1=G, 2=O, 3=O, 4=N, 5=S.\n\nPosition 3 is O. Is O allowed? O is already in the word at position 2, and we know O is present because we have O at position 2 correct. However, in the feedback, we weren\'t told about another O because we didn\'t guess O at position 3? In ""point"", we used O at position 2, so if there is another O in the secret word, it would not show up in that guess because we didn\'t supply it? But the feedback marks each guessed letter only once?\n\nActually, the standard Wordle rule handles duplicate letters:\n\n- If a letter is duplicated in the guess, it is treated individually, but the feedback may reflect the min of counts.\n\nBut in our case, for ""point"", we didn\'t guess any duplicate letters. We guessed O only once at position 2 and got (✓). So that does not prohibit the secret word from having another O.\n\nHowever, we have that the letter O is present, but if it appears multiple times, that\'s possible.\n\nIn this feedback, since we didn\'t guess O elsewhere, we don\'t know about other O\'s.\n\nFor example, if the secret word is ""GOONS"", then it has two O\'s.\n\nBut in our next guess, we could encounter that.\n\nBut in our current pattern, position 3 could be O? So ""_ O O N _"" for example.\n\nPossible words: ""BROWN"" — but R is absent? R is in absent list. So cannot.\n\n""GROWN"" — G,R,O,W,N — R is absent.\n\n""CROWN"" — C,R,O,W,N — C and R absent.\n\nNo, so avoid R.\n\nWords without absent letters.\n\nConsider: ""BOUND"" — B, O, U, N, D — all letters not in absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T. None of B,U,D are in that. So possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\nAlso, ""SOWN?"" But S O W N _? We need fifth letter. ""SOWNS"" not a word? Usually ""sown"" is four letters.\n\nFull 5-letter words: ""SOUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DOWNS"" — D O W N S — positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). But N is only at position 4? In the word ""downs"", fourth letter is N? D-O-W-N-S: yes.\n\nBut we have N already at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWNS"" — has T, but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent, so cannot.\n\nT is out.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOWNS"" not common.\n\nPossible words: I think ""BOUND"", ""FOUND"", ""MOUND"", ""SOUND"", ""WOUND"", ""HOUND"" all are similar.\n\nAlso ""GOONS"" — G O O N S.\n\nOr ""LOONS"" — L O O N S — for ""loons"".\n\nBut ""LOONS"" has two O\'s.\n\nNow, we have position 1,3,5 to determine.\n\nWe need to guess a word that includes some new letters to narrow down.\n\nFor example, we could guess ""sound"": S O U N D.\n\nThis would test S, U, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""hound"": H O U N D, tests H,U,D.\n\nBut U is common to both.\n\nSince the pattern is fixed for positions 2 and 4: O and N, we can choose any word that fits.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might not fix all positions simultaneously? Wait.\n\nIn this case, we can choose to test, for example, U in position 3.\n\nBut position 3: in ""bound"" it is U, but in ""goons"" it is O.\n\nWe need a word that distinguishes possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t have many possibilities.\n\nList: all words in English matching ?O?N? and not containing C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nPossible with third letter U: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND, SOUND — all have U at position 3.\n\nAre there others without U?\n\nFor example, with third letter D? But ""?ODN?"" — not common. ""BODEN"" not common? ""MODEL"" has E out.\n\nWhat about ""LOGIN""? But G at position 3? L O G I N: I at position 4? No, I is not allowed and position is wrong.\n\nPosition 4 must be N.\n\nPerhaps ""DOSES"" but no N.\n\nAnother: ""CONUS"" — C is out.\n\nSo almost all the words with pattern _O_N_ have U at position 3.\n\nExcept words like ""GOONS"" or ""LOONS"": G O O N S or L O O N S.\n\nIn that case, position 3 is O.\n\nAlso, ""BOWNS"" not a word.\n\n""YOWNS"" — yowl? New word ""yawns"" — but ""yawns"": Y A W N S — A is absent? A is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""DOWNY"" — D O W N Y: positions D(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),Y(5) — and W not forbidden? But we have position 3 as W.\n\nIs ""downy"" a 5-letter word? Yes, meaning covered with down.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: D,O,W,N,Y — O and N we know, D,W,Y new? And avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.\n\nYes: downy.\n\nBut it has W at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""towny"" forbidden T.\n\nSo possible words:\n- With U at position 3: bound, found, hound, mound, sound, wound\n- With O at position 3: goons, loons\n- With other: downy (W), gowns (but G O W N S, but ""gowns"" is G(1),O(2),W(3),N(4),S(5)) — gowns, but S at end.\n\n""downy"" and ""gowns"" have different structure.\n\nSince we haven\'t guessed S, D, etc., we need to choose one.\n\nBut to be efficient, we could guess a word that is among these possibilities to get direct feedback.\n\nFor example, guessing ""sound"" would tell us if S, U, and D are present and positions.\n\nBut if we guess ""sound"", and if correct, we win. If not, feedback would guide.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""goons"", if secret is ""goons"", we win; else feedback.\n\nBut we have many guesses left (4 more), so it\'s okay to guess one possibility.\n\nTo maximize information, we might avoid making the word match a common possibility? But in this case, since the pattern is narrow, guessing one is fine.\n\nI think ""sound"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, it tests S at position 1, U at position 3, D at position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback, we might know.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""sound"".\n\nBut note: we could choose something that tests other letters.\n\nIf we guess ""downy"", it tests D,W,Y — which are less common? U is more common.\n\nBut since multiple options with U, and U is vowel, likely.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""sound"".\n\nAlso, avoiding letters we haven\'t seen.\n\nSo, guess: ""sound""\n\nBut check letters: S,O,U,N,D.\n\nO and N are known, U, S, D are new? But from absent list, we only excluded C,R,A,E,P,I,T, so S,U,D are okay.\n\nPosition: S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> matches pattern.\n\nSo.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that:\n  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.\n  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word.\n- Guess 2 (""point"") revealed that:\n  - O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2.\n  - P, I, and T are not in the word.\n- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ N _\n  - Positions: 1 (unknown), 2 (O), 3 (unknown), 4 (N), 5 (unknown).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (must be avoided).\n- Remaining possible letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nFor the next guess, we need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern (_ O _ N _) and excludes the absent letters. Common possibilities include words like BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, HOUND, and GOONS.\n\nTo maximize information gain:\n- Choose a word that tests new common letters at the unknown positions (1, 3, and 5).\n- ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate:\n  - Matches the pattern: S (position 1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5).\n  - Tests letters S, U (common), and D, which are untested so far.\n  - If incorrect, the feedback will quickly narrow down possibilities (e.g., revealing if U is present or if position 1 or 5 has a specific letter).\n\n<thoughts>\n- Pattern deduced: _ O _ N _\n- Known absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T\n- Testing ""sound"" ensures O and N positions are confirmed while probing new letters S, U, D\n- Common word with high information potential\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>sound</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- O(✓) at position 2: confirmed correct.\n- N(✓) at position 4: confirmed correct.\n- S(x) at position 1: S is not in the word at all.\n- U(✓) at position 3: U is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.\n- D(✓) at position 5: D is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.\n\nTherefore:\n- Secret word is O at position 2, U at position 3, N at position 4, D at position 5.\n- Position 1 must be filled with the only unknown letter.\n- Pattern: ?

We are at Guess 6 (last try) based on:
- Previous guesses and feedback:
  Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x) → N is at position 4, and C,R,A,E absent.
  Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x) → O is at position 2, and P,I,T absent.
  Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓) → U at position 3, D at position 5, S absent. Thus the word is ? O U N D.
  Guess 4: bound -> B(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓) → B absent.
  Guess 5: found -> F(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓) → F absent.

Therefore:
- The secret word is of the form: _ O U N D
- Letters in positions:
  1: unknown
  2: O
  3: U
  4: N
  5: D
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, B, F. Also, from prior, we have excluded these. Remaining letters to try for position 1 must be from the list of letters not excluded.

Confirmed absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, B, F.

The secret word is **_ound**. The common options left are: hound, mound, wound.

We have used guesses with ""bound"", ""found"", so we have not tried H, M, W.

Since this is the last guess, we need to choose one.

Possible words:
- hound: H at position 1
- mound: M at position 1
- wound: W at position 1

Other less common words: ""pound"" has P absent; ""round"" has R absent; ""sound"" S absent; ""bound"" B absent; ""found"" F absent, etc.

Also, ""gound"": not a common word (medical term for eye discharge), not likely. ""kound"" not a word. So stick to common words.

Now, among hound, mound, wound, which one to choose?

We have no information to distinguish them, so we can choose any.

However, ""hound"" and ""wound"" are more common than ""mound""? But all are valid.

Let's list: 
- HOUND: a dog, or to pursue.
- MOUND: a hill or heap.
- WOUND: past tense of wind, or an injury.

All are valid 5-letter words.

Since we have three options and only one guess, we must pick one.

How to choose? We might consider frequency, or guess arbitrarily. 

""wound"" is a homograph (two pronunciations: woond for injury, wound for wind), but still valid word.

I think ""hound"" is a good choice.

But note: we have not tested H, M, W in previous guesses.

We must pick one.

Let me check if any other is more frequent? 

Usually, ""hound"" is common. But without data, we can pick.

Alternatively, we can avoid W because of ambiguity? But it's accepted.

I'll go with ""wound"" because it is another common word.

But to decide:

- We have tried B and F, and excluded, so next common consonants: H, M, W.

We can guess ""hound"".

But any choice is acceptable.

I will guess ""wound"".

Guess 5 feedback (**F(x)** for position 1) confirms **F** is **absent**, and **O, U, N, D** positions are verified (✓). This narrows the secret word exclusively to **? ?OUND** (letters fixed: O=2, U=3, N=4, D=5), with position 1 unresolved.  

### Analysis of Absent Letters and Candidates:  
- **Absent letters** (cumulative): C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, B, F (all excluded).  
- **Position 1 candidates**: Only **H, M, W** remain as common first-letter options for valid words:  
  - `HOUND` (tests **H** at 1)  
  - `MOUND` (tests **M** at 1)  
  - `WOUND` (tests **W** at 1)  
- **Narrowing strategy**: With no additional clues, `hound` or `mound` were alternatives, but `wound` is selected as a high-frequency guess to resolve the game. Feedback will either confirm it as correct (✓) or reveal the final absent letter (`Wx`), leaving `hound`/`mound` for a subsequent guess (but this is the last turn).  

### Guess for Turn 6:  
**<guess>wound</guess>**  

---  
*(Note: If `wound` is incorrect, the answer is one of the two other candidates, but no more guesses remain.)*  

<thoughts>
- Secret word: _ O U N D  
- Position 1 must be H, M, or W (only common valid options).  
- ""Wound"" tests W at position 1. If W✓, it wins; if Wx, it confirms HOUND or MOUND (though no further guesses).  
- Optimal given constraints.
</thoughts>",wound,"We are at Guess 6 (last try) based on:
- Previous guesses and feedback:
  Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x) → N is at position 4, and C,R,A,E absent.
  Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x) → O is at position 2, and P,I,T absent.
  Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓) → U at position 3, D at position 5, S absent. Thus the word is ? O U N D.
  Guess 4: bound -> B(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓) → B absent.
  Guess 5: found -> F(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓) → F absent.

Therefore:
- The secret word is of the form: _ O U N D
- Letters in positions:
  1: unknown
  2: O
  3: U
  4: N
  5: D
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, B, F. Also, from prior, we have excluded these. Remaining letters to try for position 1 must be from the list of letters not excluded.

Confirmed absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, B, F.

The secret word is **_ound**. The common options left are: hound, mound, wound.

We have used guesses with ""bound"", ""found"", so we have not tried H, M, W.

Since this is the last guess, we need to choose one.

Possible words:
- hound: H at position 1
- mound: M at position 1
- wound: W at position 1
