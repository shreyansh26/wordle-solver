We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 The feedback tells us:
   C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all (x).
   N is in the word but not in the fourth position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"", N is the fourth letter).

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the word.

 Now, we know the word has 5 letters and one of them is N (not at position 4).

 We need to make a second guess that uses the letter 'N' in a different position (so not position 4) and avoids C, R, A, E.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and avoiding repeating the same letters.

 Since N is in the word, we can try words with N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (because not 4).

 Let's think of common letters that aren't C, R, A, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

 We should also note that the word has only one N? Actually, we don't know yet. But for now, we assume it might have only one.

 A good second guess should include N in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 and try to cover other common letters.

 Let's consider possible words:

 Option: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. But note: O and I are vowels, and we haven't tested them. However, we have to avoid R, A, E (which we are) and also C (which we are). But R is already excluded? Actually, R was marked 'x' so not present.

 But wait: the feedback said R(x) meaning R is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

 Similarly, avoid C, R, A, E.

 Another idea: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T -> no N, so we can't use that because we must test the N in a different position.

 We need a word that includes N.

 Let's try ""STINK"": S, T, I, N, K -> but N is at position 4? We need to avoid position 4 for N. In ""stink"", N is the fourth letter: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). But we know N cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4.

 Therefore, we must choose a word where N is at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Example: ""LINKS"" -> L, I, N, K, S -> N is at position 3 -> okay.

 But note: we are avoiding R, C, A, E. ""LINKS"" doesn't contain these.

 Alternatively: ""MINTS"" -> M, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3.

 Also, ""SWUNG"" -> S, W, U, N, G -> N at position 4? ... no, in SWUNG: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> position 4 -> avoid.

 So let's avoid position 4.

 How about ""NOISY""? N is at position 1. That's allowed. Also, letters: N, O, I, S, Y -> avoid R, A, E, C.

 But wait, we have two vowels? That might be okay.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had A and E and they were absent. So the secret word might have other vowels (like O, I, U).

 Another option: ""TONGS"" -> T, O, N, G, S. N is at position 3 -> okay.

 But T? We haven't tested T yet. So trying T is good.

 Alternatively, ""BUNCH"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is absent (x). So avoid C -> ""BUNCH"" has C -> invalid.

 Therefore, avoid words with C, R, A, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""PINTS"" -> P, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3? P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but N is at position 3 -> okay. However, note we haven't seen if T, I, P, S are present.

   ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4) -> wait, N is at position 4 -> avoid? Yes, because feedback said N is not at position 4. So we cannot use position 4.

   ""JOINT"": same issue? J, O, I, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""INGOT"": I(1), N(2), G(3), O(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 Let me check: INGOT: I, N, G, O, T -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 This seems acceptable.

 Another common word: ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 ""HILLY"": no N -> we must include N.

 ""NOBLY"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. N at position 1 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested B, L, Y? So that is new.

 Alternatively, ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But note: we don't know if S is present? So we can test S in this guess.

 Considering the information, we want to test multiple new letters and also the letter N in a different position (not position 4).

 I'm going to choose a word that has N at position 2 and uses common letters: ""SNOWY"" is possible, but also ""SUNNY"" has duplicate N? We don't know if the word has duplicate N. However, it's better to avoid duplicates unless necessary because it might confuse.

 But ""SNOWY"": S at position 1, N at position 2, O at position 3, W at position 4, Y at position 5. This tests S, N, O, W, Y.

 Note: We already know N is present, so we are testing it again? Actually, we know there's an N but we are testing at position 2. If we get a (-) for N then we know position 2 is not correct, and if we get a (x) for N? That would be inconsistent because we know N is in the word? But note: if the word has only one N and we put it in position 2, then we might get:

   ✓ if correct
   - if it is in the word but not in position 2 and we haven't guessed another N? Wait, no. The feedback for each letter is independent. But if the secret has two Ns, then we could still get a (-) for N if one is in the word elsewhere? Let me clarify:

 Actually, the feedback does not account for multiple occurrences unless they are in the secret. For example, if the secret has two Ns, then each N in the guess is compared to the occurrences.

 But in our case, since we know from the first guess that there is at least one N, then in the second guess, if we put N in position 2 and if that position is wrong but there's another N elsewhere, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. Let me recall the rules:

   ✓: correct letter and position.
   -: the letter is in the word but not in this position (and also note: if the secret has multiple, then each guess letter is matched with a secret occurrence that hasn't been matched yet).

 So if we put an N in position 2, and the secret N is at, say, position 1, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: wait, the secret has an N at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would get a (-) if there is an N at position 1? Actually, no: because the N in the secret at position 1 hasn't been matched to a guess yet? Actually, the feedback goes by:

   First, check for exact matches (position and letter): then remove those. Then for the rest, match letters that are present but not in the right position.

 So if we guess N at position 2 and the secret has an N at position 1 (and no other N), then the N at position 2 would be compared to the secret N at position 1? But it's not matched because the position is different? Actually, it would get a '-' because the letter is present but not in that position? However, the secret N at position 1 hasn't been matched exactly? Then the guess's N at position 2 would match the secret N at position 1? Only if the secret N at position1 hasn't been matched? Actually, the algorithm goes:

   Step 1: Check for exact matches in each position. Then mark those as ✓ and remove both the secret letter and the guess letter for that position for the next step.

   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters, check if they appear in the secret in a position that hasn't been matched? Then mark as - if found.

 Therefore, if the secret has N at position 1 and we guess N at position 2:

   Step 1: position 1: secret has N, guess has (say) S -> no match? 
            position 2: guess has N, secret has some other letter -> not an exact match.

   Then step 2: for the guess at position 1: is S in the secret? ... but we're concerned about the N.

   For the guess at position 2: N is in the secret? We have the secret N at position 1 still available -> so we mark guess N at position 2 as '-'.

 Therefore, if we put N in a position that is not the correct one, we will get a '-'.

 We already have one N that we know is not at position 4. So we can test another position.

 Since we don't know if there are multiple Ns, it's safe to include one N.

 Let's go with ""INGOT"": which has I, N, G, O, T -> N at position 2.

 Alternatively, to test more common letters, we can choose ""POINT"" but that puts N at 4 -> disallowed.

 Another idea: ""NOTCH"" -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 Good words: ""MOIST"" -> but no N.

 We must include N? Yes, because we have a clue about N.

 How about ""LOGIN"": L, O, G, I, N -> N at position 5 -> that's allowed.

 This avoids forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 ""LOGIN"": L at 1, O at 2, G at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

 This tests L, O, G, I, N -> and we have N at position 5.

 Common words: Also ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> but E is forbidden? We know E is absent (from first guess) -> so ""ONSET"" contains E -> invalid.

 So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that includes N and avoids C,R,A,E.

 I think ""INGOT"" is suitable: letters I, N, G, O, T -> none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested U or L.

 Since we want to maximize information, we can choose a word with letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

 Let's list the letters we haven't tried (excluding C,R,A,E): 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Common vowels: I, O, U -> so we should test these? Yes.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""UNTIL"": 
   U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> N at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait, we don't know if the word has U, T, I, L? So we can test.

 Alternatively, I think ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> N at position 3 -> okay. The letters D, I, G, Y are new.

 ""DINGY"" seems okay? But D and G? Not very common? Maybe.

 I think it's better to choose a word that does not have duplicate letters and covers as many common letters as possible.

 I'll pick ""NOISY"": 
   N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N at position 1 -> that's allowed? Yes, because the previous feedback only said position 4 is incorrect, but maybe N is at position 1.

 This word has N, O, I, S, Y -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 And S and Y are common.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""NOISY"".

 Alternatively, ""TUNIS"": T, U, N, I, S -> has N at position 3? T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> that's allowed because position 3 is not 4.

 But we are testing T, U, N, I, S.

 But ""TUNIS"" might be less common? So let's choose ""NOISY"".

 However, we also have to consider: we are avoiding R, A, C, E. ""NOISY"" doesn't have these.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: ""noisy"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""noisy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C**, **R**, **A**, and **E** are not in the secret word (marked ❌). These letters are excluded.
- **N** is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked ➖).

The new guess must:
- Include **N** in a position other than 4th (i.e., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoid using **C**, **R**, **A**, **E**.
- Contain 5 distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Focus on common letters: **S**, **O**, **I**, **Y** are untested and frequently used.

A suitable second guess is **NOISY**:
- **N** appears at position 1 (new position).
- Tests **O**, **I**, **S**, **Y** (new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and duplicate letters.

This guess strategically repositions **N** while probing additional common vowels/consonants.

<guess>noisy</guess>",noisy,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 The feedback tells us:
   C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all (x).

 But note: we are avoiding R, C, A, E. ""LINKS"" doesn't contain these.

 Also, ""SWUNG"" -> S, W, U, N, G -> N at position 4? ... no, in SWUNG: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> position 4 -> avoid.

 We already have one N that we know is not at position 4. So we can test another position.

 Since we don't know if there are multiple Ns, it's safe to include one N.

 Let's go with ""INGOT"": which has I, N, G, O, T -> N at position 2.

 Alternatively, to test more common letters, we can choose ""POINT"" but that puts N at 4 -> disallowed.

 Another idea: ""NOTCH"" -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 Good words: ""MOIST"" -> but no N.

 We must include N? Yes, because we have a clue about N.

 How about ""LOGIN"": L, O, G, I, N -> N at position 5 -> that's allowed.

 This avoids forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 ""LOGIN"": L at 1, O at 2, G at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

 This tests L, O, G, I, N -> and we have N at position 5.

 Common words: Also ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> but E is forbidden? We know E is absent (from first guess) -> so ""ONSET"" contains E -> invalid.

 So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that includes N and avoids C,R,A,E.

 I think ""INGOT"" is suitable: letters I, N, G, O, T -> none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested U or L.

 Since we want to maximize information, we can choose a word with letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

 Let's list the letters we haven't tried (excluding C,R,A,E): 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Common vowels: I, O, U -> so we should test these? Yes.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""UNTIL"": 
   U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> N at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait, we don't know if the word has U, T, I, L? So we can test.

 Alternatively, I think ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> N at position 3 -> okay. The letters D, I, G, Y are new.

 ""DINGY"" seems okay? But D and G? Not very common? Maybe.

 I think it's better to choose a word that does not have duplicate letters and covers as many common letters as possible.

 I'll pick ""NOISY"": 
   N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N at position 1 -> that's allowed? Yes, because the previous feedback only said position 4 is incorrect, but maybe N is at position 1.

 This word has N, O, I, S, Y -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 And S and Y are common.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""NOISY"".

 Alternatively, ""TUNIS"": T, U, N, I, S -> has N at position 3? T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> that's allowed because position 3 is not 4.

 But we are testing T, U, N, I, S.

 But ""TUNIS"" might be less common? So let's choose ""NOISY"".

 However, we also have to consider: we are avoiding R, A, C, E. ""NOISY"" doesn't have these.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: ""noisy"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""noisy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C**, **R**, **A**, and **E** are not in the secret word (marked ❌). These letters are excluded.
- **N** is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked ➖).

The new guess must:
- Include **N** in a position other than 4th (i.e., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoid using **C**, **R**, **A**, **E**.
- Contain 5 distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Focus on common letters: **S**, **O**, **I**, **Y** are untested and frequently used.

A suitable second guess is **NOISY**:
- **N** appears at position 1 (new position).
- Tests **O**, **I**, **S**, **Y** (new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and duplicate letters.

This guess strategically repositions **N** while probing additional common vowels/consonants.",Guess 2: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,UNTIL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 The feedback tells us:
   C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all (x).
   N is in the word but not in the fourth position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"", N is the fourth letter).

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the word.

 Now, we know the word has 5 letters and one of them is N (not at position 4).

 We need to make a second guess that uses the letter 'N' in a different position (so not position 4) and avoids C, R, A, E.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and avoiding repeating the same letters.

 Since N is in the word, we can try words with N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (because not 4).

 Let's think of common letters that aren't C, R, A, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

 We should also note that the word has only one N? Actually, we don't know yet. But for now, we assume it might have only one.

 A good second guess should include N in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 and try to cover other common letters.

 Let's consider possible words:

 Option: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. But note: O and I are vowels, and we haven't tested them. However, we have to avoid R, A, E (which we are) and also C (which we are). But R is already excluded? Actually, R was marked 'x' so not present.

 But wait: the feedback said R(x) meaning R is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

 Similarly, avoid C, R, A, E.

 Another idea: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T -> no N, so we can't use that because we must test the N in a different position.

 We need a word that includes N.

 Let's try ""STINK"": S, T, I, N, K -> but N is at position 4? We need to avoid position 4 for N. In ""stink"", N is the fourth letter: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). But we know N cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4.

 Therefore, we must choose a word where N is at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Example: ""LINKS"" -> L, I, N, K, S -> N is at position 3 -> okay.

 But note: we are avoiding R, C, A, E. ""LINKS"" doesn't contain these.

 Alternatively: ""MINTS"" -> M, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3.

 Also, ""SWUNG"" -> S, W, U, N, G -> N at position 4? ... no, in SWUNG: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> position 4 -> avoid.

 So let's avoid position 4.

 How about ""NOISY""? N is at position 1. That's allowed. Also, letters: N, O, I, S, Y -> avoid R, A, E, C.

 But wait, we have two vowels? That might be okay.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had A and E and they were absent. So the secret word might have other vowels (like O, I, U).

 Another option: ""TONGS"" -> T, O, N, G, S. N is at position 3 -> okay.

 But T? We haven't tested T yet. So trying T is good.

 Alternatively, ""BUNCH"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is absent (x). So avoid C -> ""BUNCH"" has C -> invalid.

 Therefore, avoid words with C, R, A, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""PINTS"" -> P, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3? P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but N is at position 3 -> okay. However, note we haven't seen if T, I, P, S are present.

   ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4) -> wait, N is at position 4 -> avoid? Yes, because feedback said N is not at position 4. So we cannot use position 4.

   ""JOINT"": same issue? J, O, I, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""INGOT"": I(1), N(2), G(3), O(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 Let me check: INGOT: I, N, G, O, T -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 This seems acceptable.

 Another common word: ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 ""HILLY"": no N -> we must include N.

 ""NOBLY"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. N at position 1 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested B, L, Y? So that is new.

 Alternatively, ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But note: we don't know if S is present? So we can test S in this guess.

 Considering the information, we want to test multiple new letters and also the letter N in a different position (not position 4).

 I'm going to choose a word that has N at position 2 and uses common letters: ""SNOWY"" is possible, but also ""SUNNY"" has duplicate N? We don't know if the word has duplicate N. However, it's better to avoid duplicates unless necessary because it might confuse.

 But ""SNOWY"": S at position 1, N at position 2, O at position 3, W at position 4, Y at position 5. This tests S, N, O, W, Y.

 Note: We already know N is present, so we are testing it again? Actually, we know there's an N but we are testing at position 2. If we get a (-) for N then we know position 2 is not correct, and if we get a (x) for N? That would be inconsistent because we know N is in the word? But note: if the word has only one N and we put it in position 2, then we might get:

   ✓ if correct
   - if it is in the word but not in position 2 and we haven't guessed another N? Wait, no. The feedback for each letter is independent. But if the secret has two Ns, then we could still get a (-) for N if one is in the word elsewhere? Let me clarify:

 Actually, the feedback does not account for multiple occurrences unless they are in the secret. For example, if the secret has two Ns, then each N in the guess is compared to the occurrences.

 But in our case, since we know from the first guess that there is at least one N, then in the second guess, if we put N in position 2 and if that position is wrong but there's another N elsewhere, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. Let me recall the rules:

   ✓: correct letter and position.
   -: the letter is in the word but not in this position (and also note: if the secret has multiple, then each guess letter is matched with a secret occurrence that hasn't been matched yet).

 So if we put an N in position 2, and the secret N is at, say, position 1, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: wait, the secret has an N at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would get a (-) if there is an N at position 1? Actually, no: because the N in the secret at position 1 hasn't been matched to a guess yet? Actually, the feedback goes by:

   First, check for exact matches (position and letter): then remove those. Then for the rest, match letters that are present but not in the right position.

 So if we guess N at position 2 and the secret has an N at position 1 (and no other N), then the N at position 2 would be compared to the secret N at position 1? But it's not matched because the position is different? Actually, it would get a '-' because the letter is present but not in that position? However, the secret N at position 1 hasn't been matched exactly? Then the guess's N at position 2 would match the secret N at position 1? Only if the secret N at position1 hasn't been matched? Actually, the algorithm goes:

   Step 1: Check for exact matches in each position. Then mark those as ✓ and remove both the secret letter and the guess letter for that position for the next step.

   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters, check if they appear in the secret in a position that hasn't been matched? Then mark as - if found.

 Therefore, if the secret has N at position 1 and we guess N at position 2:

   Step 1: position 1: secret has N, guess has (say) S -> no match? 
            position 2: guess has N, secret has some other letter -> not an exact match.

   Then step 2: for the guess at position 1: is S in the secret? ... but we're concerned about the N.

   For the guess at position 2: N is in the secret? We have the secret N at position 1 still available -> so we mark guess N at position 2 as '-'.

 Therefore, if we put N in a position that is not the correct one, we will get a '-'.

 We already have one N that we know is not at position 4. So we can test another position.

 Since we don't know if there are multiple Ns, it's safe to include one N.

 Let's go with ""INGOT"": which has I, N, G, O, T -> N at position 2.

 Alternatively, to test more common letters, we can choose ""POINT"" but that puts N at 4 -> disallowed.

 Another idea: ""NOTCH"" -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 Good words: ""MOIST"" -> but no N.

 We must include N? Yes, because we have a clue about N.

 How about ""LOGIN"": L, O, G, I, N -> N at position 5 -> that's allowed.

 This avoids forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 ""LOGIN"": L at 1, O at 2, G at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

 This tests L, O, G, I, N -> and we have N at position 5.

 Common words: Also ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> but E is forbidden? We know E is absent (from first guess) -> so ""ONSET"" contains E -> invalid.

 So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that includes N and avoids C,R,A,E.

 I think ""INGOT"" is suitable: letters I, N, G, O, T -> none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested U or L.

 Since we want to maximize information, we can choose a word with letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

 Let's list the letters we haven't tried (excluding C,R,A,E): 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Common vowels: I, O, U -> so we should test these? Yes.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""UNTIL"": 
   U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> N at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait, we don't know if the word has U, T, I, L? So we can test.

 Alternatively, I think ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> N at position 3 -> okay. The letters D, I, G, Y are new.

 ""DINGY"" seems okay? But D and G? Not very common? Maybe.

 I think it's better to choose a word that does not have duplicate letters and covers as many common letters as possible.

 I'll pick ""NOISY"": 
   N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N at position 1 -> that's allowed? Yes, because the previous feedback only said position 4 is incorrect, but maybe N is at position 1.

 This word has N, O, I, S, Y -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 And S and Y are common.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""NOISY"".

 Alternatively, ""TUNIS"": T, U, N, I, S -> has N at position 3? T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> that's allowed because position 3 is not 4.

 But we are testing T, U, N, I, S.

 But ""TUNIS"" might be less common? So let's choose ""NOISY"".

 However, we also have to consider: we are avoiding R, A, C, E. ""NOISY"" doesn't have these.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: ""noisy"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""noisy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C**, **R**, **A**, and **E** are not in the secret word (marked ❌). These letters are excluded.
- **N** is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked ➖).

The new guess must:
- Include **N** in a position other than 4th (i.e., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoid using **C**, **R**, **A**, **E**.
- Contain 5 distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Focus on common letters: **S**, **O**, **I**, **Y** are untested and frequently used.

A suitable second guess is **NOISY**:
- **N** appears at position 1 (new position).
- Tests **O**, **I**, **S**, **Y** (new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and duplicate letters.

This guess strategically repositions **N** while probing additional common vowels/consonants.

Let me recall the rules:\n\n   ✓: correct letter and position.\n   -: the letter is in the word but not in this position (and also note: if the secret has multiple, then each guess letter is matched with a secret occurrence that hasn\'t been matched yet).\n\n So if we put an N in position 2, and the secret N is at, say, position 1, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: wait, the secret has an N at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would get a (-) if there is an N at position 1? Actually, no: because the N in the secret at position 1 hasn\'t been matched to a guess yet? Actually, the feedback goes by:\n\n   First, check for exact matches (position and letter): then remove those. Then for the rest, match letters that are present but not in the right position.\n\n So if we guess N at position 2 and the secret has an N at position 1 (and no other N), then the N at position 2 would be compared to the secret N at position 1? But it\'s not matched because the position is different? Actually, it would get a \'-\' because the letter is present but not in that position? However, the secret N at position 1 hasn\'t been matched exactly? Then the guess\'s N at position 2 would match the secret N at position 1? Only if the secret N at position1 hasn\'t been matched? Actually, the algorithm goes:\n\n   Step 1: Check for exact matches in each position. Then mark those as ✓ and remove both the secret letter and the guess letter for that position for the next step.\n\n   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters, check if they appear in the secret in a position that hasn\'t been matched? Then mark as - if found.\n\n Therefore, if the secret has N at position 1 and we guess N at position 2:\n\n   Step 1: position 1: secret has N, guess has (say) S -> no match? \n            position 2: guess has N, secret has some other letter -> not an exact match.\n\n   Then step 2: for the guess at position 1: is S in the secret? ... but we\'re concerned about the N.\n\n   For the guess at position 2: N is in the secret? We have the secret N at position 1 still available -> so we mark guess N at position 2 as \'-\'.\n\n Therefore, if we put N in a position that is not the correct one, we will get a \'-\'.\n\n We already have one N that we know is not at position 4. So we can test another position.\n\n Since we don\'t know if there are multiple Ns, it\'s safe to include one N.\n\n Let\'s go with ""INGOT"": which has I, N, G, O, T -> N at position 2.\n\n Alternatively, to test more common letters, we can choose ""POINT"" but that puts N at 4 -> disallowed.\n\n Another idea: ""NOTCH"" -> but C is forbidden. So no.\n\n Good words: ""MOIST"" -> but no N.\n\n We must include N? Yes, because we have a clue about N.\n\n How about ""LOGIN"": L, O, G, I, N -> N at position 5 -> that\'s allowed.\n\n This avoids forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.\n\n ""LOGIN"": L at 1, O at 2, G at 3, I at 4, N at 5.\n\n This tests L, O, G, I, N -> and we have N at position 5.\n\n Common words: Also ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> but E is forbidden? We know E is absent (from first guess) -> so ""ONSET"" contains E -> invalid.\n\n So we cannot use E.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word that includes N and avoids C,R,A,E.\n\n I think ""INGOT"" is suitable: letters I, N, G, O, T -> none are in the forbidden set.\n\n Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N at position 2 -> okay.\n\n But we haven\'t tested U or L.\n\n Since we want to maximize information, we can choose a word with letters that are common and that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let\'s list the letters we haven\'t tried (excluding C,R,A,E): \n   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n Common vowels: I, O, U -> so we should test these? Yes.\n\n After consideration, I\'ll go with ""UNTIL"": \n   U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> N at position 2? That\'s okay.\n\n But wait, we don\'t know if the word has U, T, I, L? So we can test.\n\n Alternatively, I think ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G -> N at position 4 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> N at position 3 -> okay. The letters D, I, G, Y are new.\n\n ""DINGY"" seems okay? But D and G? Not very common? Maybe.\n\n I think it\'s better to choose a word that does not have duplicate letters and covers as many common letters as possible.\n\n I\'ll pick ""NOISY"": \n   N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N at position 1 -> that\'s allowed? Yes, because the previous feedback only said position 4 is incorrect, but maybe N is at position 1.\n\n This word has N, O, I, S, Y -> avoids C,R,A,E.\n\n And S and Y are common.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""NOISY"".\n\n Alternatively, ""TUNIS"": T, U, N, I, S -> has N at position 3? T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> that\'s allowed because position 3 is not 4.\n\n But we are testing T, U, N, I, S.\n\n But ""TUNIS"" might be less common? So let\'s choose ""NOISY"".\n\n However, we also have to consider: we are avoiding R, A, C, E. ""NOISY"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n So let\'s go with ""NOISY"".\n\n Let me confirm the spelling: ""noisy"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, the second guess is ""noisy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- **C**, **R**, **A**, and **E** are not in the secret word (marked ❌). These letters are excluded.\n- **N** is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked ➖).\n\nThe new guess must:\n- Include **N** in a position other than 4th (i.e., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- Avoid using **C**, **R**, **A**, **E**.\n- Contain 5 distinct new letters to maximize information.\n- Focus on common letters: **S**, **O**, **I**, **Y** are untested and frequently used.\n\nA suitable second guess is **NOISY**:\n- **N** appears at position 1 (new position).\n- Tests **O**, **I**, **S**, **Y** (new letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and duplicate letters.\n\nThis guess strategically repositions **N** while probing additional common vowels/consonants.\n\n<guess>noisy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
  - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(x), I(-), S(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
  - N is again marked as present but not in the first position (since it was in position 1 in ""noisy"").
  - O, S, Y are not in the word at all (x).
  - I is in the word but not in the third position (since it was in position 3 in ""noisy"").

So, combining the information:

1. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y. (from both guesses)
2. Letters that are in the word: 
   - N (from first guess) and I (from second guess) are confirmed to be in the word.
   - We also know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess).
   - I is not in position 3 (from second guess).

We have two known letters in the word: N and I.

We must avoid using the letters: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I (since they are in the word, and we want to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.
- We should try to use other common letters to test for more information.

Available letters: We have 21 letters left (excluding the 7 we know are absent: C,R,A,E,O,S,Y). But note, we have to include N and I.

We also have constraints on the positions of N and I:
- N cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for N: positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
Possible positions for I: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is ruled out).

We should also consider that the word might have other letters that we haven't tested. We should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information from this guess, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible and also test the positions of N and I.

Let's try to think of words that have N and I and avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: 
  ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> but N is at position 2? 
    Positions: U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)
    This has I at position 4 (which is allowed) and N at position 2 (allowed). 
    Also, we test U, L, T.

But note: we don't know if U, L, T are in the word? So we can test them.

Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U, N, T, I, L -> positions: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> same as above? Actually, ""UNTIL"" is a word? Yes.

But in ""UNTIL"", N is at 2 and I at 4? That's allowed.

But we have to check if we are avoiding forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y -> yes.

Another possibility: ""BUILT"" -> but no N? We must include N.

""POINT"" -> but O is forbidden? O is out.

""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)
But wait: N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess). So invalid.

""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden and C is forbidden.

""FLING"" -> F, L, I, N, G -> positions: F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at position 4 -> invalid.

""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> N at position 4 -> invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for N.

So let's try to put N at position 2, 3, or 5.

Position 5: 
  Example: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is forbidden? E is out.

  ""TOUCH"" -> no I and has O? O is out.

  ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> no N.

  ""QUILT"" -> Q, U, I, L, T -> no N.

  ""BUILD"" -> no N.

  ""MINTY"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but Y is out? Y is absent (from second guess). So invalid.

  ""DINGY"" -> D, I, N, G, Y -> Y is out.

  ""LINGO"" -> L, I, N, G, O -> O is out.

  ""PINKY"" -> P, I, N, K, Y -> Y is out.

  ""JUMPS"" -> no I and S is out.

  ""WINCE"" -> E and C are out.

  ""HINGE"" -> E is out.

  ""TUNIC"" -> C is out.

  ""HITCH"" -> no N.

  ""WITCH"" -> no N.

  ""BENCH"" -> E and C are out.

  ""LUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""PUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""HUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""MUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""FINCH"" -> C is out.

  ""PINCH"" -> C is out.

  ""TUNED"" -> E is out.

  ""TUNER"" -> E and R are out.

  ""LINED"" -> E is out.

  ""MINED"" -> E is out.

  ""VINED"" -> E is out.

  ""WIPED"" -> E is out.

  ""BIPED"" -> E is out.

  ""TIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""FIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""HIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""WIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""MIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""SIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""TILED"" -> E is out.

  ""FILED"" -> E is out.

  ""RILED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""AILED"" -> E and A are out.

  ""OILED"" -> E and O are out.

  ""OILER"" -> E and O and R are out.

  ""OLDER"" -> O and R and E are out.

  ""OLDER"" is out.

  ""MILKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""SILKY"" -> S and Y are out.

  ""BULKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""SULKY"" -> S and Y are out.

  ""FUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""JUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""HUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""GUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""BUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""DUNGY"" -> Y is out.

  ""LUNGY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PUNGY"" -> not a word.

  ""TANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""MANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""RANGY"" -> R and A and Y are out.

  ""BANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""DINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""BINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""JINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""LINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""WINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""KINGO"" -> not common.

  ""MINIM"" -> duplicate I? M, I, N, I, M -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate in the known letters? We know only one N and one I? Not necessarily. But to avoid complexity, we can avoid duplicates for now.

  ""MINIM"" has two I's and two M's? Not good.

  ""LIMIT"" -> L, I, M, I, T -> two I's? And we don't know if I is duplicated? But we have to avoid.

  ""VIVID"" -> no N.

  ""CIVIC"" -> C is out.

  ""RADII"" -> R and A are out.

  ""TAXIS"" -> A and S are out.

  ""VALID"" -> A is out.

  ""SOLID"" -> O and S are out.

  ""TIMID"" -> T, I, M, I, D -> two I's? Avoid.

  ""RAPID"" -> R and A are out.

  ""TEPID"" -> E is out.

  ""HUMID"" -> no N.

  ""FLUID"" -> no N.

  ""LIQUID"" -> 6 letters? No, 5 letters: L, I, Q, U, I -> two I's? And Q is not very common.

  ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> no N.

  ""BUILD"" -> no N.

  ""QUILT"" -> no N.

  ""QUINT"" -> Q, U, I, N, T -> positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is at position 4 -> invalid.

  ""QUINS"" -> S is out.

  ""QUINE"" -> E is out.

  ""QUAIL"" -> A is out.

  ""EQUIP"" -> E is out.

  ""SQUIB"" -> S is out.

  ""SQUID"" -> S is out.

  ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 (allowed), I at position 4 (allowed). 
  This avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.

  So ""UNFIT"" is a candidate.

  Another: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5) -> same as above? But ""UNLIT"" is a word? Yes.

  ""UNLIT"" and ""UNFIT"" are both candidates.

  Also, ""UNTIL"" -> U, N, T, I, L -> positions: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> same.

  But ""UNTIL"" is more common? 

  However, note that in ""UNTIL"", the I is at position 4 and N at 2.

  We can also consider ""UNWIT"" -> U, N, W, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), W(3), I(4), T(5) -> also valid.

  ""UNWIT"" is a word? It means lacking wit? Or unwitting? Not common.

  ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> but E is out.

  ""INPUT"" -> I, N, P, U, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5) -> but I is at position 1? We don't have a constraint against I at position 1? Actually, we only know I is not at position 3. So position 1 is allowed.

  But in ""INPUT"", N is at position 2? That's allowed.

  However, we have to check: if we put I at position 1, and if the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a - or x? But we know I is in the word, so if not at 1, then we get a -.

  ""INPUT"" is a common word? Yes.

  But let's see the letters: I, N, P, U, T -> all new and not forbidden.

  This tests I at position 1 and N at position 2.

  We also test P, U, T.

  This is a good candidate.

  Another candidate: ""UNITY"" -> but Y is out.

  ""UNPIN"" -> U, N, P, I, N -> duplicate N? We don't know if the word has two Ns? But we are not sure. Also, we have I at position 4? Positions: U(1), N(2), P(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we have two Ns? And we are testing N at position 2 and 5? We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. This might be acceptable, but it uses duplicate and we might not get as much information.

  We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

  So ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" are good.

  Let me compare:
    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)
    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)

  Both test 5 new letters and avoid duplicates.

  We know that I is in the word and not at position 3. In ""INPUT"", we test I at position 1. In ""UNFIT"", we test I at position 4.

  We also know N is in the word and not at position 1 or 4. In both, N is at position 2.

  We can choose either.

  But note: if we choose ""INPUT"", we are testing I at position 1 and N at position 2. If the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓ for I. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.

  In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 and I at position 4.

  Since we have no information about position 1, it might be good to test a new letter at position 1? In ""INPUT"", position 1 is I (which we know is in the word) and in ""UNFIT"", position 1 is U (which we don't know).

  Testing a new letter at position 1 might be better? Because if we get a ✓ for U, we know U is in the word and at position 1. If we get a x, we know U is not in the word. If we get a -, we know U is in the word but not at position 1.

  Similarly, in ""INPUT"", if we put I at position 1, we might get:
    ✓: then I is at position 1.
    -: then I is in the word but not at position 1 (so we know it must be at 2,4,5? but we have N at 2, so if I is at 2? but we have N at 2? That position is taken by N. So I cannot be at 2? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We have I and N both in the word, but they can be in different positions.

  Actually, in ""INPUT"", position 2 is N, so if I is at position 1, then we know I is at 1 and N at 2? But we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

  But if we get a - for I at position 1, then we know I is not at 1, but we don't know where it is? Then we have to find it in positions 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by N and position 3 is P? But the secret word might have I at position 4 or 5? Or even at 3? But we know I is not at 3? From the second guess? Wait, the second guess had I at position 3 and got a -, meaning I is not at position 3. So I can be at 1,2,4,5? But in ""INPUT"", we are testing I at 1 and N at 2. So if I is not at 1, then it must be at 4 or 5? Because 2 is taken by N and 3 is not allowed for I.

  So if we get a - for I in ""INPUT"", then we know I is at 4 or 5.

  Similarly, in ""UNFIT"", we test I at 4. If we get a ✓, then I is at 4. If we get a -, then I is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 5? But 2 is taken by N? So 1 or 5? And we know it's not at 3.

  But note: in ""UNFIT"", position 2 is N, so I cannot be at 2? Because one letter per position? So if I is in the word, it must be at 1,3,4,5? But 3 is ruled out? So 1,4,5. And if we test 4 and get a -, then it must be at 1 or 5.

  So both are similar.

  However, we also test other letters: in ""INPUT"" we test P and U, in ""UNFIT"" we test F and U.

  P and F are both common? P is more common? But F is also common.

  I think both are acceptable.

  Let me choose ""INPUT"" because it's a very common word.

  But wait: in ""INPUT"", we have U at position 4? And in ""UNFIT"", we have U at position 1? We don't have a constraint on U.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNWIND"" -> 6 letters? No.

  ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.

  ""DELVE"" -> E is out.

  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice.

  But let's check: we are on the third guess, and we have two known letters. We want to find the positions.

  Another candidate: ""PINOT"" -> but O is out.

  ""LINUX"" -> L, I, N, U, X -> positions: L(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), X(5) -> this has I at position 2? We don't have a constraint against I at 2? Only that it's not at 3. And N at position 3? We know N is not at 1 or 4, but 3 is allowed? Yes.

  This tests L, I, N, U, X.

  But X is not very common? And we avoid if there are better.

  ""MINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""DINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""TINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PITHY"" -> Y is out.

  ""NIGHT"" -> N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> but N at position 1? We know from the second guess that N is not at position 1 (because in ""noisy"", N at 1 got a -). So we cannot put N at position 1.

  Therefore, ""NIGHT"" is invalid.

  Similarly, ""LIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""FIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""MIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""RIGHT"" -> R is out.

  ""SIGHT"" -> S is out.

  ""TIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""BIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""WIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""HIGHT"" -> not common.

  ""DIGHT"" -> not common.

  ""PINKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""FUNGI"" -> F, U, N, G, I -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5) -> N at position 3 (allowed), I at position 5 (allowed). This tests F, U, G, and we have N and I.

  ""FUNGI"" is a word? Yes.

  This is also a candidate.

  Now we have:
    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)
    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)
    ""FUNGI"": F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5)
    ""UNLIT"": U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)

  We can choose any.

  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice because it tests I at position 1 and N at position 2, and we get information about the beginning.

  But note: if the secret word has I at position 1, then we get a ✓ for I and we know the first letter. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.

  Alternatively, if we choose ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3 and I at position 5.

  Since we have more constraints on N (not 1, not 4), and we haven't tested position 3 for N, it might be good to test position 3.

  Similarly, for I, we haven't tested position 5.

  So ""FUNGI"" might be better for testing new positions.

  But we also want to test common letters? P, T, F, G, L, U.

  T is very common, so ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" test T.

  G is also common.

  I think both are fine.

  Let me choose ""FUNGI"" to test N at position 3 and I at position 5.

  But note: in ""FUNGI"", we have G at position 4? We don't have a constraint on G.

  Also, we test F and U.

  So I'll go with ""FUNGI"".

  But wait: is ""FUNGI"" a common word? It might be, but ""INPUT"" is more common.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNLIT"" to test L and T.

  I think I'll go with ""INPUT"" because it's a very standard word.

  But let's see the feedback we might get:

  Suppose the secret word is, for example, ""UNLIT"" (which is a candidate). Then if we guess ""INPUT"":
    I at 1: secret has U at 1 -> not I -> so if I is in the word but not at 1, we get a -? But wait, the secret ""UNLIT"" has I at position 4? So for I at 1: we get a - (because I is in the word but not at 1).
    N at 2: secret has N at 2 -> ✓.
    P at 3: secret has L at 3 -> not P -> and P is not in the word? So x.
    U at 4: secret has I at 4 -> not U -> and U is in the secret? Secret has U at 1 -> so U is in the word but not at 4 -> -.
    T at 5: secret has T at 5 -> ✓.

  So feedback: I(-), N(✓), P(x), U(-), T(✓)

  Then we know: 
    N is at position 2, T is at position 5.
    I is in the word but not at 1 -> so must be at 4 (since 2 and 5 are taken, and 3 is not allowed for I? But 3 is not tested? Actually, we know I cannot be at 3 from the second guess. So I must be at 4? But position 4 is U in our guess? And we got a - for U? That means U is in the word but not at 4. And we have I at 4? But we don't know the secret's position 4. Actually, the secret has I at 4? Then why did we get a - for I at 1? Because I is at 4? And we got a - for U at 4? Because U is at 1? 

  This might be a bit messy.

  Alternatively, if we guess ""UNFIT"" for the secret ""UNLIT"":
    U at 1: ✓
    N at 2: ✓
    F at 3: secret has L -> x (if F is not in the word)
    I at 4: secret has I at 4? -> ✓
    T at 5: ✓

  Then we get: U(✓), N(✓), F(x), I(✓), T(✓) -> so we have 4 correct and one wrong. Then we know the word is U, N, ?, I, T and the missing letter is not F. Then we can guess ""UNLIT"" or ""UNWIT"", etc.

  But we don't know the secret is ""UNLIT"".

  Given the time, I think ""UNFIT"" is a good choice because it tests U at 1 and I at 4, and we avoid the known constraints.

  But note: we have to avoid position 3 for I? Yes, but in ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is allowed.

  I'll go with ""UNFIT"".

  However, let's see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at position 3 got a -, so I is not at 3. In ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is fine.

  So guess: ""UNFIT""

  But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes.

  Alternatively, to test more positions for N: we haven't tested position 3 or 5 for N. In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 again? We already know N is not at 1 and not at 4, and we are testing position 2. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's at 2. If we get a -, then we know N is not at 2, so it must be at 3 or 5.

  That is valuable.

  In ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3.

  In ""INPUT"", we test N at position 2.

  In ""UNLIT"", we test N at position 2.

  So if we want to test a new position for N, we should choose a word with N at position 3 or 5.

  Position 5: 
    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.
    ""LOGIN"" -> L, O, G, I, N -> O is out.
    ""TOUCH"" -> O and C are out.
    ""HUMAN"" -> A is out.
    ""WOMAN"" -> O and A are out.
    ""GUILD"" -> no N at 5? It has D at 5.
    ""BUILD"" -> no N.
    ""QUILT"" -> no N.
    ""TUMOR"" -> O and R are out.
    ""DEMON"" -> E and O are out.
    ""LEMON"" -> E and O are out.
    ""VENOM"" -> E and O are out.
    ""CANON"" -> C and A and O are out.
    ""RADON"" -> R and A and O are out.
    ""WAGON"" -> A and O are out.
    ""BEGUN"" -> E is out.
    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.
    ""BISON"" -> O and S are out? S is out.
    ""VISON"" -> not common.
    ""PINON"" -> O is out.
    ""LINEN"" -> E is out.
    ""MINIM"" -> duplicate.
    ""TONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""IONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""SONIC"" -> O and S and C are out.
    ""CONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""BONUS"" -> O and S are out.
    ""DONUT"" -> O is out.
    ""BONUS"" -> out.
    ""GENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""VENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""MENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""PENIS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""IRONY"" -> O and Y are out.
    ""IRONS"" -> O and S are out.
    ""URINE"" -> E is out.
    ""TRINE"" -> E and R are out.
    ""PRION"" -> O is out.
    ""ORION"" -> O is out.
    ""OCTAN"" -> O and C are out.
    ""ADMIN"" -> A is out.
    ""TOPAZ"" -> O is out.
    ""MUSIC"" -> S and C are out.
    ""MUCIN"" -> M, U, C, I, N -> C is out.
    ""LUPIN"" -> L, U, P, I, N -> positions: L(1), U(2), P(3), I(4), N(5) -> this is valid? N at position 5. And avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.

  ""LUPIN"" is a word? Yes, a flower.

  This tests L, U, P, I, N -> with I at position 4 and N at position 5.

  This is a good candidate.

  But we are testing L, U, P, and we already have I and N.

  We can choose ""LUPIN"".

  However, we haven't tested position 3 for N? In ""LUPIN"", N is at 5.

  We can also consider ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  After careful thought, I think it's better to test a new position for N. Since we know it's not at 1 or 4, we should test either 2, 3, or 5. We haven't tested 3 or 5 yet. In the first guess, N was at 4 (not allowed), in the second guess at 1 (not allowed). So we should test 2, 3, or 5.

  We tested 2 in the second guess? In ""noisy"", N was at 1, not at 2. In the second guess, we had N at 1 and got a -, so we know it's not at 1. We haven't tested position 2 for N yet? In ""noisy"", we had N at 1, not at 2.

  So position 2 is still untested for N.

  Therefore, testing position 2 for N is also new.

  So any of positions 2,3,5 is new.

  I think I'll go with ""UNFIT"" to test position 2 for N and position 4 for I.

  So the guess is ""UNFIT"".

  But to have a clear mind, let's list the constraints again:

  Secret word contains: 
    N (not at position 1 or 4)
    I (not at position 3)

  And does not contain: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.

  ""UNFIT"": 
    U at 1: if U is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if U is in the word but not at 1, then -; if U is not in the word, then x.
    N at 2: if N is at 2, then ✓; if not, then - (because we know N is in the word) -> unless there's a duplicate? But if there's a duplicate, then it might be complicated? But we assume no duplicate for now.
    F at 3: if F is in the word and at 3, then ✓; if in the word but not at 3, then -; if not in the word, then x.
    I at 4: if I is at 4, then ✓; if not, then - (because I is in the word) -> but if not at 4, then I must be at 1,2, or 5? But position 2 is N in this guess, so in the secret, position 2 might be something else? So I could be at 1,5 or even 2 if the secret has two I's? But we don't know. But we know I is not at 3.
    T at 5: similarly.

  This guess will give us information about U, F, T, and the positions of N and I.

  Therefore, I choose ""UNFIT"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 4).
- **Guess 2 (NOISY)**: O, S, Y ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 1); I ➖ (present but not in position 3).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**: 
   - **N** is in the word (not in positions 1 or 4).
   - **I** is in the word (not in position 3).
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y (excluded from new guess).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
   - I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include N and I**: Test new positions for both (N not in 1/4, I not in 3).
- **Test New Common Letters**: Use untried letters (e.g., U, F, T) to maximize information.
- **Avoid Duplicates**: No repeated letters to cover more ground.
- **Valid Word**: ""UNFIT"" fits all constraints:
  - N at position 2 (new position to test).
  - I at position 4 (new position to test).
  - Uses U, F, T (untested common letters).
  - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, O, S, Y).

This guess will clarify:
- Positions of N and I.
- Presence of U, F, T.

<guess>unfit</guess>",unfit,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
  - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(x), I(-), S(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
  - N is again marked as present but not in the first position (since it was in position 1 in ""noisy"").
  - O, S, Y are not in the word at all (x).
  - I is in the word but not in the third position (since it was in position 3 in ""noisy"").

So, combining the information:

1. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y. (from both guesses)
2. Letters that are in the word: 
   - N (from first guess) and I (from second guess) are confirmed to be in the word.
   - We also know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess).
   - I is not in position 3 (from second guess).

We have two known letters in the word: N and I.

We must avoid using the letters: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I (since they are in the word, and we want to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.
- We should try to use other common letters to test for more information.

Available letters: We have 21 letters left (excluding the 7 we know are absent: C,R,A,E,O,S,Y). But note, we have to include N and I.

We also have constraints on the positions of N and I:
- N cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for N: positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
Possible positions for I: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is ruled out).

We should also consider that the word might have other letters that we haven't tested. We should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information from this guess, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible and also test the positions of N and I.

Let's try to think of words that have N and I and avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: 
  ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> but N is at position 2? 
    Positions: U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)
    This has I at position 4 (which is allowed) and N at position 2 (allowed). 
    Also, we test U, L, T.

But note: we don't know if U, L, T are in the word? So we can test them.

Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U, N, T, I, L -> positions: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> same as above? Actually, ""UNTIL"" is a word? Yes.

But in ""UNTIL"", N is at 2 and I at 4? That's allowed.

But we have to check if we are avoiding forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y -> yes.

Another possibility: ""BUILT"" -> but no N? We must include N.

""POINT"" -> but O is forbidden? O is out.

""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)
But wait: N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess). So invalid.

""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden and C is forbidden.

""FLING"" -> F, L, I, N, G -> positions: F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at position 4 -> invalid.

""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> N at position 4 -> invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for N.

So let's try to put N at position 2, 3, or 5.

Position 5: 
  Example: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is forbidden? E is out.

  ""TOUCH"" -> no I and has O? O is out.

  ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> no N.

  ""QUILT"" -> Q, U, I, L, T -> no N.

  ""BUILD"" -> no N.

  ""MINTY"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but Y is out? Y is absent (from second guess). So invalid.

  ""DINGY"" -> D, I, N, G, Y -> Y is out.

  ""LINGO"" -> L, I, N, G, O -> O is out.

  ""PINKY"" -> P, I, N, K, Y -> Y is out.

  ""JUMPS"" -> no I and S is out.

  ""WINCE"" -> E and C are out.

  ""HINGE"" -> E is out.

  ""TUNIC"" -> C is out.

  ""BUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""DITCH"" -> no N.

  ""PITCH"" -> no N.

  ""HITCH"" -> no N.

  ""WITCH"" -> no N.

  ""BENCH"" -> E and C are out.

  ""LUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""PUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""HUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""MUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""FINCH"" -> C is out.

  ""PINCH"" -> C is out.

  ""TUNED"" -> E is out.

  ""TUNER"" -> E and R are out.

  ""LINED"" -> E is out.

  ""MINED"" -> E is out.

  ""VINED"" -> E is out.

  ""WIPED"" -> E is out.

  ""BIPED"" -> E is out.

  ""TIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""FIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""HIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""WIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""MIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""SIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""TILED"" -> E is out.

  ""FILED"" -> E is out.

  ""RILED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""AILED"" -> E and A are out.

  ""OILED"" -> E and O are out.

  ""OILER"" -> E and O and R are out.

  ""OLDER"" -> O and R and E are out.

  ""OLDER"" is out.

  ""MILKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""SILKY"" -> S and Y are out.

  ""BULKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""SULKY"" -> S and Y are out.

  ""FUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""JUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""HUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""GUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""BUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""DUNGY"" -> Y is out.

  ""LUNGY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PUNGY"" -> not a word.

  ""TANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""MANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""RANGY"" -> R and A and Y are out.

  ""BANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""DINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""BINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""JINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""LINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""WINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""KINGO"" -> not common.

  ""MINIM"" -> duplicate I? M, I, N, I, M -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate in the known letters? We know only one N and one I? Not necessarily. But to avoid complexity, we can avoid duplicates for now.

  ""MINIM"" has two I's and two M's? Not good.

  ""LIMIT"" -> L, I, M, I, T -> two I's? And we don't know if I is duplicated? But we have to avoid.

  ""VIVID"" -> no N.

  ""CIVIC"" -> C is out.

  ""RADII"" -> R and A are out.

  ""TAXIS"" -> A and S are out.

  ""VALID"" -> A is out.

  ""SOLID"" -> O and S are out.

  ""TIMID"" -> T, I, M, I, D -> two I's? Avoid.

  ""RAPID"" -> R and A are out.

  ""TEPID"" -> E is out.

  ""HUMID"" -> no N.

  ""FLUID"" -> no N.

  ""LIQUID"" -> 6 letters? No, 5 letters: L, I, Q, U, I -> two I's? And Q is not very common.

  ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> no N.

  ""BUILD"" -> no N.

  ""QUILT"" -> no N.

  ""QUINT"" -> Q, U, I, N, T -> positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is at position 4 -> invalid.

  ""QUINS"" -> S is out.

  ""QUINE"" -> E is out.

  ""QUAIL"" -> A is out.

  ""EQUIP"" -> E is out.

  ""SQUIB"" -> S is out.

  ""SQUID"" -> S is out.

  ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 (allowed), I at position 4 (allowed). 
  This avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.

  So ""UNFIT"" is a candidate.

  Another: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5) -> same as above? But ""UNLIT"" is a word? Yes.

  ""UNLIT"" and ""UNFIT"" are both candidates.

  Also, ""UNTIL"" -> U, N, T, I, L -> positions: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> same.

  But ""UNTIL"" is more common? 

  However, note that in ""UNTIL"", the I is at position 4 and N at 2.

  We can also consider ""UNWIT"" -> U, N, W, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), W(3), I(4), T(5) -> also valid.

  ""UNWIT"" is a word? It means lacking wit? Or unwitting? Not common.

  ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> but E is out.

  ""INPUT"" -> I, N, P, U, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5) -> but I is at position 1? We don't have a constraint against I at position 1? Actually, we only know I is not at position 3. So position 1 is allowed.

  But in ""INPUT"", N is at position 2? That's allowed.

  However, we have to check: if we put I at position 1, and if the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a - or x? But we know I is in the word, so if not at 1, then we get a -.

  ""INPUT"" is a common word? Yes.

  But let's see the letters: I, N, P, U, T -> all new and not forbidden.

  This tests I at position 1 and N at position 2.

  We also test P, U, T.

  This is a good candidate.

  Another candidate: ""UNITY"" -> but Y is out.

  ""UNPIN"" -> U, N, P, I, N -> duplicate N? We don't know if the word has two Ns? But we are not sure. Also, we have I at position 4? Positions: U(1), N(2), P(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we have two Ns? And we are testing N at position 2 and 5? We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. This might be acceptable, but it uses duplicate and we might not get as much information.

  We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

  So ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" are good.

  Let me compare:
    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)
    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)

  Both test 5 new letters and avoid duplicates.

  We know that I is in the word and not at position 3. In ""INPUT"", we test I at position 1. In ""UNFIT"", we test I at position 4.

  We also know N is in the word and not at position 1 or 4. In both, N is at position 2.

  We can choose either.

  But note: if we choose ""INPUT"", we are testing I at position 1 and N at position 2. If the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓ for I. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.

  In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 and I at position 4.

  Since we have no information about position 1, it might be good to test a new letter at position 1? In ""INPUT"", position 1 is I (which we know is in the word) and in ""UNFIT"", position 1 is U (which we don't know).

  Testing a new letter at position 1 might be better? Because if we get a ✓ for U, we know U is in the word and at position 1. If we get a x, we know U is not in the word. If we get a -, we know U is in the word but not at position 1.

  Similarly, in ""INPUT"", if we put I at position 1, we might get:
    ✓: then I is at position 1.
    -: then I is in the word but not at position 1 (so we know it must be at 2,4,5? but we have N at 2, so if I is at 2? but we have N at 2? That position is taken by N. So I cannot be at 2? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We have I and N both in the word, but they can be in different positions.

  Actually, in ""INPUT"", position 2 is N, so if I is at position 1, then we know I is at 1 and N at 2? But we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

  But if we get a - for I at position 1, then we know I is not at 1, but we don't know where it is? Then we have to find it in positions 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by N and position 3 is P? But the secret word might have I at position 4 or 5? Or even at 3? But we know I is not at 3? From the second guess? Wait, the second guess had I at position 3 and got a -, meaning I is not at position 3. So I can be at 1,2,4,5? But in ""INPUT"", we are testing I at 1 and N at 2. So if I is not at 1, then it must be at 4 or 5? Because 2 is taken by N and 3 is not allowed for I.

  So if we get a - for I in ""INPUT"", then we know I is at 4 or 5.

  Similarly, in ""UNFIT"", we test I at 4. If we get a ✓, then I is at 4. If we get a -, then I is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 5? But 2 is taken by N? So 1 or 5? And we know it's not at 3.

  But note: in ""UNFIT"", position 2 is N, so I cannot be at 2? Because one letter per position? So if I is in the word, it must be at 1,3,4,5? But 3 is ruled out? So 1,4,5. And if we test 4 and get a -, then it must be at 1 or 5.

  So both are similar.

  However, we also test other letters: in ""INPUT"" we test P and U, in ""UNFIT"" we test F and U.

  P and F are both common? P is more common? But F is also common.

  I think both are acceptable.

  Let me choose ""INPUT"" because it's a very common word.

  But wait: in ""INPUT"", we have U at position 4? And in ""UNFIT"", we have U at position 1? We don't have a constraint on U.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNWIND"" -> 6 letters? No.

  ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.

  ""DELVE"" -> E is out.

  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice.

  But let's check: we are on the third guess, and we have two known letters. We want to find the positions.

  Another candidate: ""PINOT"" -> but O is out.

  ""LINUX"" -> L, I, N, U, X -> positions: L(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), X(5) -> this has I at position 2? We don't have a constraint against I at 2? Only that it's not at 3. And N at position 3? We know N is not at 1 or 4, but 3 is allowed? Yes.

  This tests L, I, N, U, X.

  But X is not very common? And we avoid if there are better.

  ""MINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""DINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""TINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PITHY"" -> Y is out.

  ""NIGHT"" -> N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> but N at position 1? We know from the second guess that N is not at position 1 (because in ""noisy"", N at 1 got a -). So we cannot put N at position 1.

  Therefore, ""NIGHT"" is invalid.

  Similarly, ""LIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""FIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""MIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""RIGHT"" -> R is out.

  ""SIGHT"" -> S is out.

  ""TIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""BIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""WIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""HIGHT"" -> not common.

  ""DIGHT"" -> not common.

  ""PINKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""FUNGI"" -> F, U, N, G, I -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5) -> N at position 3 (allowed), I at position 5 (allowed). This tests F, U, G, and we have N and I.

  ""FUNGI"" is a word? Yes.

  This is also a candidate.

  Now we have:
    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)
    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)
    ""FUNGI"": F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5)
    ""UNLIT"": U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)

  We can choose any.

  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice because it tests I at position 1 and N at position 2, and we get information about the beginning.

  But note: if the secret word has I at position 1, then we get a ✓ for I and we know the first letter. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.

  Alternatively, if we choose ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3 and I at position 5.

  Since we have more constraints on N (not 1, not 4), and we haven't tested position 3 for N, it might be good to test position 3.

  Similarly, for I, we haven't tested position 5.

  So ""FUNGI"" might be better for testing new positions.

  But we also want to test common letters? P, T, F, G, L, U.

  T is very common, so ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" test T.

  G is also common.

  I think both are fine.

  Let me choose ""FUNGI"" to test N at position 3 and I at position 5.

  But note: in ""FUNGI"", we have G at position 4? We don't have a constraint on G.

  Also, we test F and U.

  So I'll go with ""FUNGI"".

  But wait: is ""FUNGI"" a common word? It might be, but ""INPUT"" is more common.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNLIT"" to test L and T.

  I think I'll go with ""INPUT"" because it's a very standard word.

  But let's see the feedback we might get:

  Suppose the secret word is, for example, ""UNLIT"" (which is a candidate). Then if we guess ""INPUT"":
    I at 1: secret has U at 1 -> not I -> so if I is in the word but not at 1, we get a -? But wait, the secret ""UNLIT"" has I at position 4? So for I at 1: we get a - (because I is in the word but not at 1).
    N at 2: secret has N at 2 -> ✓.
    P at 3: secret has L at 3 -> not P -> and P is not in the word? So x.
    U at 4: secret has I at 4 -> not U -> and U is in the secret? Secret has U at 1 -> so U is in the word but not at 4 -> -.
    T at 5: secret has T at 5 -> ✓.

  So feedback: I(-), N(✓), P(x), U(-), T(✓)

  Then we know: 
    N is at position 2, T is at position 5.
    I is in the word but not at 1 -> so must be at 4 (since 2 and 5 are taken, and 3 is not allowed for I? But 3 is not tested? Actually, we know I cannot be at 3 from the second guess. So I must be at 4? But position 4 is U in our guess? And we got a - for U? That means U is in the word but not at 4. And we have I at 4? But we don't know the secret's position 4. Actually, the secret has I at 4? Then why did we get a - for I at 1? Because I is at 4? And we got a - for U at 4? Because U is at 1? 

  This might be a bit messy.

  Alternatively, if we guess ""UNFIT"" for the secret ""UNLIT"":
    U at 1: ✓
    N at 2: ✓
    F at 3: secret has L -> x (if F is not in the word)
    I at 4: secret has I at 4? -> ✓
    T at 5: ✓

  Then we get: U(✓), N(✓), F(x), I(✓), T(✓) -> so we have 4 correct and one wrong. Then we know the word is U, N, ?, I, T and the missing letter is not F. Then we can guess ""UNLIT"" or ""UNWIT"", etc.

  But we don't know the secret is ""UNLIT"".

  Given the time, I think ""UNFIT"" is a good choice because it tests U at 1 and I at 4, and we avoid the known constraints.

  But note: we have to avoid position 3 for I? Yes, but in ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is allowed.

  I'll go with ""UNFIT"".

  However, let's see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at position 3 got a -, so I is not at 3. In ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is fine.

  So guess: ""UNFIT""

  But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes.

  Alternatively, to test more positions for N: we haven't tested position 3 or 5 for N. In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 again? We already know N is not at 1 and not at 4, and we are testing position 2. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's at 2. If we get a -, then we know N is not at 2, so it must be at 3 or 5.

  That is valuable.

  In ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3.

  In ""INPUT"", we test N at position 2.

  In ""UNLIT"", we test N at position 2.

  So if we want to test a new position for N, we should choose a word with N at position 3 or 5.

  Position 5: 
    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.
    ""LOGIN"" -> L, O, G, I, N -> O is out.
    ""TOUCH"" -> O and C are out.
    ""HUMAN"" -> A is out.
    ""WOMAN"" -> O and A are out.
    ""GUILD"" -> no N at 5? It has D at 5.
    ""BUILD"" -> no N.
    ""QUILT"" -> no N.
    ""TUMOR"" -> O and R are out.
    ""DEMON"" -> E and O are out.
    ""LEMON"" -> E and O are out.
    ""VENOM"" -> E and O are out.
    ""CANON"" -> C and A and O are out.
    ""RADON"" -> R and A and O are out.
    ""WAGON"" -> A and O are out.
    ""BEGUN"" -> E is out.
    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.
    ""BISON"" -> O and S are out? S is out.
    ""VISON"" -> not common.
    ""PINON"" -> O is out.
    ""LINEN"" -> E is out.
    ""MINIM"" -> duplicate.
    ""TONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""IONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""SONIC"" -> O and S and C are out.
    ""CONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""BONUS"" -> O and S are out.
    ""DONUT"" -> O is out.
    ""BONUS"" -> out.
    ""GENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""VENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""MENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""PENIS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""IRONY"" -> O and Y are out.
    ""IRONS"" -> O and S are out.
    ""URINE"" -> E is out.
    ""TRINE"" -> E and R are out.
    ""PRION"" -> O is out.
    ""ORION"" -> O is out.
    ""OCTAN"" -> O and C are out.
    ""ADMIN"" -> A is out.
    ""TOPAZ"" -> O is out.
    ""MUSIC"" -> S and C are out.
    ""MUCIN"" -> M, U, C, I, N -> C is out.
    ""LUPIN"" -> L, U, P, I, N -> positions: L(1), U(2), P(3), I(4), N(5) -> this is valid? N at position 5. And avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.

  ""LUPIN"" is a word? Yes, a flower.

  This tests L, U, P, I, N -> with I at position 4 and N at position 5.

  This is a good candidate.

  But we are testing L, U, P, and we already have I and N.

  We can choose ""LUPIN"".

  However, we haven't tested position 3 for N? In ""LUPIN"", N is at 5.

  We can also consider ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  After careful thought, I think it's better to test a new position for N. Since we know it's not at 1 or 4, we should test either 2, 3, or 5. We haven't tested 3 or 5 yet. In the first guess, N was at 4 (not allowed), in the second guess at 1 (not allowed). So we should test 2, 3, or 5.

  We tested 2 in the second guess? In ""noisy"", N was at 1, not at 2. In the second guess, we had N at 1 and got a -, so we know it's not at 1. We haven't tested position 2 for N yet? In ""noisy"", we had N at 1, not at 2.

  So position 2 is still untested for N.

  Therefore, testing position 2 for N is also new.

  So any of positions 2,3,5 is new.

  I think I'll go with ""UNFIT"" to test position 2 for N and position 4 for I.

  So the guess is ""UNFIT"".

  But to have a clear mind, let's list the constraints again:

  Secret word contains: 
    N (not at position 1 or 4)
    I (not at position 3)

  And does not contain: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.

  ""UNFIT"": 
    U at 1: if U is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if U is in the word but not at 1, then -; if U is not in the word, then x.
    N at 2: if N is at 2, then ✓; if not, then - (because we know N is in the word) -> unless there's a duplicate? But if there's a duplicate, then it might be complicated? But we assume no duplicate for now.
    F at 3: if F is in the word and at 3, then ✓; if in the word but not at 3, then -; if not in the word, then x.
    I at 4: if I is at 4, then ✓; if not, then - (because I is in the word) -> but if not at 4, then I must be at 1,2, or 5? But position 2 is N in this guess, so in the secret, position 2 might be something else? So I could be at 1,5 or even 2 if the secret has two I's? But we don't know. But we know I is not at 3.
    T at 5: similarly.

  This guess will give us information about U, F, T, and the positions of N and I.

  Therefore, I choose ""UNFIT"".

  <guess>unfit</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 4).
- **Guess 2 (NOISY)**: O, S, Y ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 1); I ➖ (present but not in position 3).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**: 
   - **N** is in the word (not in positions 1 or 4).
   - **I** is in the word (not in position 3).
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y (excluded from new guess).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
   - I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include N and I**: Test new positions for both (N not in 1/4, I not in 3).
- **Test New Common Letters**: Use untried letters (e.g., U, F, T) to maximize information.
- **Avoid Duplicates**: No repeated letters to cover more ground.
- **Valid Word**: ""UNFIT"" fits all constraints:
  - N at position 2 (new position to test).
  - I at position 4 (new position to test).
  - Uses U, F, T (untested common letters).
  - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, O, S, Y).

This guess will clarify:
- Positions of N and I.
- Presence of U, F, T.",Guess 3: unfit -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 The feedback tells us:
   C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all (x).
   N is in the word but not in the fourth position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"", N is the fourth letter).

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the word.

 Now, we know the word has 5 letters and one of them is N (not at position 4).

 We need to make a second guess that uses the letter 'N' in a different position (so not position 4) and avoids C, R, A, E.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and avoiding repeating the same letters.

 Since N is in the word, we can try words with N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (because not 4).

 Let's think of common letters that aren't C, R, A, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

 We should also note that the word has only one N? Actually, we don't know yet. But for now, we assume it might have only one.

 A good second guess should include N in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 and try to cover other common letters.

 Let's consider possible words:

 Option: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. But note: O and I are vowels, and we haven't tested them. However, we have to avoid R, A, E (which we are) and also C (which we are). But R is already excluded? Actually, R was marked 'x' so not present.

 But wait: the feedback said R(x) meaning R is not in the word. So we must avoid R.

 Similarly, avoid C, R, A, E.

 Another idea: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T -> no N, so we can't use that because we must test the N in a different position.

 We need a word that includes N.

 Let's try ""STINK"": S, T, I, N, K -> but N is at position 4? We need to avoid position 4 for N. In ""stink"", N is the fourth letter: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). But we know N cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4.

 Therefore, we must choose a word where N is at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Example: ""LINKS"" -> L, I, N, K, S -> N is at position 3 -> okay.

 But note: we are avoiding R, C, A, E. ""LINKS"" doesn't contain these.

 Alternatively: ""MINTS"" -> M, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3.

 Also, ""SWUNG"" -> S, W, U, N, G -> N at position 4? ... no, in SWUNG: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> position 4 -> avoid.

 So let's avoid position 4.

 How about ""NOISY""? N is at position 1. That's allowed. Also, letters: N, O, I, S, Y -> avoid R, A, E, C.

 But wait, we have two vowels? That might be okay.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had A and E and they were absent. So the secret word might have other vowels (like O, I, U).

 Another option: ""TONGS"" -> T, O, N, G, S. N is at position 3 -> okay.

 But T? We haven't tested T yet. So trying T is good.

 Alternatively, ""BUNCH"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is absent (x). So avoid C -> ""BUNCH"" has C -> invalid.

 Therefore, avoid words with C, R, A, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""PINTS"" -> P, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3? P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but N is at position 3 -> okay. However, note we haven't seen if T, I, P, S are present.

   ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4) -> wait, N is at position 4 -> avoid? Yes, because feedback said N is not at position 4. So we cannot use position 4.

   ""JOINT"": same issue? J, O, I, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""INGOT"": I(1), N(2), G(3), O(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 Let me check: INGOT: I, N, G, O, T -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 This seems acceptable.

 Another common word: ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 ""HILLY"": no N -> we must include N.

 ""NOBLY"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. N at position 1 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested B, L, Y? So that is new.

 Alternatively, ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But note: we don't know if S is present? So we can test S in this guess.

 Considering the information, we want to test multiple new letters and also the letter N in a different position (not position 4).

 I'm going to choose a word that has N at position 2 and uses common letters: ""SNOWY"" is possible, but also ""SUNNY"" has duplicate N? We don't know if the word has duplicate N. However, it's better to avoid duplicates unless necessary because it might confuse.

 But ""SNOWY"": S at position 1, N at position 2, O at position 3, W at position 4, Y at position 5. This tests S, N, O, W, Y.

 Note: We already know N is present, so we are testing it again? Actually, we know there's an N but we are testing at position 2. If we get a (-) for N then we know position 2 is not correct, and if we get a (x) for N? That would be inconsistent because we know N is in the word? But note: if the word has only one N and we put it in position 2, then we might get:

   ✓ if correct
   - if it is in the word but not in position 2 and we haven't guessed another N? Wait, no. The feedback for each letter is independent. But if the secret has two Ns, then we could still get a (-) for N if one is in the word elsewhere? Let me clarify:

 Actually, the feedback does not account for multiple occurrences unless they are in the secret. For example, if the secret has two Ns, then each N in the guess is compared to the occurrences.

 But in our case, since we know from the first guess that there is at least one N, then in the second guess, if we put N in position 2 and if that position is wrong but there's another N elsewhere, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. Let me recall the rules:

   ✓: correct letter and position.
   -: the letter is in the word but not in this position (and also note: if the secret has multiple, then each guess letter is matched with a secret occurrence that hasn't been matched yet).

 So if we put an N in position 2, and the secret N is at, say, position 1, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: wait, the secret has an N at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would get a (-) if there is an N at position 1? Actually, no: because the N in the secret at position 1 hasn't been matched to a guess yet? Actually, the feedback goes by:

   First, check for exact matches (position and letter): then remove those. Then for the rest, match letters that are present but not in the right position.

 So if we guess N at position 2 and the secret has an N at position 1 (and no other N), then the N at position 2 would be compared to the secret N at position 1? But it's not matched because the position is different? Actually, it would get a '-' because the letter is present but not in that position? However, the secret N at position 1 hasn't been matched exactly? Then the guess's N at position 2 would match the secret N at position 1? Only if the secret N at position1 hasn't been matched? Actually, the algorithm goes:

   Step 1: Check for exact matches in each position. Then mark those as ✓ and remove both the secret letter and the guess letter for that position for the next step.

   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters, check if they appear in the secret in a position that hasn't been matched? Then mark as - if found.

 Therefore, if the secret has N at position 1 and we guess N at position 2:

   Step 1: position 1: secret has N, guess has (say) S -> no match? 
            position 2: guess has N, secret has some other letter -> not an exact match.

   Then step 2: for the guess at position 1: is S in the secret? ... but we're concerned about the N.

   For the guess at position 2: N is in the secret? We have the secret N at position 1 still available -> so we mark guess N at position 2 as '-'.

 Therefore, if we put N in a position that is not the correct one, we will get a '-'.

 We already have one N that we know is not at position 4. So we can test another position.

 Since we don't know if there are multiple Ns, it's safe to include one N.

 Let's go with ""INGOT"": which has I, N, G, O, T -> N at position 2.

 Alternatively, to test more common letters, we can choose ""POINT"" but that puts N at 4 -> disallowed.

 Another idea: ""NOTCH"" -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 Good words: ""MOIST"" -> but no N.

 We must include N? Yes, because we have a clue about N.

 How about ""LOGIN"": L, O, G, I, N -> N at position 5 -> that's allowed.

 This avoids forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 ""LOGIN"": L at 1, O at 2, G at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

 This tests L, O, G, I, N -> and we have N at position 5.

 Common words: Also ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> but E is forbidden? We know E is absent (from first guess) -> so ""ONSET"" contains E -> invalid.

 So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that includes N and avoids C,R,A,E.

 I think ""INGOT"" is suitable: letters I, N, G, O, T -> none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N at position 2 -> okay.

 But we haven't tested U or L.

 Since we want to maximize information, we can choose a word with letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

 Let's list the letters we haven't tried (excluding C,R,A,E): 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Common vowels: I, O, U -> so we should test these? Yes.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""UNTIL"": 
   U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> N at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait, we don't know if the word has U, T, I, L? So we can test.

 Alternatively, I think ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G -> N at position 4 -> avoid.

 How about ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> N at position 3 -> okay. The letters D, I, G, Y are new.

 ""DINGY"" seems okay? But D and G? Not very common? Maybe.

 I think it's better to choose a word that does not have duplicate letters and covers as many common letters as possible.

 I'll pick ""NOISY"": 
   N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N at position 1 -> that's allowed? Yes, because the previous feedback only said position 4 is incorrect, but maybe N is at position 1.

 This word has N, O, I, S, Y -> avoids C,R,A,E.

 And S and Y are common.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""NOISY"".

 Alternatively, ""TUNIS"": T, U, N, I, S -> has N at position 3? T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> that's allowed because position 3 is not 4.

 But we are testing T, U, N, I, S.

 But ""TUNIS"" might be less common? So let's choose ""NOISY"".

 However, we also have to consider: we are avoiding R, A, C, E. ""NOISY"" doesn't have these.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: ""noisy"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""noisy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C**, **R**, **A**, and **E** are not in the secret word (marked ❌). These letters are excluded.
- **N** is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked ➖).

The new guess must:
- Include **N** in a position other than 4th (i.e., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoid using **C**, **R**, **A**, **E**.
- Contain 5 distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Focus on common letters: **S**, **O**, **I**, **Y** are untested and frequently used.

A suitable second guess is **NOISY**:
- **N** appears at position 1 (new position).
- Tests **O**, **I**, **S**, **Y** (new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and duplicate letters.

This guess strategically repositions **N** while probing additional common vowels/consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
  - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(x), I(-), S(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
  - N is again marked as present but not in the first position (since it was in position 1 in ""noisy"").
  - O, S, Y are not in the word at all (x).
  - I is in the word but not in the third position (since it was in position 3 in ""noisy"").

So, combining the information:

1. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y. (from both guesses)
2. Letters that are in the word: 
   - N (from first guess) and I (from second guess) are confirmed to be in the word.
   - We also know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess).
   - I is not in position 3 (from second guess).

We have two known letters in the word: N and I.

We must avoid using the letters: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I (since they are in the word, and we want to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.
- We should try to use other common letters to test for more information.

Available letters: We have 21 letters left (excluding the 7 we know are absent: C,R,A,E,O,S,Y). But note, we have to include N and I.

We also have constraints on the positions of N and I:
- N cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for N: positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
Possible positions for I: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is ruled out).

We should also consider that the word might have other letters that we haven't tested. We should try to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We want to maximize the information from this guess, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible and also test the positions of N and I.

Let's try to think of words that have N and I and avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: 
  ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> but N is at position 2? 
    Positions: U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)
    This has I at position 4 (which is allowed) and N at position 2 (allowed). 
    Also, we test U, L, T.

But note: we don't know if U, L, T are in the word? So we can test them.

Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U, N, T, I, L -> positions: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> same as above? Actually, ""UNTIL"" is a word? Yes.

But in ""UNTIL"", N is at 2 and I at 4? That's allowed.

But we have to check if we are avoiding forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y -> yes.

Another possibility: ""BUILT"" -> but no N? We must include N.

""POINT"" -> but O is forbidden? O is out.

""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)
But wait: N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess). So invalid.

""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden and C is forbidden.

""FLING"" -> F, L, I, N, G -> positions: F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at position 4 -> invalid.

""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> N at position 4 -> invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for N.

So let's try to put N at position 2, 3, or 5.

Position 5: 
  Example: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is forbidden? E is out.

  ""TOUCH"" -> no I and has O? O is out.

  ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> no N.

  ""QUILT"" -> Q, U, I, L, T -> no N.

  ""BUILD"" -> no N.

  ""MINTY"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but Y is out? Y is absent (from second guess). So invalid.

  ""DINGY"" -> D, I, N, G, Y -> Y is out.

  ""LINGO"" -> L, I, N, G, O -> O is out.

  ""PINKY"" -> P, I, N, K, Y -> Y is out.

  ""JUMPS"" -> no I and S is out.

  ""WINCE"" -> E and C are out.

  ""HINGE"" -> E is out.

  ""TUNIC"" -> C is out.

  ""MUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""BUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""DITCH"" -> no N.

  ""PITCH"" -> no N.

  ""HITCH"" -> no N.

  ""WITCH"" -> no N.

  ""BENCH"" -> E and C are out.

  ""LUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""PUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""HUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""MUNCH"" -> C is out.

  ""FINCH"" -> C is out.

  ""PINCH"" -> C is out.

  ""TUNED"" -> E is out.

  ""TUNER"" -> E and R are out.

  ""LINED"" -> E is out.

  ""MINED"" -> E is out.

  ""VINED"" -> E is out.

  ""WIPED"" -> E is out.

  ""BIPED"" -> E is out.

  ""TIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""FIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""HIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""WIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""MIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""SIRED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""TILED"" -> E is out.

  ""FILED"" -> E is out.

  ""RILED"" -> E and R are out.

  ""AILED"" -> E and A are out.

  ""OILED"" -> E and O are out.

  ""OILER"" -> E and O and R are out.

  ""OLDER"" -> O and R and E are out.

  ""OLDER"" is out.

  ""MILKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""SILKY"" -> S and Y are out.

  ""BULKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""SULKY"" -> S and Y are out.

  ""FUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""JUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""HUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""GUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""BUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""DUNGY"" -> Y is out.

  ""LUNGY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PUNGY"" -> not a word.

  ""TANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""MANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""RANGY"" -> R and A and Y are out.

  ""BANGY"" -> A and Y are out.

  ""DINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""BINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""JINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""LINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""WINGO"" -> O is out.

  ""KINGO"" -> not common.

  ""MINIM"" -> duplicate I? M, I, N, I, M -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate in the known letters? We know only one N and one I? Not necessarily. But to avoid complexity, we can avoid duplicates for now.

  ""MINIM"" has two I's and two M's? Not good.

  ""LIMIT"" -> L, I, M, I, T -> two I's? And we don't know if I is duplicated? But we have to avoid.

  ""VIVID"" -> no N.

  ""CIVIC"" -> C is out.

  ""RADII"" -> R and A are out.

  ""TAXIS"" -> A and S are out.

  ""VALID"" -> A is out.

  ""SOLID"" -> O and S are out.

  ""TIMID"" -> T, I, M, I, D -> two I's? Avoid.

  ""RAPID"" -> R and A are out.

  ""TEPID"" -> E is out.

  ""HUMID"" -> no N.

  ""FLUID"" -> no N.

  ""LIQUID"" -> 6 letters? No, 5 letters: L, I, Q, U, I -> two I's? And Q is not very common.

  ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> no N.

  ""BUILD"" -> no N.

  ""QUILT"" -> no N.

  ""QUINT"" -> Q, U, I, N, T -> positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is at position 4 -> invalid.

  ""QUINS"" -> S is out.

  ""QUINE"" -> E is out.

  ""QUAIL"" -> A is out.

  ""EQUIP"" -> E is out.

  ""SQUIB"" -> S is out.

  ""SQUID"" -> S is out.

  ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 (allowed), I at position 4 (allowed). 
  This avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.

  So ""UNFIT"" is a candidate.

  Another: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5) -> same as above? But ""UNLIT"" is a word? Yes.

  ""UNLIT"" and ""UNFIT"" are both candidates.

  Also, ""UNTIL"" -> U, N, T, I, L -> positions: U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> same.

  But ""UNTIL"" is more common? 

  However, note that in ""UNTIL"", the I is at position 4 and N at 2.

  We can also consider ""UNWIT"" -> U, N, W, I, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), W(3), I(4), T(5) -> also valid.

  ""UNWIT"" is a word? It means lacking wit? Or unwitting? Not common.

  ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> but E is out.

  ""INPUT"" -> I, N, P, U, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5) -> but I is at position 1? We don't have a constraint against I at position 1? Actually, we only know I is not at position 3. So position 1 is allowed.

  But in ""INPUT"", N is at position 2? That's allowed.

  However, we have to check: if we put I at position 1, and if the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a - or x? But we know I is in the word, so if not at 1, then we get a -.

  ""INPUT"" is a common word? Yes.

  But let's see the letters: I, N, P, U, T -> all new and not forbidden.

  This tests I at position 1 and N at position 2.

  We also test P, U, T.

  This is a good candidate.

  Another candidate: ""UNITY"" -> but Y is out.

  ""UNPIN"" -> U, N, P, I, N -> duplicate N? We don't know if the word has two Ns? But we are not sure. Also, we have I at position 4? Positions: U(1), N(2), P(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we have two Ns? And we are testing N at position 2 and 5? We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. This might be acceptable, but it uses duplicate and we might not get as much information.

  We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

  So ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" are good.

  Let me compare:
    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)
    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)

  Both test 5 new letters and avoid duplicates.

  We know that I is in the word and not at position 3. In ""INPUT"", we test I at position 1. In ""UNFIT"", we test I at position 4.

  We also know N is in the word and not at position 1 or 4. In both, N is at position 2.

  We can choose either.

  But note: if we choose ""INPUT"", we are testing I at position 1 and N at position 2. If the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓ for I. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.

  In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 and I at position 4.

  Since we have no information about position 1, it might be good to test a new letter at position 1? In ""INPUT"", position 1 is I (which we know is in the word) and in ""UNFIT"", position 1 is U (which we don't know).

  Testing a new letter at position 1 might be better? Because if we get a ✓ for U, we know U is in the word and at position 1. If we get a x, we know U is not in the word. If we get a -, we know U is in the word but not at position 1.

  Similarly, in ""INPUT"", if we put I at position 1, we might get:
    ✓: then I is at position 1.
    -: then I is in the word but not at position 1 (so we know it must be at 2,4,5? but we have N at 2, so if I is at 2? but we have N at 2? That position is taken by N. So I cannot be at 2? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We have I and N both in the word, but they can be in different positions.

  Actually, in ""INPUT"", position 2 is N, so if I is at position 1, then we know I is at 1 and N at 2? But we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

  But if we get a - for I at position 1, then we know I is not at 1, but we don't know where it is? Then we have to find it in positions 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by N and position 3 is P? But the secret word might have I at position 4 or 5? Or even at 3? But we know I is not at 3? From the second guess? Wait, the second guess had I at position 3 and got a -, meaning I is not at position 3. So I can be at 1,2,4,5? But in ""INPUT"", we are testing I at 1 and N at 2. So if I is not at 1, then it must be at 4 or 5? Because 2 is taken by N and 3 is not allowed for I.

  So if we get a - for I in ""INPUT"", then we know I is at 4 or 5.

  Similarly, in ""UNFIT"", we test I at 4. If we get a ✓, then I is at 4. If we get a -, then I is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 5? But 2 is taken by N? So 1 or 5? And we know it's not at 3.

  But note: in ""UNFIT"", position 2 is N, so I cannot be at 2? Because one letter per position? So if I is in the word, it must be at 1,3,4,5? But 3 is ruled out? So 1,4,5. And if we test 4 and get a -, then it must be at 1 or 5.

  So both are similar.

  However, we also test other letters: in ""INPUT"" we test P and U, in ""UNFIT"" we test F and U.

  P and F are both common? P is more common? But F is also common.

  I think both are acceptable.

  Let me choose ""INPUT"" because it's a very common word.

  But wait: in ""INPUT"", we have U at position 4? And in ""UNFIT"", we have U at position 1? We don't have a constraint on U.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNWIND"" -> 6 letters? No.

  ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.

  ""DELVE"" -> E is out.

  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice.

  But let's check: we are on the third guess, and we have two known letters. We want to find the positions.

  Another candidate: ""PINOT"" -> but O is out.

  ""LINUX"" -> L, I, N, U, X -> positions: L(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), X(5) -> this has I at position 2? We don't have a constraint against I at 2? Only that it's not at 3. And N at position 3? We know N is not at 1 or 4, but 3 is allowed? Yes.

  This tests L, I, N, U, X.

  But X is not very common? And we avoid if there are better.

  ""MINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""DINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""TINTY"" -> Y is out.

  ""PITHY"" -> Y is out.

  ""NIGHT"" -> N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> but N at position 1? We know from the second guess that N is not at position 1 (because in ""noisy"", N at 1 got a -). So we cannot put N at position 1.

  Therefore, ""NIGHT"" is invalid.

  Similarly, ""LIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""FIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""MIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""RIGHT"" -> R is out.

  ""SIGHT"" -> S is out.

  ""TIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""BIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""WIGHT"" -> no N.

  ""HIGHT"" -> not common.

  ""DIGHT"" -> not common.

  ""PINKY"" -> Y is out.

  ""FUNGI"" -> F, U, N, G, I -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5) -> N at position 3 (allowed), I at position 5 (allowed). This tests F, U, G, and we have N and I.

  ""FUNGI"" is a word? Yes.

  This is also a candidate.

  Now we have:
    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)
    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)
    ""FUNGI"": F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5)
    ""UNLIT"": U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)

  We can choose any.

  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice because it tests I at position 1 and N at position 2, and we get information about the beginning.

  But note: if the secret word has I at position 1, then we get a ✓ for I and we know the first letter. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.

  Alternatively, if we choose ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3 and I at position 5.

  Since we have more constraints on N (not 1, not 4), and we haven't tested position 3 for N, it might be good to test position 3.

  Similarly, for I, we haven't tested position 5.

  So ""FUNGI"" might be better for testing new positions.

  But we also want to test common letters? P, T, F, G, L, U.

  T is very common, so ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" test T.

  G is also common.

  I think both are fine.

  Let me choose ""FUNGI"" to test N at position 3 and I at position 5.

  But note: in ""FUNGI"", we have G at position 4? We don't have a constraint on G.

  Also, we test F and U.

  So I'll go with ""FUNGI"".

  But wait: is ""FUNGI"" a common word? It might be, but ""INPUT"" is more common.

  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNLIT"" to test L and T.

  I think I'll go with ""INPUT"" because it's a very standard word.

  But let's see the feedback we might get:

  Suppose the secret word is, for example, ""UNLIT"" (which is a candidate). Then if we guess ""INPUT"":
    I at 1: secret has U at 1 -> not I -> so if I is in the word but not at 1, we get a -? But wait, the secret ""UNLIT"" has I at position 4? So for I at 1: we get a - (because I is in the word but not at 1).
    N at 2: secret has N at 2 -> ✓.
    P at 3: secret has L at 3 -> not P -> and P is not in the word? So x.
    U at 4: secret has I at 4 -> not U -> and U is in the secret? Secret has U at 1 -> so U is in the word but not at 4 -> -.
    T at 5: secret has T at 5 -> ✓.

  So feedback: I(-), N(✓), P(x), U(-), T(✓)

  Then we know: 
    N is at position 2, T is at position 5.
    I is in the word but not at 1 -> so must be at 4 (since 2 and 5 are taken, and 3 is not allowed for I? But 3 is not tested? Actually, we know I cannot be at 3 from the second guess. So I must be at 4? But position 4 is U in our guess? And we got a - for U? That means U is in the word but not at 4. And we have I at 4? But we don't know the secret's position 4. Actually, the secret has I at 4? Then why did we get a - for I at 1? Because I is at 4? And we got a - for U at 4? Because U is at 1? 

  This might be a bit messy.

  Alternatively, if we guess ""UNFIT"" for the secret ""UNLIT"":
    U at 1: ✓
    N at 2: ✓
    F at 3: secret has L -> x (if F is not in the word)
    I at 4: secret has I at 4? -> ✓
    T at 5: ✓

  Then we get: U(✓), N(✓), F(x), I(✓), T(✓) -> so we have 4 correct and one wrong. Then we know the word is U, N, ?, I, T and the missing letter is not F. Then we can guess ""UNLIT"" or ""UNWIT"", etc.

  But we don't know the secret is ""UNLIT"".

  Given the time, I think ""UNFIT"" is a good choice because it tests U at 1 and I at 4, and we avoid the known constraints.

  But note: we have to avoid position 3 for I? Yes, but in ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is allowed.

  I'll go with ""UNFIT"".

  However, let's see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at position 3 got a -, so I is not at 3. In ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is fine.

  So guess: ""UNFIT""

  But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes.

  Alternatively, to test more positions for N: we haven't tested position 3 or 5 for N. In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 again? We already know N is not at 1 and not at 4, and we are testing position 2. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's at 2. If we get a -, then we know N is not at 2, so it must be at 3 or 5.

  That is valuable.

  In ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3.

  In ""INPUT"", we test N at position 2.

  In ""UNLIT"", we test N at position 2.

  So if we want to test a new position for N, we should choose a word with N at position 3 or 5.

  Position 5: 
    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.
    ""LOGIN"" -> L, O, G, I, N -> O is out.
    ""TOUCH"" -> O and C are out.
    ""HUMAN"" -> A is out.
    ""WOMAN"" -> O and A are out.
    ""GUILD"" -> no N at 5? It has D at 5.
    ""BUILD"" -> no N.
    ""QUILT"" -> no N.
    ""TUMOR"" -> O and R are out.
    ""DEMON"" -> E and O are out.
    ""LEMON"" -> E and O are out.
    ""VENOM"" -> E and O are out.
    ""CANON"" -> C and A and O are out.
    ""RADON"" -> R and A and O are out.
    ""WAGON"" -> A and O are out.
    ""BEGUN"" -> E is out.
    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.
    ""BISON"" -> O and S are out? S is out.
    ""VISON"" -> not common.
    ""PINON"" -> O is out.
    ""LINEN"" -> E is out.
    ""MINIM"" -> duplicate.
    ""TONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""IONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""SONIC"" -> O and S and C are out.
    ""CONIC"" -> O and C are out.
    ""BONUS"" -> O and S are out.
    ""DONUT"" -> O is out.
    ""BONUS"" -> out.
    ""GENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""VENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""MENUS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""PENIS"" -> E and S are out.
    ""IRONY"" -> O and Y are out.
    ""IRONS"" -> O and S are out.
    ""URINE"" -> E is out.
    ""TRINE"" -> E and R are out.
    ""PRION"" -> O is out.
    ""ORION"" -> O is out.
    ""OCTAN"" -> O and C are out.
    ""ADMIN"" -> A is out.
    ""TOPAZ"" -> O is out.
    ""MUSIC"" -> S and C are out.
    ""MUCIN"" -> M, U, C, I, N -> C is out.
    ""LUPIN"" -> L, U, P, I, N -> positions: L(1), U(2), P(3), I(4), N(5) -> this is valid? N at position 5. And avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.

  ""LUPIN"" is a word? Yes, a flower.

  This tests L, U, P, I, N -> with I at position 4 and N at position 5.

  This is a good candidate.

  But we are testing L, U, P, and we already have I and N.

  We can choose ""LUPIN"".

  However, we haven't tested position 3 for N? In ""LUPIN"", N is at 5.

  We can also consider ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.

  After careful thought, I think it's better to test a new position for N. Since we know it's not at 1 or 4, we should test either 2, 3, or 5. We haven't tested 3 or 5 yet. In the first guess, N was at 4 (not allowed), in the second guess at 1 (not allowed). So we should test 2, 3, or 5.

  We tested 2 in the second guess? In ""noisy"", N was at 1, not at 2. In the second guess, we had N at 1 and got a -, so we know it's not at 1. We haven't tested position 2 for N yet? In ""noisy"", we had N at 1, not at 2.

  So position 2 is still untested for N.

  Therefore, testing position 2 for N is also new.

  So any of positions 2,3,5 is new.

  I think I'll go with ""UNFIT"" to test position 2 for N and position 4 for I.

  So the guess is ""UNFIT"".

  But to have a clear mind, let's list the constraints again:

  Secret word contains: 
    N (not at position 1 or 4)
    I (not at position 3)

  And does not contain: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.

  ""UNFIT"": 
    U at 1: if U is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if U is in the word but not at 1, then -; if U is not in the word, then x.
    N at 2: if N is at 2, then ✓; if not, then - (because we know N is in the word) -> unless there's a duplicate? But if there's a duplicate, then it might be complicated? But we assume no duplicate for now.
    F at 3: if F is in the word and at 3, then ✓; if in the word but not at 3, then -; if not in the word, then x.
    I at 4: if I is at 4, then ✓; if not, then - (because I is in the word) -> but if not at 4, then I must be at 1,2, or 5? But position 2 is N in this guess, so in the secret, position 2 might be something else? So I could be at 1,5 or even 2 if the secret has two I's? But we don't know. But we know I is not at 3.
    T at 5: similarly.

  This guess will give us information about U, F, T, and the positions of N and I.

  Therefore, I choose ""UNFIT"".

  <guess>unfit</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 4).
- **Guess 2 (NOISY)**: O, S, Y ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 1); I ➖ (present but not in position 3).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**: 
   - **N** is in the word (not in positions 1 or 4).
   - **I** is in the word (not in position 3).
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y (excluded from new guess).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
   - I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include N and I**: Test new positions for both (N not in 1/4, I not in 3).
- **Test New Common Letters**: Use untried letters (e.g., U, F, T) to maximize information.
- **Avoid Duplicates**: No repeated letters to cover more ground.
- **Valid Word**: ""UNFIT"" fits all constraints:
  - N at position 2 (new position to test).
  - I at position 4 (new position to test).
  - Uses U, F, T (untested common letters).
  - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, O, S, Y).

This guess will clarify:

Actually, we don\'t know yet. But for now, we assume it might have only one.\n\n A good second guess should include N in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5 and try to cover other common letters.\n\n Let\'s consider possible words:\n\n Option: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. But note: O and I are vowels, and we haven\'t tested them. However, we have to avoid R, A, E (which we are) and also C (which we are). But R is already excluded? Actually, R was marked \'x\' so not present.\n\n But wait: the feedback said R(x) meaning R is not in the word. So we must avoid R.\n\n Similarly, avoid C, R, A, E.\n\n Another idea: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T -> no N, so we can\'t use that because we must test the N in a different position.\n\n We need a word that includes N.\n\n Let\'s try ""STINK"": S, T, I, N, K -> but N is at position 4? We need to avoid position 4 for N. In ""stink"", N is the fourth letter: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). But we know N cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word where N is at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Example: ""LINKS"" -> L, I, N, K, S -> N is at position 3 -> okay.\n\n But note: we are avoiding R, C, A, E. ""LINKS"" doesn\'t contain these.\n\n Alternatively: ""MINTS"" -> M, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3.\n\n Also, ""SWUNG"" -> S, W, U, N, G -> N at position 4? ... no, in SWUNG: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> position 4 -> avoid.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 4.\n\n How about ""NOISY""? N is at position 1. That\'s allowed. Also, letters: N, O, I, S, Y -> avoid R, A, E, C.\n\n But wait, we have two vowels? That might be okay.\n\n However, note: in the first guess, we had A and E and they were absent. So the secret word might have other vowels (like O, I, U).\n\n Another option: ""TONGS"" -> T, O, N, G, S. N is at position 3 -> okay.\n\n But T? We haven\'t tested T yet. So trying T is good.\n\n Alternatively, ""BUNCH"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is absent (x). So avoid C -> ""BUNCH"" has C -> invalid.\n\n Therefore, avoid words with C, R, A, E.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""PINTS"" -> P, I, N, T, S -> N at position 3? P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but N is at position 3 -> okay. However, note we haven\'t seen if T, I, P, S are present.\n\n   ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4) -> wait, N is at position 4 -> avoid? Yes, because feedback said N is not at position 4. So we cannot use position 4.\n\n   ""JOINT"": same issue? J, O, I, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""INGOT"": I(1), N(2), G(3), O(4), T(5) -> N at position 2 -> okay.\n\n Let me check: INGOT: I, N, G, O, T -> avoids C,R,A,E.\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n Another common word: ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N at position 4 -> avoid.\n\n ""HILLY"": no N -> we must include N.\n\n ""NOBLY"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5) -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. N at position 1 -> okay.\n\n But we haven\'t tested B, L, Y? So that is new.\n\n Alternatively, ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N at position 2 -> okay.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if S is present? So we can test S in this guess.\n\n Considering the information, we want to test multiple new letters and also the letter N in a different position (not position 4).\n\n I\'m going to choose a word that has N at position 2 and uses common letters: ""SNOWY"" is possible, but also ""SUNNY"" has duplicate N? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate N. However, it\'s better to avoid duplicates unless necessary because it might confuse.\n\n But ""SNOWY"": S at position 1, N at position 2, O at position 3, W at position 4, Y at position 5. This tests S, N, O, W, Y.\n\n Note: We already know N is present, so we are testing it again? Actually, we know there\'s an N but we are testing at position 2. If we get a (-) for N then we know position 2 is not correct, and if we get a (x) for N? That would be inconsistent because we know N is in the word? But note: if the word has only one N and we put it in position 2, then we might get:\n\n   ✓ if correct\n   - if it is in the word but not in position 2 and we haven\'t guessed another N? Wait, no. The feedback for each letter is independent. But if the secret has two Ns, then we could still get a (-) for N if one is in the word elsewhere? Let me clarify:\n\n Actually, the feedback does not account for multiple occurrences unless they are in the secret. For example, if the secret has two Ns, then each N in the guess is compared to the occurrences.\n\n But in our case, since we know from the first guess that there is at least one N, then in the second guess, if we put N in position 2 and if that position is wrong but there\'s another N elsewhere, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. Let me recall the rules:\n\n   ✓: correct letter and position.\n   -: the letter is in the word but not in this position (and also note: if the secret has multiple, then each guess letter is matched with a secret occurrence that hasn\'t been matched yet).\n\n So if we put an N in position 2, and the secret N is at, say, position 1, then we get a (-) for that N? Actually, no: wait, the secret has an N at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would get a (-) if there is an N at position 1? Actually, no: because the N in the secret at position 1 hasn\'t been matched to a guess yet? Actually, the feedback goes by:\n\n   First, check for exact matches (position and letter): then remove those. Then for the rest, match letters that are present but not in the right position.\n\n So if we guess N at position 2 and the secret has an N at position 1 (and no other N), then the N at position 2 would be compared to the secret N at position 1? But it\'s not matched because the position is different? Actually, it would get a \'-\' because the letter is present but not in that position? However, the secret N at position 1 hasn\'t been matched exactly? Then the guess\'s N at position 2 would match the secret N at position 1? Only if the secret N at position1 hasn\'t been matched? Actually, the algorithm goes:\n\n   Step 1: Check for exact matches in each position. Then mark those as ✓ and remove both the secret letter and the guess letter for that position for the next step.\n\n   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters, check if they appear in the secret in a position that hasn\'t been matched? Then mark as - if found.\n\n Therefore, if the secret has N at position 1 and we guess N at position 2:\n\n   Step 1: position 1: secret has N, guess has (say) S -> no match? \n            position 2: guess has N, secret has some other letter -> not an exact match.\n\n   Then step 2: for the guess at position 1: is S in the secret? ... but we\'re concerned about the N.\n\n   For the guess at position 2: N is in the secret? We have the secret N at position 1 still available -> so we mark guess N at position 2 as \'-\'.\n\n Therefore, if we put N in a position that is not the correct one, we will get a \'-\'.\n\n We already have one N that we know is not at position 4. So we can test another position.\n\n Since we don\'t know if there are multiple Ns, it\'s safe to include one N.\n\n Let\'s go with ""INGOT"": which has I, N, G, O, T -> N at position 2.\n\n Alternatively, to test more common letters, we can choose ""POINT"" but that puts N at 4 -> disallowed.\n\n Another idea: ""NOTCH"" -> but C is forbidden. So no.\n\n Good words: ""MOIST"" -> but no N.\n\n We must include N? Yes, because we have a clue about N.\n\n How about ""LOGIN"": L, O, G, I, N -> N at position 5 -> that\'s allowed.\n\n This avoids forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.\n\n ""LOGIN"": L at 1, O at 2, G at 3, I at 4, N at 5.\n\n This tests L, O, G, I, N -> and we have N at position 5.\n\n Common words: Also ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> but E is forbidden? We know E is absent (from first guess) -> so ""ONSET"" contains E -> invalid.\n\n So we cannot use E.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word that includes N and avoids C,R,A,E.\n\n I think ""INGOT"" is suitable: letters I, N, G, O, T -> none are in the forbidden set.\n\n Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N at position 2 -> okay.\n\n But we haven\'t tested U or L.\n\n Since we want to maximize information, we can choose a word with letters that are common and that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let\'s list the letters we haven\'t tried (excluding C,R,A,E): \n   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n Common vowels: I, O, U -> so we should test these? Yes.\n\n After consideration, I\'ll go with ""UNTIL"": \n   U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> N at position 2? That\'s okay.\n\n But wait, we don\'t know if the word has U, T, I, L? So we can test.\n\n Alternatively, I think ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G -> N at position 4 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> N at position 3 -> okay. The letters D, I, G, Y are new.\n\n ""DINGY"" seems okay? But D and G? Not very common? Maybe.\n\n I think it\'s better to choose a word that does not have duplicate letters and covers as many common letters as possible.\n\n I\'ll pick ""NOISY"": \n   N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N at position 1 -> that\'s allowed? Yes, because the previous feedback only said position 4 is incorrect, but maybe N is at position 1.\n\n This word has N, O, I, S, Y -> avoids C,R,A,E.\n\n And S and Y are common.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""NOISY"".\n\n Alternatively, ""TUNIS"": T, U, N, I, S -> has N at position 3? T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> that\'s allowed because position 3 is not 4.\n\n But we are testing T, U, N, I, S.\n\n But ""TUNIS"" might be less common? So let\'s choose ""NOISY"".\n\n However, we also have to consider: we are avoiding R, A, C, E. ""NOISY"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n So let\'s go with ""NOISY"".\n\n Let me confirm the spelling: ""noisy"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, the second guess is ""noisy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- **C**, **R**, **A**, and **E** are not in the secret word (marked ❌). These letters are excluded.\n- **N** is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked ➖).\n\nThe new guess must:\n- Include **N** in a position other than 4th (i.e., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- Avoid using **C**, **R**, **A**, **E**.\n- Contain 5 distinct new letters to maximize information.\n- Focus on common letters: **S**, **O**, **I**, **Y** are untested and frequently used.\n\nA suitable second guess is **NOISY**:\n- **N** appears at position 1 (new position).\n- Tests **O**, **I**, **S**, **Y** (new letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and duplicate letters.\n\nThis guess strategically repositions **N** while probing additional common vowels/consonants.\n\n<guess>noisy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n  - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(x), I(-), S(x), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n  - N is again marked as present but not in the first position (since it was in position 1 in ""noisy"").\n  - O, S, Y are not in the word at all (x).\n  - I is in the word but not in the third position (since it was in position 3 in ""noisy"").\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\n1.

We don\'t have a constraint against I at position 1? Actually, we only know I is not at position 3. So position 1 is allowed.\n\n  But in ""INPUT"", N is at position 2? That\'s allowed.\n\n  However, we have to check: if we put I at position 1, and if the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a - or x? But we know I is in the word, so if not at 1, then we get a -.\n\n  ""INPUT"" is a common word? Yes.\n\n  But let\'s see the letters: I, N, P, U, T -> all new and not forbidden.\n\n  This tests I at position 1 and N at position 2.\n\n  We also test P, U, T.\n\n  This is a good candidate.\n\n  Another candidate: ""UNITY"" -> but Y is out.\n\n  ""UNPIN"" -> U, N, P, I, N -> duplicate N?

We know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. This might be acceptable, but it uses duplicate and we might not get as much information.\n\n  We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.\n\n  So ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" are good.\n\n  Let me compare:\n    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)\n    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)\n\n  Both test 5 new letters and avoid duplicates.\n\n  We know that I is in the word and not at position 3. In ""INPUT"", we test I at position 1. In ""UNFIT"", we test I at position 4.\n\n  We also know N is in the word and not at position 1 or 4. In both, N is at position 2.\n\n  We can choose either.\n\n  But note: if we choose ""INPUT"", we are testing I at position 1 and N at position 2. If the secret word has I at position 1, we get a ✓ for I. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.\n\n  In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 and I at position 4.\n\n  Since we have no information about position 1, it might be good to test a new letter at position 1? In ""INPUT"", position 1 is I (which we know is in the word) and in ""UNFIT"", position 1 is U (which we don\'t know).\n\n  Testing a new letter at position 1 might be better? Because if we get a ✓ for U, we know U is in the word and at position 1. If we get a x, we know U is not in the word. If we get a -, we know U is in the word but not at position 1.\n\n  Similarly, in ""INPUT"", if we put I at position 1, we might get:\n    ✓: then I is at position 1.\n    -: then I is in the word but not at position 1 (so we know it must be at 2,4,5? but we have N at 2, so if I is at 2? but we have N at 2? That position is taken by N. So I cannot be at 2? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We have I and N both in the word, but they can be in different positions.\n\n  Actually, in ""INPUT"", position 2 is N, so if I is at position 1, then we know I is at 1 and N at 2? But we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We are testing.\n\n  But if we get a - for I at position 1, then we know I is not at 1, but we don\'t know where it is? Then we have to find it in positions 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by N and position 3 is P? But the secret word might have I at position 4 or 5? Or even at 3? But we know I is not at 3? From the second guess? Wait, the second guess had I at position 3 and got a -, meaning I is not at position 3. So I can be at 1,2,4,5? But in ""INPUT"", we are testing I at 1 and N at 2. So if I is not at 1, then it must be at 4 or 5? Because 2 is taken by N and 3 is not allowed for I.\n\n  So if we get a - for I in ""INPUT"", then we know I is at 4 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, in ""UNFIT"", we test I at 4. If we get a ✓, then I is at 4. If we get a -, then I is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2, or 5? But 2 is taken by N? So 1 or 5? And we know it\'s not at 3.\n\n  But note: in ""UNFIT"", position 2 is N, so I cannot be at 2? Because one letter per position? So if I is in the word, it must be at 1,3,4,5? But 3 is ruled out? So 1,4,5. And if we test 4 and get a -, then it must be at 1 or 5.\n\n  So both are similar.\n\n  However, we also test other letters: in ""INPUT"" we test P and U, in ""UNFIT"" we test F and U.\n\n  P and F are both common? P is more common? But F is also common.\n\n  I think both are acceptable.\n\n  Let me choose ""INPUT"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\n  But wait: in ""INPUT"", we have U at position 4? And in ""UNFIT"", we have U at position 1? We don\'t have a constraint on U.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNWIND"" -> 6 letters? No.\n\n  ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.\n\n  ""DELVE"" -> E is out.\n\n  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice.\n\n  But let\'s check: we are on the third guess, and we have two known letters. We want to find the positions.\n\n  Another candidate: ""PINOT"" -> but O is out.\n\n  ""LINUX"" -> L, I, N, U, X -> positions: L(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), X(5) -> this has I at position 2? We don\'t have a constraint against I at 2? Only that it\'s not at 3. And N at position 3? We know N is not at 1 or 4, but 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\n  This tests L, I, N, U, X.\n\n  But X is not very common? And we avoid if there are better.\n\n  ""MINTY"" -> Y is out.\n\n  ""DINTY"" -> Y is out.\n\n  ""TINTY"" -> Y is out.\n\n  ""PITHY"" -> Y is out.\n\n  ""NIGHT"" -> N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> but N at position 1? We know from the second guess that N is not at position 1 (because in ""noisy"", N at 1 got a -). So we cannot put N at position 1.\n\n  Therefore, ""NIGHT"" is invalid.\n\n  Similarly, ""LIGHT"" -> no N.\n\n  ""FIGHT"" -> no N.\n\n  ""MIGHT"" -> no N.\n\n  ""RIGHT"" -> R is out.\n\n  ""SIGHT"" -> S is out.\n\n  ""TIGHT"" -> no N.\n\n  ""BIGHT"" -> no N.\n\n  ""WIGHT"" -> no N.\n\n  ""HIGHT"" -> not common.\n\n  ""DIGHT"" -> not common.\n\n  ""PINKY"" -> Y is out.\n\n  ""FUNGI"" -> F, U, N, G, I -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5) -> N at position 3 (allowed), I at position 5 (allowed). This tests F, U, G, and we have N and I.\n\n  ""FUNGI"" is a word? Yes.\n\n  This is also a candidate.\n\n  Now we have:\n    ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5)\n    ""UNFIT"": U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5)\n    ""FUNGI"": F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5)\n    ""UNLIT"": U(1), N(2), L(3), I(4), T(5)\n\n  We can choose any.\n\n  I think ""INPUT"" is a good choice because it tests I at position 1 and N at position 2, and we get information about the beginning.\n\n  But note: if the secret word has I at position 1, then we get a ✓ for I and we know the first letter. Similarly, if N is at position 2, we get a ✓ for N.\n\n  Alternatively, if we choose ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3 and I at position 5.\n\n  Since we have more constraints on N (not 1, not 4), and we haven\'t tested position 3 for N, it might be good to test position 3.\n\n  Similarly, for I, we haven\'t tested position 5.\n\n  So ""FUNGI"" might be better for testing new positions.\n\n  But we also want to test common letters? P, T, F, G, L, U.\n\n  T is very common, so ""INPUT"" and ""UNFIT"" test T.\n\n  G is also common.\n\n  I think both are fine.\n\n  Let me choose ""FUNGI"" to test N at position 3 and I at position 5.\n\n  But note: in ""FUNGI"", we have G at position 4? We don\'t have a constraint on G.\n\n  Also, we test F and U.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""FUNGI"".\n\n  But wait: is ""FUNGI"" a common word? It might be, but ""INPUT"" is more common.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose ""UNLIT"" to test L and T.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""INPUT"" because it\'s a very standard word.\n\n  But let\'s see the feedback we might get:\n\n  Suppose the secret word is, for example, ""UNLIT"" (which is a candidate). Then if we guess ""INPUT"":\n    I at 1: secret has U at 1 -> not I -> so if I is in the word but not at 1, we get a -? But wait, the secret ""UNLIT"" has I at position 4? So for I at 1: we get a - (because I is in the word but not at 1).\n    N at 2: secret has N at 2 -> ✓.\n    P at 3: secret has L at 3 -> not P -> and P is not in the word? So x.\n    U at 4: secret has I at 4 -> not U -> and U is in the secret? Secret has U at 1 -> so U is in the word but not at 4 -> -.\n    T at 5: secret has T at 5 -> ✓.\n\n  So feedback: I(-), N(✓), P(x), U(-), T(✓)\n\n  Then we know: \n    N is at position 2, T is at position 5.\n    I is in the word but not at 1 -> so must be at 4 (since 2 and 5 are taken, and 3 is not allowed for I? But 3 is not tested? Actually, we know I cannot be at 3 from the second guess. So I must be at 4? But position 4 is U in our guess? And we got a - for U? That means U is in the word but not at 4. And we have I at 4? But we don\'t know the secret\'s position 4. Actually, the secret has I at 4? Then why did we get a - for I at 1? Because I is at 4? And we got a - for U at 4? Because U is at 1? \n\n  This might be a bit messy.\n\n  Alternatively, if we guess ""UNFIT"" for the secret ""UNLIT"":\n    U at 1: ✓\n    N at 2: ✓\n    F at 3: secret has L -> x (if F is not in the word)\n    I at 4: secret has I at 4? -> ✓\n    T at 5: ✓\n\n  Then we get: U(✓), N(✓), F(x), I(✓), T(✓) -> so we have 4 correct and one wrong. Then we know the word is U, N, ?, I, T and the missing letter is not F. Then we can guess ""UNLIT"" or ""UNWIT"", etc.\n\n  But we don\'t know the secret is ""UNLIT"".\n\n  Given the time, I think ""UNFIT"" is a good choice because it tests U at 1 and I at 4, and we avoid the known constraints.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid position 3 for I? Yes, but in ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is allowed.\n\n  I\'ll go with ""UNFIT"".\n\n  However, let\'s see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at position 3 got a -, so I is not at 3. In ""UNFIT"", I is at 4, which is fine.\n\n  So guess: ""UNFIT""\n\n  But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes.\n\n  Alternatively, to test more positions for N: we haven\'t tested position 3 or 5 for N. In ""UNFIT"", we test N at position 2 again? We already know N is not at 1 and not at 4, and we are testing position 2. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it\'s at 2. If we get a -, then we know N is not at 2, so it must be at 3 or 5.\n\n  That is valuable.\n\n  In ""FUNGI"", we test N at position 3.\n\n  In ""INPUT"", we test N at position 2.\n\n  In ""UNLIT"", we test N at position 2.\n\n  So if we want to test a new position for N, we should choose a word with N at position 3 or 5.\n\n  Position 5: \n    ""BEGIN"" -> E is out.\n    ""LOGIN"" -> L, O, G, I, N -> O is out.\n    ""TOUCH"" -> O and C are out.\n    ""HUMAN"" -> A is out.\n    ""WOMAN"" -> O and A are out.\n    ""GUILD"" -> no N at 5?

N at position 5. And avoids forbidden letters: no C,R,A,E,O,S,Y.\n\n  ""LUPIN"" is a word? Yes, a flower.\n\n  This tests L, U, P, I, N -> with I at position 4 and N at position 5.\n\n  This is a good candidate.\n\n  But we are testing L, U, P, and we already have I and N.\n\n  We can choose ""LUPIN"".\n\n  However, we haven\'t tested position 3 for N? In ""LUPIN"", N is at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""PUNKY"" -> Y is out.\n\n  After careful thought, I think it\'s better to test a new position for N. Since we know it\'s not at 1 or 4, we should test either 2, 3, or 5. We haven\'t tested 3 or 5 yet. In the first guess, N was at 4 (not allowed), in the second guess at 1 (not allowed). So we should test 2, 3, or 5.\n\n  We tested 2 in the second guess? In ""noisy"", N was at 1, not at 2. In the second guess, we had N at 1 and got a -, so we know it\'s not at 1. We haven\'t tested position 2 for N yet? In ""noisy"", we had N at 1, not at 2.\n\n  So position 2 is still untested for N.\n\n  Therefore, testing position 2 for N is also new.\n\n  So any of positions 2,3,5 is new.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""UNFIT"" to test position 2 for N and position 4 for I.\n\n  So the guess is ""UNFIT"".\n\n  But to have a clear mind, let\'s list the constraints again:\n\n  Secret word contains: \n    N (not at position 1 or 4)\n    I (not at position 3)\n\n  And does not contain: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y.\n\n  ""UNFIT"": \n    U at 1: if U is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if U is in the word but not at 1, then -; if U is not in the word, then x.\n    N at 2: if N is at 2, then ✓; if not, then - (because we know N is in the word) -> unless there\'s a duplicate? But if there\'s a duplicate, then it might be complicated? But we assume no duplicate for now.\n    F at 3: if F is in the word and at 3, then ✓; if in the word but not at 3, then -; if not in the word, then x.\n    I at 4: if I is at 4, then ✓; if not, then - (because I is in the word) -> but if not at 4, then I must be at 1,2, or 5? But position 2 is N in this guess, so in the secret, position 2 might be something else? So I could be at 1,5 or even 2 if the secret has two I\'s? But we don\'t know. But we know I is not at 3.\n    T at 5: similarly.\n\n  This guess will give us information about U, F, T, and the positions of N and I.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""UNFIT"".\n\n  <guess>unfit</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 4).\n- **Guess 2 (NOISY)**: O, S, Y ❌ (absent); N ➖ (present but not in position 1); I ➖ (present but not in position 3).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters**: \n   - **N** is in the word (not in positions 1 or 4).\n   - **I** is in the word (not in position 3).\n2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y (excluded from new guess).\n3. **Position Constraints**:\n   - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n   - I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include N and I**: Test new positions for both (N not in 1/4, I not in 3).\n- **Test New Common Letters**: Use untried letters (e.g., U, F, T) to maximize information.\n- **Avoid Duplicates**: No repeated letters to cover more ground.\n- **Valid Word**: ""UNFIT"" fits all constraints:\n  - N at position 2 (new position to test).\n  - I at position 4 (new position to test).\n  - Uses U, F, T (untested common letters).\n  - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, O, S, Y).\n\nThis guess will clarify:\n- Positions of N and I.\n- Presence of U, F, T.\n\n<guess>unfit</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(-) S(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: unfit -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: ""unfit"" -> U(✓) N(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(-)
This means:
  U at position 1 is correct (✓).
  N at position 2 is correct (✓).
  F is not in the word (x).
  I at position 4 is correct (✓).
  T is in the word but not at position 5 (since it got a ""-"").

So, the secret word has:
  Position 1: U (fixed)
  Position 2: N (fixed)
  Position 4: I (fixed)
  T is present in the word, but not at position 5.

Also, from the feedback:
  Position 5 cannot be T, and F is absent.

We know from previous feedback that the word has 5 letters, and we have three positions fixed: U at 1, N at 2, I at 4.

The remaining positions are 3 and 5.

We know T is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, T must be at position 3? Because positions 1,2,4 are fixed and position 5 is not T? So T must be at position 3.

But let's confirm:
  The word has U, N, ?, I, ?
  We know T is in the word and is not at position 5. The only positions left are 3 and 5. But we know T is not at 5, so T must be at position 3.

Then what about position 5? It must be another letter that hasn't been excluded.

Also, we know the letter T is at position 3? So the word looks like: U, N, T, I, ?

But the feedback for ""unfit"" has T at position 5 marked as '-', meaning T is in the word but not at 5. If T is at position 3, then it's present and not at 5, which is consistent.

But we haven't confirmed position 3 yet. We just inferred it must be T.

Alternatively, is it possible that T is not at position 3? What if the secret word has two T's? But we don't have any indication of duplicates. However, we can't rule it out completely. But in this case, if T is at position 3, then position 5 is unknown.

But the feedback for the letter T in ""unfit"": we guessed T at position 5 and got a '-'. So T is in the word but not at 5. Since positions 1 and 2 and 4 are fixed and not T (because position 1 is U, position 2 is N, position 4 is I), the only possibility left is position 3. Therefore, T must be at position 3.

Therefore, the word is U, N, T, I, and an unknown letter at position 5.

Now, position 5 is not F (because F is absent) and not any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y, F.

We need to find a letter for position 5 that:
  - Has not been excluded.
  - Forms a valid English word with ""U N T I ?""

Also, from previous guesses, we know the word must be a valid English word.

We have a template: U N T I ?  -> so the word is ""UNTI*"", and the last letter is unknown.

We must avoid: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y, F.

Available letters (consonants): B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: U and I are already used? The vowel available: U and I are in the word, but we can have other vowels? The only vowel we haven't tried that isn't excluded is U, I, and possibly ... wait, we excluded A, E, O. The only remaining vowel? U and I are vowels, but the last letter could be another vowel? But we have excluded A, E, O. So the last letter must be a consonant because the only potential vowel left is U or I, but they are already used? Or we can use them again? We don't know. The word can have multiple U or I? But let's see.

We have not tried: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we know that from the first guess, N was present, and in the third guess, T is present, and U and I are fixed.

What words end with ""UNTI*"" and are 5 letters?

Common words: 
  ""UNTIE"" -> but E is excluded.
  ""UNTIL"" -> L is not excluded? And we have not tried L.

But ""UNTIL"" has L at the end? And we have U at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, L at 5? This fits the pattern.

""UNTIL"" is a valid word.

We must check if L is allowed? Yes, it hasn't been excluded.

Other words:
  ""UNTIN"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIG"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIP"" -> not common.
  ""UNTIB"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTID"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIX"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIZ"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIC"" -> not a word and C is out.
  ""UNTIE"" -> E out.

Therefore, ""UNTIL"" is a strong candidate.

But are there any other possibilities? Let me think:

Words containing ""UNTI"" as the first four letters? Not many. ""UNTIL"" is the primary candidate.

Another possibility: if the word is not ""UNTIL"", then what? We know T is at position 3, so the word must be U, N, T, I, ?.

Other words: 
  ""UNITY"" -> but Y is excluded and it has Y? No, ""UNITY"" would be U, N, I, T, Y? But that's not U, N, T, I, ?. The positions wouldn't match: 
    In ""UNITY"":
      Position 1: U
      Position 2: N
      Position 3: I? But we have I at position 4? No, ""UNITY"" is U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). But we have a constraint that I cannot be at position 3? From the second guess? Guess 2: ""noisy"" had I at position 3, and feedback was I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position 3? So I cannot be at position 3? And in ""UNITY"", I is at position 3? Which would contradict the feedback? Therefore, ""UNITY"" is invalid.

  ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T, E -> but E is out and I at position 3 is forbidden.

  ""UNTIE"" -> U, N, T, I, E -> E is out.

  ""UNTIL"" works.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""UNTIL"".

We can guess ""UNTIL"" as the fourth guess.

But wait, we have 6 tries, so we can guess now.

Alternatively, we can consider if there are other possibilities? For example, the word might have duplicate letters? But nothing suggests duplicates, and in this case, with the constraints, it fits.

Moreover, the feedback for T in the third guess: we guessed T at position 5 and got a '-' (wrong position). If T is at position 3 in the secret, then it wasn't an exact match, so when we guessed T at 5, it should be marked as '-' because it's present but not at the guessed position? And the secret has T at position 3.

Then, the letter at position 5 would be L? And we haven't guessed L before? So no conflict.

Therefore, the word is ""UNTIL"".

But we must check if the previous feedback holds.

Let's validate:

Secret: U N T I L

First guess: ""crane"" -> 
  C: absent (x) -> U N T I L doesn't have C -> ok.
  R: absent (x) -> ok.
  A: absent (x) -> ok.
  N: present but not at position 4? In ""crane"", N is position 4? But in the secret, N is at position 2? So it should be marked as '-' -> matches.
  E: absent (x) -> ok.

Second guess: ""noisy"" ->
  N: present but not at position 1? In ""noisy"", N is at position 1? Secret has N at position 2 -> not position 1 -> marked as '-' -> ok.
  O: absent (x) -> no O -> ok.
  I: present but not at position 3? In ""noisy"", I is at position 3? Secret has I at position 4 -> not position 3 -> marked as '-' -> ok.
  S: absent (x) -> no S -> ok.
  Y: absent (x) -> no Y -> ok.

Third guess: ""unfit"" ->
  U: position 1 -> correct -> ✓ -> ok.
  N: position 2 -> correct -> ✓ -> ok.
  F: absent (x) -> no F -> ok.
  I: position 4 -> correct -> ✓ -> ok.
  T: present but not at position 5? In ""unfit"", T is at position 5? Secret has T at position 3 -> so present but not at 5 -> '-' -> matches.

So everything checks out.

Therefore, we guess ""UNTIL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` ❌ (absent). 
   - `N` ➖ (present but not in position 4).

2. **Guess 2 (NOISY)**:
   - `O`, `S`, `Y` ❌ (absent).
   - `N` ➖ (present but not in position 1).
   - `I` ➖ (present but not in position 3).

3. **Guess 3 (UNFIT)**:
   - `U` ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - `N` ✓ (position 2 correct).
   - `F` ❌ (absent).
   - `I` ✓ (position 4 correct).
   - `T` ➖ (present but not in position 5).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 1: `U`
  - Position 2: `N`
  - Position 4: `I`
- `T` is in the word but not in position 5 → must be in position 3 (only remaining unfixed position).
- **Excluded letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `O`, `S`, `Y`, `F` (cannot be used).
- **Remaining position**: Position 5 must be a new valid letter (not excluded).

### Reconstructed secret word:
- Positions: `U` (1), `N` (2), `T` (3), `I` (4), *?* (5).
- **Position 5 candidate**: Must form a valid English word. After testing possibilities:
  - `UNTIL` is the only common English word that fits.
  - `L` is available (not excluded).

### Validation:
- `UNTIL` adheres to all constraints:
  - `T` is in position 3 (consistent with feedback `T➖` in position 5).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.
  - Matches fixed positions: `U`, `N`, `I`.

Thus, the secret word is **UNTIL**.  
Final guess: `<guess>until</guess>`

<guess>until</guess>",until,"We have feedback from Guess 3: ""unfit"" -> U(✓) N(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(-)
This means:
  U at position 1 is correct (✓).
  N at position 2 is correct (✓).
  F is not in the word (x).
  I at position 4 is correct (✓).
  T is in the word but not at position 5 (since it got a ""-"").

So, the secret word has:
  Position 1: U (fixed)
  Position 2: N (fixed)
  Position 4: I (fixed)
  T is present in the word, but not at position 5.

Also, from the feedback:
  Position 5 cannot be T, and F is absent.

We know from previous feedback that the word has 5 letters, and we have three positions fixed: U at 1, N at 2, I at 4.

The remaining positions are 3 and 5.

We know T is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, T must be at position 3? Because positions 1,2,4 are fixed and position 5 is not T? So T must be at position 3.

But let's confirm:
  The word has U, N, ?, I, ?
  We know T is in the word and is not at position 5. The only positions left are 3 and 5. But we know T is not at 5, so T must be at position 3.

Then what about position 5? It must be another letter that hasn't been excluded.

Also, we know the letter T is at position 3? So the word looks like: U, N, T, I, ?

But the feedback for ""unfit"" has T at position 5 marked as '-', meaning T is in the word but not at 5. If T is at position 3, then it's present and not at 5, which is consistent.

But we haven't confirmed position 3 yet. We just inferred it must be T.

Alternatively, is it possible that T is not at position 3? What if the secret word has two T's? But we don't have any indication of duplicates. However, we can't rule it out completely. But in this case, if T is at position 3, then position 5 is unknown.

But the feedback for the letter T in ""unfit"": we guessed T at position 5 and got a '-'. So T is in the word but not at 5. Since positions 1 and 2 and 4 are fixed and not T (because position 1 is U, position 2 is N, position 4 is I), the only possibility left is position 3. Therefore, T must be at position 3.

Therefore, the word is U, N, T, I, and an unknown letter at position 5.

Now, position 5 is not F (because F is absent) and not any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y, F.

We need to find a letter for position 5 that:
  - Has not been excluded.
  - Forms a valid English word with ""U N T I ?""

Also, from previous guesses, we know the word must be a valid English word.

We have a template: U N T I ?  -> so the word is ""UNTI*"", and the last letter is unknown.

We must avoid: C, R, A, E, O, S, Y, F.

Available letters (consonants): B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: U and I are already used? The vowel available: U and I are in the word, but we can have other vowels? The only vowel we haven't tried that isn't excluded is U, I, and possibly ... wait, we excluded A, E, O. The only remaining vowel? U and I are vowels, but the last letter could be another vowel? But we have excluded A, E, O. So the last letter must be a consonant because the only potential vowel left is U or I, but they are already used? Or we can use them again? We don't know. The word can have multiple U or I? But let's see.

We have not tried: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we know that from the first guess, N was present, and in the third guess, T is present, and U and I are fixed.

What words end with ""UNTI*"" and are 5 letters?

Common words: 
  ""UNTIE"" -> but E is excluded.
  ""UNTIL"" -> L is not excluded? And we have not tried L.

But ""UNTIL"" has L at the end? And we have U at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, L at 5? This fits the pattern.

""UNTIL"" is a valid word.

We must check if L is allowed? Yes, it hasn't been excluded.

Other words:
  ""UNTIN"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIG"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIP"" -> not common.
  ""UNTIB"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTID"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIX"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIZ"" -> not a word.
  ""UNTIC"" -> not a word and C is out.
  ""UNTIE"" -> E out.

Therefore, ""UNTIL"" is a strong candidate.

But are there any other possibilities? Let me think:

Words containing ""UNTI"" as the first four letters? Not many. ""UNTIL"" is the primary candidate.

Another possibility: if the word is not ""UNTIL"", then what? We know T is at position 3, so the word must be U, N, T, I, ?.

Other words: 
  ""UNITY"" -> but Y is excluded and it has Y? No, ""UNITY"" would be U, N, I, T, Y? But that's not U, N, T, I, ?. The positions wouldn't match: 
    In ""UNITY"":
      Position 1: U
      Position 2: N
      Position 3: I? But we have I at position 4? No, ""UNITY"" is U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). But we have a constraint that I cannot be at position 3? From the second guess? Guess 2: ""noisy"" had I at position 3, and feedback was I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position 3? So I cannot be at position 3? And in ""UNITY"", I is at position 3? Which would contradict the feedback? Therefore, ""UNITY"" is invalid.

  ""UNITE"" -> U(1), N(2), I(3), T, E -> but E is out and I at position 3 is forbidden.

  ""UNTIE"" -> U, N, T, I, E -> E is out.

  ""UNTIL"" works.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""UNTIL"".

We can guess ""UNTIL"" as the fourth guess.

But wait, we have 6 tries, so we can guess now.

Alternatively, we can consider if there are other possibilities? For example, the word might have duplicate letters? But nothing suggests duplicates, and in this case, with the constraints, it fits.

Moreover, the feedback for T in the third guess: we guessed T at position 5 and got a '-' (wrong position). If T is at position 3 in the secret, then it wasn't an exact match, so when we guessed T at 5, it should be marked as '-' because it's present but not at the guessed position? And the secret has T at position 3.

Then, the letter at position 5 would be L? And we haven't guessed L before? So no conflict.

Therefore, the word is ""UNTIL"".

But we must check if the previous feedback holds.

Let's validate:

Secret: U N T I L

First guess: ""crane"" -> 
  C: absent (x) -> U N T I L doesn't have C -> ok.
  R: absent (x) -> ok.
  A: absent (x) -> ok.
  N: present but not at position 4? In ""crane"", N is position 4? But in the secret, N is at position 2? So it should be marked as '-' -> matches.
  E: absent (x) -> ok.

Second guess: ""noisy"" ->
  N: present but not at position 1? In ""noisy"", N is at position 1? Secret has N at position 2 -> not position 1 -> marked as '-' -> ok.
  O: absent (x) -> no O -> ok.
  I: present but not at position 3? In ""noisy"", I is at position 3? Secret has I at position 4 -> not position 3 -> marked as '-' -> ok.
  S: absent (x) -> no S -> ok.
  Y: absent (x) -> no Y -> ok.

Third guess: ""unfit"" ->
  U: position 1 -> correct -> ✓ -> ok.
  N: position 2 -> correct -> ✓ -> ok.
  F: absent (x) -> no F -> ok.
  I: position 4 -> correct -> ✓ -> ok.
  T: present but not at position 5? In ""unfit"", T is at position 5? Secret has T at position 3 -> so present but not at 5 -> '-' -> matches.

So everything checks out.

Therefore, we guess ""UNTIL"".Based on the feedback from all guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` ❌ (absent). 
   - `N` ➖ (present but not in position 4).

2. **Guess 2 (NOISY)**:
   - `O`, `S`, `Y` ❌ (absent).
   - `N` ➖ (present but not in position 1).
   - `I` ➖ (present but not in position 3).

3. **Guess 3 (UNFIT)**:
   - `U` ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - `N` ✓ (position 2 correct).
   - `F` ❌ (absent).
   - `I` ✓ (position 4 correct).
   - `T` ➖ (present but not in position 5).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 1: `U`
  - Position 2: `N`
  - Position 4: `I`
- `T` is in the word but not in position 5 → must be in position 3 (only remaining unfixed position).
- **Excluded letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `O`, `S`, `Y`, `F` (cannot be used).
- **Remaining position**: Position 5 must be a new valid letter (not excluded).

### Reconstructed secret word:
- Positions: `U` (1), `N` (2), `T` (3), `I` (4), *?* (5).
- **Position 5 candidate**: Must form a valid English word. After testing possibilities:
  - `UNTIL` is the only common English word that fits.
  - `L` is available (not excluded).

### Validation:
- `UNTIL` adheres to all constraints:
  - `T` is in position 3 (consistent with feedback `T➖` in position 5).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.
  - Matches fixed positions: `U`, `N`, `I`.

Thus, the secret word is **UNTIL**.
