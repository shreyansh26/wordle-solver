We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is correct and in the correct position (✓). That means the secret word ends with E. So the 5th letter is E.
- R is present but in the wrong position (-). So R is in the word, but not in the second position.
- C, A, N are not in the word at all (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E
- The word contains the letter R, but not in the first or second position? Actually, the R was in the second position of ""CRANE"", but since it's marked as wrong position, it cannot be in the second position. However, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth? But fifth is E, which is fixed. Also, note: if R were in the first position, that would conflict because we have C (which is not present) as the first letter. So R cannot be in the first position either? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't say anything about R being in the first position because we didn't guess R there. We only know it's not in the second position and it's somewhere else.

But note: the secret word must contain R (because of the ""-"" feedback) and it cannot be in the second position. Since the fifth position is fixed as E, R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we also know that C, A, N are absent. So the word does not contain C, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- We must include R (and it cannot be in position 2).
- We must have E in the fifth position.
- We must avoid C, A, N.

We also want to test other letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common vowels: We have E already (at the end). The absence of A suggests we might have other vowels? We don't know any other vowels yet because A is absent. So let's consider other vowels: O, I, U? Or maybe consonants.

We also note that the first letter is unknown. It might be R? But let's consider:

If we try R in the first position, that could be a good test. However, we have to form a valid word.

Possible words: Since the word ends with E, and contains R, and avoids C, A, N.

Let me brainstorm words ending in E that contain R and exclude C, A, N.

Examples: 
- ""PRICE""? But has C and I? But C is absent! So not allowed. We avoid C.
- ""DRIVE""? Has D, R, I, V, E. Avoids C, A, N. 
  - Positions: D is first, R in second? Wait, we cannot put R in second because we know R cannot be in second? But note: the feedback only said R wasn't in second in the secret word when we guessed ""CRANE"". So in ""DRIVE"", if we put R in second, that might be allowed? However, we are guessing now and we don't know the secret word's R position. But we know R cannot be in the second position? Actually, yes: from the feedback, we know R is in the word but not in the second position. So in our next guess, we can put R in first? Or third, etc.

But note: the feedback is based on the secret word. The fact that R is present but not in the second position means that for any guess, if we put R in the second, we might get a ""-"" (if the actual R is elsewhere) but if we put R elsewhere, we might get a ""✓"" if it's correct.

However, we might try a word that has R in the first position to test if it's there. Similarly, we can try words that put R in third or fourth.

We also want to cover common letters we haven't tried. So far, we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try a word that uses as many of these as possible, avoiding the ones we know are absent (C, A, N) and including R and ending with E.

Let me think of words that end with E and have R and no A, C, N.

Potential words:
- ""PRIDE"" : P, R, I, D, E -> Has R in second? But we know R can't be in second? Wait, if we guess ""PRIDE"", and the secret word has R not in second, then the R in second would get a ""-""? And if the secret word has R in third or fourth, then we might get feedback.

But note: we must avoid putting R in second? Actually, no. We can put R anywhere in our guess, but the feedback will tell us whether it's in the correct position or not.

But we know that in the secret word, R is not in the second position. So even if we guess R in second, it will never be correct for this word? So why not put R in a position we think might be correct? We have three possibilities: position 1, 3, or 4.

So I think it's better to try a word where R is in one of those positions.

Example: 
- Position 1: R_ _ _ E -> words like ""RIP E"", ""RIDE"" (has A? No: RIDE has R, I, D, E -> no A, C, N). But RIDE: R in first. 
- However, we also want to test more letters. RIDE: letters are R, I, D, E. E is already at the end.

But we haven't tested any new vowels except the E we know. So RIDE tests I and D? Not a lot of letters.

Alternatively: ""ROUTE"" -> R, O, U, T, E -> avoids C, A, N. Then:
- R in first, O in second, U in third, T in fourth, E in fifth.

But note: we know R cannot be in the second position? Actually, when we put R in the first, we are testing that position.

Similarly, O, U, T are new.

So ""ROUTE"" might be a good guess? But note that the secret word might have R in first? Then we'd get R at first as correct? Or if R is in third, then R in first would get a '-'.

But let's consider that we have R in the word and E fixed.

Another word: ""GRIME"" -> G, R, I, M, E -> avoids C, A, N.

But again, R is in the same position? In GRIME, R is in second? We know R cannot be in second? Then why put it there? The feedback for GRIME would show R as '-', and then we know it's present but not first or second? That might not be efficient.

So I think it's better to avoid putting R in the forbidden position (second) because we already know it's not there. We want to maximize our chance of getting new information.

Therefore, we should make R appear in either position 1, 3, or 4.

So let me think of words ending in E, with R in 1, 3, or 4, and without A, C, N.

Examples:
- R in first: 
  - ""RHYME"": R, H, Y, M, E -> we don't know about H, Y, M.
- R in third:
  - ""BARRE""? Ends with E? No, ""BARREL"" is 6 letters. 
  - ""FORCE""? But has C -> invalid.
  - ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> R in third -> avoids A, C, N. Good.
- R in fourth:
  - ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? Wait, that ends with D. We want E at the end? So ""TIRE E"" -> must be 5 letters? ""TIRES"" ends with S, not E. 
  - ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> R in fourth? Yes -> positions: S first, T second, O third, R fourth, E fifth. This avoids A, C, N.

So candidates: 
- ""RHYME"" (R1, H2, Y3, M4, E5)
- ""HORDE"" (H1, O2, R3, D4, E5) -> R in third
- ""STORE"" (S1, T2, O3, R4, E5) -> R in fourth

We want to test multiple common letters. Let me choose one that has common letters.

""STORE"" uses S, T, O, R, E -> R is in fourth. And we test S, T, O.

""HORDE"" tests H, O, R, D.

""RHYME"" has H, Y, M which are less common.

I think ""STORE"" is a good candidate because S, T, O are common. Also, we know that the word does not have A, C, N, so we avoid those.

But wait: if the secret word has R in the fourth position, then ""STORE"" would have R in fourth and get a ✓? If not, then R in fourth might be marked as '-'. Similarly, if we put R in third in ""HORDE"", it might be marked '-' or ✓.

But either way, we get information about R's position.

I think I'll go with ""STORE"" because it has S and T.

But note: what if the secret word has R in the first? Then with ""STORE"", R is in fourth and we get only one test? Or we might get feedback that R is not in fourth? Then we still know R is in the word but not fourth? So we'll know R must be in first? Actually, from the possibilities: R can be in 1,3,4? But after this guess, if we get R not in fourth? Then first or third.

But we are testing multiple letters.

Alternatively, we could try ""RIP E"" but ""RIPE"" is a word: R, I, P, E -> ends with E? ""RIPE"" is 4 letters? Or ""RIP E""? No, ""RIPEN"" has N? Absent. So ""RIP E"" isn't a word. Then ""RIDER"" ends with R, not E. So we need 5 letters ending with E.

Another word: ""RAISE"" -> R first, A? But A is absent! So we cannot use A.

So let's pick one.

I think ""STORE"" is a solid choice.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in fifth correct. Now, what about the vowel? We know A is absent. So the word must have other vowels: like I, O, U.

In ""STORE"": O is in third, which is a vowel.

Similarly, in ""HORDE"": O is in second.

Both are okay.

I'll go with ""STORE"". Then we can get feedback on S, T, O, R in their positions.

So second guess: STORE

We output: <guess>store</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). Therefore, the secret word ends with E.
- R is in the secret word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- It must contain the letter R, but R cannot be in the 2nd position (since it was misplaced in the first guess). R could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- It should avoid using C, A, or N.
- To gather more information, prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I) and confirm possible positions for R.

I selected ""STORE"" as the second guess because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known position).
- It places R in the 4th position (testing one of the possible spots for R).
- It includes new common letters: S, T, and O, which are frequently used in English words.
- It avoids C, A, and N.

The feedback from this guess will help narrow down the position of R and reveal the presence/absence of S, T, and O.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior information.
 We want a word that maximizes the information we get. Common starting words in Wordle include words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 A good starter word is often ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me choose one that has five distinct letters and common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

 So my first guess is: CRANEMy first guess is ""CRANE"". This word uses common letters and includes a mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which often helps gather useful information about the secret word based on the feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is correct and in the correct position (✓). That means the secret word ends with E. So the 5th letter is E.
- R is present but in the wrong position (-). So R is in the word, but not in the second position.
- C, A, N are not in the word at all (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E
- The word contains the letter R, but not in the first or second position? Actually, the R was in the second position of ""CRANE"", but since it's marked as wrong position, it cannot be in the second position. However, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth? But fifth is E, which is fixed. Also, note: if R were in the first position, that would conflict because we have C (which is not present) as the first letter. So R cannot be in the first position either? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't say anything about R being in the first position because we didn't guess R there. We only know it's not in the second position and it's somewhere else.

But note: the secret word must contain R (because of the ""-"" feedback) and it cannot be in the second position. Since the fifth position is fixed as E, R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we also know that C, A, N are absent. So the word does not contain C, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- We must include R (and it cannot be in position 2).
- We must have E in the fifth position.
- We must avoid C, A, N.

We also want to test other letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common vowels: We have E already (at the end). The absence of A suggests we might have other vowels? We don't know any other vowels yet because A is absent. So let's consider other vowels: O, I, U? Or maybe consonants.

We also note that the first letter is unknown. It might be R? But let's consider:

If we try R in the first position, that could be a good test. However, we have to form a valid word.

Possible words: Since the word ends with E, and contains R, and avoids C, A, N.

Let me brainstorm words ending in E that contain R and exclude C, A, N.

Examples: 
- ""PRICE""? But has C and I? But C is absent! So not allowed. We avoid C.
- ""DRIVE""? Has D, R, I, V, E. Avoids C, A, N. 
  - Positions: D is first, R in second? Wait, we cannot put R in second because we know R cannot be in second? But note: the feedback only said R wasn't in second in the secret word when we guessed ""CRANE"". So in ""DRIVE"", if we put R in second, that might be allowed? However, we are guessing now and we don't know the secret word's R position. But we know R cannot be in the second position? Actually, yes: from the feedback, we know R is in the word but not in the second position. So in our next guess, we can put R in first? Or third, etc.

But note: the feedback is based on the secret word. The fact that R is present but not in the second position means that for any guess, if we put R in the second, we might get a ""-"" (if the actual R is elsewhere) but if we put R elsewhere, we might get a ""✓"" if it's correct.

However, we might try a word that has R in the first position to test if it's there. Similarly, we can try words that put R in third or fourth.

We also want to cover common letters we haven't tried. So far, we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try a word that uses as many of these as possible, avoiding the ones we know are absent (C, A, N) and including R and ending with E.

Let me think of words that end with E and have R and no A, C, N.

Potential words:
- ""PRIDE"" : P, R, I, D, E -> Has R in second? But we know R can't be in second? Wait, if we guess ""PRIDE"", and the secret word has R not in second, then the R in second would get a ""-""? And if the secret word has R in third or fourth, then we might get feedback.

But note: we must avoid putting R in second? Actually, no. We can put R anywhere in our guess, but the feedback will tell us whether it's in the correct position or not.

But we know that in the secret word, R is not in the second position. So even if we guess R in second, it will never be correct for this word? So why not put R in a position we think might be correct? We have three possibilities: position 1, 3, or 4.

So I think it's better to try a word where R is in one of those positions.

Example: 
- Position 1: R_ _ _ E -> words like ""RIP E"", ""RIDE"" (has A? No: RIDE has R, I, D, E -> no A, C, N). But RIDE: R in first. 
- However, we also want to test more letters. RIDE: letters are R, I, D, E. E is already at the end.

But we haven't tested any new vowels except the E we know. So RIDE tests I and D? Not a lot of letters.

Alternatively: ""ROUTE"" -> R, O, U, T, E -> avoids C, A, N. Then:
- R in first, O in second, U in third, T in fourth, E in fifth.

But note: we know R cannot be in the second position? Actually, when we put R in the first, we are testing that position.

Similarly, O, U, T are new.

So ""ROUTE"" might be a good guess? But note that the secret word might have R in first? Then we'd get R at first as correct? Or if R is in third, then R in first would get a '-'.

But let's consider that we have R in the word and E fixed.

Another word: ""GRIME"" -> G, R, I, M, E -> avoids C, A, N.

But again, R is in the same position? In GRIME, R is in second? We know R cannot be in second? Then why put it there? The feedback for GRIME would show R as '-', and then we know it's present but not first or second? That might not be efficient.

So I think it's better to avoid putting R in the forbidden position (second) because we already know it's not there. We want to maximize our chance of getting new information.

Therefore, we should make R appear in either position 1, 3, or 4.

So let me think of words ending in E, with R in 1, 3, or 4, and without A, C, N.

Examples:
- R in first: 
  - ""RHYME"": R, H, Y, M, E -> we don't know about H, Y, M.
- R in third:
  - ""BARRE""? Ends with E? No, ""BARREL"" is 6 letters. 
  - ""FORCE""? But has C -> invalid.
  - ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> R in third -> avoids A, C, N. Good.
- R in fourth:
  - ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? Wait, that ends with D. We want E at the end? So ""TIRE E"" -> must be 5 letters? ""TIRES"" ends with S, not E. 
  - ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> R in fourth? Yes -> positions: S first, T second, O third, R fourth, E fifth. This avoids A, C, N.

So candidates: 
- ""RHYME"" (R1, H2, Y3, M4, E5)
- ""HORDE"" (H1, O2, R3, D4, E5) -> R in third
- ""STORE"" (S1, T2, O3, R4, E5) -> R in fourth

We want to test multiple common letters. Let me choose one that has common letters.

""STORE"" uses S, T, O, R, E -> R is in fourth. And we test S, T, O.

""HORDE"" tests H, O, R, D.

""RHYME"" has H, Y, M which are less common.

I think ""STORE"" is a good candidate because S, T, O are common. Also, we know that the word does not have A, C, N, so we avoid those.

But wait: if the secret word has R in the fourth position, then ""STORE"" would have R in fourth and get a ✓? If not, then R in fourth might be marked as '-'. Similarly, if we put R in third in ""HORDE"", it might be marked '-' or ✓.

But either way, we get information about R's position.

I think I'll go with ""STORE"" because it has S and T.

But note: what if the secret word has R in the first? Then with ""STORE"", R is in fourth and we get only one test? Or we might get feedback that R is not in fourth? Then we still know R is in the word but not fourth? So we'll know R must be in first? Actually, from the possibilities: R can be in 1,3,4? But after this guess, if we get R not in fourth? Then first or third.

But we are testing multiple letters.

Alternatively, we could try ""RIP E"" but ""RIPE"" is a word: R, I, P, E -> ends with E? ""RIPE"" is 4 letters? Or ""RIP E""? No, ""RIPEN"" has N? Absent. So ""RIP E"" isn't a word. Then ""RIDER"" ends with R, not E. So we need 5 letters ending with E.

Another word: ""RAISE"" -> R first, A? But A is absent! So we cannot use A.

So let's pick one.

I think ""STORE"" is a solid choice.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in fifth correct. Now, what about the vowel? We know A is absent. So the word must have other vowels: like I, O, U.

In ""STORE"": O is in third, which is a vowel.

Similarly, in ""HORDE"": O is in second.

Both are okay.

I'll go with ""STORE"". Then we can get feedback on S, T, O, R in their positions.

So second guess: STORE

We output: <guess>store</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). Therefore, the secret word ends with E.
- R is in the secret word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- It must contain the letter R, but R cannot be in the 2nd position (since it was misplaced in the first guess). R could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- It should avoid using C, A, or N.
- To gather more information, prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I) and confirm possible positions for R.

I selected ""STORE"" as the second guess because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known position).
- It places R in the 4th position (testing one of the possible spots for R).
- It includes new common letters: S, T, and O, which are frequently used in English words.
- It avoids C, A, and N.

The feedback from this guess will help narrow down the position of R and reveal the presence/absence of S, T, and O.

We are given previous feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: store -> S(x) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(✓)

Analysis of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter), so the word ends with 'E'.
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since it was in the 2nd position in ""crane"" and got (-)).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

So we know:
- The secret word ends with 'E'.
- The secret word contains 'R', but not in position 2.
- Secret word contains: R, E (and letters we don't know yet).

From Guess 2 (""store""):
- E(✓): Correct position, confirmed again.
- S(x): 'S' is not in the word.
- T(x): 'T' is not in the word.
- O(-): 'O' is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it in 3rd and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
- R(-): 'R' is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we guessed it in 4th and got a '-'). Also, note that in guess1, R was not in 2nd, and now we know it's also not in 4th.

So combining:
- R is present, but cannot be in positions 2 (from guess1) or 4 (from guess2). Since the word has 5 positions and position 5 is E, R must be in position 1 or position 3.
- O is present, so the word contains 'O'. But not in position 3 (from guess2 feedback). Since positions are: 1,2,3,4,5 and position5 is E, O can be in position 1, 2, 4? 
  - Position 5 is fixed as E, so O cannot be there.
  - O is not in 3, so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- S and T are now known to be absent.
- Additionally, from guess1, we know C, A, N are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have the format: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] E
- Contains: R, O, E
- Does not contain: C, A, N, S, T
- R must be in position 1 or 3.
- O must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

Now, let's think of possible words that fit these constraints.

First, consider the position of R:

Case 1: R in position 1 (first letter).
Then the word is: R _ _ _ E
And O is in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? But note: O cannot be in position 3 because from ""store"" feedback? Wait, no: the feedback only said O is not in position 3 in the secret word. So O might be in 1? But if R is in 1, then O cannot be in 1. So if R is in 1, O can be in 2 or 4.

But wait: the word contains O, and if R is in 1, then O must be in 2 or 4.

Similarly, the middle letter (position 3) is unknown but must not be O? Since O is not allowed in position 3.

Also, we have three positions: 2,3,4 to fill with letters including O and possibly two others.

Case 2: R in position 3.
Then the word is: _ _ R _ E
And O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we must avoid S, T, C, A, N.

Letters we haven't checked: 
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E / S, T, O, R, E -> so tested letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.

Absent: C,A,N,S,T -> so known absent letters: C,A,N,S,T.

Present: R, O, E (and at least one more because we have 5 letters? In fact, the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we have R,O,E and possibly duplicates or new letters).

We know the word must have exactly R,O,E and two more letters that are not C,A,N,S,T.

Remaining letters: many but we can try to think of common ones.

When forming a word, we must have:
- The word ends with E.
- Contains R and O.

Possible words:

First, if R in position 1: R _ _ _ E
We need to choose letters for positions 2,3,4. One of them must be O? Actually O must be present, so either in 2 or 4? Position 3 cannot be O.

So subcases:
- If O is in position 2: R O _ _ E -> so the word is RO?E? -> e.g., ROUTE? But ROUTE has T? T is absent, so invalid. ROUGH? Not ending with E? Valid words: ??? 

Examples: 
- ""ROGUE"": R,O,G,U,E -> contains G,U. Check absent letters: we avoid C,A,N,S,T -> so G,U are new and allowed? But we must confirm if they are absent? We don't know yet. So ""ROGUE"" is R in1, O in2, G in3, U in4, E in5.
- ""ROUSE"": R,O,U,S,E -> but S is absent? So invalid because of S.
- ""ROMEO"": too long? 5 letters? ""ROME"" is 4. So no.

Another: ""ROULE"": ROUL E? Is that a word? Not really, English word: ""ROUSE"" we rejected because S is absent. 

Then: ""ROUTE""? R,O,U,T,E -> but T is absent? From guess2, T not present -> so ""ROUTE"" has T -> invalid.

If O in position 4: Then word: R _ _ O E.

So letters: R, ?, ?, O, E.

Position 2 and 3 to be filled.

But O is in position 4? Then the word: e.g., ""RADIO""? But A is absent and not E. Actually, ends with E? ""RADIO"" ends with O. Doesn't end with E.

Examples: 
- ""RENEW"": But E in position4? And it has N? N is absent -> invalid.
- ""RECCE"": Not common. Also has C and C absent? Not allowed.

What about: ""REVUE""? Not standard? Or ""REUSE"" -> has S, absent. 

If R in position1 and O in position4? So word: R ? ? O E -> e.g., ""RIFLE""? R,I,F,L,E -> no O? But O must be present? So missing O? Doesn't work.

Actually, O must be placed! So if we put O in the fourth position, then we have R _ _ O E -> and the word must contain O? It is in fourth. Then we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not C,A,N,S,T and form a word.

Examples: 
- ""RHO?? E"" -> ""RHOLE""? Not a word.
- ""ROGUE"" we thought earlier? But O is in second? Not in fourth.

Wait, so perhaps O cannot be fourth if R is first? 

Alternatively, case where R is in position 3: the word is _ _ R _ E

And O must be in 1, 2, or 4? But not 3.

Now, O in position1: so O _ R _ E -> e.g., ""OIL R E"" -> ""OILRE""? Not a word. ""OUTRE""? U,T: U is new, but T is absent -> ""OUTRE"" has T? Yes -> T absent -> invalid.

O in position2: then _ O R _ E -> e.g., ""FOR E?"" -> ""FORGE"" : F,O,R,G,E -> avoids prohibited letters? Prohibited: C,A,N,S,T -> F and G are new. So ""FORGE"" could be? Yes.

O in position4: then _ _ R O E -> e.g., word: ? ? R O E -> ""PRO E?"" -> ""PROBE""! But ""PROBE"": P,R,O,B,E -> O is in position 4? Then word: _ _ R O E -> positions: let P in1, R in2? No: ""PROBE"" has P in1, R in2, O in3? No: ""PROBE"": P1, R2, O3, B4, E5? So O in third? But we cannot have O in third? Because from feedback O cannot be in position3.

But in this guess, if we have _ _ R O E, then the secret word must have O in position4? So in ""PROBE"" O is in third, so not.

Then a word with O in fourth? Like ""FLO R E"" -> ""FLORE"" meaning floral? Not common? Or ""CHORE"" has C -> invalid.

So possibilities:

- ""FORGE"" with O in second and R in third: letters F, O, R, G, E -> avoids C,A,N,S,T -> valid.

- ""BORDE""? Not a common word. ""HORDE"" we thought earlier? ""HORDE"": H,O,R,D,E -> but in guess2, O is marked as present but wrong position? In ""HORDE"", O would be in second. So if the secret is ""HORDE"", then in guess2 we had ""store"": O in third would not match? But feedback shows O(-), meaning O is in the word? Which is true? Then why not?

But let's check with feedback:

If secret word is ""HORDE"": 
- Ends with E: correct.
- Contains R and O: R position: in third? And O in second? 

Guess2: ""store"" -> S not present? Correct because ""HORDE"" has no S -> (x) ok.
T not present? -> correct? ""HORDE"" has no T -> (x) ok.
O in position3? But in ""HORDE"", O is in position2? So O is present -> but position not correct -> because we guessed O in third and it's actually second -> so should be marked as (-) -> which matches the feedback: O(-).
R: we guessed R in fourth? But ""HORDE"" has R in third? So R is present? but not in fourth -> (-) -> matches feedback.
E in fifth: (✓).

So ""HORDE"" is possible? But does it fit? Let me see:

In ""HORDE"": positions: H1, O2, R3, D4, E5.

From constraints:
- R position? In third? Which is acceptable? R must be in 1 or 3? Third is fine.
- O in position2? Which is acceptable? O can be in 1,2,4? Yes, 2 is fine.
- Check letters: H, O, R, D, E -> none of C,A,N,S,T -> so absent letters are clear? 
- Also, from guess1: ""crane"" -> R was in second? But ""HORDE"" has R in third? So when we guessed ""crane"": R in second? Marked as (-), correct? Because it is present but not in second.

But note: in ""HORDE"", the secret word does not have a second letter of R? But in our guess, we put R in second? So feedback: R(-) because it's present but not there? Correct.

So ""HORDE"" is a candidate? 

But wait: in guess2 (""store"") for O: we had O in third? and ""HORDE"" has O in second? So O is in wrong position? Correctly marked as (-)? 

And R in fourth? We guessed R in fourth? But ""HORDE"" has R in third? So not in fourth -> (-). 

But also, O(-) from guess2 tells us O is not in third? Which for ""HORDE"", O is indeed not in third -> true.

So candidate: ""HORDE""

Another candidate: ""FORGE"": F1, O2, R3, G4, E5 -> same? How different? 

Also, are there others? If R in first? Maybe ""R"" but with O in second? Like ""ROGUE"": R1, O2, G3, U4, E5 -> yes? 

This has U in fourth? And presents G,U? So words: ""ROGUE""

Now, feedback implications on these:

If secret is ""ROGUE"":
- Guess1: ""crane"": E(✓) good? But R(-): R was in second? But ""ROGUE"" has R in first? So R(-) because we guessed it in second and it shouldn't? The feedback will indicate that R is present? But there is a R in the word? Yes? So (-) is appropriate? Because it is not in the position guessed? So correct? 

Guess2: ""store"": 
- S(x): ""ROGUE"" has no S? Correct.
- T(x): ""ROGUE"" has no T? Correct.
- O(-): we guessed O in third? But ""ROGUE"" has O in second? So O is present? but not in third -> (-) -> matches.
- R(-): we guessed R in fourth? But ""ROGUE"" has R in first? So not in fourth? (-) -> matches.
- E(✓) -> matches.

So both ""HORDE"" and ""ROGUE"" are possible? 

But are there others? 

What about R in position3 and O in position1? Example? 
- O _ R _ E -> e.g., ""OIL R E""? Not a word.
- ""OGR E""? ""OGR E"" -> ""OGRE"": O1, G2, R3, E? But ends with? ""OGRE"" is 4 letters? Or ""OGREE""? Not common. 

R in position3 and O in position4? Then _ _ R O E -> but we need an English word? e.g., ""MICRO"" doesn't end with E.

""HERO E""? ""HEROE""? Not 5 letters, ""HEROE"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""WORD O E""? Not.

Another possibility: O in position1 and R in position3? Then word: O ? R ? E -> e.g., ""ORATE""? But has A,T? Absent -> invalid. 
""OILSE"": not a word. 
""OMBRE"": O,M,B,R,E? Or ""OMBER""? Not an English word.

Now, what about R in position1 and O in position4? Then word: R ? ? O E -> 
Positions: 1:R, 2:?, 3:?, 4:O, 5:E? 

Examples: ""RUPEE"": R,U,P,E,E? But first two: RU, then PE? But O? We need O in position4? Not P? So no. 
""RYTHE""? Not. 

So likely candidates: ""HORDE"", ""ROGUE"", and perhaps ""FORGE""? 

Also, we have to consider if the secret word has duplicate letters? Not ruled out.

But at least, we have three candidates? We need to guess a word that fits and tests these.

Alternatively, make a guess that can distinguish between these possibilities.

We know:
We have R, O, E must be present, and two more letters. For candidate:
- ""HORDE"" uses H,D.
- ""ROGUE"" uses G,U? 
- ""FORGE"" uses F,G? Then G appears? 

Now, if we want to guess a word that includes letters of one candidate? But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""LORE"" is 4 letters? ""LORE E""? No. ""MOIRE""? Not common? Or ""MORE E""? ""MORSE"" has S? Absent.

Perhaps ""DOWRY""? Doesn't end with E.

Or ""POWER""? Ends with R? Not E? 

So let's list: Only a few 5-letter words ending with E, containing R and O? Known absent letters.

But note: We also know that O cannot be in position3? And R in1 or3.

So let me think of ""ROGUE"" and ""HORDE"" and ""FORGE"".

But there is also ""FROZE"": Doesn't end with E? ""FROZE"" ends with E? F,R,O,Z,E? Z is new? But yes? But also, O in position3? In ""FROZE"": F1, R2, O3, Z4, E5? But O is in position3? Which is forbidden? Because from ""store"" O(-) feedback? O is not allowed in position3. So impossible? Invalid candidate? Similarly, ""VOT R E"" words? Not in pattern.

So eliminate ""FROZE"" and any having O in3.

Then what about ""BROKE""? Ends with E? ""BROKE"" ends with E? B,R,O,K,E -> O in position3? Again, forbidden? So same problem.

Therefore, the candidates we had: 
- For R in1: ""ROGUE"" (with O in2) 
- For R in3: ""HORDE"" (with O in2) or ""FORGE"" (with O in2)

But note: ""HORDE"" and ""FORGE"" are both in pattern: _ O R _ E -> with O in2 and R in3.

Then the unknown letters: position1 and position4? But for ""HORDE"": position1 is H, position4 is D.
For ""FORGE"": position1 is F, position4 is G.

Therefore, the fourth letter? We don't know? But we have to guess.

Similarly, ""ROGUE"": R in1, O in2, G in3, U in4, E in5.

Possible? We don't know.

Now, we have 6 tries? So guess one that can distinguish.

We could guess a word that utilizes common letters? Not guessed? But we need to avoid C,A,N,S,T.

So available letters: We haven't guessed: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, we can form a word that tests between these? 

For example, if we guess ""HORDE"", we test directly? But then we use one of the candidates.

Or guess something else that includes letters from multiple positions?

But note: we need to include O (which must be present) and R (must be present? Actually, both are present, so we can include them? But we must avoid positions known: R cannot be in2,4? But we suspect positions: R in1 or3? So we can put R in3? Then the word: if we put R in3, and O? O cannot be in3? So O in1,2,4? 

Also, we need to use new letters.

Since H,D,F,G,U are new? Let's choose common ones? 

Idea: We can try a word that has O in a possible new position? And R in another? 

But we don't have many knowns? 

Maybe assume R is in position3? Then we can test ""HORDE"" or ""FORGE""? 

But which? Both are possible? 

We can also try a word that, for example, puts D or G or H to test? 

Let me brainstorm a guess:

For example: ""DRONE""? But has N? Absent -> invalid. 
""GR O V E""? Ends with E? ""GROVE""? G,R,O,V,E -> avoids prohibited: C,A,N,S,T? Yes? But note: O is in position3? In ""GROVE"": G1, R2? R is in second? But we know R cannot be in second? Because from guess1! R in second is forbidden? So ""GROVE"" has R in second? So if we guess that? The feedback would show R as (-) because it is present? But we already know that R is not in second? So why guess? We can avoid forbidden positions for R? So better to put R in either1 or3? 

Therefore, let's form:

Option: Guess ""ROGUE""? R in first, O in second? Which is acceptable? Then letters: R,O,G,U,E? And E in fifth? Sounds good? Then feedback would tell us if R,O are correct? 

But if the secret word is ""HORDE"" or ""FORGE"", what happens? 

For ""ROGUE"":
- Secret ""HORDE"" -> 
  - R: guessed in first? Actual in third -> so R present but not first: (-) -> but also, the O: guessed in second vs actual second: ""HORDE"" has O in second? Wait: ""HORDE"": O in second? So if we guess ""ROGUE"": first letter R? In secret ""HORDE"", it is H? Not R? So R would be marked as (x)? But no: because R is in secret, but not in first? So we put R in first? Actual R in third? So how will R be marked? It should be marked as (-) meaning present? Because it is in the secret but not in the position guessed? 

Similarly, O: guessed in second? Secret ""HORDE"" has O in second? Then O would be marked as (✓)? 

Positional feedback per letter.

But we don't care? We get the feedback? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""HORDE"":
- Secret ""ROGUE"": 
  - H? ""ROGUE"" has no H -> (x)
  - O: guessed in second? Actual in second? 
      Both ""ROGUE"" and ""HORDE"" have O in second? So in guess ""HORDE"", O in second? If secret ""ROGUE"", O is in second? Correct position? Then (✓)?
  - R: guessed in third? Actual in first? Since ""ROGUE"" R in first? So R is present? but not in third? (-)
  - D? ""ROGUE"" has no D? (x)
  - E: (✓)

But we don't know which? 

So to distinguish between ""HORDE"", ""FORGE"" and ""ROGUE"", we need a guess that includes:

Perhaps letters that are unique? 

Ideal is to test letters H,D vs G,U vs F,G etc? 

So why not guess a word that contains H, or D? Or G? 

But we also have to put R and O in possible positions? 

Alternatively, since both patterns? We can guess a word that uses R in position3 and O in position? Not conflicting.

Idea: Guess the word ""GROUT""? But ends with T? T absent and not E? Invalid.
Or ""GROUP""? No E.

Our goal is to test? For example: Guess ""HORME""? Not a word? 

Another: ""FOGRE""? Not a word? 

But we only have English words.

Perhaps ""DO U R E""? Not? 

But note: we can guess ""HORDE"" directly? But it might not be correct? 

Given that we have both possibilities? Why not guess ""ROGUE""? 

We can test U and D etc? 

Since we have three candidates? And we need to guess a word? Let me think:

Possible to form a word that includes letters: for example, include U and H? 

Example: ""HOU R E""? ""HOUR E"" -> ""HOUR"" is 4? ""HOURI""? not? 

Not a common word? 

Guessing ""ROUND""? But ends with D? Not E? invalid.
""ROUSE"" -> has S? invalid.

So possibilities are? Maybe very few? 

I think we should guess between? For instance, if we guess ""HORDE"":
- If correct: we win? 
- If not:
  - If secret is ""ROGUE"": feedback would be: H(x), O(✓), R(-), D(x), E(✓)? Then we know O and E in correct position? Then we know the pattern? 
  - If secret is ""FORGE"": similarly? F and H? 

But so we can try?

But I have an alternative: 

Let's guess ""R O U G E""? ""ROUGE""? 
""R O U G E"": R1, O2, U3, G4, E5? 

Then: 
- For secret ""HORDE"": 
  - R1: present? The secret has R in third? So R is present? but not first? (-)
  - O2: present? Secret has O in second? So (✓)
  - U3: not? Secret has H,O,R,D,E? U not present? (x)
  - G4: not present? (x)
  - E: (✓)

Then we know: O in second? R must be in position3? And then fourth would be D? So we deduce ""H O R D E""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""ROUGE"" and secret is ""ROGUE"": 
  - R in first: secret also R in first? (✓) 
  - O in second: also O in second? (✓)
  - U in third: secret ""ROGUE"" has U in fourth? So present? but not third? (-)? 
  - G in fourth: secret has G in third? So present? but not in fourth? (-)? 
  - E: (✓)? 

But  then feedback: R(✓), O(✓), U(-), G(-), E(✓)? 

Then we know R O _ _ E, with U and G present? And U in third? Wrong? Then U could be fourth? G could be? But in secret they are: G at3, U at4? So positions? 

Alternatively, secret ""ROGUE"" has R1✓, O2✓, so the word is RO?E? Then with U and G present? Then the third and fourth? We can deduce? 

Similarly, if we guess ""ROUGE"", and secret ""FORGE"": 
""FORGE"": F1, O2, R3, G4, E5.
Guess ""ROUGE"": 
- R in first? Secret R in third? So (-) 
- O in second? (✓) 
- U in third? not present? (x) 
- G in fourth? secret G in fourth? (✓) 
- E (✓) 

So feedback: R(-), O(✓), U(x), G(✓), E(✓) 

Then we know: O in second, G in fourth, E in fifth? And R present? Then R must be in position? Position1? But no, in this case it would be position3? And position1 is unknown? And we know U absent? Then position1 is F? And R in third? 

So deducing: ? O R G E -> then F? ""FORGE"" 

Therefore, by guessing ""ROUGE"" (a valid English word), we can get different feedbacks for the candidates and distinguish? 

But note: is ""ROUGE"" an English word? Yes, meaning red used in makeup.

So let's verify the spelling: R-O-U-G-E.

Now, does this word meet the constraints? 
- Ends with E: yes.
- R in first? Which is ok? R can be in1? 
- O in second? Ok? 
- Avoids C,A,N,S,T? Yes, letters R,O,U,G,E -> U is new? We never tested? 

Therefore, I propose to guess ""ROUGE"". 

Feedback will help us narrow down:
- We'll see how the feedback is? For example, G and U will give us information? 

Then the next guesses? We don't care yet? 

So guess: ROUGE
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Secret Word Pattern:** The 5th letter is ""E"" (confirmed by both guesses).
2. **Present Letters:** 
   - ""R"" is in the word (from Guess 1 feedback) but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (since it was misplaced in positions 2 and 4 in the guesses).
   - ""O"" is in the word (from Guess 2 feedback) but **not** in position 3.
3. **Absent Letters:** C, A, N (from Guess 1 feedback), and S (from Guess 1), T (from Guess 2)—none of these are in the secret word.
4. **Constraints from Feedback:**
   - ""R"" must be in position 1 or 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are now ruled out).
   - ""O"" must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is ruled out, and position 5 is ""E"").
   - Possible candidate words include:
     - **R in position 1, O in position 2:** e.g., ""ROGUE"" (R in 1, O in 2).
     - **R in position 3, O in position 2:** e.g., ""HORDE"" or ""FORGE"" (O in 2, R in 3).
     - Other letter combinations are possible (e.g., O in position 1 or 4 with R in 1/3), but they are less common.

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Goal:** Test the position of ""R"" and ""O"" while introducing new letters (avoiding C, A, N, S, T) to gather more information.
- **Strategy:** Guess a word that:
  - Includes ""R"" in position 1 and ""O"" in position 2 to directly test one of the candidate patterns.
  - Includes new high-frequency vowels/consonants (e.g., ""U"" and ""G"") to test for their presence/absence and positions.
- **Selected Guess: ""ROUGE""**:
  - Structure: R (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), G (position 4), E (position 5).
  - Why ""ROUGE""?
    - Tests ""R"" in position 1 and ""O"" in position 2—if either gets a ""✓"", it confirms their positions.
    - The new letters ""U"" (position 3) and ""G"" (position 4) will provide feedback:
      - If ""U"" or ""G"" is absent (x), it rules out certain words (e.g., ""ROGUE"" requires ""G"" and ""U"").
      - If ""U"" or ""G"" is present but misplaced (-), it reveals their positions.
    - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, S, T) and adheres to known constraints.
  - This guess efficiently discriminates between candidates:
    - If the secret word is ""HORDE"" (R in position 3), ""ROUGE"" will likely show R(-) and O(✓), with U/G feedback helping to deduce it has letters like H/D.
    - If the secret word is ""FORGE"" (similar to ""HORDE""), feedback for U/G will differ.
    - If the secret word is ""ROGUE"" (R in position 1), feedback might show R(✓), O(✓), and U/G misplaced.

This guess maximizes information with distinct letter testing while narrowing the remaining possibilities for future guesses.

<guess>rouge</guess>",rouge,"We are given previous feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: store -> S(x) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(✓)

Analysis of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter), so the word ends with 'E'.
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since it was in the 2nd position in ""crane"" and got (-)).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

So we know:
- The secret word ends with 'E'.
- The secret word contains 'R', but not in position 2.
- Secret word contains: R, E (and letters we don't know yet).

From Guess 2 (""store""):
- E(✓): Correct position, confirmed again.
- S(x): 'S' is not in the word.
- T(x): 'T' is not in the word.
- O(-): 'O' is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it in 3rd and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
- R(-): 'R' is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we guessed it in 4th and got a '-'). Also, note that in guess1, R was not in 2nd, and now we know it's also not in 4th.

So combining:
- R is present, but cannot be in positions 2 (from guess1) or 4 (from guess2). Since the word has 5 positions and position 5 is E, R must be in position 1 or position 3.
- O is present, so the word contains 'O'. But not in position 3 (from guess2 feedback). Since positions are: 1,2,3,4,5 and position5 is E, O can be in position 1, 2, 4? 
  - Position 5 is fixed as E, so O cannot be there.
  - O is not in 3, so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- S and T are now known to be absent.
- Additionally, from guess1, we know C, A, N are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have the format: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] E
- Contains: R, O, E
- Does not contain: C, A, N, S, T
- R must be in position 1 or 3.
- O must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

Now, let's think of possible words that fit these constraints.

First, consider the position of R:

Case 1: R in position 1 (first letter).
Then the word is: R _ _ _ E
And O is in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? But note: O cannot be in position 3 because from ""store"" feedback? Wait, no: the feedback only said O is not in position 3 in the secret word. So O might be in 1? But if R is in 1, then O cannot be in 1. So if R is in 1, O can be in 2 or 4.

But wait: the word contains O, and if R is in 1, then O must be in 2 or 4.

Similarly, the middle letter (position 3) is unknown but must not be O? Since O is not allowed in position 3.

Also, we have three positions: 2,3,4 to fill with letters including O and possibly two others.

Case 2: R in position 3.
Then the word is: _ _ R _ E
And O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we must avoid S, T, C, A, N.

Letters we haven't checked: 
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E / S, T, O, R, E -> so tested letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.

Absent: C,A,N,S,T -> so known absent letters: C,A,N,S,T.

Present: R, O, E (and at least one more because we have 5 letters? In fact, the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we have R,O,E and possibly duplicates or new letters).

We know the word must have exactly R,O,E and two more letters that are not C,A,N,S,T.

Remaining letters: many but we can try to think of common ones.

When forming a word, we must have:
- The word ends with E.
- Contains R and O.

Possible words:

First, if R in position 1: R _ _ _ E
We need to choose letters for positions 2,3,4. One of them must be O? Actually O must be present, so either in 2 or 4? Position 3 cannot be O.

So subcases:
- If O is in position 2: R O _ _ E -> so the word is RO?E? -> e.g., ROUTE? But ROUTE has T? T is absent, so invalid. ROUGH? Not ending with E? Valid words: ??? 

Examples: 
- ""ROGUE"": R,O,G,U,E -> contains G,U. Check absent letters: we avoid C,A,N,S,T -> so G,U are new and allowed? But we must confirm if they are absent? We don't know yet. So ""ROGUE"" is R in1, O in2, G in3, U in4, E in5.
- ""ROUSE"": R,O,U,S,E -> but S is absent? So invalid because of S.
- ""ROMEO"": too long? 5 letters? ""ROME"" is 4. So no.

Another: ""ROULE"": ROUL E? Is that a word? Not really, English word: ""ROUSE"" we rejected because S is absent. 

Then: ""ROUTE""? R,O,U,T,E -> but T is absent? From guess2, T not present -> so ""ROUTE"" has T -> invalid.

If O in position 4: Then word: R _ _ O E.

So letters: R, ?, ?, O, E.

Position 2 and 3 to be filled.

But O is in position 4? Then the word: e.g., ""RADIO""? But A is absent and not E. Actually, ends with E? ""RADIO"" ends with O. Doesn't end with E.

Examples: 
- ""RENEW"": But E in position4? And it has N? N is absent -> invalid.
- ""RECCE"": Not common. Also has C and C absent? Not allowed.

What about: ""REVUE""? Not standard? Or ""REUSE"" -> has S, absent. 

If R in position1 and O in position4? So word: R ? ? O E -> e.g., ""RIFLE""? R,I,F,L,E -> no O? But O must be present? So missing O? Doesn't work.

Actually, O must be placed! So if we put O in the fourth position, then we have R _ _ O E -> and the word must contain O? It is in fourth. Then we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not C,A,N,S,T and form a word.

Examples: 
- ""RHO?? E"" -> ""RHOLE""? Not a word.
- ""ROGUE"" we thought earlier? But O is in second? Not in fourth.

Wait, so perhaps O cannot be fourth if R is first? 

Alternatively, case where R is in position 3: the word is _ _ R _ E

And O must be in 1, 2, or 4? But not 3.

Now, O in position1: so O _ R _ E -> e.g., ""OIL R E"" -> ""OILRE""? Not a word. ""OUTRE""? U,T: U is new, but T is absent -> ""OUTRE"" has T? Yes -> T absent -> invalid.

O in position2: then _ O R _ E -> e.g., ""FOR E?"" -> ""FORGE"" : F,O,R,G,E -> avoids prohibited letters? Prohibited: C,A,N,S,T -> F and G are new. So ""FORGE"" could be? Yes.

O in position4: then _ _ R O E -> e.g., word: ? ? R O E -> ""PRO E?"" -> ""PROBE""! But ""PROBE"": P,R,O,B,E -> O is in position 4? Then word: _ _ R O E -> positions: let P in1, R in2? No: ""PROBE"" has P in1, R in2, O in3? No: ""PROBE"": P1, R2, O3, B4, E5? So O in third? But we cannot have O in third? Because from feedback O cannot be in position3.

But in this guess, if we have _ _ R O E, then the secret word must have O in position4? So in ""PROBE"" O is in third, so not.

Then a word with O in fourth? Like ""FLO R E"" -> ""FLORE"" meaning floral? Not common? Or ""CHORE"" has C -> invalid.

So possibilities:

- ""FORGE"" with O in second and R in third: letters F, O, R, G, E -> avoids C,A,N,S,T -> valid.

- ""BORDE""? Not a common word. ""HORDE"" we thought earlier? ""HORDE"": H,O,R,D,E -> but in guess2, O is marked as present but wrong position? In ""HORDE"", O would be in second. So if the secret is ""HORDE"", then in guess2 we had ""store"": O in third would not match? But feedback shows O(-), meaning O is in the word? Which is true? Then why not?

But let's check with feedback:

If secret word is ""HORDE"": 
- Ends with E: correct.
- Contains R and O: R position: in third? And O in second? 

Guess2: ""store"" -> S not present? Correct because ""HORDE"" has no S -> (x) ok.
T not present? -> correct? ""HORDE"" has no T -> (x) ok.
O in position3? But in ""HORDE"", O is in position2? So O is present -> but position not correct -> because we guessed O in third and it's actually second -> so should be marked as (-) -> which matches the feedback: O(-).
R: we guessed R in fourth? But ""HORDE"" has R in third? So R is present? but not in fourth -> (-) -> matches feedback.
E in fifth: (✓).

So ""HORDE"" is possible? But does it fit? Let me see:

In ""HORDE"": positions: H1, O2, R3, D4, E5.

From constraints:
- R position? In third? Which is acceptable? R must be in 1 or 3? Third is fine.
- O in position2? Which is acceptable? O can be in 1,2,4? Yes, 2 is fine.
- Check letters: H, O, R, D, E -> none of C,A,N,S,T -> so absent letters are clear? 
- Also, from guess1: ""crane"" -> R was in second? But ""HORDE"" has R in third? So when we guessed ""crane"": R in second? Marked as (-), correct? Because it is present but not in second.

But note: in ""HORDE"", the secret word does not have a second letter of R? But in our guess, we put R in second? So feedback: R(-) because it's present but not there? Correct.

So ""HORDE"" is a candidate? 

But wait: in guess2 (""store"") for O: we had O in third? and ""HORDE"" has O in second? So O is in wrong position? Correctly marked as (-)? 

And R in fourth? We guessed R in fourth? But ""HORDE"" has R in third? So not in fourth -> (-). 

But also, O(-) from guess2 tells us O is not in third? Which for ""HORDE"", O is indeed not in third -> true.

So candidate: ""HORDE""

Another candidate: ""FORGE"": F1, O2, R3, G4, E5 -> same? How different? 

Also, are there others? If R in first? Maybe ""R"" but with O in second? Like ""ROGUE"": R1, O2, G3, U4, E5 -> yes? 

This has U in fourth? And presents G,U? So words: ""ROGUE""

Now, feedback implications on these:

If secret is ""ROGUE"":
- Guess1: ""crane"": E(✓) good? But R(-): R was in second? But ""ROGUE"" has R in first? So R(-) because we guessed it in second and it shouldn't? The feedback will indicate that R is present? But there is a R in the word? Yes? So (-) is appropriate? Because it is not in the position guessed? So correct? 

Guess2: ""store"": 
- S(x): ""ROGUE"" has no S? Correct.
- T(x): ""ROGUE"" has no T? Correct.
- O(-): we guessed O in third? But ""ROGUE"" has O in second? So O is present? but not in third -> (-) -> matches.
- R(-): we guessed R in fourth? But ""ROGUE"" has R in first? So not in fourth? (-) -> matches.
- E(✓) -> matches.

So both ""HORDE"" and ""ROGUE"" are possible? 

But are there others? 

What about R in position3 and O in position1? Example? 
- O _ R _ E -> e.g., ""OIL R E""? Not a word.
- ""OGR E""? ""OGR E"" -> ""OGRE"": O1, G2, R3, E? But ends with? ""OGRE"" is 4 letters? Or ""OGREE""? Not common. 

R in position3 and O in position4? Then _ _ R O E -> but we need an English word? e.g., ""MICRO"" doesn't end with E.

""HERO E""? ""HEROE""? Not 5 letters, ""HEROE"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""WORD O E""? Not.

Another possibility: O in position1 and R in position3? Then word: O ? R ? E -> e.g., ""ORATE""? But has A,T? Absent -> invalid. 
""OILSE"": not a word. 
""OMBRE"": O,M,B,R,E? Or ""OMBER""? Not an English word.

Now, what about R in position1 and O in position4? Then word: R ? ? O E -> 
Positions: 1:R, 2:?, 3:?, 4:O, 5:E? 

Examples: ""RUPEE"": R,U,P,E,E? But first two: RU, then PE? But O? We need O in position4? Not P? So no. 
""RYTHE""? Not. 

So likely candidates: ""HORDE"", ""ROGUE"", and perhaps ""FORGE""? 

Also, we have to consider if the secret word has duplicate letters? Not ruled out.

But at least, we have three candidates? We need to guess a word that fits and tests these.

Alternatively, make a guess that can distinguish between these possibilities.

We know:
We have R, O, E must be present, and two more letters. For candidate:
- ""HORDE"" uses H,D.
- ""ROGUE"" uses G,U? 
- ""FORGE"" uses F,G? Then G appears? 

Now, if we want to guess a word that includes letters of one candidate? But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""LORE"" is 4 letters? ""LORE E""? No. ""MOIRE""? Not common? Or ""MORE E""? ""MORSE"" has S? Absent.

Perhaps ""DOWRY""? Doesn't end with E.

Or ""POWER""? Ends with R? Not E? 

So let's list: Only a few 5-letter words ending with E, containing R and O? Known absent letters.

But note: We also know that O cannot be in position3? And R in1 or3.

So let me think of ""ROGUE"" and ""HORDE"" and ""FORGE"".

But there is also ""FROZE"": Doesn't end with E? ""FROZE"" ends with E? F,R,O,Z,E? Z is new? But yes? But also, O in position3? In ""FROZE"": F1, R2, O3, Z4, E5? But O is in position3? Which is forbidden? Because from ""store"" O(-) feedback? O is not allowed in position3. So impossible? Invalid candidate? Similarly, ""VOT R E"" words? Not in pattern.

So eliminate ""FROZE"" and any having O in3.

Then what about ""BROKE""? Ends with E? ""BROKE"" ends with E? B,R,O,K,E -> O in position3? Again, forbidden? So same problem.

Therefore, the candidates we had: 
- For R in1: ""ROGUE"" (with O in2) 
- For R in3: ""HORDE"" (with O in2) or ""FORGE"" (with O in2)

But note: ""HORDE"" and ""FORGE"" are both in pattern: _ O R _ E -> with O in2 and R in3.

Then the unknown letters: position1 and position4? But for ""HORDE"": position1 is H, position4 is D.
For ""FORGE"": position1 is F, position4 is G.

Therefore, the fourth letter? We don't know? But we have to guess.

Similarly, ""ROGUE"": R in1, O in2, G in3, U in4, E in5.

Possible? We don't know.

Now, we have 6 tries? So guess one that can distinguish.

We could guess a word that utilizes common letters? Not guessed? But we need to avoid C,A,N,S,T.

So available letters: We haven't guessed: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, we can form a word that tests between these? 

For example, if we guess ""HORDE"", we test directly? But then we use one of the candidates.

Or guess something else that includes letters from multiple positions?

But note: we need to include O (which must be present) and R (must be present? Actually, both are present, so we can include them? But we must avoid positions known: R cannot be in2,4? But we suspect positions: R in1 or3? So we can put R in3? Then the word: if we put R in3, and O? O cannot be in3? So O in1,2,4? 

Also, we need to use new letters.

Since H,D,F,G,U are new? Let's choose common ones? 

Idea: We can try a word that has O in a possible new position? And R in another? 

But we don't have many knowns? 

Maybe assume R is in position3? Then we can test ""HORDE"" or ""FORGE""? 

But which? Both are possible? 

We can also try a word that, for example, puts D or G or H to test? 

Let me brainstorm a guess:

For example: ""DRONE""? But has N? Absent -> invalid. 
""GR O V E""? Ends with E? ""GROVE""? G,R,O,V,E -> avoids prohibited: C,A,N,S,T? Yes? But note: O is in position3? In ""GROVE"": G1, R2? R is in second? But we know R cannot be in second? Because from guess1! R in second is forbidden? So ""GROVE"" has R in second? So if we guess that? The feedback would show R as (-) because it is present? But we already know that R is not in second? So why guess? We can avoid forbidden positions for R? So better to put R in either1 or3? 

Therefore, let's form:

Option: Guess ""ROGUE""? R in first, O in second? Which is acceptable? Then letters: R,O,G,U,E? And E in fifth? Sounds good? Then feedback would tell us if R,O are correct? 

But if the secret word is ""HORDE"" or ""FORGE"", what happens? 

For ""ROGUE"":
- Secret ""HORDE"" -> 
  - R: guessed in first? Actual in third -> so R present but not first: (-) -> but also, the O: guessed in second vs actual second: ""HORDE"" has O in second? Wait: ""HORDE"": O in second? So if we guess ""ROGUE"": first letter R? In secret ""HORDE"", it is H? Not R? So R would be marked as (x)? But no: because R is in secret, but not in first? So we put R in first? Actual R in third? So how will R be marked? It should be marked as (-) meaning present? Because it is in the secret but not in the position guessed? 

Similarly, O: guessed in second? Secret ""HORDE"" has O in second? Then O would be marked as (✓)? 

Positional feedback per letter.

But we don't care? We get the feedback? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""HORDE"":
- Secret ""ROGUE"": 
  - H? ""ROGUE"" has no H -> (x)
  - O: guessed in second? Actual in second? 
      Both ""ROGUE"" and ""HORDE"" have O in second? So in guess ""HORDE"", O in second? If secret ""ROGUE"", O is in second? Correct position? Then (✓)?
  - R: guessed in third? Actual in first? Since ""ROGUE"" R in first? So R is present? but not in third? (-)
  - D? ""ROGUE"" has no D? (x)
  - E: (✓)

But we don't know which? 

So to distinguish between ""HORDE"", ""FORGE"" and ""ROGUE"", we need a guess that includes:

Perhaps letters that are unique? 

Ideal is to test letters H,D vs G,U vs F,G etc? 

So why not guess a word that contains H, or D? Or G? 

But we also have to put R and O in possible positions? 

Alternatively, since both patterns? We can guess a word that uses R in position3 and O in position? Not conflicting.

Idea: Guess the word ""GROUT""? But ends with T? T absent and not E? Invalid.
Or ""GROUP""? No E.

Our goal is to test? For example: Guess ""HORME""? Not a word? 

Another: ""FOGRE""? Not a word? 

But we only have English words.

Perhaps ""DO U R E""? Not? 

But note: we can guess ""HORDE"" directly? But it might not be correct? 

Given that we have both possibilities? Why not guess ""ROGUE""? 

We can test U and D etc? 

Since we have three candidates? And we need to guess a word? Let me think:

Possible to form a word that includes letters: for example, include U and H? 

Example: ""HOU R E""? ""HOUR E"" -> ""HOUR"" is 4? ""HOURI""? not? 

Not a common word? 

Guessing ""ROUND""? But ends with D? Not E? invalid.
""ROUSE"" -> has S? invalid.

So possibilities are? Maybe very few? 

I think we should guess between? For instance, if we guess ""HORDE"":
- If correct: we win? 
- If not:
  - If secret is ""ROGUE"": feedback would be: H(x), O(✓), R(-), D(x), E(✓)? Then we know O and E in correct position? Then we know the pattern? 
  - If secret is ""FORGE"": similarly? F and H? 

But so we can try?

But I have an alternative: 

Let's guess ""R O U G E""? ""ROUGE""? 
""R O U G E"": R1, O2, U3, G4, E5? 

Then: 
- For secret ""HORDE"": 
  - R1: present? The secret has R in third? So R is present? but not first? (-)
  - O2: present? Secret has O in second? So (✓)
  - U3: not? Secret has H,O,R,D,E? U not present? (x)
  - G4: not present? (x)
  - E: (✓)

Then we know: O in second? R must be in position3? And then fourth would be D? So we deduce ""H O R D E""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""ROUGE"" and secret is ""ROGUE"": 
  - R in first: secret also R in first? (✓) 
  - O in second: also O in second? (✓)
  - U in third: secret ""ROGUE"" has U in fourth? So present? but not third? (-)? 
  - G in fourth: secret has G in third? So present? but not in fourth? (-)? 
  - E: (✓)? 

But  then feedback: R(✓), O(✓), U(-), G(-), E(✓)? 

Then we know R O _ _ E, with U and G present? And U in third? Wrong? Then U could be fourth? G could be? But in secret they are: G at3, U at4? So positions? 

Alternatively, secret ""ROGUE"" has R1✓, O2✓, so the word is RO?E? Then with U and G present? Then the third and fourth? We can deduce? 

Similarly, if we guess ""ROUGE"", and secret ""FORGE"": 
""FORGE"": F1, O2, R3, G4, E5.
Guess ""ROUGE"": 
- R in first? Secret R in third? So (-) 
- O in second? (✓) 
- U in third? not present? (x) 
- G in fourth? secret G in fourth? (✓) 
- E (✓) 

So feedback: R(-), O(✓), U(x), G(✓), E(✓) 

Then we know: O in second, G in fourth, E in fifth? And R present? Then R must be in position? Position1? But no, in this case it would be position3? And position1 is unknown? And we know U absent? Then position1 is F? And R in third? 

So deducing: ? O R G E -> then F? ""FORGE"" 

Therefore, by guessing ""ROUGE"" (a valid English word), we can get different feedbacks for the candidates and distinguish? 

But note: is ""ROUGE"" an English word? Yes, meaning red used in makeup.

So let's verify the spelling: R-O-U-G-E.

Now, does this word meet the constraints? 
- Ends with E: yes.
- R in first? Which is ok? R can be in1? 
- O in second? Ok? 
- Avoids C,A,N,S,T? Yes, letters R,O,U,G,E -> U is new? We never tested? 

Therefore, I propose to guess ""ROUGE"". 

Feedback will help us narrow down:
- We'll see how the feedback is? For example, G and U will give us information? 

Then the next guesses? We don't care yet? 

So guess: ROUGEBased on the previous feedback:

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Secret Word Pattern:** The 5th letter is ""E"" (confirmed by both guesses).
2. **Present Letters:** 
   - ""R"" is in the word (from Guess 1 feedback) but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (since it was misplaced in positions 2 and 4 in the guesses).
   - ""O"" is in the word (from Guess 2 feedback) but **not** in position 3.
3. **Absent Letters:** C, A, N (from Guess 1 feedback), and S (from Guess 1), T (from Guess 2)—none of these are in the secret word.
4. **Constraints from Feedback:**
   - ""R"" must be in position 1 or 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are now ruled out).
   - ""O"" must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is ruled out, and position 5 is ""E"").
   - Possible candidate words include:
     - **R in position 1, O in position 2:** e.g., ""ROGUE"" (R in 1, O in 2).
     - **R in position 3, O in position 2:** e.g., ""HORDE"" or ""FORGE"" (O in 2, R in 3).
     - Other letter combinations are possible (e.g., O in position 1 or 4 with R in 1/3), but they are less common.

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Goal:** Test the position of ""R"" and ""O"" while introducing new letters (avoiding C, A, N, S, T) to gather more information.
- **Strategy:** Guess a word that:
  - Includes ""R"" in position 1 and ""O"" in position 2 to directly test one of the candidate patterns.
  - Includes new high-frequency vowels/consonants (e.g., ""U"" and ""G"") to test for their presence/absence and positions.
- **Selected Guess: ""ROUGE""**:
  - Structure: R (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), G (position 4), E (position 5).
  - Why ""ROUGE""?
    - Tests ""R"" in position 1 and ""O"" in position 2—if either gets a ""✓"", it confirms their positions.
    - The new letters ""U"" (position 3) and ""G"" (position 4) will provide feedback:
      - If ""U"" or ""G"" is absent (x), it rules out certain words (e.g., ""ROGUE"" requires ""G"" and ""U"").
      - If ""U"" or ""G"" is present but misplaced (-), it reveals their positions.
    - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, S, T) and adheres to known constraints.
  - This guess efficiently discriminates between candidates:
    - If the secret word is ""HORDE"" (R in position 3), ""ROUGE"" will likely show R(-) and O(✓), with U/G feedback helping to deduce it has letters like H/D.
    - If the secret word is ""FORGE"" (similar to ""HORDE""), feedback for U/G will differ.
    - If the secret word is ""ROGUE"" (R in position 1), feedback might show R(✓), O(✓), and U/G misplaced.

This guess maximizes information with distinct letter testing while narrowing the remaining possibilities for future guesses.",Guess 3: rouge -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) U(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
