We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". Let me choose one that covers a few vowels and common consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)
This means:
- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4, since we count from 1: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E)
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5)
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.

So, the secret word has:
  - The 4th letter as N
  - The 5th letter as E
  - Does not contain C, R, or A.

Therefore, the secret word is in the form: _ _ _ N E

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
  - Ends with ""NE""
  - Does not contain C, R, or A.
  - Should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible common letters to include: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y

Considering the pattern: _ _ _ N E

We want to maximize information by covering frequent letters and avoiding the eliminated letters (C, R, A).

Looking for words that end with ""NE"":

Common words: 
  - stone, phone, alone, prone, shone, etc. But we must avoid 'A' (so alone is out because of A), and avoid C, R? Actually, feedback says R is not present, so we cannot use R.

Avoiding C, R, A, we consider words without these letters.

Options:
  - ""phone"": P H O N E -> positions: 1=P, 2=H, 3=O, 4=N, 5=E -> we don't know about P, H, O yet.
  - ""stone"": S T O N E -> avoids C,R,A
  - ""prone"": has R -> cannot use because R is not in the word (as per feedback). Similarly, ""shone"" has S H O N E -> avoids C,R,A? R is excluded, so S, H, O are new.

But ""prone"" contains R which is excluded. So we must avoid that.

Let me verify the feedback: R was marked as x, meaning not in the word. So we cannot use R.

Similarly, avoid C and A.

Therefore, ""stone"" is a candidate: letters S, T, O, N, E. None of S, T, O are eliminated. But note that N and E are already in the right spots, so for the new guess we have:
  - Position 4: N (correct, we leave it)
  - Position 5: E (correct, we leave it)
  - Positions 1, 2, 3: we want to test new letters.

""stone"" would test S, T, and O.

Alternatively, ""phone"" tests P, H, O.

Which one is better? We want to cover more common letters. 

Looking at English letter frequency: E is the most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, etc. But we eliminated A, and N and E are already known.

Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

So ""stone"" introduces S, T, O.

Another candidate: ""shine"" -> ends with NE, but has I in position 3? S H I N E -> but note we don't know about S, H, I. However, ""shine"" does not have A,C,R. But position 4 must be N? Yes.

Wait, ""shine"" has position 3 as I, and position 4 as N. So the pattern is _ _ I N E? But we don't know if the third letter is I. 

We must maintain the known positions? Actually, no, we can change the other letters. The known letters in positions 4 and 5 should be the same? Actually, no. The feedback said N is in position 4 and E in position 5, so they must be in the secret word at those positions. Therefore, in our new guess, we should keep the E in position 5 and N in position 4? Not necessarily because we are allowed to try a different combination? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that for the secret word, the 4th letter is N and 5th is E. But in our next guess, we don't have to keep N in position 4 and E in position 5? Actually, we can, but it's beneficial because if we get them correct again, we confirm. But in this case, the feedback already told us they are correct. So we can reuse that information.

In fact, to test other letters efficiently, we should keep the correctly placed letters in their positions. Because if we change them, we might lose the advantage of knowing them. So it's best to have a guess that has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position.

Therefore, we are going to guess a word of the form: _ _ _ N E

So the first three letters are what we need to guess.

We have to choose a word that ends with ""NE"", but the last two are fixed as N and E, so we need a word that is ??? + ""NE"".

So we need 5-letter words with the pattern [letter1][letter2][letter3] ""N"" ""E"", and without C, R, A.

Now, we fill the first three positions with letters that are not C, R, A.

Common words: 
  - ""stone"": S T O N E -> S at 1, T at 2, O at 3.
  - ""phone"": P H O N E
  - ""shine"": S H I N E
  - ""tune"": too short? must be 5 letters. ""tune"" is 4 letters. So not valid.
  - ""alone"": contains A -> invalid.
  - ""prone"": contains R -> invalid.
  - ""clone"": contains C -> invalid.

So ""stone"", ""phone"", ""shine"" are valid. Also ""thine"", ""whine"", ""ozone"", etc.

Now, to maximize information, we should include common letters that we haven't tested yet. We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y.

But note: we already know that N and E are in the word and in those positions. So we care about the first three.

Also, we want to cover letters that might appear multiple times? But we don't know.

Considering the word ""stone"": it has S, T, O. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""shine"" has S, H, I.

Or ""phone"" has P, H, O.

Another: ""thine"" has T, H, I -> but ""thine"" ends with NE? T H I N E -> yes.

We can choose among these.

Since we have limited tries, we should aim for a word that includes letters that are frequent and that we haven't ruled out.

I think ""stone"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has S and T, which are common.
  - O is also common.

Alternatively, ""phone"" has P and H, which are less frequent? Actually, S is more common than P.

Similarly, ""shine"" has S and H, but H is medium frequency.

But note: in position 3, for ""stone"" we have O, which is a vowel. We haven't tested any vowel that is in the secret word? We only tested A (which was eliminated). But E is present (at the end). We don't know about other vowels.

So testing O is good because it's a common vowel.

Similarly, we can test a word with I? We can do that later.

Therefore, I choose ""stone"" for the next guess.

So the new guess is: stone

We'll see what the feedback gives.

Therefore, the response is:
</think>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- N is correct and in position 4 (✓).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- C, R, and A are not in the word (x).

Thus, the secret word ends with ""NE"" and does not contain C, R, or A. For the next guess:
- Retain N in position 4 and E in position 5 to leverage known positions.
- Guess a word of the form _ _ _ N E.
- Focus on common letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A).
- ""Stone"" is chosen because it includes S, T, and O—common letters—and fits the criteria (S, T, O are new and not eliminated).

Possible common letters to include: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y

Considering the pattern: _ _ _ N E

We want to maximize information by covering frequent letters and avoiding the eliminated letters (C, R, A).

Looking for words that end with ""NE"":

Common words: 
  - stone, phone, alone, prone, shone, etc. But we must avoid 'A' (so alone is out because of A), and avoid C, R? Actually, feedback says R is not present, so we cannot use R.

Avoiding C, R, A, we consider words without these letters.

Options:
  - ""phone"": P H O N E -> positions: 1=P, 2=H, 3=O, 4=N, 5=E -> we don't know about P, H, O yet.
  - ""stone"": S T O N E -> avoids C,R,A
  - ""prone"": has R -> cannot use because R is not in the word (as per feedback). Similarly, ""shone"" has S H O N E -> avoids C,R,A? R is excluded, so S, H, O are new.

But ""prone"" contains R which is excluded. So we must avoid that.

Let me verify the feedback: R was marked as x, meaning not in the word. So we cannot use R.

Similarly, avoid C and A.

Therefore, ""stone"" is a candidate: letters S, T, O, N, E. None of S, T, O are eliminated. But note that N and E are already in the right spots, so for the new guess we have:
  - Position 4: N (correct, we leave it)
  - Position 5: E (correct, we leave it)
  - Positions 1, 2, 3: we want to test new letters.

""stone"" would test S, T, and O.

Alternatively, ""phone"" tests P, H, O.

Which one is better? We want to cover more common letters. 

Looking at English letter frequency: E is the most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, etc. But we eliminated A, and N and E are already known.

Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

So ""stone"" introduces S, T, O.

Another candidate: ""shine"" -> ends with NE, but has I in position 3? S H I N E -> but note we don't know about S, H, I. However, ""shine"" does not have A,C,R. But position 4 must be N? Yes.

Wait, ""shine"" has position 3 as I, and position 4 as N. So the pattern is _ _ I N E? But we don't know if the third letter is I. 

We must maintain the known positions? Actually, no, we can change the other letters. The known letters in positions 4 and 5 should be the same? Actually, no. The feedback said N is in position 4 and E in position 5, so they must be in the secret word at those positions. Therefore, in our new guess, we should keep the E in position 5 and N in position 4? Not necessarily because we are allowed to try a different combination? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that for the secret word, the 4th letter is N and 5th is E. But in our next guess, we don't have to keep N in position 4 and E in position 5? Actually, we can, but it's beneficial because if we get them correct again, we confirm. But in this case, the feedback already told us they are correct. So we can reuse that information.

In fact, to test other letters efficiently, we should keep the correctly placed letters in their positions. Because if we change them, we might lose the advantage of knowing them. So it's best to have a guess that has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position.

Therefore, we are going to guess a word of the form: _ _ _ N E

So the first three letters are what we need to guess.

We have to choose a word that ends with ""NE"", but the last two are fixed as N and E, so we need a word that is ??? + ""NE"".

So we need 5-letter words with the pattern [letter1][letter2][letter3] ""N"" ""E"", and without C, R, A.

Now, we fill the first three positions with letters that are not C, R, A.

Common words: 
  - ""stone"": S T O N E -> S at 1, T at 2, O at 3.
  - ""phone"": P H O N E
  - ""shine"": S H I N E
  - ""tune"": too short? must be 5 letters. ""tune"" is 4 letters. So not valid.
  - ""alone"": contains A -> invalid.
  - ""prone"": contains R -> invalid.
  - ""clone"": contains C -> invalid.

So ""stone"", ""phone"", ""shine"" are valid. Also ""thine"", ""whine"", ""ozone"", etc.

Now, to maximize information, we should include common letters that we haven't tested yet. We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y.

But note: we already know that N and E are in the word and in those positions. So we care about the first three.

Also, we want to cover letters that might appear multiple times? But we don't know.

Considering the word ""stone"": it has S, T, O. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""shine"" has S, H, I.

Or ""phone"" has P, H, O.

Another: ""thine"" has T, H, I -> but ""thine"" ends with NE? T H I N E -> yes.

We can choose among these.

Since we have limited tries, we should aim for a word that includes letters that are frequent and that we haven't ruled out.

I think ""stone"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has S and T, which are common.
  - O is also common.

Alternatively, ""phone"" has P and H, which are less frequent? Actually, S is more common than P.

Similarly, ""shine"" has S and H, but H is medium frequency.

But note: in position 3, for ""stone"" we have O, which is a vowel. We haven't tested any vowel that is in the secret word? We only tested A (which was eliminated). But E is present (at the end). We don't know about other vowels.

So testing O is good because it's a common vowel.

Similarly, we can test a word with I? We can do that later.

Therefore, I choose ""stone"" for the next guess.

So the new guess is: stone

We'll see what the feedback gives.

Therefore, the response is:The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- N is correct and in position 4 (✓).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- C, R, and A are not in the word (x).

Thus, the secret word ends with ""NE"" and does not contain C, R, or A. For the next guess:
- Retain N in position 4 and E in position 5 to leverage known positions.
- Guess a word of the form _ _ _ N E.
- Focus on common letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A).
- ""Stone"" is chosen because it includes S, T, and O—common letters—and fits the criteria (S, T, O are new and not eliminated).

We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
- This means: 
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
  - C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)
- This means:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st).
  - T is not in the word (x).
  - O is not in the word (x).
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th) (already known).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th) (already known).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 1: S (from ""stone"" feedback: S(✓))
  - Position 4: N (from both)
  - Position 5: E (from both)

- Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T, O.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: S _ _ N E

We need to fill in the 2nd and 3rd positions.

We also know that the letters not in the word are: C, R, A, T, O.

So, available letters: all letters except C, R, A, T, O and the ones we know (S, N, E). But note: S, N, E are already placed, so we don't need to use them again in the unknown positions? Actually, we can't because the word is 5 letters and positions are fixed except 2 and 3.

The unknown positions (2 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not in the exclusion list: C, R, A, T, O.

Also, we must avoid using any letter that is already known to be in the word? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates so far. For example, in ""stone"", S was in position 1 and correct, but if there were another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, the rules don't specify, but typically in such games, each letter is marked independently. However, if a letter appears multiple times, it might be marked accordingly.

But in this case, we have no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now, unless feedback suggests otherwise.

Therefore, for positions 2 and 3, we need to choose two distinct letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, A, T, O, and also excluding S, N, E (since they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates?).

But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could the word have two E's? We know E is at position 5, but it might appear elsewhere? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""stone"" didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know for sure.

However, to be safe, we should consider that the unknown positions could be any letter not excluded, including the possibility of duplicates? But the feedback for ""crane"" had E at the end, and if there was another E, it might have been marked? Actually, in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and marked correct. If there was an E in another position, and we didn't guess it, we wouldn't know. Similarly, in ""stone"", we only have E at the end.

So we cannot rule out duplicates. But without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for efficiency.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

So, the current state:

- Known: Position 1: S, Position 4: N, Position 5: E
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, T, O
- We have two positions to fill: 2 and 3.

We need to guess a word that starts with S, then two letters, then N, then E: S _ _ N E

We must avoid using the excluded letters in positions 2 and 3.

Also, we should avoid using S, N, E again in positions 2 or 3? Because if we assume no duplicates, then we cannot use S, N, E again. But if we allow duplicates, we could. However, since we have no evidence of duplicates, and to avoid confusion, it's better to assume no duplicates for now and use new letters.

Therefore, for positions 2 and 3, we choose from the remaining alphabet minus the excluded ones and minus S, N, E.

Remaining letters: 
Alphabet: A to Z, exclude C, R, A, T, O -> so exclude A, C, R, T, O.

Also exclude S, N, E (because they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates).

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form S _ _ N E.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- ""shine"": S H I N E -> but we have to check if H and I are available? H and I are in the available list. However, we don't know if they are in the word. But we are going to test them.

But note: in the feedback from ""stone"", we had T and O marked as absent. We don't have any feedback on H or I.

So ""shine"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""spine"": S P I N E -> P and I.

""swine"": S W I N E -> W and I.

""smile"": but that ends with LE, not NE. So not.

""shine"", ""spine"", ""swine"", ""sinew"": but ""sinew"" is S I N E W -> that's 5 letters, but then the pattern is S I N E W, which doesn't end with NE? Wait, it ends with EW, so not matching S _ _ N E. We need the last two to be N and E, so the word must end with ""NE"".

So ""sinew"" is S I N E W -> positions: 1=S, 2=I, 3=N, 4=E, 5=W -> but we need position 4 to be N and 5 to be E? So that doesn't match.

We need the word to have N at position 4 and E at position 5. So the word must be of the form ...N E at the end.

So ""shine"" is S H I N E -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=E -> perfect.

Similarly, ""spine"": S P I N E.

""swine"": S W I N E.

""scene"": but C is excluded -> invalid.

""skene"": not common, and K is available? But let's stick to common words.

""shine"" is a common word.

But we also have ""sine"": that's 4 letters.

Another: ""stone"" we already used.

We have ""shone"": but O is excluded.

""spine"", ""shine"", ""swine"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common to get more information.

Common letters: H, I, P, W, etc.

H is more common than W? In English, H is more frequent than W.

But we have two positions, so we can test two letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has one vowel and one consonant? We know that the word has at least one vowel (E) but we don't know about the others. We tested A and O and they are absent. So the only vowel we know is E. There might be other vowels: I, U, or sometimes Y.

So testing I is good because it's a vowel.

Similarly, we can test U? But in the pattern S _ _ N E, we can have words like ""sunne"" which is not a word? Or ""suing"" doesn't end with NE.

""suine"" is not a word.

So I is a good vowel to test.

Therefore, ""shine"" (with H and I) or ""spine"" (with P and I) are both good.

But H is more common than P? Let's see frequency:

According to English letter frequency, I is more common than H, and H is more common than P.

But we are testing two letters.

In ""shine"", we test H and I.

In ""spine"", we test P and I.

Since I is common, and we are testing it in both, the difference is H vs P.

H is more common than P, so ""shine"" might be better.

But we also have to consider that we might get it right.

Another candidate: ""smite"" doesn't end with NE.

""slide"" ends with DE.

So limited options.

We can also consider ""snipe"": but that would be S N I P E -> but position 4 is I? We need position 4 to be N. So ""snipe"" is S N I P E -> positions: 1=S, 2=N, 3=I, 4=P, 5=E -> but we need position 4 to be N, so that doesn't match.

We must have N at position 4, so the word must be S ? ? N E.

So ""snipe"" doesn't work.

Similarly, ""swine"": S W I N E -> that works.

""swipe"": S W I P E -> position 4 is P, not N -> invalid.

So the common words are: ""shine"", ""spine"", ""swine"".

Now, among these, ""shine"" has H and I, ""spine"" has P and I, ""swine"" has W and I.

We want to maximize the chance of getting information. Since I is in all, we are testing I in position 3.

Then we are testing either H, P, or W in position 2.

H is the most common of these.

But also, we can think about what words are possible.

We have two positions: 2 and 3.

We need to fill with two letters from the available set.

After this guess, we might get more feedback.

But we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? But we only have I and U as possible vowels (since A, E, O are known: E is in, A and O are out). E is in, but we know its position. So for the unknown positions, we can have I or U or Y.

But in the pattern, we can have:

- Position 2: consonant or vowel
- Position 3: vowel or consonant

But in ""shine"", position 2 is H (consonant) and position 3 is I (vowel).

Similarly, ""spine"": P (consonant) and I (vowel).

""swine"": W (consonant) and I (vowel).

We could have a word with a vowel in position 2? For example, ""sinew"" doesn't fit. ""saine"" not a word. ""seine"" -> S E I N E, but E is already in position 5, and we have E in position 2? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in ""seine"", position 2 is E, but we have E at the end. If we guess ""seine"", then position 2 is E, which we know is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again.

But let's see: ""seine"" is a word. But we have to consider the feedback.

If we guess ""seine"", then:
- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: E (if it is in the word, but we don't know if it is in position 2 or not)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

But we know E is in the word at position 5. If there is another E, it might be marked. But in the feedback, for ""crane"", we had E at position 5 marked, but if there was another E, it might have been marked with a dash if in wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only had one E, at position 5, so we don't know.

Similarly, in ""stone"", only one E at the end.

So it's possible that there is another E.

But to avoid complexity, and since we have few guesses, perhaps it's better to avoid using known letters again? Because if we use E in position 2, and it is not in the word (i.e., no duplicate), then we get an 'x' and we know no duplicate. But if it is in the word, we get a dash or correct.

But we don't know the position, so it might be a dash.

However, we are trying to solve the word, so we can try.

But let's list possible words: ""seine"" is S E I N E.

But E is not excluded? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated.

Similarly, ""scene"" has C, excluded.

""sheen"": S H E E N -> but then position 4 is E? We need position 4 to be N. ""sheen"" is S H E E N -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=N -> not matching, because we need position 4 to be N.

So not.

Therefore, the only common words are ""shine"", ""spine"", ""swine"", and perhaps ""sinew"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Another: ""spine"", ""shine"", ""swine"" are the main ones.

I think ""shine"" is a good choice because H and I are common.

But let's see the feedback we have: we know S is at 1, N at 4, E at 5, and we know T and O are absent.

So for the next guess, I'll go with ""shine"".

So the guess is ""shine"".

But note: we are on guess 3.

After this, we will get feedback on H and I.

If H is correct, then position 2 is H. If I is correct, position 3 is I.

If not, we get more information.

So let's do that.

Therefore, the new guess is ""shine"".

<guess>shine</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)  
  This means:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - C, R, and A are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: ""stone""** → S(✓), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)  
  This means:
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 1.
  - T and O are not in the secret word.
  - N (position 4) and E (position 5) are confirmed correct again.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ _ N E** (positions: 1=S, 4=N, 5=E).
- Positions 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters not yet excluded.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, T, O**.
- Since S, N, and E are already placed and no duplicates have been indicated in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now. Thus, positions 2 and 3 should avoid S, N, E and the excluded letters.
- Available letters for positions 2 and 3: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a valid 5-letter word of the form **S _ _ N E**.
- To maximize information, choose a word with common letters from the available set to test new possibilities for positions 2 and 3.
- ""shine"" (S H I N E) is a strong candidate because:
  - It tests **H** (position 2) and **I** (position 3), both common letters not yet tried.
  - H is a high-frequency consonant, and I is a vowel (since A and O are excluded, testing I is valuable).
  - If H or I is correct, we narrow down the positions; if not, we eliminate them.

### Next guess: **shine**
- This tests:
  - Position 1: S (✓, already confirmed).
  - Position 2: H (new).
  - Position 3: I (new).
  - Position 4: N (✓, confirmed).
  - Position 5: E (✓, confirmed).

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
- This means: 
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
  - C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)
- This means:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st).
  - T is not in the word (x).
  - O is not in the word (x).
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th) (already known).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th) (already known).

So, combining the feedback:

- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 1: S (from ""stone"" feedback: S(✓))
  - Position 4: N (from both)
  - Position 5: E (from both)

- Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T, O.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: S _ _ N E

We need to fill in the 2nd and 3rd positions.

We also know that the letters not in the word are: C, R, A, T, O.

So, available letters: all letters except C, R, A, T, O and the ones we know (S, N, E). But note: S, N, E are already placed, so we don't need to use them again in the unknown positions? Actually, we can't because the word is 5 letters and positions are fixed except 2 and 3.

The unknown positions (2 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not in the exclusion list: C, R, A, T, O.

Also, we must avoid using any letter that is already known to be in the word? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates so far. For example, in ""stone"", S was in position 1 and correct, but if there were another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, the rules don't specify, but typically in such games, each letter is marked independently. However, if a letter appears multiple times, it might be marked accordingly.

But in this case, we have no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now, unless feedback suggests otherwise.

Therefore, for positions 2 and 3, we need to choose two distinct letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding: C, R, A, T, O, and also excluding S, N, E (since they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates?).

But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could the word have two E's? We know E is at position 5, but it might appear elsewhere? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""stone"" didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know for sure.

However, to be safe, we should consider that the unknown positions could be any letter not excluded, including the possibility of duplicates? But the feedback for ""crane"" had E at the end, and if there was another E, it might have been marked? Actually, in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and marked correct. If there was an E in another position, and we didn't guess it, we wouldn't know. Similarly, in ""stone"", we only have E at the end.

So we cannot rule out duplicates. But without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for efficiency.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

So, the current state:

- Known: Position 1: S, Position 4: N, Position 5: E
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, T, O
- We have two positions to fill: 2 and 3.

We need to guess a word that starts with S, then two letters, then N, then E: S _ _ N E

We must avoid using the excluded letters in positions 2 and 3.

Also, we should avoid using S, N, E again in positions 2 or 3? Because if we assume no duplicates, then we cannot use S, N, E again. But if we allow duplicates, we could. However, since we have no evidence of duplicates, and to avoid confusion, it's better to assume no duplicates for now and use new letters.

Therefore, for positions 2 and 3, we choose from the remaining alphabet minus the excluded ones and minus S, N, E.

Remaining letters: 
Alphabet: A to Z, exclude C, R, A, T, O -> so exclude A, C, R, T, O.

Also exclude S, N, E (because they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates).

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form S _ _ N E.

Common words that fit this pattern:

- ""shine"": S H I N E -> but we have to check if H and I are available? H and I are in the available list. However, we don't know if they are in the word. But we are going to test them.

But note: in the feedback from ""stone"", we had T and O marked as absent. We don't have any feedback on H or I.

So ""shine"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""spine"": S P I N E -> P and I.

""swine"": S W I N E -> W and I.

""smile"": but that ends with LE, not NE. So not.

""shine"", ""spine"", ""swine"", ""sinew"": but ""sinew"" is S I N E W -> that's 5 letters, but then the pattern is S I N E W, which doesn't end with NE? Wait, it ends with EW, so not matching S _ _ N E. We need the last two to be N and E, so the word must end with ""NE"".

So ""sinew"" is S I N E W -> positions: 1=S, 2=I, 3=N, 4=E, 5=W -> but we need position 4 to be N and 5 to be E? So that doesn't match.

We need the word to have N at position 4 and E at position 5. So the word must be of the form ...N E at the end.

So ""shine"" is S H I N E -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=E -> perfect.

Similarly, ""spine"": S P I N E.

""swine"": S W I N E.

""scene"": but C is excluded -> invalid.

""skene"": not common, and K is available? But let's stick to common words.

""shine"" is a common word.

But we also have ""sine"": that's 4 letters.

Another: ""stone"" we already used.

We have ""shone"": but O is excluded.

""spine"", ""shine"", ""swine"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common to get more information.

Common letters: H, I, P, W, etc.

H is more common than W? In English, H is more frequent than W.

But we have two positions, so we can test two letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has one vowel and one consonant? We know that the word has at least one vowel (E) but we don't know about the others. We tested A and O and they are absent. So the only vowel we know is E. There might be other vowels: I, U, or sometimes Y.

So testing I is good because it's a vowel.

Similarly, we can test U? But in the pattern S _ _ N E, we can have words like ""sunne"" which is not a word? Or ""suing"" doesn't end with NE.

""suine"" is not a word.

So I is a good vowel to test.

Therefore, ""shine"" (with H and I) or ""spine"" (with P and I) are both good.

But H is more common than P? Let's see frequency:

According to English letter frequency, I is more common than H, and H is more common than P.

But we are testing two letters.

In ""shine"", we test H and I.

In ""spine"", we test P and I.

Since I is common, and we are testing it in both, the difference is H vs P.

H is more common than P, so ""shine"" might be better.

But we also have to consider that we might get it right.

Another candidate: ""smite"" doesn't end with NE.

""slide"" ends with DE.

So limited options.

We can also consider ""snipe"": but that would be S N I P E -> but position 4 is I? We need position 4 to be N. So ""snipe"" is S N I P E -> positions: 1=S, 2=N, 3=I, 4=P, 5=E -> but we need position 4 to be N, so that doesn't match.

We must have N at position 4, so the word must be S ? ? N E.

So ""snipe"" doesn't work.

Similarly, ""swine"": S W I N E -> that works.

""swipe"": S W I P E -> position 4 is P, not N -> invalid.

So the common words are: ""shine"", ""spine"", ""swine"".

Now, among these, ""shine"" has H and I, ""spine"" has P and I, ""swine"" has W and I.

We want to maximize the chance of getting information. Since I is in all, we are testing I in position 3.

Then we are testing either H, P, or W in position 2.

H is the most common of these.

But also, we can think about what words are possible.

We have two positions: 2 and 3.

We need to fill with two letters from the available set.

After this guess, we might get more feedback.

But we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two new vowels? But we only have I and U as possible vowels (since A, E, O are known: E is in, A and O are out). E is in, but we know its position. So for the unknown positions, we can have I or U or Y.

But in the pattern, we can have:

- Position 2: consonant or vowel
- Position 3: vowel or consonant

But in ""shine"", position 2 is H (consonant) and position 3 is I (vowel).

Similarly, ""spine"": P (consonant) and I (vowel).

""swine"": W (consonant) and I (vowel).

We could have a word with a vowel in position 2? For example, ""sinew"" doesn't fit. ""saine"" not a word. ""seine"" -> S E I N E, but E is already in position 5, and we have E in position 2? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in ""seine"", position 2 is E, but we have E at the end. If we guess ""seine"", then position 2 is E, which we know is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again.

But let's see: ""seine"" is a word. But we have to consider the feedback.

If we guess ""seine"", then:
- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: E (if it is in the word, but we don't know if it is in position 2 or not)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

But we know E is in the word at position 5. If there is another E, it might be marked. But in the feedback, for ""crane"", we had E at position 5 marked, but if there was another E, it might have been marked with a dash if in wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only had one E, at position 5, so we don't know.

Similarly, in ""stone"", only one E at the end.

So it's possible that there is another E.

But to avoid complexity, and since we have few guesses, perhaps it's better to avoid using known letters again? Because if we use E in position 2, and it is not in the word (i.e., no duplicate), then we get an 'x' and we know no duplicate. But if it is in the word, we get a dash or correct.

But we don't know the position, so it might be a dash.

However, we are trying to solve the word, so we can try.

But let's list possible words: ""seine"" is S E I N E.

But E is not excluded? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated.

Similarly, ""scene"" has C, excluded.

""sheen"": S H E E N -> but then position 4 is E? We need position 4 to be N. ""sheen"" is S H E E N -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=N -> not matching, because we need position 4 to be N.

So not.

Therefore, the only common words are ""shine"", ""spine"", ""swine"", and perhaps ""sinew"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Another: ""spine"", ""shine"", ""swine"" are the main ones.

I think ""shine"" is a good choice because H and I are common.

But let's see the feedback we have: we know S is at 1, N at 4, E at 5, and we know T and O are absent.

So for the next guess, I'll go with ""shine"".

So the guess is ""shine"".

But note: we are on guess 3.

After this, we will get feedback on H and I.

If H is correct, then position 2 is H. If I is correct, position 3 is I.

If not, we get more information.

So let's do that.

Therefore, the new guess is ""shine"".

<guess>shine</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)  
  This means:
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - C, R, and A are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: ""stone""** → S(✓), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)  
  This means:
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 1.
  - T and O are not in the secret word.
  - N (position 4) and E (position 5) are confirmed correct again.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ _ N E** (positions: 1=S, 4=N, 5=E).
- Positions 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters not yet excluded.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, T, O**.
- Since S, N, and E are already placed and no duplicates have been indicated in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now. Thus, positions 2 and 3 should avoid S, N, E and the excluded letters.
- Available letters for positions 2 and 3: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a valid 5-letter word of the form **S _ _ N E**.
- To maximize information, choose a word with common letters from the available set to test new possibilities for positions 2 and 3.
- ""shine"" (S H I N E) is a strong candidate because:
  - It tests **H** (position 2) and **I** (position 3), both common letters not yet tried.
  - H is a high-frequency consonant, and I is a vowel (since A and O are excluded, testing I is valuable).
  - If H or I is correct, we narrow down the positions; if not, we eliminate them.

### Next guess: **shine**
- This tests:
  - Position 1: S (✓, already confirmed).
  - Position 2: H (new).
  - Position 3: I (new).
  - Position 4: N (✓, confirmed).
  - Position 5: E (✓, confirmed).",Guess 3: shine -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
