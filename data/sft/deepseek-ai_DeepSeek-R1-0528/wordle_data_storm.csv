We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are absent.

We must avoid using C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We also know that R must be included, but not in position 2.

We have 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We should try to use a word that:
- Includes R (but not in position 2)
- Does not include C, A, N, E
- Uses other common letters to get more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, U, etc.

We also want to cover different positions for R.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have R in one of these positions and avoid the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E.

We can use: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

Example words:
- If R is in position 1: words like ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"", but we cannot use A (in ROAST) and we cannot use E? ROAST has A and S, T. But A is forbidden. So not ROAST.
  - Instead: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROILS""? But that has I and L, S. And no forbidden letters? ROILS: R, O, I, L, S. No C,A,N,E. Valid.

But we also want to cover other common letters.

Another idea: ""SPORT"" - but that has O and T, and R in position 4? S P O R T -> R is in position 4. But we have to avoid A, but S,P,O,R,T are allowed. However, we have only 5 letters: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). But we don't know if R is in position 4. We are trying to test R in different positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 1 and then use other common letters.

Let me list some words without C,A,N,E and with R not in position 2:

- R in position 1: 
  - ROBOT: R O B O T -> but O is repeated? Actually, it's R-O-B-O-T, so two O's. But that's acceptable. Letters: R, O, B, T. (O repeated). But we don't know if O is in the word. We can use it.
  - ROILS: R O I L S -> no repeats, and uses common letters.

- R in position 3: 
  - WORD: W O R D -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters. 
  - How about ""THIRD"": T H I R D -> R in position 4? Let's count: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R is in position 4, not 3.
  - For R in position 3: ""STORM"" -> S T O R M -> R is in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So position 4.
  - ""BIRDS"": B I R D S -> R in position 3. But we have S at the end. And B,I,R,D,S. No forbidden letters.

- R in position 4: 
  - ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> R in position 4.

- R in position 5:
  - ""MIRTH"": M I R T H -> R is in position 3? M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So not position 5.
  - ""FUROR"": F U R O R -> R in position 3 and 5? But we have two R's. And we don't know if the word has two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one R in ""crane"", and it was marked as present but wrong position, it doesn't tell us if there are multiple R's. So we cannot assume only one R.

But to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters for now.

We also want to test other vowels because we only have R so far. We know the word has at least one R, and we have eliminated A and E (and C, N). So the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We should try to include I and O to check for vowels.

I am considering ""ROILS"": 
- R in position 1 (so not position 2, which is good), O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.

But we are putting R in position 1, which is a possibility. And we are testing O, I, L, S.

Another option: ""SPRIT"" - but that has P, R, I, T, and S? S P R I T -> R is in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), T(5). So R in position 3. And no forbidden letters.

But ""SPRIT"" is a word? It means a small sprout or a spirit. It's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""THIRD"" is 5 letters? T-H-I-R-D, that's 5: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R in position 4.

We have multiple options.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good choice because:
- It has R in position 1 (testing a new position for R)
- It has two vowels: O and I (in positions 2 and 3) which we haven't tested.
- It has L and S, which are common consonants.

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R in position 1. We are also testing O in position 2 and I in position 3.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and also covers more common consonants.

Another classic second guess is to use a word with the known letter and new letters.

I think I'll go with ""ROILS"".

But let me check if it's valid: ROILS is a word (to agitate or stir up).

So, next guess: ""ROILS""

We are hoping to get more information about the R and also test O, I, L, S.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E.

""ROILS"" does not contain any of these.

So, I'll go with ""roils"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include R, but not in position 2 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to gather more information.
- Aim to cover multiple positions for R and other letters.

The word ""roils"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R (in position 1, avoiding position 2).
- Uses new vowels (O, I) and consonants (L, S) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R in position 1. We are also testing O in position 2 and I in position 3.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and also covers more common consonants.

Another classic second guess is to use a word with the known letter and new letters.

I think I'll go with ""ROILS"".

But let me check if it's valid: ROILS is a word (to agitate or stir up).

So, next guess: ""ROILS""

We are hoping to get more information about the R and also test O, I, L, S.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E.

""ROILS"" does not contain any of these.

So, I'll go with ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include R, but not in position 2 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to gather more information.
- Aim to cover multiple positions for R and other letters.

The word ""roils"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R (in position 1, avoiding position 2).
- Uses new vowels (O, I) and consonants (L, S) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

So not position 5.\n  - ""FUROR"": F U R O R -> R in position 3 and 5? But we have two R\'s. And we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one R in ""crane"", and it was marked as present but wrong position, it doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple R\'s. So we cannot assume only one R.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters for now.\n\nWe also want to test other vowels because we only have R so far. We know the word has at least one R, and we have eliminated A and E (and C, N). So the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s avoid Y for now).\n\nWe should try to include I and O to check for vowels.\n\nI am considering ""ROILS"": \n- R in position 1 (so not position 2, which is good), O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we are putting R in position 1, which is a possibility. And we are testing O, I, L, S.\n\nAnother option: ""SPRIT"" - but that has P, R, I, T, and S? S P R I T -> R is in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), T(5). So R in position 3. And no forbidden letters.\n\nBut ""SPRIT"" is a word? It means a small sprout or a spirit. It\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""THIRD"" is 5 letters? T-H-I-R-D, that\'s 5: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R in position 4.\n\nWe have multiple options.\n\nI think ""ROILS"" is a good choice because:\n- It has R in position 1 (testing a new position for R)\n- It has two vowels: O and I (in positions 2 and 3) which we haven\'t tested.\n- It has L and S, which are common consonants.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was wrong.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C: absent (not in the word)
- R: present but in the wrong position (not in position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Meaning:
- R: present but in the wrong position (and since it was in position 1 in this guess, it's not in position 1 either)
- O: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so not there)
- I: absent
- L: absent
- S: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so not there)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L
Present letters (but position unknown): R, O, S

We also know that R is not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1: not 2, guess2: not 1).
Similarly, O is not in position 2 (from guess2) and S is not in position 5 (from guess2).

We have 5 positions. The secret word must contain R, O, and S, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet (since we have only used C,R,A,N,E,R,O,I,L,S and we know C,A,N,E,I,L are absent).

The remaining letters to choose from are the alphabet minus the absent ones: 
Absent: C, A, N, E, I, L
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we have to form a 5-letter word).

But we know the word has R, O, S, and two more letters from the available set.

Also, note that R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
O cannot be in position 2, so O can be in 1,3,4,5 (but note position 1 is still available for O? But we don't know yet).
S cannot be in position 5, so S can be in 1,2,3,4.

We need to form a word that includes R, O, S and two new letters, and we want to test the positions.

We also want to avoid the absent letters.

Let's think of words that have R, O, S and two other available letters.

Common letters: T, B, D, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words:

- ""PORTS"": P O R T S -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2 (from guess2: O was in position 2 and marked wrong). So if we put O in position 2 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position, so we can avoid position 2 for O.

But ""PORTS"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

How about ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> 
- S in position 1 (which is allowed, since S can be in 1)
- P is new
- O in position 3 (not 2, so allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R can be in 4)
- T in position 5 (and S cannot be in 5, but here S is in 1, so that's fine)

But note: in ""SPORT"", we have R in position 4 and O in position 3. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing.

Also, we are introducing P and T.

But wait, we have to check if we are repeating any absent letters? P and T are not in the absent list (absent: C,A,N,E,I,L). So that's fine.

Another possibility: ""ROAST"" but A is absent, so not allowed.

""FORTS"": F O R T S -> O in position 2? Not allowed because O cannot be in 2. So we avoid.

""TORUS"": T O R U S -> O in position 2? Again, position 2 is bad for O.

We need to avoid putting O in position 2.

So, let's try to put O in position 1,3,4, or 5.

Similarly, R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,2,3,4.

Let me try to list:

Option 1: O in position 1: then we can have O _ _ _ _ 
But we need R and S. And we know R cannot be in 1 or 2, so R must be in 3,4,5. And S can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5? Actually, S can be in 2,3,4 because it cannot be in 5? Wait, from guess2, S was in position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. So S can be in 1,2,3,4.

But if O is in 1, then S can be in 2,3,4.

Example: ""OPSIS"" - but that has I and I, and I is absent. Not allowed.

""ORTHS"" - but H is allowed? ""ORTHS"" is a word? It might be archaic, but let's avoid.

Option 2: O in position 3: then we can have _ _ O _ _
We can put R in 4 or 5, and S in 1,2, or 4 (if R is not in 4) or 1,2 if R is in 4.

For example: 
- ""SPORT"": S(1) P(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> as I thought earlier.

Another: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same pattern.

But in ""SHORT"", we have H and T, which are new.

Option 3: O in position 4: then _ _ _ O _
We can put R in 3 or 5, and S in 1,2, or 3 (if R is not in 3) or 1,2 if R is in 3.

Example: ""FROST"": F(1) R(2) O(3) S(4) T(5) -> but wait, R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess). So that's invalid.

Another: ""BROWS"": B(1) R(2) O(3) W(4) S(5) -> again R in 2, invalid.

We cannot put R in position 2.

So for O in position 4, we need R in 3 or 5.

Example: ""DROPS"": D(1) R(2) O(3) P(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

""PROWS"": P(1) R(2) O(3) W(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

It's hard to have O in position 4 without R in 2? 

How about: ""TORSK"": T(1) O(2) R(3) S(4) K(5) -> but O is in position 2, which is forbidden for O. So not allowed.

Another: ""GORSE"": but E is absent.

So maybe O in position 4 is difficult.

Option 4: O in position 5: then _ _ _ _ O
We can put R in 3 or 4, and S in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5, which is taken by O).

Example: ""BROOD"" -> but O repeated and we don't know if O is repeated? But also, we have B and D. However, ""BROOD"" has O in position 3 and 4? B(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), D(5). But R is in position 2, which is forbidden. So invalid.

""PROSO"" -> not a common word.

""TROIS"": T(1) R(2) O(3) I(4) S(5) -> but R in 2 (forbidden) and I is absent. Not allowed.

So it seems that having O in position 5 is also challenging.

Therefore, the most feasible is to put O in position 3, as in ""SPORT"" or ""SHORT"".

Now, between ""SPORT"" and ""SHORT"", both are valid words and use new letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""SPORT"", we use P and T. In ""SHORT"", we use H and T. Both are good.

But note: we have S in position 1 in both. We don't know if S is in position 1, but we are testing it.

Alternatively, we could put S in a different position to test.

But we have limited options.

Another word: ""STROP"" -> S(1) T(2) R(3) O(4) P(5). 
This has O in position 4 (which we haven't tested) and R in position 3 (which is allowed). Also, S in 1 and T and P new.

But is ""STROP"" a word? Yes, it means a strap or a device for sharpening razors.

But let's see the positions: 
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since not 1 or 2)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since not 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, and we are testing if it's correct)

We are also introducing T and P.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is more common.

We could also consider ""ROUPS"" (a Scottish word for an auction) but R is in position 1, which we now know is wrong (from guess2: R was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so R is not in position 1). So we cannot put R in 1.

Similarly, we cannot put R in 2.

So R must be in 3,4,5.

In ""STROP"", R is in 3, which is fine.

But let me compare:

- ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5)
  - Tests S in 1, P in 2, O in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

- ""STROP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), O(4), P(5)
  - Tests S in 1, T in 2, R in 3, O in 4, P in 5.

Both are valid. But note that in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in position 3 and R in 4. In ""STROP"", O in 4 and R in 3.

We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

But we also know that S is present and not in position 5, but we don't know about position 1. Similarly, we don't know about the other positions.

Another word: ""PORTS"" is invalid because O is in 2.

""TRODS"" -> T(1) R(2) O(3) D(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

""DOORS"" -> D(1) O(2) O(3) R(4) S(5) -> O in 2, invalid.

So I think ""SPORT"" or ""STROP"" are good.

But let me think about the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R, O, S and two new letters, and also avoids putting any of these in positions we know are wrong.

We know:
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 -> so positions 3,4,5
- O cannot be in 2 -> so 1,3,4,5
- S cannot be in 5 -> so 1,2,3,4

We also have two more letters to include.

We want to cover as many new positions as possible.

In ""SPORT"":
- S in 1: we don't know if correct, but we are testing.
- P in 2: new letter, new position.
- O in 3: new position for O (we haven't tested position 3 for O)
- R in 4: new position for R (we had R in 2 and 1, now 4)
- T in 5: new letter.

In ""STROP"":
- S in 1: same
- T in 2: new letter, new position.
- R in 3: new position for R (we had 1 and 2, now 3)
- O in 4: new position for O (we had 2, now 4)
- P in 5: new letter.

Both are similar.

But note: in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in 3 and R in 4, which are adjacent. In ""STROP"", R in 3 and O in 4, also adjacent. So no big difference.

I think I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it's a more common word.

But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same as SPORT but with H instead of P.

""SHORT"" is also common.

But we don't have a reason to prefer one over the other.

We can also consider ""FORMS"", but F O R M S -> O in 2? Not allowed.

""GOURD"": G O U R D -> O in 2, not allowed.

""COURT"": but C is absent.

So, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any absent letters. In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,E,I,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, I will guess ""sport"".

But note: we are also testing if S is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. Similarly for the others.

We might get more information.

So, the next guess is ""sport"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""roils""** → R (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), I (absent), L (absent), S (present, wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, I, L (cannot be used).
- **Present letters (must be included)**: R, O, S.
  - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from ""roils"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - O is not in position 2 (from ""roils"").
  - S is not in position 5 (from ""roils"").
- **Available positions**:
  - R: Can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  - O: Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
  - S: Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include R, O, and S.
  - Use two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L).
  - Test R, O, and S in new positions to narrow down possibilities.
  - Prioritize common letters (e.g., T, P, H) to maximize information.

### Why ""sport""?
- **Word**: ""sport"" (S-P-O-R-T).
  - **S in position 1**: Tests if S is correct in position 1 (since S cannot be in 5, but position 1 is untested).
  - **P in position 2**: Introduces a new common consonant (P) and tests an untested position.
  - **O in position 3**: Tests O in a new position (not 2, as previously ruled out).
  - **R in position 4**: Tests R in a new position (not 1 or 2, as ruled out).
  - **T in position 5**: Introduces a new common consonant (T) and tests position 5.
- **Advantages**:
  - Uses all three present letters (R, O, S) while avoiding forbidden positions.
  - Introduces two new common letters (P and T) to gather more feedback.
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, I, L).
  - Tests multiple positions simultaneously, which could confirm or rule out several possibilities with one guess.

This guess should provide strong feedback to help identify the secret word in subsequent attempts.

<guess>sport</guess>",sport,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C: absent (not in the word)
- R: present but in the wrong position (not in position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)

- S: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so not there)

Present letters (but position unknown): R, O, S

We also know that R is not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1: not 2, guess2: not 1).
Similarly, O is not in position 2 (from guess2) and S is not in position 5 (from guess2).

We have 5 positions. The secret word must contain R, O, and S, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet (since we have only used C,R,A,N,E,R,O,I,L,S and we know C,A,N,E,I,L are absent).

Absent: C, A, N, E, I, L
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we have to form a 5-letter word).

But we know the word has R, O, S, and two more letters from the available set.

Also, note that R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
O cannot be in position 2, so O can be in 1,3,4,5 (but note position 1 is still available for O? But we don't know yet).
S cannot be in position 5, so S can be in 1,2,3,4.

We need to form a word that includes R, O, S and two new letters, and we want to test the positions.

- ""PORTS"": P O R T S -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2 (from guess2: O was in position 2 and marked wrong). So if we put O in position 2 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position, so we can avoid position 2 for O.

But ""PORTS"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

How about ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> 
- S in position 1 (which is allowed, since S can be in 1)
- P is new
- O in position 3 (not 2, so allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R can be in 4)
- T in position 5 (and S cannot be in 5, but here S is in 1, so that's fine)

But note: in ""SPORT"", we have R in position 4 and O in position 3. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing.

Also, we are introducing P and T.

But wait, we have to check if we are repeating any absent letters? P and T are not in the absent list (absent: C,A,N,E,I,L). So that's fine.

Another possibility: ""ROAST"" but A is absent, so not allowed.

""FORTS"": F O R T S -> O in position 2? Not allowed because O cannot be in 2. So we avoid.

""TORUS"": T O R U S -> O in position 2? Again, position 2 is bad for O.

We need to avoid putting O in position 2.

So, let's try to put O in position 1,3,4, or 5.

Similarly, R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,2,3,4.

Let me try to list:

Option 1: O in position 1: then we can have O _ _ _ _ 
But we need R and S. And we know R cannot be in 1 or 2, so R must be in 3,4,5. And S can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5? Actually, S can be in 2,3,4 because it cannot be in 5? Wait, from guess2, S was in position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. So S can be in 1,2,3,4.

But if O is in 1, then S can be in 2,3,4.

Example: ""OPSIS"" - but that has I and I, and I is absent. Not allowed.

""ORTHS"" - but H is allowed? ""ORTHS"" is a word? It might be archaic, but let's avoid.

Option 2: O in position 3: then we can have _ _ O _ _
We can put R in 4 or 5, and S in 1,2, or 4 (if R is not in 4) or 1,2 if R is in 4.

For example: 
- ""SPORT"": S(1) P(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> as I thought earlier.

Another: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same pattern.

But in ""SHORT"", we have H and T, which are new.

Option 3: O in position 4: then _ _ _ O _
We can put R in 3 or 5, and S in 1,2, or 3 (if R is not in 3) or 1,2 if R is in 3.

Example: ""FROST"": F(1) R(2) O(3) S(4) T(5) -> but wait, R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess). So that's invalid.

Another: ""BROWS"": B(1) R(2) O(3) W(4) S(5) -> again R in 2, invalid.

We cannot put R in position 2.

So for O in position 4, we need R in 3 or 5.

Example: ""DROPS"": D(1) R(2) O(3) P(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

""PROWS"": P(1) R(2) O(3) W(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

It's hard to have O in position 4 without R in 2? 

How about: ""TORSK"": T(1) O(2) R(3) S(4) K(5) -> but O is in position 2, which is forbidden for O. So not allowed.

Another: ""GORSE"": but E is absent.

So maybe O in position 4 is difficult.

Option 4: O in position 5: then _ _ _ _ O
We can put R in 3 or 4, and S in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5, which is taken by O).

Example: ""BROOD"" -> but O repeated and we don't know if O is repeated? But also, we have B and D. However, ""BROOD"" has O in position 3 and 4? B(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), D(5). But R is in position 2, which is forbidden. So invalid.

""PROSO"" -> not a common word.

""TROIS"": T(1) R(2) O(3) I(4) S(5) -> but R in 2 (forbidden) and I is absent. Not allowed.

So it seems that having O in position 5 is also challenging.

Therefore, the most feasible is to put O in position 3, as in ""SPORT"" or ""SHORT"".

Now, between ""SPORT"" and ""SHORT"", both are valid words and use new letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""SPORT"", we use P and T. In ""SHORT"", we use H and T. Both are good.

But note: we have S in position 1 in both. We don't know if S is in position 1, but we are testing it.

Alternatively, we could put S in a different position to test.

But we have limited options.

Another word: ""STROP"" -> S(1) T(2) R(3) O(4) P(5). 
This has O in position 4 (which we haven't tested) and R in position 3 (which is allowed). Also, S in 1 and T and P new.

But is ""STROP"" a word? Yes, it means a strap or a device for sharpening razors.

But let's see the positions: 
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since not 1 or 2)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since not 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, and we are testing if it's correct)

We are also introducing T and P.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is more common.

We could also consider ""ROUPS"" (a Scottish word for an auction) but R is in position 1, which we now know is wrong (from guess2: R was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so R is not in position 1). So we cannot put R in 1.

Similarly, we cannot put R in 2.

So R must be in 3,4,5.

In ""STROP"", R is in 3, which is fine.

But let me compare:

- ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5)
  - Tests S in 1, P in 2, O in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

- ""STROP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), O(4), P(5)
  - Tests S in 1, T in 2, R in 3, O in 4, P in 5.

Both are valid. But note that in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in position 3 and R in 4. In ""STROP"", O in 4 and R in 3.

We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

But we also know that S is present and not in position 5, but we don't know about position 1. Similarly, we don't know about the other positions.

Another word: ""PORTS"" is invalid because O is in 2.

""TRODS"" -> T(1) R(2) O(3) D(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

""DOORS"" -> D(1) O(2) O(3) R(4) S(5) -> O in 2, invalid.

So I think ""SPORT"" or ""STROP"" are good.

But let me think about the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R, O, S and two new letters, and also avoids putting any of these in positions we know are wrong.

We know:
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 -> so positions 3,4,5
- O cannot be in 2 -> so 1,3,4,5
- S cannot be in 5 -> so 1,2,3,4

We also have two more letters to include.

We want to cover as many new positions as possible.

In ""SPORT"":
- S in 1: we don't know if correct, but we are testing.
- P in 2: new letter, new position.
- O in 3: new position for O (we haven't tested position 3 for O)
- R in 4: new position for R (we had R in 2 and 1, now 4)
- T in 5: new letter.

In ""STROP"":
- S in 1: same
- T in 2: new letter, new position.
- R in 3: new position for R (we had 1 and 2, now 3)
- O in 4: new position for O (we had 2, now 4)
- P in 5: new letter.

Both are similar.

But note: in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in 3 and R in 4, which are adjacent. In ""STROP"", R in 3 and O in 4, also adjacent. So no big difference.

I think I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it's a more common word.

But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same as SPORT but with H instead of P.

""SHORT"" is also common.

But we don't have a reason to prefer one over the other.

We can also consider ""FORMS"", but F O R M S -> O in 2? Not allowed.

""GOURD"": G O U R D -> O in 2, not allowed.

""COURT"": but C is absent.

So, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any absent letters. In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,E,I,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, I will guess ""sport"".

But note: we are also testing if S is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. Similarly for the others.

We might get more information.

So, the next guess is ""sport"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""roils""** → R (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), I (absent), L (absent), S (present, wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, I, L (cannot be used).
- **Present letters (must be included)**: R, O, S.
  - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from ""roils"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - O is not in position 2 (from ""roils"").
  - S is not in position 5 (from ""roils"").
- **Available positions**:
  - R: Can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  - O: Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
  - S: Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include R, O, and S.
  - Use two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L).
  - Test R, O, and S in new positions to narrow down possibilities.
  - Prioritize common letters (e.g., T, P, H) to maximize information.

### Why ""sport""?
- **Word**: ""sport"" (S-P-O-R-T).
  - **S in position 1**: Tests if S is correct in position 1 (since S cannot be in 5, but position 1 is untested).
  - **P in position 2**: Introduces a new common consonant (P) and tests an untested position.
  - **O in position 3**: Tests O in a new position (not 2, as previously ruled out).
  - **R in position 4**: Tests R in a new position (not 1 or 2, as ruled out).
  - **T in position 5**: Introduces a new common consonant (T) and tests position 5.
- **Advantages**:
  - Uses all three present letters (R, O, S) while avoiding forbidden positions.
  - Introduces two new common letters (P and T) to gather more feedback.
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, I, L).
  - Tests multiple positions simultaneously, which could confirm or rule out several possibilities with one guess.

This guess should provide strong feedback to help identify the secret word in subsequent attempts.",Guess 3: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,storm,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- A, N, E are not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are absent.

We must avoid using C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We also know that R must be included, but not in position 2.

We have 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We should try to use a word that:
- Includes R (but not in position 2)
- Does not include C, A, N, E
- Uses other common letters to get more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, U, etc.

We also want to cover different positions for R.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have R in one of these positions and avoid the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E.

We can use: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

Example words:
- If R is in position 1: words like ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"", but we cannot use A (in ROAST) and we cannot use E? ROAST has A and S, T. But A is forbidden. So not ROAST.
  - Instead: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROILS""? But that has I and L, S. And no forbidden letters? ROILS: R, O, I, L, S. No C,A,N,E. Valid.

But we also want to cover other common letters.

Another idea: ""SPORT"" - but that has O and T, and R in position 4? S P O R T -> R is in position 4. But we have to avoid A, but S,P,O,R,T are allowed. However, we have only 5 letters: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). But we don't know if R is in position 4. We are trying to test R in different positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 1 and then use other common letters.

Let me list some words without C,A,N,E and with R not in position 2:

- R in position 1: 
  - ROBOT: R O B O T -> but O is repeated? Actually, it's R-O-B-O-T, so two O's. But that's acceptable. Letters: R, O, B, T. (O repeated). But we don't know if O is in the word. We can use it.
  - ROILS: R O I L S -> no repeats, and uses common letters.

- R in position 3: 
  - WORD: W O R D -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters. 
  - How about ""THIRD"": T H I R D -> R in position 4? Let's count: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R is in position 4, not 3.
  - For R in position 3: ""STORM"" -> S T O R M -> R is in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So position 4.
  - ""BIRDS"": B I R D S -> R in position 3. But we have S at the end. And B,I,R,D,S. No forbidden letters.

- R in position 4: 
  - ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> R in position 4.

- R in position 5:
  - ""MIRTH"": M I R T H -> R is in position 3? M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So not position 5.
  - ""FUROR"": F U R O R -> R in position 3 and 5? But we have two R's. And we don't know if the word has two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one R in ""crane"", and it was marked as present but wrong position, it doesn't tell us if there are multiple R's. So we cannot assume only one R.

But to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters for now.

We also want to test other vowels because we only have R so far. We know the word has at least one R, and we have eliminated A and E (and C, N). So the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We should try to include I and O to check for vowels.

I am considering ""ROILS"": 
- R in position 1 (so not position 2, which is good), O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.

But we are putting R in position 1, which is a possibility. And we are testing O, I, L, S.

Another option: ""SPRIT"" - but that has P, R, I, T, and S? S P R I T -> R is in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), T(5). So R in position 3. And no forbidden letters.

But ""SPRIT"" is a word? It means a small sprout or a spirit. It's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""THIRD"" is 5 letters? T-H-I-R-D, that's 5: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R in position 4.

We have multiple options.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good choice because:
- It has R in position 1 (testing a new position for R)
- It has two vowels: O and I (in positions 2 and 3) which we haven't tested.
- It has L and S, which are common consonants.

But note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R in position 1. We are also testing O in position 2 and I in position 3.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and also covers more common consonants.

Another classic second guess is to use a word with the known letter and new letters.

I think I'll go with ""ROILS"".

But let me check if it's valid: ROILS is a word (to agitate or stir up).

So, next guess: ""ROILS""

We are hoping to get more information about the R and also test O, I, L, S.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E.

""ROILS"" does not contain any of these.

So, I'll go with ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include R, but not in position 2 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to gather more information.
- Aim to cover multiple positions for R and other letters.

The word ""roils"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R (in position 1, avoiding position 2).
- Uses new vowels (O, I) and consonants (L, S) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

<guess>roils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C: absent (not in the word)
- R: present but in the wrong position (not in position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Meaning:
- R: present but in the wrong position (and since it was in position 1 in this guess, it's not in position 1 either)
- O: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so not there)
- I: absent
- L: absent
- S: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so not there)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L
Present letters (but position unknown): R, O, S

We also know that R is not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1: not 2, guess2: not 1).
Similarly, O is not in position 2 (from guess2) and S is not in position 5 (from guess2).

We have 5 positions. The secret word must contain R, O, and S, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet (since we have only used C,R,A,N,E,R,O,I,L,S and we know C,A,N,E,I,L are absent).

The remaining letters to choose from are the alphabet minus the absent ones: 
Absent: C, A, N, E, I, L
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we have to form a 5-letter word).

But we know the word has R, O, S, and two more letters from the available set.

Also, note that R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
O cannot be in position 2, so O can be in 1,3,4,5 (but note position 1 is still available for O? But we don't know yet).
S cannot be in position 5, so S can be in 1,2,3,4.

We need to form a word that includes R, O, S and two new letters, and we want to test the positions.

We also want to avoid the absent letters.

Let's think of words that have R, O, S and two other available letters.

Common letters: T, B, D, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words:

- ""PORTS"": P O R T S -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2 (from guess2: O was in position 2 and marked wrong). So if we put O in position 2 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to find the correct position, so we can avoid position 2 for O.

But ""PORTS"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

How about ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> 
- S in position 1 (which is allowed, since S can be in 1)
- P is new
- O in position 3 (not 2, so allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R can be in 4)
- T in position 5 (and S cannot be in 5, but here S is in 1, so that's fine)

But note: in ""SPORT"", we have R in position 4 and O in position 3. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing.

Also, we are introducing P and T.

But wait, we have to check if we are repeating any absent letters? P and T are not in the absent list (absent: C,A,N,E,I,L). So that's fine.

Another possibility: ""ROAST"" but A is absent, so not allowed.

""FORTS"": F O R T S -> O in position 2? Not allowed because O cannot be in 2. So we avoid.

""TORUS"": T O R U S -> O in position 2? Again, position 2 is bad for O.

We need to avoid putting O in position 2.

So, let's try to put O in position 1,3,4, or 5.

Similarly, R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,2,3,4.

Let me try to list:

Option 1: O in position 1: then we can have O _ _ _ _ 
But we need R and S. And we know R cannot be in 1 or 2, so R must be in 3,4,5. And S can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5? Actually, S can be in 2,3,4 because it cannot be in 5? Wait, from guess2, S was in position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. So S can be in 1,2,3,4.

But if O is in 1, then S can be in 2,3,4.

Example: ""OPSIS"" - but that has I and I, and I is absent. Not allowed.

""ORTHS"" - but H is allowed? ""ORTHS"" is a word? It might be archaic, but let's avoid.

Option 2: O in position 3: then we can have _ _ O _ _
We can put R in 4 or 5, and S in 1,2, or 4 (if R is not in 4) or 1,2 if R is in 4.

For example: 
- ""SPORT"": S(1) P(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> as I thought earlier.

Another: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same pattern.

But in ""SHORT"", we have H and T, which are new.

Option 3: O in position 4: then _ _ _ O _
We can put R in 3 or 5, and S in 1,2, or 3 (if R is not in 3) or 1,2 if R is in 3.

Example: ""FROST"": F(1) R(2) O(3) S(4) T(5) -> but wait, R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess). So that's invalid.

Another: ""BROWS"": B(1) R(2) O(3) W(4) S(5) -> again R in 2, invalid.

We cannot put R in position 2.

So for O in position 4, we need R in 3 or 5.

Example: ""DROPS"": D(1) R(2) O(3) P(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

""PROWS"": P(1) R(2) O(3) W(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

It's hard to have O in position 4 without R in 2? 

How about: ""TORSK"": T(1) O(2) R(3) S(4) K(5) -> but O is in position 2, which is forbidden for O. So not allowed.

Another: ""GORSE"": but E is absent.

So maybe O in position 4 is difficult.

Option 4: O in position 5: then _ _ _ _ O
We can put R in 3 or 4, and S in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5, which is taken by O).

Example: ""BROOD"" -> but O repeated and we don't know if O is repeated? But also, we have B and D. However, ""BROOD"" has O in position 3 and 4? B(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), D(5). But R is in position 2, which is forbidden. So invalid.

""PROSO"" -> not a common word.

""TROIS"": T(1) R(2) O(3) I(4) S(5) -> but R in 2 (forbidden) and I is absent. Not allowed.

So it seems that having O in position 5 is also challenging.

Therefore, the most feasible is to put O in position 3, as in ""SPORT"" or ""SHORT"".

Now, between ""SPORT"" and ""SHORT"", both are valid words and use new letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""SPORT"", we use P and T. In ""SHORT"", we use H and T. Both are good.

But note: we have S in position 1 in both. We don't know if S is in position 1, but we are testing it.

Alternatively, we could put S in a different position to test.

But we have limited options.

Another word: ""STROP"" -> S(1) T(2) R(3) O(4) P(5). 
This has O in position 4 (which we haven't tested) and R in position 3 (which is allowed). Also, S in 1 and T and P new.

But is ""STROP"" a word? Yes, it means a strap or a device for sharpening razors.

But let's see the positions: 
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since not 1 or 2)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since not 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, and we are testing if it's correct)

We are also introducing T and P.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is more common.

We could also consider ""ROUPS"" (a Scottish word for an auction) but R is in position 1, which we now know is wrong (from guess2: R was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so R is not in position 1). So we cannot put R in 1.

Similarly, we cannot put R in 2.

So R must be in 3,4,5.

In ""STROP"", R is in 3, which is fine.

But let me compare:

- ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5)
  - Tests S in 1, P in 2, O in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

- ""STROP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), O(4), P(5)
  - Tests S in 1, T in 2, R in 3, O in 4, P in 5.

Both are valid. But note that in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in position 3 and R in 4. In ""STROP"", O in 4 and R in 3.

We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

But we also know that S is present and not in position 5, but we don't know about position 1. Similarly, we don't know about the other positions.

Another word: ""PORTS"" is invalid because O is in 2.

""TRODS"" -> T(1) R(2) O(3) D(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.

""DOORS"" -> D(1) O(2) O(3) R(4) S(5) -> O in 2, invalid.

So I think ""SPORT"" or ""STROP"" are good.

But let me think about the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R, O, S and two new letters, and also avoids putting any of these in positions we know are wrong.

We know:
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 -> so positions 3,4,5
- O cannot be in 2 -> so 1,3,4,5
- S cannot be in 5 -> so 1,2,3,4

We also have two more letters to include.

We want to cover as many new positions as possible.

In ""SPORT"":
- S in 1: we don't know if correct, but we are testing.
- P in 2: new letter, new position.
- O in 3: new position for O (we haven't tested position 3 for O)
- R in 4: new position for R (we had R in 2 and 1, now 4)
- T in 5: new letter.

In ""STROP"":
- S in 1: same
- T in 2: new letter, new position.
- R in 3: new position for R (we had 1 and 2, now 3)
- O in 4: new position for O (we had 2, now 4)
- P in 5: new letter.

Both are similar.

But note: in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in 3 and R in 4, which are adjacent. In ""STROP"", R in 3 and O in 4, also adjacent. So no big difference.

I think I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it's a more common word.

But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same as SPORT but with H instead of P.

""SHORT"" is also common.

But we don't have a reason to prefer one over the other.

We can also consider ""FORMS"", but F O R M S -> O in 2? Not allowed.

""GOURD"": G O U R D -> O in 2, not allowed.

""COURT"": but C is absent.

So, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any absent letters. In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,E,I,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, I will guess ""sport"".

But note: we are also testing if S is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. Similarly for the others.

We might get more information.

So, the next guess is ""sport"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""roils""** → R (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), I (absent), L (absent), S (present, wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, I, L (cannot be used).
- **Present letters (must be included)**: R, O, S.
  - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from ""roils"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - O is not in position 2 (from ""roils"").
  - S is not in position 5 (from ""roils"").
- **Available positions**:
  - R: Can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  - O: Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
  - S: Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include R, O, and S.
  - Use two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L).
  - Test R, O, and S in new positions to narrow down possibilities.
  - Prioritize common letters (e.g., T, P, H) to maximize information.

### Why ""sport""?
- **Word**: ""sport"" (S-P-O-R-T).
  - **S in position 1**: Tests if S is correct in position 1 (since S cannot be in 5, but position 1 is untested).
  - **P in position 2**: Introduces a new common consonant (P) and tests an untested position.
  - **O in position 3**: Tests O in a new position (not 2, as previously ruled out).
  - **R in position 4**: Tests R in a new position (not 1 or 2, as ruled out).
  - **T in position 5**: Introduces a new common consonant (T) and tests position 5.
- **Advantages**:
  - Uses all three present letters (R, O, S) while avoiding forbidden positions.
  - Introduces two new common letters (P and T) to gather more feedback.
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, I, L).
  - Tests multiple positions simultaneously, which could confirm or rule out several possibilities with one guess.

This guess should provide strong feedback to help identify the secret word in subsequent attempts.

No C,A,N,E. Valid.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""SPORT"" - but that has O and T, and R in position 4? S P O R T -> R is in position 4. But we have to avoid A, but S,P,O,R,T are allowed. However, we have only 5 letters: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). But we don\'t know if R is in position 4. We are trying to test R in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R in position 1 and then use other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words without C,A,N,E and with R not in position 2:\n\n- R in position 1: \n  - ROBOT: R O B O T -> but O is repeated? Actually, it\'s R-O-B-O-T, so two O\'s. But that\'s acceptable. Letters: R, O, B, T. (O repeated). But we don\'t know if O is in the word. We can use it.\n  - ROILS: R O I L S -> no repeats, and uses common letters.\n\n- R in position 3: \n  - WORD: W O R D -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters. \n  - How about ""THIRD"": T H I R D -> R in position 4? Let\'s count: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R is in position 4, not 3.\n  - For R in position 3: ""STORM"" -> S T O R M -> R is in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So position 4.\n  - ""BIRDS"": B I R D S -> R in position 3. But we have S at the end. And B,I,R,D,S. No forbidden letters.\n\n- R in position 4: \n  - ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> R in position 4.\n\n- R in position 5:\n  - ""MIRTH"": M I R T H -> R is in position 3? M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So not position 5.\n  - ""FUROR"": F U R O R -> R in position 3 and 5? But we have two R\'s. And we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one R in ""crane"", and it was marked as present but wrong position, it doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple R\'s. So we cannot assume only one R.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters for now.\n\nWe also want to test other vowels because we only have R so far. We know the word has at least one R, and we have eliminated A and E (and C, N). So the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s avoid Y for now).\n\nWe should try to include I and O to check for vowels.\n\nI am considering ""ROILS"": \n- R in position 1 (so not position 2, which is good), O in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we are putting R in position 1, which is a possibility. And we are testing O, I, L, S.\n\nAnother option: ""SPRIT"" - but that has P, R, I, T, and S? S P R I T -> R is in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), T(5). So R in position 3. And no forbidden letters.\n\nBut ""SPRIT"" is a word? It means a small sprout or a spirit. It\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""THIRD"" is 5 letters? T-H-I-R-D, that\'s 5: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). So R in position 4.\n\nWe have multiple options.\n\nI think ""ROILS"" is a good choice because:\n- It has R in position 1 (testing a new position for R)\n- It has two vowels: O and I (in positions 2 and 3) which we haven\'t tested.\n- It has L and S, which are common consonants.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R in position 1. We are also testing O in position 2 and I in position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried and also covers more common consonants.\n\nAnother classic second guess is to use a word with the known letter and new letters.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""ROILS"".\n\nBut let me check if it\'s valid: ROILS is a word (to agitate or stir up).\n\nSo, next guess: ""ROILS""\n\nWe are hoping to get more information about the R and also test O, I, L, S.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E.\n\n""ROILS"" does not contain any of these.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, A, N, E.\n- Include R, but not in position 2 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to gather more information.\n- Aim to cover multiple positions for R and other letters.\n\nThe word ""roils"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains R (in position 1, avoiding position 2).\n- Uses new vowels (O, I) and consonants (L, S) not yet tested.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).\n\n<guess>roils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C: absent (not in the word)\n- R: present but in the wrong position (not in position 2)\n- A: absent\n- N: absent\n- E: absent\n\nGuess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nMeaning:\n- R: present but in the wrong position (and since it was in position 1 in this guess, it\'s not in position 1 either)\n- O: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so not there)\n- I: absent\n- L: absent\n- S: present but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so not there)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L\nPresent letters (but position unknown): R, O, S\n\nWe also know that R is not in position 1 or 2 (from guess1: not 2, guess2: not 1).\nSimilarly, O is not in position 2 (from guess2) and S is not in position 5 (from guess2).\n\nWe have 5 positions.

But we are trying to find the correct position, so we can avoid position 2 for O.\n\nBut ""PORTS"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nHow about ""SPORT"": S P O R T -> \n- S in position 1 (which is allowed, since S can be in 1)\n- P is new\n- O in position 3 (not 2, so allowed)\n- R in position 4 (allowed, since R can be in 4)\n- T in position 5 (and S cannot be in 5, but here S is in 1, so that\'s fine)\n\nBut note: in ""SPORT"", we have R in position 4 and O in position 3. We don\'t know if these positions are correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlso, we are introducing P and T.\n\nBut wait, we have to check if we are repeating any absent letters? P and T are not in the absent list (absent: C,A,N,E,I,L). So that\'s fine.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROAST"" but A is absent, so not allowed.\n\n""FORTS"": F O R T S -> O in position 2? Not allowed because O cannot be in 2. So we avoid.\n\n""TORUS"": T O R U S -> O in position 2?

In ""STROP"", O in 4 and R in 3.\n\nWe don\'t have information to prefer one over the other.\n\nBut we also know that S is present and not in position 5, but we don\'t know about position 1. Similarly, we don\'t know about the other positions.\n\nAnother word: ""PORTS"" is invalid because O is in 2.\n\n""TRODS"" -> T(1) R(2) O(3) D(4) S(5) -> R in 2, invalid.\n\n""DOORS"" -> D(1) O(2) O(3) R(4) S(5) -> O in 2, invalid.\n\nSo I think ""SPORT"" or ""STROP"" are good.\n\nBut let me think about the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R, O, S and two new letters, and also avoids putting any of these in positions we know are wrong.\n\nWe know:\n- R cannot be in 1 or 2 -> so positions 3,4,5\n- O cannot be in 2 -> so 1,3,4,5\n- S cannot be in 5 -> so 1,2,3,4\n\nWe also have two more letters to include.\n\nWe want to cover as many new positions as possible.\n\nIn ""SPORT"":\n- S in 1: we don\'t know if correct, but we are testing.\n- P in 2: new letter, new position.\n- O in 3: new position for O (we haven\'t tested position 3 for O)\n- R in 4: new position for R (we had R in 2 and 1, now 4)\n- T in 5: new letter.\n\nIn ""STROP"":\n- S in 1: same\n- T in 2: new letter, new position.\n- R in 3: new position for R (we had 1 and 2, now 3)\n- O in 4: new position for O (we had 2, now 4)\n- P in 5: new letter.\n\nBoth are similar.\n\nBut note: in ""SPORT"", we are putting O in 3 and R in 4, which are adjacent. In ""STROP"", R in 3 and O in 4, also adjacent. So no big difference.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SPORT"" because it\'s a more common word.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SHORT"": S(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) -> same as SPORT but with H instead of P.\n\n""SHORT"" is also common.\n\nBut we don\'t have a reason to prefer one over the other.\n\nWe can also consider ""FORMS"", but F O R M S -> O in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""GOURD"": G O U R D -> O in 2, not allowed.\n\n""COURT"": but C is absent.\n\nSo, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any absent letters. In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,E,I,L). So it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""sport"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing if S is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. Similarly for the others.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""sport"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (absent).  \n- **Guess 2: ""roils""** → R (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), I (absent), L (absent), S (present, wrong position).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, I, L (cannot be used).\n- **Present letters (must be included)**: R, O, S.\n  - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from ""roils"" and ""crane"" feedback).\n  - O is not in position 2 (from ""roils"").\n  - S is not in position 5 (from ""roils"").\n- **Available positions**:\n  - R: Can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n  - O: Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).\n  - S: Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n- **Strategy for next guess**:\n  - Must include R, O, and S.\n  - Use two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L).\n  - Test R, O, and S in new positions to narrow down possibilities.\n  - Prioritize common letters (e.g., T, P, H) to maximize information.\n\n### Why ""sport""?\n- **Word**: ""sport"" (S-P-O-R-T).\n  - **S in position 1**: Tests if S is correct in position 1 (since S cannot be in 5, but position 1 is untested).\n  - **P in position 2**: Introduces a new common consonant (P) and tests an untested position.\n  - **O in position 3**: Tests O in a new position (not 2, as previously ruled out).\n  - **R in position 4**: Tests R in a new position (not 1 or 2, as ruled out).\n  - **T in position 5**: Introduces a new common consonant (T) and tests position 5.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Uses all three present letters (R, O, S) while avoiding forbidden positions.\n  - Introduces two new common letters (P and T) to gather more feedback.\n  - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, I, L).\n  - Tests multiple positions simultaneously, which could confirm or rule out several possibilities with one guess.\n\nThis guess should provide strong feedback to help identify the secret word in subsequent attempts.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for the third guess ""sport"":
- S(✓) : S is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- P(x) : P is absent.
- O(✓) : O is correct and in the right position (position 3).
- R(✓) : R is correct and in the right position (position 4).
- T(-) : T is present but in the wrong position.

So, we now know:
- The secret word has S in position 1, O in position 3, and R in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong position).
- P is absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L, P (now added).
- Present letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), and T (somewhere not in position 5).

The secret word so far: S _ O R _

We know T is present but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2 (since positions 1,3,4 are taken by S,O,R and are correct).

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: ? (must be T? because T is present and cannot be in 5, and 1,3,4 are fixed and correct, so only position 2 left for T? But wait, we have position 5 open, but T is not in 5, so it must be in 2. However, we must confirm if there are other letters? The word has 5 letters, and we have S, O, R, T, and one more letter.

We know the word has T, and it must be in position 2 because:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, but T is not in position 5 (from feedback: T(-) meaning present but not in 5)
- Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

But we must also have one more letter? No, because we have five positions and we have four letters: S, O, R, T. The fifth letter must be the one in position 5.

But T is one of the letters, and we are placing it in position 2. Then position 5 is open for a new letter.

So the word is: S T O R ? 

But wait, we have T in position 2? We don't know that for sure yet. We know T is in the word and not in 5, and positions 1,3,4 are fixed and taken by S,O,R. So indeed, T must be in position 2. Because there is no other position.

Therefore, the word is: S _ O R _ 
with the second letter being T? But we haven't confirmed that. We know T is present and not in 5, and the only open positions are 2 and 5. But if T is in 5, we know it's not (from feedback). So T must be in position 2.

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""sport"" was T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 5). So T is in the word, but not at position 5. The only positions available are 2 and 5. Since 5 is ruled out, T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is: S T O R ?

Now, the last letter (position 5) is missing. We need to find that letter.

We also know the absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, L, P.

So the missing letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.

Available letters: from the alphabet, excluding absent ones: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ""STOR_"" where the last letter is one of these.

Common words:
- STORE: but E is absent, so no.
- STORM: M is available? Yes, M is not absent. And ""storm"" is a word.
- STORK: K is available, and ""stork"" is a word.
- STORY: Y is available, and ""story"" is a word.
- STOIC: but I and C are absent, so no.
- STOAT: A is absent, so no.
- STOUR: U is available? But ""stour"" is a word? It means a strong wind or dust. But let's check: S T O U R -> but we have R in position 4, so the word is S T O R _, so the last letter is the fifth. ""Stour"" would be S-T-O-U-R, so R is in position 5? But in our case, R is fixed in position 4. So ""stour"" has R in 5, which doesn't match.

We need words that end with R? No, because position 4 is R, so the word is S T O R ? meaning the fifth letter is after R.

So the pattern is ""STORx"" where x is the fifth letter.

Possible words:
- STORM: S T O R M
- STORK: S T O R K
- STORY: S T O R Y
- STOPS: but P is absent and S is already in position 1? ""Stops"" would be S T O P S, but P is absent and also we have two S's? But we don't know if S is repeated. However, in the feedback for ""sport"", we had S in position 1 correct, and no other S, but that doesn't rule out another S. However, P is absent, so ""stops"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""store"" has E, absent.

""Stove"": O is in position 3? S T O V E -> but E is absent.

""Stout"": S T O U T -> but T is repeated? We have T in position 2 and then T in position 5? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, in the feedback for ""sport"", we had T marked as present but wrong position (in position 5). But if the word had two T's, then the T in position 5 might be correct? But the feedback said T(-) meaning that the T in position 5 is not correct, but there is a T elsewhere (which we think is in position 2). So if the word has two T's, then the T in position 5 would be marked as present if it were in the word? But the feedback says T is present but not in position 5, so that means there is at least one T in the word that is not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about a second T. So the word could have a T in position 2 and also in position 5? But if it had a T in position 5, then when we guessed T in position 5, it should have been marked as correct (✓) if it were in the right position, or (-) if it were in the word but in a different position? But if it were in the right position, it would be ✓. But it was marked (-), meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had a T in position 5, then when we put T in position 5, it should be marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as (-), so that means there is no T in position 5. Therefore, the word does not have a T in position 5. But it has at least one T, which must be in position 2 (as we deduced). So the word has exactly one T, in position 2.

Therefore, the fifth letter cannot be T. So ""stout"" is invalid because it has T at the end.

Similarly, ""start"" has A and T repeated, but A is absent.

So back to the possibilities: STORM, STORK, STORY.

We also have ""stowp"" or ""stows"", but ""stowp"" is not common, and ""stows"" has S at the end? S T O W S -> but we have S at the beginning and end. But we don't know if S is repeated. However, in the feedback for ""roils"", we had S in position 5 marked as (-), meaning S is present but not in position 5. But if the word has S in position 1 and also in position 5, then when we put S in position 5 in ""roils"", it should have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""roils"", we had S in position 5 and it was marked (-), which is consistent with S being in the word but not in position 5. However, if the word has S in position 1 and also in position 5, then S is in position 5, so when we put S in position 5 in ""roils"", it should have been marked as correct (✓) because it is in the correct position. But it was marked as (-), meaning not in the correct position. Therefore, the word does not have S in position 5. So the fifth letter cannot be S. Therefore, ""stows"" is invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have S repeated.

So the only possibilities are STORM, STORK, STORY.

Now, we need to choose one to guess. But we have to make a guess, and we can only guess one.

We can try to see if we can eliminate more.

But we don't have more information. We have to guess one of these.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests the fifth letter without using the known letters? But we know S, T, O, R must be in their positions, so we have to include them? Actually, we are at the fourth guess, and we have only 6 tries. We can guess one of these.

But let me see if there is a word that can test multiple possibilities.

We know the word is ""STORx"" with x being M, K, or Y (or others?).

We also have other letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, U, V, W, X, Z.

But are there other words? For example, ""stoor"" is not a common word. ""Stond"" is obsolete. ""Stoff"" not a word. ""Stogy"" or ""stogy"" is a variant of stogie, which is S T O G Y? But that would be S T O G Y, so G in position 4? But we have R fixed in position 4. So no, position 4 is R, so it must be ""STORx"".

So only STORM, STORK, STORY are common words.

We can guess one of them.

But note: we have not used H, for example. But we don't need to test other letters because we know the pattern.

We can guess ""storm"" and see.

But to be safe, we might choose a word that includes the possible letters? But we can only guess one word.

Alternatively, we can think about the feedback we got.

We also have to consider that T is in position 2, which we are assuming, but we haven't confirmed it. We deduced it must be there, but we haven't tested it. However, the logic seems solid: T must be in position 2 because it's the only position left.

But to confirm, let's see: if T were not in position 2, then where? The only positions are 2 and 5, and 5 is ruled out, so it must be 2. So it's confirmed.

Therefore, we can guess one of STORM, STORK, STORY.

I think ""storm"" is a very common word, so I'll go with that.

But let me check the feedback history to see if we can get a hint.

We have no other information.

So, I'll guess ""storm"".

But note: we are at guess 4, and we have 2 more guesses if needed.

But if we guess ""storm"" and it's wrong, we still have to guess between ""stork"" and ""story"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the last letter without committing to one.

But we don't have many options. For example, we could guess a word that has M, K, Y in it? But we have to include the known letters? Not necessarily, but we know S, T, O, R are fixed, so we must include them? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't, we might not get information about the whole word.

But we can try to guess a word that has the known letters in their positions and then a letter that is one of the possibilities? But that's what we are doing.

We could guess ""stomy"" but that's not a word.

Or ""storx"" not a word.

So we have to choose one.

I think ""storm"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""storm"".

But let me see: in the feedback for ""sport"", we had T marked as present but wrong position. If we now put T in position 2 in ""storm"", and if it is correct, we should get a check for T. But we are assuming it is.

So, the guess is ""storm"".

But to be thorough, let's list the possibilities:

- If the secret word is ""storm"", then we win.
- If not, then we get feedback that M is absent or wrong, and then we know it's either ""stork"" or ""story"".

But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

Therefore, I'll guess ""storm"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""roils""** → R (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), I (absent), L (absent), S (present, wrong position).  
- **Guess 3: ""sport""** → S (correct position), P (absent), O (correct position), R (correct position), T (present, wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Correctly Placed Letters**:
   - **Position 1**: S (from ""sport"" feedback: S✓).
   - **Position 3**: O (from ""sport"" feedback: O✓).
   - **Position 4**: R (from ""sport"" feedback: R✓).
   - This gives us the partial word: `S _ O R _`.

2. **Present but Misplaced Letters**:
   - **T**: Present in the word but not in position 5 (from ""sport"" feedback: T-). Since positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed (S, O, R), and T cannot be in position 5, **T must be in position 2**.  
     - Thus, the word is now: `S T O R _`.

3. **Absent Letters** (cannot be used):  
   - C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), I, L (from ""roils""), and P (from ""sport"").  
   - **Total absent**: C, A, N, E, I, L, P.  
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. **Remaining Task**:  
   - The only unknown is the 5th letter (position 5).  
   - Possible words fitting `S T O R _` and avoiding absent letters:  
     - **STORM** (M in position 5)  
     - **STORK** (K in position 5)  
     - **STORY** (Y in position 5)  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **STORM** is chosen as the next guess because:  
  - It tests the most common word among the possibilities.  
  - If correct, the game ends. If not, the feedback will confirm if M is present/absent, narrowing it to **STORK** or **STORY** for the next guess.  
- This leverages the known positions (S, T, O, R) and efficiently resolves the remaining uncertainty with minimal guesses.  

<guess>storm</guess>",storm,"We are given the feedback for the third guess ""sport"":
- S(✓) : S is correct and in the right position (position 1).

- O(✓) : O is correct and in the right position (position 3).
- R(✓) : R is correct and in the right position (position 4).
- T(-) : T is present but in the wrong position.

So, we now know:
- The secret word has S in position 1, O in position 3, and R in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong position).

The secret word so far: S _ O R _

However, we must confirm if there are other letters? The word has 5 letters, and we have S, O, R, T, and one more letter.

We know the word has T, and it must be in position 2 because:

- Position 5: unknown, but T is not in position 5 (from feedback: T(-) meaning present but not in 5)
- Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

But we must also have one more letter? No, because we have five positions and we have four letters: S, O, R, T. The fifth letter must be the one in position 5.

But T is one of the letters, and we are placing it in position 2. Then position 5 is open for a new letter.

Therefore, the word is: S T O R ?

Now, the last letter (position 5) is missing. We need to find that letter.

Therefore, the word does not have a T in position 5. But it has at least one T, which must be in position 2 (as we deduced). So the word has exactly one T, in position 2.

Therefore, the fifth letter cannot be T. So ""stout"" is invalid because it has T at the end.

Similarly, ""start"" has A and T repeated, but A is absent.

So back to the possibilities: STORM, STORK, STORY.

We also have ""stowp"" or ""stows"", but ""stowp"" is not common, and ""stows"" has S at the end? S T O W S -> but we have S at the beginning and end. But we don't know if S is repeated. However, in the feedback for ""roils"", we had S in position 5 marked as (-), meaning S is present but not in position 5. But if the word has S in position 1 and also in position 5, then when we put S in position 5 in ""roils"", it should have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""roils"", we had S in position 5 and it was marked (-), which is consistent with S being in the word but not in position 5.

But to be safe, we might choose a word that includes the possible letters? But we can only guess one word.

Alternatively, we can think about the feedback we got.

We also have to consider that T is in position 2, which we are assuming, but we haven't confirmed it. We deduced it must be there, but we haven't tested it. However, the logic seems solid: T must be in position 2 because it's the only position left.

But to confirm, let's see: if T were not in position 2, then where? The only positions are 2 and 5, and 5 is ruled out, so it must be 2. So it's confirmed.

Therefore, we can guess one of STORM, STORK, STORY.

I think ""storm"" is a very common word, so I'll go with that.

But let me check the feedback history to see if we can get a hint.

We have no other information.

So, I'll guess ""storm"".

But note: we are at guess 4, and we have 2 more guesses if needed.

But if we guess ""storm"" and it's wrong, we still have to guess between ""stork"" and ""story"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the last letter without committing to one.

But we don't have many options. For example, we could guess a word that has M, K, Y in it? But we have to include the known letters? Not necessarily, but we know S, T, O, R are fixed, so we must include them? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't, we might not get information about the whole word.

But we can try to guess a word that has the known letters in their positions and then a letter that is one of the possibilities? But that's what we are doing.

We could guess ""stomy"" but that's not a word.

Or ""storx"" not a word.

So we have to choose one.

I think ""storm"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""storm"".

But let me see: in the feedback for ""sport"", we had T marked as present but wrong position. If we now put T in position 2 in ""storm"", and if it is correct, we should get a check for T. But we are assuming it is.

So, the guess is ""storm"".

But to be thorough, let's list the possibilities:

- If the secret word is ""storm"", then we win.
- If not, then we get feedback that M is absent or wrong, and then we know it's either ""stork"" or ""story"".

But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

Therefore, I'll guess ""storm"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""roils""** → R (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), I (absent), L (absent), S (present, wrong position).  
- **Guess 3: ""sport""** → S (correct position), P (absent), O (correct position), R (correct position), T (present, wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Correctly Placed Letters**:
   - **Position 1**: S (from ""sport"" feedback: S✓).
   - **Position 3**: O (from ""sport"" feedback: O✓).
   - **Position 4**: R (from ""sport"" feedback: R✓).
   - This gives us the partial word: `S _ O R _`.

2. **Present but Misplaced Letters**:
   - **T**: Present in the word but not in position 5 (from ""sport"" feedback: T-). Since positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed (S, O, R), and T cannot be in position 5, **T must be in position 2**.  
     - Thus, the word is now: `S T O R _`.

3. **Absent Letters** (cannot be used):  
   - C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), I, L (from ""roils""), and P (from ""sport"").  
   - **Total absent**: C, A, N, E, I, L, P.  
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. **Remaining Task**:  
   - The only unknown is the 5th letter (position 5).  
   - Possible words fitting `S T O R _` and avoiding absent letters:  
     - **STORM** (M in position 5)  
     - **STORK** (K in position 5)  
     - **STORY** (Y in position 5)  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **STORM** is chosen as the next guess because:  
  - It tests the most common word among the possibilities.  
  - If correct, the game ends. If not, the feedback will confirm if M is present/absent, narrowing it to **STORK** or **STORY** for the next guess.  
- This leverages the known positions (S, T, O, R) and efficiently resolves the remaining uncertainty with minimal guesses.",Guess 4: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
