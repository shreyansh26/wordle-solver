We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is present in the secret word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
 - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (because in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
   The secret word does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can eliminate any words that contain R, A, N, E.

 Also, note that the letter 'C' must be in the word, but not in the first position. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter 'C' (but not in the first position).
   - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common consonants and vowels that are still possible. Since we have eliminated A and E (common vowels), we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 We also know that the word does not have R, so we can avoid that.

 We can try to use a word that has the letter 'C' in a different position (not first) and includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 We should also avoid using the same letters we already know are absent (R, A, N, E).

 Let's try to form a word that has:
   - 'C' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Other letters that are common and not yet tested.

 Example: 
   We could try putting 'C' in the second position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We want to test multiple positions.

 However, we have to choose one word. Let's try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Idea: Use a word that has 'C' in the second position and includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words:
   ""scoop"" -> but we don't know if O is present? Also, we have two O's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless they are in the word. So we have to be cautious.

 But note: we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So we must use other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to think of words that have 'C' and use common letters.

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, so we can use another consonant. Let's use 'S' (very common).
   Then put 'C' in position 2? Then we have ""S C _ _ _""

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not R, A, N, E and are common.

 Let me try: ""S C O L D"" -> ""scold""? 
   But we haven't tested O, L, D.

 However, note that we have only 5 positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""S C H O P"" -> ""chop"" is 4 letters, so not 5. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""slick""? 
   s l i c k -> but that has 'C' in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), l (2), i (3), c (4), k (5)

 But wait, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except first? Actually, the feedback said C is in the word but not in the first position. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.

 However, in ""slick"", the C is in the fourth position. That's acceptable.

 But let's check the letters: S, L, I, C, K.
   We know C is in the word (so that's good).
   We haven't tested S, L, I, K.

 However, note that we have already eliminated A, E, R, N. So these letters (S, L, I, K) are all new.

 But wait: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the secret word has a 'C' but not in the first position. It did not tell us about other letters. So we don't know if the secret word has S, L, I, K.

 So ""slick"" is a valid guess? But let me check: is ""slick"" a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we can also consider other words that might cover more vowels? We have only one vowel in ""slick"": I.

 Alternatively, we could use a word with O or U? 

 How about ""scout""? 
   s c o u t -> 
   But we have eliminated R, A, N, E, but not O, U. 
   However, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""scout"", C is in the second position. That's acceptable.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not in the first position. It doesn't say that it must be in the second? So we are free to test any position (2-5).

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test the second position for C? Because if we put C in the second position and it gets marked as correct (✓) then we know the second letter is C. If it's marked as wrong position (-) then we know it's in the word but not in the second position (so it must be in 3,4,5). If it's marked as absent (x) that would contradict the first feedback? But wait, the first feedback already said C is present. So it cannot be absent. Therefore, in the feedback for the second guess, we expect to see either ✓ or - for the C.

 So let's try to put C in the second position to test that.

 Therefore, I propose a word that has C in the second position and uses other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Example: ""s c _ _ _""

 We can try:
   ""s c o p e"" -> but we have E? We know E is not in the word! So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E.

 How about ""s c o l d"" -> scold: s, c, o, l, d. 
   This avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have two vowels? Actually, O is a vowel. And we haven't tested O.

 Alternatively, ""s c u l p"" -> sculpt? But that's 6 letters? No, ""sculp"" is not a word. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""s c a b s"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.

 Another: ""s c i o n"" -> but we have N? We know N is not in the word.

 We must avoid A, E, R, N.

 So let's try: ""s c h u t"" -> not a word.

 How about ""s c u m p"" -> not a word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't start with S? But we want to test S too.

 Another idea: start with T? ""t c ..."" but that's not common. We can have ""t"" as the first letter and then ""c"" in the second? But what words? ""tchick"" is not a word.

 How about ""b c"" words? Not common.

 Maybe we should avoid forcing the second letter? We can put C in a different position.

 Let me try to put C in the third position? For example: 
   _ _ c _ _

 Example: ""p u c k s"" -> pucks? But that has S and K? And U.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, N.

 ""pucks"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are testing P, U, C, K, S.

 However, we are putting C in the third position. We know C is in the word, so we are testing if it's in the third.

 Alternatively, we can try ""music"" -> but that has M, U, S, I, C. But we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""music"", C is in the fifth position. That's acceptable. But wait, we have the letter 'I' which is a vowel we haven't tested. However, ""music"" contains the letter 'S' and 'M' and 'U'. 

 But note: we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""music"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

 However, we are on the second guess and we want to maximize information. We might want to avoid repeating the same position for C? Actually, we don't know the position of C, so we are free to test any.

 But the problem: we have only one C? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple. So we have to be cautious.

 Since we don't have much information, let's choose a word that has the letter C and four new letters that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}.

 Let me list the available letters: 
   We can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 How about ""slick"" again? It has S, L, I, C, K. 
   S is very common, L is common, I is a vowel, K is common.

 But note: we are putting C in the fourth position. We can see if it's in the fourth? Or if it's elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can use ""stock"": 
   s t o c k -> 
   This has S, T, O, C, K. 
   And C is in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), t (2), o (3), c (4), k (5)

 But we are testing O as well.

 However, we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""stock"" does not have these.

 So ""stock"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare ""slick"" and ""stock"":
   slick: tests S, L, I, C, K.
   stock: tests S, T, O, C, K.

 We haven't tested T or O or L or I? So both are good.

 Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E) and two consonants (R and N), we might want to test another vowel? We have I and O available.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""stock"" because it has T and O which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""stock"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has C in the second position? Then by putting C in the fourth, we might not get information about the second position? However, we are going to get feedback on the C: if the C in ""stock"" is marked as correct (✓) then we know it's in the fourth. If it's marked as wrong position (-) then we know it's in the word but not in the fourth, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? But we have already tried the first and it wasn't there. And we are not testing position 2 and 3 in this guess? Actually, we are testing position 4 only for C.

 Alternatively, if we put C in the second position, we can get information about the second position.

 So let me reconsider: we can try to put C in the second position to test that.

 How about ""scold""? 
   s c o l d -> 
   This tests: S, C (in second), O, L, D.

 This is also a valid word and avoids A, E, R, N.

 So now I have two options: 
   Option 1: ""stock"" (C in fourth) -> tests S, T, O, C, K.
   Option 2: ""scold"" (C in second) -> tests S, C (second), O, L, D.

 Which one is better? 
   We haven't tested T, K vs L, D. 
   T is more common than D? And K is more common than D? 
   But L is very common.

 Actually, both are good. I'll choose ""scold"" because we are testing the second position for C, which might give us a fixed letter if it's correct.

 So let's go with ""scold"".

 Therefore, my second guess is ""scold"".

<guess>scold</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter **C** is present in the secret word but not in the first position (marked `-`).
- The letters **R, A, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include **C** in positions 2–5 (since it cannot be in position 1).
- The word must exclude **R, A, N, E**.
- To maximize information, I prioritized testing **C** in position 2 (to potentially confirm its exact placement) and introduced new common letters: **S, O, L, D** (all untested so far).

The word **""scold""** fits these criteria:
- **C** is in position 2.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).
- It tests high-frequency consonants (**S, L, D**) and a vowel (**O**), which could reveal critical patterns.

<guess>scold</guess>",scold,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is present in the secret word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
 - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (because in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
   The secret word does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can eliminate any words that contain R, A, N, E.

 Also, note that the letter 'C' must be in the word, but not in the first position. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 Let me try: ""S C O L D"" -> ""scold""? 
   But we haven't tested O, L, D.

 However, note that we have only 5 positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""S C H O P"" -> ""chop"" is 4 letters, so not 5. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""slick""?

 But wait, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except first? Actually, the feedback said C is in the word but not in the first position. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.

 However, in ""slick"", the C is in the fourth position. That's acceptable.

 But let's check the letters: S, L, I, C, K.

   We haven't tested S, L, I, K.

 ""pucks"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are testing P, U, C, K, S.

 However, we are putting C in the third position. We know C is in the word, so we are testing if it's in the third.

 Alternatively, we can try ""music"" -> but that has M, U, S, I, C. But we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""music"", C is in the fifth position. That's acceptable. But wait, we have the letter 'I' which is a vowel we haven't tested. However, ""music"" contains the letter 'S' and 'M' and 'U'.

   We can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 How about ""slick"" again? It has S, L, I, C, K. 
   S is very common, L is common, I is a vowel, K is common.

 But note: we are putting C in the fourth position. We can see if it's in the fourth? Or if it's elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can use ""stock"": 
   s t o c k -> 
   This has S, T, O, C, K. 
   And C is in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), t (2), o (3), c (4), k (5)

 But we are testing O as well.

 However, we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""stock"" does not have these.

 So ""stock"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare ""slick"" and ""stock"":
   slick: tests S, L, I, C, K.
   stock: tests S, T, O, C, K.

 We haven't tested T or O or L or I? So both are good.

 Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E) and two consonants (R and N), we might want to test another vowel? We have I and O available.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""stock"" because it has T and O which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""stock"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has C in the second position? Then by putting C in the fourth, we might not get information about the second position? However, we are going to get feedback on the C: if the C in ""stock"" is marked as correct (✓) then we know it's in the fourth. If it's marked as wrong position (-) then we know it's in the word but not in the fourth, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? But we have already tried the first and it wasn't there. And we are not testing position 2 and 3 in this guess? Actually, we are testing position 4 only for C.

 Alternatively, if we put C in the second position, we can get information about the second position.

 So let me reconsider: we can try to put C in the second position to test that.

 How about ""scold""? 
   s c o l d -> 
   This tests: S, C (in second), O, L, D.

 This is also a valid word and avoids A, E, R, N.

 So now I have two options: 
   Option 1: ""stock"" (C in fourth) -> tests S, T, O, C, K.
   Option 2: ""scold"" (C in second) -> tests S, C (second), O, L, D.

 Which one is better? 
   We haven't tested T, K vs L, D. 
   T is more common than D? And K is more common than D? 
   But L is very common.

 Actually, both are good. I'll choose ""scold"" because we are testing the second position for C, which might give us a fixed letter if it's correct.

 So let's go with ""scold"".

 Therefore, my second guess is ""scold"".

<guess>scold</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter **C** is present in the secret word but not in the first position (marked `-`).
- The letters **R, A, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include **C** in positions 2–5 (since it cannot be in position 1).
- The word must exclude **R, A, N, E**.
- To maximize information, I prioritized testing **C** in position 2 (to potentially confirm its exact placement) and introduced new common letters: **S, O, L, D** (all untested so far).

The word **""scold""** fits these criteria:
- **C** is in position 2.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).
- It tests high-frequency consonants (**S, L, D**) and a vowel (**O**), which could reveal critical patterns.",Guess 2: scold -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is present in the secret word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
 - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (because in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
   The secret word does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can eliminate any words that contain R, A, N, E.

 Also, note that the letter 'C' must be in the word, but not in the first position. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter 'C' (but not in the first position).
   - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common consonants and vowels that are still possible. Since we have eliminated A and E (common vowels), we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 We also know that the word does not have R, so we can avoid that.

 We can try to use a word that has the letter 'C' in a different position (not first) and includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 We should also avoid using the same letters we already know are absent (R, A, N, E).

 Let's try to form a word that has:
   - 'C' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Other letters that are common and not yet tested.

 Example: 
   We could try putting 'C' in the second position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We want to test multiple positions.

 However, we have to choose one word. Let's try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Idea: Use a word that has 'C' in the second position and includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words:
   ""scoop"" -> but we don't know if O is present? Also, we have two O's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless they are in the word. So we have to be cautious.

 But note: we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So we must use other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to think of words that have 'C' and use common letters.

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, so we can use another consonant. Let's use 'S' (very common).
   Then put 'C' in position 2? Then we have ""S C _ _ _""

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not R, A, N, E and are common.

 Let me try: ""S C O L D"" -> ""scold""? 
   But we haven't tested O, L, D.

 However, note that we have only 5 positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""S C H O P"" -> ""chop"" is 4 letters, so not 5. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""slick""? 
   s l i c k -> but that has 'C' in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), l (2), i (3), c (4), k (5)

 But wait, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except first? Actually, the feedback said C is in the word but not in the first position. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.

 However, in ""slick"", the C is in the fourth position. That's acceptable.

 But let's check the letters: S, L, I, C, K.
   We know C is in the word (so that's good).
   We haven't tested S, L, I, K.

 However, note that we have already eliminated A, E, R, N. So these letters (S, L, I, K) are all new.

 But wait: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the secret word has a 'C' but not in the first position. It did not tell us about other letters. So we don't know if the secret word has S, L, I, K.

 So ""slick"" is a valid guess? But let me check: is ""slick"" a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we can also consider other words that might cover more vowels? We have only one vowel in ""slick"": I.

 Alternatively, we could use a word with O or U? 

 How about ""scout""? 
   s c o u t -> 
   But we have eliminated R, A, N, E, but not O, U. 
   However, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""scout"", C is in the second position. That's acceptable.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not in the first position. It doesn't say that it must be in the second? So we are free to test any position (2-5).

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test the second position for C? Because if we put C in the second position and it gets marked as correct (✓) then we know the second letter is C. If it's marked as wrong position (-) then we know it's in the word but not in the second position (so it must be in 3,4,5). If it's marked as absent (x) that would contradict the first feedback? But wait, the first feedback already said C is present. So it cannot be absent. Therefore, in the feedback for the second guess, we expect to see either ✓ or - for the C.

 So let's try to put C in the second position to test that.

 Therefore, I propose a word that has C in the second position and uses other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Example: ""s c _ _ _""

 We can try:
   ""s c o p e"" -> but we have E? We know E is not in the word! So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E.

 How about ""s c o l d"" -> scold: s, c, o, l, d. 
   This avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have two vowels? Actually, O is a vowel. And we haven't tested O.

 Alternatively, ""s c u l p"" -> sculpt? But that's 6 letters? No, ""sculp"" is not a word. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""s c a b s"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.

 Another: ""s c i o n"" -> but we have N? We know N is not in the word.

 We must avoid A, E, R, N.

 So let's try: ""s c h u t"" -> not a word.

 How about ""s c u m p"" -> not a word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't start with S? But we want to test S too.

 Another idea: start with T? ""t c ..."" but that's not common. We can have ""t"" as the first letter and then ""c"" in the second? But what words? ""tchick"" is not a word.

 How about ""b c"" words? Not common.

 Maybe we should avoid forcing the second letter? We can put C in a different position.

 Let me try to put C in the third position? For example: 
   _ _ c _ _

 Example: ""p u c k s"" -> pucks? But that has S and K? And U.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, N.

 ""pucks"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are testing P, U, C, K, S.

 However, we are putting C in the third position. We know C is in the word, so we are testing if it's in the third.

 Alternatively, we can try ""music"" -> but that has M, U, S, I, C. But we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""music"", C is in the fifth position. That's acceptable. But wait, we have the letter 'I' which is a vowel we haven't tested. However, ""music"" contains the letter 'S' and 'M' and 'U'. 

 But note: we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""music"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

 However, we are on the second guess and we want to maximize information. We might want to avoid repeating the same position for C? Actually, we don't know the position of C, so we are free to test any.

 But the problem: we have only one C? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple. So we have to be cautious.

 Since we don't have much information, let's choose a word that has the letter C and four new letters that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}.

 Let me list the available letters: 
   We can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 How about ""slick"" again? It has S, L, I, C, K. 
   S is very common, L is common, I is a vowel, K is common.

 But note: we are putting C in the fourth position. We can see if it's in the fourth? Or if it's elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can use ""stock"": 
   s t o c k -> 
   This has S, T, O, C, K. 
   And C is in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), t (2), o (3), c (4), k (5)

 But we are testing O as well.

 However, we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""stock"" does not have these.

 So ""stock"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare ""slick"" and ""stock"":
   slick: tests S, L, I, C, K.
   stock: tests S, T, O, C, K.

 We haven't tested T or O or L or I? So both are good.

 Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E) and two consonants (R and N), we might want to test another vowel? We have I and O available.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""stock"" because it has T and O which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""stock"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has C in the second position? Then by putting C in the fourth, we might not get information about the second position?

And we are not testing position 2 and 3 in this guess? Actually, we are testing position 4 only for C.

 Alternatively, if we put C in the second position, we can get information about the second position.

 So let me reconsider: we can try to put C in the second position to test that.

 How about ""scold""? 
   s c o l d -> 
   This tests: S, C (in second), O, L, D.

 This is also a valid word and avoids A, E, R, N.

 So now I have two options: 
   Option 1: ""stock"" (C in fourth) -> tests S, T, O, C, K.
   Option 2: ""scold"" (C in second) -> tests S, C (second), O, L, D.

 Which one is better? 
   We haven't tested T, K vs L, D. 
   T is more common than D? And K is more common than D? 
   But L is very common.

 Actually, both are good. I'll choose ""scold"" because we are testing the second position for C, which might give us a fixed letter if it's correct.

 So let's go with ""scold"".

 Therefore, my second guess is ""scold"".

Actually, in ""music"", C is in the fifth position. That\'s acceptable. But wait, we have the letter \'I\' which is a vowel we haven\'t tested. However, ""music"" contains the letter \'S\' and \'M\' and \'U\'. \n\n But note: we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""music"" does not contain these, so it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we are on the second guess and we want to maximize information. We might want to avoid repeating the same position for C? Actually, we don\'t know the position of C, so we are free to test any.\n\n But the problem: we have only one C? The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple. So we have to be cautious.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information, let\'s choose a word that has the letter C and four new letters that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}.\n\n Let me list the available letters: \n   We can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n How about ""slick"" again? It has S, L, I, C, K. \n   S is very common, L is common, I is a vowel, K is common.\n\n But note: we are putting C in the fourth position. We can see if it\'s in the fourth? Or if it\'s elsewhere.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""stock"": \n   s t o c k -> \n   This has S, T, O, C, K. \n   And C is in the fourth position? Actually: \n      s (1), t (2), o (3), c (4), k (5)\n\n But we are testing O as well.\n\n However, we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""stock"" does not have these.\n\n So ""stock"" is a valid word.\n\n But let me compare ""slick"" and ""stock"":\n   slick: tests S, L, I, C, K.\n   stock: tests S, T, O, C, K.\n\n We haven\'t tested T or O or L or I? So both are good.\n\n Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E) and two consonants (R and N), we might want to test another vowel? We have I and O available.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""stock"" because it has T and O which are very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""stock"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has C in the second position? Then by putting C in the fourth, we might not get information about the second position? However, we are going to get feedback on the C: if the C in ""stock"" is marked as correct (✓) then we know it\'s in the fourth. If it\'s marked as wrong position (-) then we know it\'s in the word but not in the fourth, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? But we have already tried the first and it wasn\'t there. And we are not testing position 2 and 3 in this guess? Actually, we are testing position 4 only for C.\n\n Alternatively, if we put C in the second position, we can get information about the second position.\n\n So let me reconsider: we can try to put C in the second position to test that.\n\n How about ""scold""? \n   s c o l d -> \n   This tests: S, C (in second), O, L, D.\n\n This is also a valid word and avoids A, E, R, N.\n\n So now I have two options: \n   Option 1: ""stock"" (C in fourth) -> tests S, T, O, C, K.\n   Option 2: ""scold"" (C in second) -> tests S, C (second), O, L, D.\n\n Which one is better? \n   We haven\'t tested T, K vs L, D. \n   T is more common than D? And K is more common than D? \n   But L is very common.\n\n Actually, both are good. I\'ll choose ""scold"" because we are testing the second position for C, which might give us a fixed letter if it\'s correct.\n\n So let\'s go with ""scold"".\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""scold"".\n\n<guess>scold</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The letter **C** is present in the secret word but not in the first position (marked `-`).\n- The letters **R, A, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include **C** in positions 2–5 (since it cannot be in position 1).\n- The word must exclude **R, A, N, E**.\n- To maximize information, I prioritized testing **C** in position 2 (to potentially confirm its exact placement) and introduced new common letters: **S, O, L, D** (all untested so far).\n\nThe word **""scold""** fits these criteria:\n- **C** is in position 2.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).\n- It tests high-frequency consonants (**S, L, D**) and a vowel (**O**), which could reveal critical patterns.\n\n<guess>scold</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scold -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is in the secret word, but not in the first position.
  - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: scold -> S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)
Meaning:
  - S, O, L, D are not in the secret word.
  - C is still present but not in the second position (because in ""scold"" it was in position 2 and marked as wrong position).

So now we know:
  The secret word contains the letter C.
  C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains the letter C in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.
  - Uses only letters that haven't been tested yet or that we know must be in the word.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters include:
  B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know C is in the word.

We are on the third guess.

We need to test the position of C and also test other common letters.

Given that C must be in positions 3,4, or 5, we can try to form words with C in each of these positions to see which one fits.

But we have to choose one word. We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let me think of common vowels that are left: I, U (since A, E, O are eliminated). We should include at least one vowel (I or U) to test.

Common consonants left: T, H, M, P, K, etc.

Possible positions for C:
  Option 1: C in position 3: __ c _ _
  Option 2: C in position 4: ___ c _
  Option 3: C in position 5: ____ c

We can also try to cover multiple positions? But we don't know.

Idea: Since we know C is in positions 3,4,5, why not try to put it in position 3? Then we can test two positions after.

But we have to use only allowed letters.

Let's try to form a word with C in position 3 and include common letters: T, H, I, M, P, etc.

Example: 
  Position 1: T (common, not tested)
  Position 2: H (common, not tested)
  Position 3: C
  Position 4: I (vowel, not tested)
  Position 5: P

This would be ""thcip"" which is not a word.

Another: Position 1: T, Position 2: I, Position 3: C, Position 4: K, Position 5: S -> ""ticks"" but S has been eliminated -> not allowed.

We can't use S, O, L, D.

How about ""thump""? But that doesn't have C.

We need C.

Let me try C in position 4.

Example: ___ c _

Position 1: T
Position 2: H
Position 3: U (vowel)
Position 4: C
Position 5: ? Must be a letter not forbidden and such that it forms a word.

Possible: ""thuck""? Not a word.

Another: Position 1: P, Position 2: I, Position 3: L -> but L is eliminated. Cannot.

L is eliminated.

How about ""pick"" but it's 4 letters? We need 5.

Word: ""music"" -> but M is allowed? Yes, but we have U and S? S is eliminated -> not allowed.

We must avoid S.

Alternative: ""panic"" -> has A which is eliminated.

Another idea: C in position 5: ____ c

Then the word ends with C.

Example: words ending with C: ""topic"", ""music"", ""panic"" but all these have O or A or S which are eliminated.

What about ""muck"" -> 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with C? There aren't many. ""havoc"" -> has H and A -> A eliminated. ""arctic"" -> 6 letters, and has A.

""comic"" -> has O which is eliminated.

Perhaps we need to consider words like ""pubic"", but ""pubic"" has P, U, B, I, C. That might work? But we have to check the letters.

""pubic"" - P, U, B, I, C.
  - P is not tested.
  - U is a vowel (not tested).
  - B is not tested.
  - I is a vowel (not tested).
  - C is in the fifth position.

And avoids the forbidden letters: no R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D.

Is ""pubic"" a valid English word? Yes (meaning: relating to the pubes).

So that's a candidate.

But we don't know if the word contains U or I? We are testing them.

Another candidate: ""cubic"" -> but we must not put C in the first position. That is forbidden by the first feedback. So we cannot start with C.

Okay, so words starting with C are impossible? We are avoiding C in first position.

So only words that don't start with C and end with C? Or have C in middle.

""pubic"" is one option.

How about ""mucic"" -> not a common word.

Or ""magic"" -> has A and G? But A is eliminated.

Another word: ""topic"" -> O is eliminated, so no.

So ""pubic"" is a candidate.

But let's think of words with C in position 4.

Example: ___ c _

Position 1: B? Position 2: I? Position 3: T? Position 4: C, Position 5: H? -> ""bitch"" but that might be a word? But it's slang and might not be in the word list. Also, we have not eliminated B,I,T,H.

But ""bitch"" is five letters and valid? But we have to avoid controversy? Actually, we should use valid words. Alternatively, we can use ""beach"" -> but has A and E -> eliminated.

Another: ""watch"" -> contains A? No, ""watch"" has W,A,T,C,H? A is eliminated? Wait, ""watch"": W,A,T,C,H -> A is present -> not allowed.

How about ""pitch""? P,I,T,C,H -> but C is in fourth position? ""pitch"": P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? But that's a word.

Letters: P, I, T, C, H - none of which are forbidden (since forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D). So this is acceptable.

Now, comparing ""pubic"" and ""pitch"":
  ""pubic"": ends with C, letters: P, U, B, I, C -> tests B, U (vowel), and has I (vowel) and P and C.
  ""pitch"": C in fourth, letters: P, I, T, C, H -> tests T, H, and I is a vowel.

We haven't tested T, H, B, U.

Common letters: T is more frequent than B? H is common.

We might want to test T and H? Also, we haven't tested any T so far.

Also, note that we only have one more vowel possibility? Because A,E,O are out, so only I and U are left? Actually, Y can be a vowel too.

But let's choose ""pitch"" because it tests T and H, which are very common consonants.

Also, putting C in the fourth position (since we haven't tested positions 4 for C).

Alternatively, we can put C in the third? Is there a word?

Example: position 3=C: __ c __

Word: ""bucket"" -> 6 letters? No.

""vouch"" -> 5 letters: V, O, U, C, H -> but O is eliminated -> not allowed.

""match"" -> A eliminated.

""batch"" -> A? No.

But we can't use O or A.

How about ""wight""? But no C.

Word with C in third: ""hiccup"" -> 6 letters.

""tacky"" -> A eliminated? T is okay.

Actually, ""tacky"": T(1), A(2) -> but A is eliminated -> invalid.

""bumpy"" -> no C.

It might be hard to find words with C in third.

Another: ""bunch"" -> has U: B,U,N? N is eliminated -> not allowed.

So perhaps C in fourth is easier? ""pitch"" seems good.

Or C in fifth: ""pubic"" or ""comic"" -> but ""comic"" starts with C which we cannot do.

Another ending with C: ""tonic"" -> O eliminated.

""panic"" -> A eliminated.

So ""pubic"" and ""pitch"" are both valid candidates.

But I prefer ""pitch"" because it tests two common consonants (T and H) and we avoid using U? Actually, we need to test U too? But let's see: U is less common? And we haven't eliminated any vowels except A,E,O.

We know the word must contain at least one vowel? And the vowels left are I, U, (and Y as a vowel?).

By testing ""pitch"", we are testing I as a vowel. If I is not in the word, then it might be U. If we test ""pitch"" and I is absent, then we know the vowel is U (or Y). But we have only limited choices.

Alternatively, if we test ""pubic"", we test two vowels: U and I? And we can get information about both.

So perhaps ""pubic"" is better? Actually, no: ""pubic"" has two vowels? We can know for both.

But let me check:

In ""pubic"": 
  - If U is in the word? Position 2? 
  - If I is in the word? Position 4?
  - And C at position 5? Which we know is not fixed? Actually, we don't know the position of C.

However, we are testing U and I together? So we might waste a guess? Or we might get information faster.

I think we should choose one vowel to test at a time? Because if we use two vowels and both are absent? Then we know we have to look for Y? Or other vowels? But 5-letter words usually have at least one vowel.

The English alphabet has vowels: A,E,I,O,U, sometimes Y.

We don't know if Y is in the word? We haven't tested Y.

But let's stick to I and U first.

I think ""pitch"" is a solid choice: it tests T, H, I (vowel), and C in the fourth position.

It also does not repeat any tested letters? Except C which is required.

Therefore, I choose ""pitch"".

But let me confirm: is ""pitch"" a valid word? Yes.

And it does not contain any forbidden letters? All letters are in the set: B,C,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and excluding R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D. Specifically: P,I,T,C,H -> none of the forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D are in it.

So, we'll guess ""pitch"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from both previous guesses:

1. **First Guess (crane):**  
   - **C**: Present but not in position 1 (marked `-`).  
   - **R, A, N, E**: Absent (marked `x`).  

2. **Second Guess (scold):**  
   - **S, O, L, D**: Absent (marked `x`).  
   - **C**: Present but not in position 2 (marked `-`).  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word **must contain ""C""**, but it cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (since both placements were flagged as wrong positions). Therefore, **""C"" must be in position 3, 4, or 5**.
- The following letters are **absent** and excluded: **R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**.  
- Available letters for new guesses include untested consonants (e.g., **B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**) and vowels (only **I, U** remain untested since **A, E, O** are eliminated).

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Prioritize placing **""C"" in a new position (3, 4, or 5)** to test its location.
- Include high-frequency untested letters to maximize information:  
  - **T** (common consonant).
  - **H** (common consonant).
  - **I** (only untested vowel other than U).
- Avoid all eliminated letters (**R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**).

### Selected Guess: ""PITCH""
- **P**: Untested consonant (position 1).  
- **I**: Untested vowel (position 2).  
- **T**: Untested consonant (position 3).  
- **C**: Placed in position 4 (testing a new position).  
- **H**: Untested consonant (position 5).  

""PITCH"" is valid, avoids forbidden letters, and efficiently probes **C's correct position** while testing **3 new consonants and 1 vowel**.  

<guess>pitch</guess>",pitch,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is in the secret word, but not in the first position.
  - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: scold -> S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)
Meaning:
  - S, O, L, D are not in the secret word.
  - C is still present but not in the second position (because in ""scold"" it was in position 2 and marked as wrong position).

So now we know:
  The secret word contains the letter C.
  C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains the letter C in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.
  - Uses only letters that haven't been tested yet or that we know must be in the word.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters include:
  B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know C is in the word.

We are on the third guess.

We need to test the position of C and also test other common letters.

Given that C must be in positions 3,4, or 5, we can try to form words with C in each of these positions to see which one fits.

But we have to choose one word. We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let me think of common vowels that are left: I, U (since A, E, O are eliminated). We should include at least one vowel (I or U) to test.

Common consonants left: T, H, M, P, K, etc.

Possible positions for C:
  Option 1: C in position 3: __ c _ _
  Option 2: C in position 4: ___ c _
  Option 3: C in position 5: ____ c

We can also try to cover multiple positions? But we don't know.

Idea: Since we know C is in positions 3,4,5, why not try to put it in position 3? Then we can test two positions after.

But we have to use only allowed letters.

Let's try to form a word with C in position 3 and include common letters: T, H, I, M, P, etc.

Example: 
  Position 1: T (common, not tested)
  Position 2: H (common, not tested)
  Position 3: C
  Position 4: I (vowel, not tested)
  Position 5: P

This would be ""thcip"" which is not a word.

Another: Position 1: T, Position 2: I, Position 3: C, Position 4: K, Position 5: S -> ""ticks"" but S has been eliminated -> not allowed.

We can't use S, O, L, D.

How about ""thump""? But that doesn't have C.

We need C.

Let me try C in position 4.

Example: ___ c _

Position 1: T
Position 2: H
Position 3: U (vowel)
Position 4: C
Position 5: ? Must be a letter not forbidden and such that it forms a word.

Possible: ""thuck""? Not a word.

Another: Position 1: P, Position 2: I, Position 3: L -> but L is eliminated. Cannot.

L is eliminated.

How about ""pick"" but it's 4 letters? We need 5.

Word: ""music"" -> but M is allowed? Yes, but we have U and S? S is eliminated -> not allowed.

We must avoid S.

Alternative: ""panic"" -> has A which is eliminated.

Another idea: C in position 5: ____ c

Then the word ends with C.

Example: words ending with C: ""topic"", ""music"", ""panic"" but all these have O or A or S which are eliminated.

What about ""muck"" -> 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with C? There aren't many. ""havoc"" -> has H and A -> A eliminated. ""arctic"" -> 6 letters, and has A.

""comic"" -> has O which is eliminated.

Perhaps we need to consider words like ""pubic"", but ""pubic"" has P, U, B, I, C. That might work? But we have to check the letters.

""pubic"" - P, U, B, I, C.
  - P is not tested.
  - U is a vowel (not tested).
  - B is not tested.
  - I is a vowel (not tested).
  - C is in the fifth position.

And avoids the forbidden letters: no R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D.

Is ""pubic"" a valid English word? Yes (meaning: relating to the pubes).

So that's a candidate.

But we don't know if the word contains U or I? We are testing them.

Another candidate: ""cubic"" -> but we must not put C in the first position. That is forbidden by the first feedback. So we cannot start with C.

Okay, so words starting with C are impossible? We are avoiding C in first position.

So only words that don't start with C and end with C? Or have C in middle.

""pubic"" is one option.

How about ""mucic"" -> not a common word.

Or ""magic"" -> has A and G? But A is eliminated.

Another word: ""topic"" -> O is eliminated, so no.

So ""pubic"" is a candidate.

But let's think of words with C in position 4.

Example: ___ c _

Position 1: B? Position 2: I? Position 3: T? Position 4: C, Position 5: H? -> ""bitch"" but that might be a word? But it's slang and might not be in the word list. Also, we have not eliminated B,I,T,H.

But ""bitch"" is five letters and valid? But we have to avoid controversy? Actually, we should use valid words. Alternatively, we can use ""beach"" -> but has A and E -> eliminated.

Another: ""watch"" -> contains A? No, ""watch"" has W,A,T,C,H? A is eliminated? Wait, ""watch"": W,A,T,C,H -> A is present -> not allowed.

How about ""pitch""? P,I,T,C,H -> but C is in fourth position? ""pitch"": P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? But that's a word.

Letters: P, I, T, C, H - none of which are forbidden (since forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D). So this is acceptable.

Now, comparing ""pubic"" and ""pitch"":
  ""pubic"": ends with C, letters: P, U, B, I, C -> tests B, U (vowel), and has I (vowel) and P and C.
  ""pitch"": C in fourth, letters: P, I, T, C, H -> tests T, H, and I is a vowel.

We haven't tested T, H, B, U.

Common letters: T is more frequent than B? H is common.

We might want to test T and H? Also, we haven't tested any T so far.

Also, note that we only have one more vowel possibility? Because A,E,O are out, so only I and U are left? Actually, Y can be a vowel too.

But let's choose ""pitch"" because it tests T and H, which are very common consonants.

Also, putting C in the fourth position (since we haven't tested positions 4 for C).

Alternatively, we can put C in the third? Is there a word?

Example: position 3=C: __ c __

Word: ""bucket"" -> 6 letters? No.

""vouch"" -> 5 letters: V, O, U, C, H -> but O is eliminated -> not allowed.

""match"" -> A eliminated.

""batch"" -> A? No.

But we can't use O or A.

How about ""wight""? But no C.

Word with C in third: ""hiccup"" -> 6 letters.

""tacky"" -> A eliminated? T is okay.

Actually, ""tacky"": T(1), A(2) -> but A is eliminated -> invalid.

""bumpy"" -> no C.

It might be hard to find words with C in third.

Another: ""bunch"" -> has U: B,U,N? N is eliminated -> not allowed.

So perhaps C in fourth is easier? ""pitch"" seems good.

Or C in fifth: ""pubic"" or ""comic"" -> but ""comic"" starts with C which we cannot do.

Another ending with C: ""tonic"" -> O eliminated.

""panic"" -> A eliminated.

So ""pubic"" and ""pitch"" are both valid candidates.

But I prefer ""pitch"" because it tests two common consonants (T and H) and we avoid using U? Actually, we need to test U too? But let's see: U is less common? And we haven't eliminated any vowels except A,E,O.

We know the word must contain at least one vowel? And the vowels left are I, U, (and Y as a vowel?).

It also does not repeat any tested letters? Except C which is required.

Therefore, I choose ""pitch"".

But let me confirm: is ""pitch"" a valid word? Yes.

And it does not contain any forbidden letters? All letters are in the set: B,C,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and excluding R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D. Specifically: P,I,T,C,H -> none of the forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D are in it.

So, we'll guess ""pitch"".After analyzing the feedback from both previous guesses:

- The following letters are **absent** and excluded: **R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**.  
- Available letters for new guesses include untested consonants (e.g., **B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**) and vowels (only **I, U** remain untested since **A, E, O** are eliminated).

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Prioritize placing **""C"" in a new position (3, 4, or 5)** to test its location.
- Include high-frequency untested letters to maximize information:  
  - **T** (common consonant).
  - **H** (common consonant).
  - **I** (only untested vowel other than U).
- Avoid all eliminated letters (**R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**).

### Selected Guess: ""PITCH""
- **P**: Untested consonant (position 1).  
- **I**: Untested vowel (position 2).  
- **T**: Untested consonant (position 3).  
- **C**: Placed in position 4 (testing a new position).  
- **H**: Untested consonant (position 5).  

""PITCH"" is valid, avoids forbidden letters, and efficiently probes **C's correct position** while testing **3 new consonants and 1 vowel**.",Guess 3: pitch -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) T(x) C(-) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PICKY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is present in the secret word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
 - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (because in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
   The secret word does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can eliminate any words that contain R, A, N, E.

 Also, note that the letter 'C' must be in the word, but not in the first position. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter 'C' (but not in the first position).
   - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common consonants and vowels that are still possible. Since we have eliminated A and E (common vowels), we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 We also know that the word does not have R, so we can avoid that.

 We can try to use a word that has the letter 'C' in a different position (not first) and includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 We should also avoid using the same letters we already know are absent (R, A, N, E).

 Let's try to form a word that has:
   - 'C' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Other letters that are common and not yet tested.

 Example: 
   We could try putting 'C' in the second position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We want to test multiple positions.

 However, we have to choose one word. Let's try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Idea: Use a word that has 'C' in the second position and includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words:
   ""scoop"" -> but we don't know if O is present? Also, we have two O's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless they are in the word. So we have to be cautious.

 But note: we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So we must use other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to think of words that have 'C' and use common letters.

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, so we can use another consonant. Let's use 'S' (very common).
   Then put 'C' in position 2? Then we have ""S C _ _ _""

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not R, A, N, E and are common.

 Let me try: ""S C O L D"" -> ""scold""? 
   But we haven't tested O, L, D.

 However, note that we have only 5 positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""S C H O P"" -> ""chop"" is 4 letters, so not 5. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""slick""? 
   s l i c k -> but that has 'C' in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), l (2), i (3), c (4), k (5)

 But wait, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except first? Actually, the feedback said C is in the word but not in the first position. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.

 However, in ""slick"", the C is in the fourth position. That's acceptable.

 But let's check the letters: S, L, I, C, K.
   We know C is in the word (so that's good).
   We haven't tested S, L, I, K.

 However, note that we have already eliminated A, E, R, N. So these letters (S, L, I, K) are all new.

 But wait: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the secret word has a 'C' but not in the first position. It did not tell us about other letters. So we don't know if the secret word has S, L, I, K.

 So ""slick"" is a valid guess? But let me check: is ""slick"" a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we can also consider other words that might cover more vowels? We have only one vowel in ""slick"": I.

 Alternatively, we could use a word with O or U? 

 How about ""scout""? 
   s c o u t -> 
   But we have eliminated R, A, N, E, but not O, U. 
   However, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""scout"", C is in the second position. That's acceptable.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not in the first position. It doesn't say that it must be in the second? So we are free to test any position (2-5).

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test the second position for C? Because if we put C in the second position and it gets marked as correct (✓) then we know the second letter is C. If it's marked as wrong position (-) then we know it's in the word but not in the second position (so it must be in 3,4,5). If it's marked as absent (x) that would contradict the first feedback? But wait, the first feedback already said C is present. So it cannot be absent. Therefore, in the feedback for the second guess, we expect to see either ✓ or - for the C.

 So let's try to put C in the second position to test that.

 Therefore, I propose a word that has C in the second position and uses other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Example: ""s c _ _ _""

 We can try:
   ""s c o p e"" -> but we have E? We know E is not in the word! So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E.

 How about ""s c o l d"" -> scold: s, c, o, l, d. 
   This avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have two vowels? Actually, O is a vowel. And we haven't tested O.

 Alternatively, ""s c u l p"" -> sculpt? But that's 6 letters? No, ""sculp"" is not a word. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""s c a b s"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.

 Another: ""s c i o n"" -> but we have N? We know N is not in the word.

 We must avoid A, E, R, N.

 So let's try: ""s c h u t"" -> not a word.

 How about ""s c u m p"" -> not a word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't start with S? But we want to test S too.

 Another idea: start with T? ""t c ..."" but that's not common. We can have ""t"" as the first letter and then ""c"" in the second? But what words? ""tchick"" is not a word.

 How about ""b c"" words? Not common.

 Maybe we should avoid forcing the second letter? We can put C in a different position.

 Let me try to put C in the third position? For example: 
   _ _ c _ _

 Example: ""p u c k s"" -> pucks? But that has S and K? And U.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, N.

 ""pucks"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are testing P, U, C, K, S.

 However, we are putting C in the third position. We know C is in the word, so we are testing if it's in the third.

 Alternatively, we can try ""music"" -> but that has M, U, S, I, C. But we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""music"", C is in the fifth position. That's acceptable. But wait, we have the letter 'I' which is a vowel we haven't tested. However, ""music"" contains the letter 'S' and 'M' and 'U'. 

 But note: we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""music"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

 However, we are on the second guess and we want to maximize information. We might want to avoid repeating the same position for C? Actually, we don't know the position of C, so we are free to test any.

 But the problem: we have only one C? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple. So we have to be cautious.

 Since we don't have much information, let's choose a word that has the letter C and four new letters that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}.

 Let me list the available letters: 
   We can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 How about ""slick"" again? It has S, L, I, C, K. 
   S is very common, L is common, I is a vowel, K is common.

 But note: we are putting C in the fourth position. We can see if it's in the fourth? Or if it's elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can use ""stock"": 
   s t o c k -> 
   This has S, T, O, C, K. 
   And C is in the fourth position? Actually: 
      s (1), t (2), o (3), c (4), k (5)

 But we are testing O as well.

 However, we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""stock"" does not have these.

 So ""stock"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare ""slick"" and ""stock"":
   slick: tests S, L, I, C, K.
   stock: tests S, T, O, C, K.

 We haven't tested T or O or L or I? So both are good.

 Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E) and two consonants (R and N), we might want to test another vowel? We have I and O available.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""stock"" because it has T and O which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""stock"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has C in the second position? Then by putting C in the fourth, we might not get information about the second position? However, we are going to get feedback on the C: if the C in ""stock"" is marked as correct (✓) then we know it's in the fourth. If it's marked as wrong position (-) then we know it's in the word but not in the fourth, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? But we have already tried the first and it wasn't there. And we are not testing position 2 and 3 in this guess? Actually, we are testing position 4 only for C.

 Alternatively, if we put C in the second position, we can get information about the second position.

 So let me reconsider: we can try to put C in the second position to test that.

 How about ""scold""? 
   s c o l d -> 
   This tests: S, C (in second), O, L, D.

 This is also a valid word and avoids A, E, R, N.

 So now I have two options: 
   Option 1: ""stock"" (C in fourth) -> tests S, T, O, C, K.
   Option 2: ""scold"" (C in second) -> tests S, C (second), O, L, D.

 Which one is better? 
   We haven't tested T, K vs L, D. 
   T is more common than D? And K is more common than D? 
   But L is very common.

 Actually, both are good. I'll choose ""scold"" because we are testing the second position for C, which might give us a fixed letter if it's correct.

 So let's go with ""scold"".

 Therefore, my second guess is ""scold"".

<guess>scold</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter **C** is present in the secret word but not in the first position (marked `-`).
- The letters **R, A, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include **C** in positions 2–5 (since it cannot be in position 1).
- The word must exclude **R, A, N, E**.
- To maximize information, I prioritized testing **C** in position 2 (to potentially confirm its exact placement) and introduced new common letters: **S, O, L, D** (all untested so far).

The word **""scold""** fits these criteria:
- **C** is in position 2.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).
- It tests high-frequency consonants (**S, L, D**) and a vowel (**O**), which could reveal critical patterns.

<guess>scold</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: scold -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is in the secret word, but not in the first position.
  - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: scold -> S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)
Meaning:
  - S, O, L, D are not in the secret word.
  - C is still present but not in the second position (because in ""scold"" it was in position 2 and marked as wrong position).

So now we know:
  The secret word contains the letter C.
  C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains the letter C in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.
  - Uses only letters that haven't been tested yet or that we know must be in the word.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters include:
  B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know C is in the word.

We are on the third guess.

We need to test the position of C and also test other common letters.

Given that C must be in positions 3,4, or 5, we can try to form words with C in each of these positions to see which one fits.

But we have to choose one word. We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let me think of common vowels that are left: I, U (since A, E, O are eliminated). We should include at least one vowel (I or U) to test.

Common consonants left: T, H, M, P, K, etc.

Possible positions for C:
  Option 1: C in position 3: __ c _ _
  Option 2: C in position 4: ___ c _
  Option 3: C in position 5: ____ c

We can also try to cover multiple positions? But we don't know.

Idea: Since we know C is in positions 3,4,5, why not try to put it in position 3? Then we can test two positions after.

But we have to use only allowed letters.

Let's try to form a word with C in position 3 and include common letters: T, H, I, M, P, etc.

Example: 
  Position 1: T (common, not tested)
  Position 2: H (common, not tested)
  Position 3: C
  Position 4: I (vowel, not tested)
  Position 5: P

This would be ""thcip"" which is not a word.

Another: Position 1: T, Position 2: I, Position 3: C, Position 4: K, Position 5: S -> ""ticks"" but S has been eliminated -> not allowed.

We can't use S, O, L, D.

How about ""thump""? But that doesn't have C.

We need C.

Let me try C in position 4.

Example: ___ c _

Position 1: T
Position 2: H
Position 3: U (vowel)
Position 4: C
Position 5: ? Must be a letter not forbidden and such that it forms a word.

Possible: ""thuck""? Not a word.

Another: Position 1: P, Position 2: I, Position 3: L -> but L is eliminated. Cannot.

L is eliminated.

How about ""pick"" but it's 4 letters? We need 5.

Word: ""music"" -> but M is allowed? Yes, but we have U and S? S is eliminated -> not allowed.

We must avoid S.

Alternative: ""panic"" -> has A which is eliminated.

Another idea: C in position 5: ____ c

Then the word ends with C.

Example: words ending with C: ""topic"", ""music"", ""panic"" but all these have O or A or S which are eliminated.

What about ""muck"" -> 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with C? There aren't many. ""havoc"" -> has H and A -> A eliminated. ""arctic"" -> 6 letters, and has A.

""comic"" -> has O which is eliminated.

Perhaps we need to consider words like ""pubic"", but ""pubic"" has P, U, B, I, C. That might work? But we have to check the letters.

""pubic"" - P, U, B, I, C.
  - P is not tested.
  - U is a vowel (not tested).
  - B is not tested.
  - I is a vowel (not tested).
  - C is in the fifth position.

And avoids the forbidden letters: no R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D.

Is ""pubic"" a valid English word? Yes (meaning: relating to the pubes).

So that's a candidate.

But we don't know if the word contains U or I? We are testing them.

Another candidate: ""cubic"" -> but we must not put C in the first position. That is forbidden by the first feedback. So we cannot start with C.

Okay, so words starting with C are impossible? We are avoiding C in first position.

So only words that don't start with C and end with C? Or have C in middle.

""pubic"" is one option.

How about ""mucic"" -> not a common word.

Or ""magic"" -> has A and G? But A is eliminated.

Another word: ""topic"" -> O is eliminated, so no.

So ""pubic"" is a candidate.

But let's think of words with C in position 4.

Example: ___ c _

Position 1: B? Position 2: I? Position 3: T? Position 4: C, Position 5: H? -> ""bitch"" but that might be a word? But it's slang and might not be in the word list. Also, we have not eliminated B,I,T,H.

But ""bitch"" is five letters and valid? But we have to avoid controversy? Actually, we should use valid words. Alternatively, we can use ""beach"" -> but has A and E -> eliminated.

Another: ""watch"" -> contains A? No, ""watch"" has W,A,T,C,H? A is eliminated? Wait, ""watch"": W,A,T,C,H -> A is present -> not allowed.

How about ""pitch""? P,I,T,C,H -> but C is in fourth position? ""pitch"": P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? But that's a word.

Letters: P, I, T, C, H - none of which are forbidden (since forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D). So this is acceptable.

Now, comparing ""pubic"" and ""pitch"":
  ""pubic"": ends with C, letters: P, U, B, I, C -> tests B, U (vowel), and has I (vowel) and P and C.
  ""pitch"": C in fourth, letters: P, I, T, C, H -> tests T, H, and I is a vowel.

We haven't tested T, H, B, U.

Common letters: T is more frequent than B? H is common.

We might want to test T and H? Also, we haven't tested any T so far.

Also, note that we only have one more vowel possibility? Because A,E,O are out, so only I and U are left? Actually, Y can be a vowel too.

But let's choose ""pitch"" because it tests T and H, which are very common consonants.

Also, putting C in the fourth position (since we haven't tested positions 4 for C).

Alternatively, we can put C in the third? Is there a word?

Example: position 3=C: __ c __

Word: ""bucket"" -> 6 letters? No.

""vouch"" -> 5 letters: V, O, U, C, H -> but O is eliminated -> not allowed.

""match"" -> A eliminated.

""batch"" -> A? No.

But we can't use O or A.

How about ""wight""? But no C.

Word with C in third: ""hiccup"" -> 6 letters.

""tacky"" -> A eliminated? T is okay.

Actually, ""tacky"": T(1), A(2) -> but A is eliminated -> invalid.

""bumpy"" -> no C.

It might be hard to find words with C in third.

Another: ""bunch"" -> has U: B,U,N? N is eliminated -> not allowed.

So perhaps C in fourth is easier? ""pitch"" seems good.

Or C in fifth: ""pubic"" or ""comic"" -> but ""comic"" starts with C which we cannot do.

Another ending with C: ""tonic"" -> O eliminated.

""panic"" -> A eliminated.

So ""pubic"" and ""pitch"" are both valid candidates.

But I prefer ""pitch"" because it tests two common consonants (T and H) and we avoid using U? Actually, we need to test U too? But let's see: U is less common? And we haven't eliminated any vowels except A,E,O.

We know the word must contain at least one vowel? And the vowels left are I, U, (and Y as a vowel?).

By testing ""pitch"", we are testing I as a vowel. If I is not in the word, then it might be U. If we test ""pitch"" and I is absent, then we know the vowel is U (or Y). But we have only limited choices.

Alternatively, if we test ""pubic"", we test two vowels: U and I? And we can get information about both.

So perhaps ""pubic"" is better? Actually, no: ""pubic"" has two vowels? We can know for both.

But let me check:

In ""pubic"": 
  - If U is in the word? Position 2? 
  - If I is in the word? Position 4?
  - And C at position 5? Which we know is not fixed? Actually, we don't know the position of C.

However, we are testing U and I together? So we might waste a guess? Or we might get information faster.

I think we should choose one vowel to test at a time? Because if we use two vowels and both are absent? Then we know we have to look for Y? Or other vowels? But 5-letter words usually have at least one vowel.

The English alphabet has vowels: A,E,I,O,U, sometimes Y.

We don't know if Y is in the word? We haven't tested Y.

But let's stick to I and U first.

I think ""pitch"" is a solid choice: it tests T, H, I (vowel), and C in the fourth position.

It also does not repeat any tested letters? Except C which is required.

Therefore, I choose ""pitch"".

But let me confirm: is ""pitch"" a valid word? Yes.

And it does not contain any forbidden letters? All letters are in the set: B,C,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and excluding R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D. Specifically: P,I,T,C,H -> none of the forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D are in it.

So, we'll guess ""pitch"".After analyzing the feedback from both previous guesses:

1. **First Guess (crane):**  
   - **C**: Present but not in position 1 (marked `-`).  
   - **R, A, N, E**: Absent (marked `x`).  

2. **Second Guess (scold):**  
   - **S, O, L, D**: Absent (marked `x`).  
   - **C**: Present but not in position 2 (marked `-`).  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word **must contain ""C""**, but it cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (since both placements were flagged as wrong positions). Therefore, **""C"" must be in position 3, 4, or 5**.
- The following letters are **absent** and excluded: **R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**.  
- Available letters for new guesses include untested consonants (e.g., **B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**) and vowels (only **I, U** remain untested since **A, E, O** are eliminated).

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Prioritize placing **""C"" in a new position (3, 4, or 5)** to test its location.
- Include high-frequency untested letters to maximize information:  
  - **T** (common consonant).
  - **H** (common consonant).
  - **I** (only untested vowel other than U).
- Avoid all eliminated letters (**R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**).

### Selected Guess: ""PITCH""
- **P**: Untested consonant (position 1).  
- **I**: Untested vowel (position 2).  
- **T**: Untested consonant (position 3).  
- **C**: Placed in position 4 (testing a new position).  
- **H**: Untested consonant (position 5).  

""PITCH"" is valid, avoids forbidden letters, and efficiently probes **C's correct position** while testing **3 new consonants and 1 vowel**.

So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we are on the second try.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n   - Does not contain R, A, N, E.\n   - Contains the letter \'C\' (but not in the first position).\n   - We want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common consonants and vowels that are still possible. Since we have eliminated A and E (common vowels), we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n\n We also know that the word does not have R, so we can avoid that.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the letter \'C\' in a different position (not first) and includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.\n\n We should also avoid using the same letters we already know are absent (R, A, N, E).\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has:\n   - \'C\' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n   - Other letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\n Example: \n   We could try putting \'C\' in the second position? But note: we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We want to test multiple positions.\n\n However, we have to choose one word. Let\'s try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Idea: Use a word that has \'C\' in the second position and includes S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Example words:\n   ""scoop"" -> but we don\'t know if O is present? Also, we have two O\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless they are in the word. So we have to be cautious.\n\n But note: we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So we must use other vowels: I, O, U.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have \'C\' and use common letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n   Position 1: cannot be C, so we can use another consonant. Let\'s use \'S\' (very common).\n   Then put \'C\' in position 2? Then we have ""S C _ _ _""\n\n We need to fill the rest with letters that are not R, A, N, E and are common.\n\n Let me try: ""S C O L D"" -> ""scold""? \n   But we haven\'t tested O, L, D.\n\n However, note that we have only 5 positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: ""S C H O P"" -> ""chop"" is 4 letters, so not 5. We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""slick""? \n   s l i c k -> but that has \'C\' in the fourth position? Actually: \n      s (1), l (2), i (3), c (4), k (5)\n\n But wait, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except first? Actually, the feedback said C is in the word but not in the first position. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.\n\n However, in ""slick"", the C is in the fourth position. That\'s acceptable.\n\n But let\'s check the letters: S, L, I, C, K.\n   We know C is in the word (so that\'s good).\n   We haven\'t tested S, L, I, K.\n\n However, note that we have already eliminated A, E, R, N. So these letters (S, L, I, K) are all new.\n\n But wait: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the secret word has a \'C\' but not in the first position. It did not tell us about other letters. So we don\'t know if the secret word has S, L, I, K.\n\n So ""slick"" is a valid guess? But let me check: is ""slick"" a valid English word? Yes.\n\n However, we can also consider other words that might cover more vowels? We have only one vowel in ""slick"": I.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word with O or U? \n\n How about ""scout""? \n   s c o u t -> \n   But we have eliminated R, A, N, E, but not O, U. \n   However, we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""scout"", C is in the second position. That\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not in the first position. It doesn\'t say that it must be in the second? So we are free to test any position (2-5).\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test the second position for C? Because if we put C in the second position and it gets marked as correct (✓) then we know the second letter is C. If it\'s marked as wrong position (-) then we know it\'s in the word but not in the second position (so it must be in 3,4,5). If it\'s marked as absent (x) that would contradict the first feedback? But wait, the first feedback already said C is present. So it cannot be absent. Therefore, in the feedback for the second guess, we expect to see either ✓ or - for the C.\n\n So let\'s try to put C in the second position to test that.\n\n Therefore, I propose a word that has C in the second position and uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Example: ""s c _ _ _""\n\n We can try:\n   ""s c o p e"" -> but we have E? We know E is not in the word! So we cannot use E.\n\n We must avoid E.\n\n How about ""s c o l d"" -> scold: s, c, o, l, d. \n   This avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have two vowels? Actually, O is a vowel. And we haven\'t tested O.\n\n Alternatively, ""s c u l p"" -> sculpt? But that\'s 6 letters? No, ""sculp"" is not a word. We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""s c a b s"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.\n\n Another: ""s c i o n"" -> but we have N? We know N is not in the word.\n\n We must avoid A, E, R, N.\n\n So let\'s try: ""s c h u t"" -> not a word.\n\n How about ""s c u m p"" -> not a word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t start with S? But we want to test S too.\n\n Another idea: start with T? ""t c ..."" but that\'s not common. We can have ""t"" as the first letter and then ""c"" in the second? But what words? ""tchick"" is not a word.\n\n How about ""b c"" words? Not common.\n\n Maybe we should avoid forcing the second letter? We can put C in a different position.\n\n Let me try to put C in the third position? For example: \n   _ _ c _ _\n\n Example: ""p u c k s"" -> pucks? But that has S and K? And U.\n\n But we have to avoid A, E, R, N.\n\n ""pucks"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But note: we are testing P, U, C, K, S.\n\n However, we are putting C in the third position. We know C is in the word, so we are testing if it\'s in the third.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""music"" -> but that has M, U, S, I, C. But we have to avoid the first position for C? Actually, in ""music"", C is in the fifth position. That\'s acceptable. But wait, we have the letter \'I\' which is a vowel we haven\'t tested. However, ""music"" contains the letter \'S\' and \'M\' and \'U\'. \n\n But note: we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""music"" does not contain these, so it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we are on the second guess and we want to maximize information. We might want to avoid repeating the same position for C? Actually, we don\'t know the position of C, so we are free to test any.\n\n But the problem: we have only one C? The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple. So we have to be cautious.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information, let\'s choose a word that has the letter C and four new letters that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}.\n\n Let me list the available letters: \n   We can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n How about ""slick"" again? It has S, L, I, C, K. \n   S is very common, L is common, I is a vowel, K is common.\n\n But note: we are putting C in the fourth position. We can see if it\'s in the fourth? Or if it\'s elsewhere.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""stock"": \n   s t o c k -> \n   This has S, T, O, C, K. \n   And C is in the fourth position? Actually: \n      s (1), t (2), o (3), c (4), k (5)\n\n But we are testing O as well.\n\n However, we must avoid A, E, R, N. ""stock"" does not have these.\n\n So ""stock"" is a valid word.\n\n But let me compare ""slick"" and ""stock"":\n   slick: tests S, L, I, C, K.\n   stock: tests S, T, O, C, K.\n\n We haven\'t tested T or O or L or I? So both are good.\n\n Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E) and two consonants (R and N), we might want to test another vowel? We have I and O available.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""stock"" because it has T and O which are very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""stock"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has C in the second position? Then by putting C in the fourth, we might not get information about the second position? However, we are going to get feedback on the C: if the C in ""stock"" is marked as correct (✓) then we know it\'s in the fourth. If it\'s marked as wrong position (-) then we know it\'s in the word but not in the fourth, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? But we have already tried the first and it wasn\'t there. And we are not testing position 2 and 3 in this guess? Actually, we are testing position 4 only for C.\n\n Alternatively, if we put C in the second position, we can get information about the second position.\n\n So let me reconsider: we can try to put C in the second position to test that.\n\n How about ""scold""? \n   s c o l d -> \n   This tests: S, C (in second), O, L, D.\n\n This is also a valid word and avoids A, E, R, N.\n\n So now I have two options: \n   Option 1: ""stock"" (C in fourth) -> tests S, T, O, C, K.\n   Option 2: ""scold"" (C in second) -> tests S, C (second), O, L, D.\n\n Which one is better? \n   We haven\'t tested T, K vs L, D. \n   T is more common than D? And K is more common than D? \n   But L is very common.\n\n Actually, both are good. I\'ll choose ""scold"" because we are testing the second position for C, which might give us a fixed letter if it\'s correct.\n\n So let\'s go with ""scold"".\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""scold"".\n\n<guess>scold</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The letter **C** is present in the secret word but not in the first position (marked `-`).\n- The letters **R, A, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include **C** in positions 2–5 (since it cannot be in position 1).\n- The word must exclude **R, A, N, E**.\n- To maximize information, I prioritized testing **C** in position 2 (to potentially confirm its exact placement) and introduced new common letters: **S, O, L, D** (all untested so far).\n\nThe word **""scold""** fits these criteria:\n- **C** is in position 2.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).\n- It tests high-frequency consonants (**S, L, D**) and a vowel (**O**), which could reveal critical patterns.\n\n<guess>scold</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scold -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - C is in the secret word, but not in the first position.\n  - R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n\nGuess 2: scold -> S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S, O, L, D are not in the secret word.\n  - C is still present but not in the second position (because in ""scold"" it was in position 2 and marked as wrong position).\n\nSo now we know:\n  The secret word contains the letter C.\n  C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, the following letters are not in the word: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.\n\nWe must choose a word that:\n  - Contains the letter C in position 3, 4, or 5.\n  - Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D.\n  - Uses only letters that haven\'t been tested yet or that we know must be in the word.\n\nWe have eliminated many common letters. The available letters include:\n  B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know C is in the word.\n\nWe are on the third guess.\n\nWe need to test the position of C and also test other common letters.\n\nGiven that C must be in positions 3,4, or 5, we can try to form words with C in each of these positions to see which one fits.\n\nBut we have to choose one word. We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.\n\nLet me think of common vowels that are left: I, U (since A, E, O are eliminated). We should include at least one vowel (I or U) to test.\n\nCommon consonants left: T, H, M, P, K, etc.\n\nPossible positions for C:\n  Option 1: C in position 3: __ c _ _\n  Option 2: C in position 4: ___ c _\n  Option 3: C in position 5: ____ c\n\nWe can also try to cover multiple positions? But we don\'t know.\n\nIdea: Since we know C is in positions 3,4,5, why not try to put it in position 3? Then we can test two positions after.\n\nBut we have to use only allowed letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word with C in position 3 and include common letters: T, H, I, M, P, etc.\n\nExample: \n  Position 1: T (common, not tested)\n  Position 2: H (common, not tested)\n  Position 3: C\n  Position 4: I (vowel, not tested)\n  Position 5: P\n\nThis would be ""thcip"" which is not a word.\n\nAnother: Position 1: T, Position 2: I, Position 3: C, Position 4: K, Position 5: S -> ""ticks"" but S has been eliminated -> not allowed.\n\nWe can\'t use S, O, L, D.\n\nHow about ""thump""? But that doesn\'t have C.\n\nWe need C.\n\nLet me try C in position 4.\n\nExample: ___ c _\n\nPosition 1: T\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: U (vowel)\nPosition 4: C\nPosition 5: ? Must be a letter not forbidden and such that it forms a word.\n\nPossible: ""thuck""? Not a word.\n\nAnother: Position 1: P, Position 2: I, Position 3: L -> but L is eliminated. Cannot.\n\nL is eliminated.\n\nHow about ""pick"" but it\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\nWord: ""music"" -> but M is allowed? Yes, but we have U and S? S is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nAlternative: ""panic"" -> has A which is eliminated.\n\nAnother idea: C in position 5: ____ c\n\nThen the word ends with C.\n\nExample: words ending with C: ""topic"", ""music"", ""panic"" but all these have O or A or S which are eliminated.\n\nWhat about ""muck"" -> 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words ending with C? There aren\'t many. ""havoc"" -> has H and A -> A eliminated. ""arctic"" -> 6 letters, and has A.\n\n""comic"" -> has O which is eliminated.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider words like ""pubic"", but ""pubic"" has P, U, B, I, C. That might work? But we have to check the letters.\n\n""pubic"" - P, U, B, I, C.\n  - P is not tested.\n  - U is a vowel (not tested).\n  - B is not tested.\n  - I is a vowel (not tested).\n  - C is in the fifth position.\n\nAnd avoids the forbidden letters: no R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D.\n\nIs ""pubic"" a valid English word? Yes (meaning: relating to the pubes).\n\nSo that\'s a candidate.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word contains U or I? We are testing them.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cubic"" -> but we must not put C in the first position. That is forbidden by the first feedback. So we cannot start with C.\n\nOkay, so words starting with C are impossible? We are avoiding C in first position.\n\nSo only words that don\'t start with C and end with C? Or have C in middle.\n\n""pubic"" is one option.\n\nHow about ""mucic"" -> not a common word.\n\nOr ""magic"" -> has A and G? But A is eliminated.\n\nAnother word: ""topic"" -> O is eliminated, so no.\n\nSo ""pubic"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s think of words with C in position 4.\n\nExample: ___ c _\n\nPosition 1: B? Position 2: I? Position 3: T? Position 4: C, Position 5: H? -> ""bitch"" but that might be a word? But it\'s slang and might not be in the word list. Also, we have not eliminated B,I,T,H.\n\nBut ""bitch"" is five letters and valid? But we have to avoid controversy? Actually, we should use valid words. Alternatively, we can use ""beach"" -> but has A and E -> eliminated.\n\nAnother: ""watch"" -> contains A? No, ""watch"" has W,A,T,C,H? A is eliminated? Wait, ""watch"": W,A,T,C,H -> A is present -> not allowed.\n\nHow about ""pitch""? P,I,T,C,H -> but C is in fourth position? ""pitch"": P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? But that\'s a word.\n\nLetters: P, I, T, C, H - none of which are forbidden (since forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D). So this is acceptable.\n\nNow, comparing ""pubic"" and ""pitch"":\n  ""pubic"": ends with C, letters: P, U, B, I, C -> tests B, U (vowel), and has I (vowel) and P and C.\n  ""pitch"": C in fourth, letters: P, I, T, C, H -> tests T, H, and I is a vowel.\n\nWe haven\'t tested T, H, B, U.\n\nCommon letters: T is more frequent than B? H is common.\n\nWe might want to test T and H? Also, we haven\'t tested any T so far.\n\nAlso, note that we only have one more vowel possibility? Because A,E,O are out, so only I and U are left? Actually, Y can be a vowel too.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""pitch"" because it tests T and H, which are very common consonants.\n\nAlso, putting C in the fourth position (since we haven\'t tested positions 4 for C).\n\nAlternatively, we can put C in the third? Is there a word?\n\nExample: position 3=C: __ c __\n\nWord: ""bucket"" -> 6 letters? No.\n\n""vouch"" -> 5 letters: V, O, U, C, H -> but O is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""match"" -> A eliminated.\n\n""batch"" -> A? No.\n\nBut we can\'t use O or A.\n\nHow about ""wight""? But no C.\n\nWord with C in third: ""hiccup"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""tacky"" -> A eliminated? T is okay.\n\nActually, ""tacky"": T(1), A(2) -> but A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""bumpy"" -> no C.\n\nIt might be hard to find words with C in third.\n\nAnother: ""bunch"" -> has U: B,U,N? N is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps C in fourth is easier? ""pitch"" seems good.\n\nOr C in fifth: ""pubic"" or ""comic"" -> but ""comic"" starts with C which we cannot do.\n\nAnother ending with C: ""tonic"" -> O eliminated.\n\n""panic"" -> A eliminated.\n\nSo ""pubic"" and ""pitch"" are both valid candidates.\n\nBut I prefer ""pitch"" because it tests two common consonants (T and H) and we avoid using U? Actually, we need to test U too? But let\'s see: U is less common? And we haven\'t eliminated any vowels except A,E,O.\n\nWe know the word must contain at least one vowel? And the vowels left are I, U, (and Y as a vowel?).\n\nBy testing ""pitch"", we are testing I as a vowel. If I is not in the word, then it might be U. If we test ""pitch"" and I is absent, then we know the vowel is U (or Y). But we have only limited choices.\n\nAlternatively, if we test ""pubic"", we test two vowels: U and I? And we can get information about both.\n\nSo perhaps ""pubic"" is better? Actually, no: ""pubic"" has two vowels? We can know for both.\n\nBut let me check:\n\nIn ""pubic"": \n  - If U is in the word? Position 2? \n  - If I is in the word? Position 4?\n  - And C at position 5? Which we know is not fixed? Actually, we don\'t know the position of C.\n\nHowever, we are testing U and I together? So we might waste a guess? Or we might get information faster.\n\nI think we should choose one vowel to test at a time? Because if we use two vowels and both are absent? Then we know we have to look for Y? Or other vowels? But 5-letter words usually have at least one vowel.\n\nThe English alphabet has vowels: A,E,I,O,U, sometimes Y.\n\nWe don\'t know if Y is in the word? We haven\'t tested Y.\n\nBut let\'s stick to I and U first.\n\nI think ""pitch"" is a solid choice: it tests T, H, I (vowel), and C in the fourth position.\n\nIt also does not repeat any tested letters? Except C which is required.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""pitch"".\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""pitch"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnd it does not contain any forbidden letters? All letters are in the set: B,C,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and excluding R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D. Specifically: P,I,T,C,H -> none of the forbidden: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D are in it.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""pitch"".After analyzing the feedback from both previous guesses:\n\n1. **First Guess (crane):**  \n   - **C**: Present but not in position 1 (marked `-`).  \n   - **R, A, N, E**: Absent (marked `x`).  \n\n2. **Second Guess (scold):**  \n   - **S, O, L, D**: Absent (marked `x`).  \n   - **C**: Present but not in position 2 (marked `-`).  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- The secret word **must contain ""C""**, but it cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (since both placements were flagged as wrong positions). Therefore, **""C"" must be in position 3, 4, or 5**.\n- The following letters are **absent** and excluded: **R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**.  \n- Available letters for new guesses include untested consonants (e.g., **B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**) and vowels (only **I, U** remain untested since **A, E, O** are eliminated).\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- Prioritize placing **""C"" in a new position (3, 4, or 5)** to test its location.\n- Include high-frequency untested letters to maximize information:  \n  - **T** (common consonant).\n  - **H** (common consonant).\n  - **I** (only untested vowel other than U).\n- Avoid all eliminated letters (**R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D**).\n\n### Selected Guess: ""PITCH""\n- **P**: Untested consonant (position 1).  \n- **I**: Untested vowel (position 2).  \n- **T**: Untested consonant (position 3).  \n- **C**: Placed in position 4 (testing a new position).  \n- **H**: Untested consonant (position 5).  \n\n""PITCH"" is valid, avoids forbidden letters, and efficiently probes **C\'s correct position** while testing **3 new consonants and 1 vowel**.\n\n<guess>pitch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scold -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(x) L(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: pitch -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) T(x) C(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>

- C is present but in the wrong position (since it's marked -). Note: C is in position 4 in this guess, so it cannot be in position 4 in the secret word.
- H is absent (x).

From previous guesses, we also know:
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 2 (from guess 2). Now we also know it's not in position 4 (from this guess). Therefore, C must be in position 3 or 5? But wait, the secret word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We have:
  Position 1: P (fixed)
  Position 2: I (fixed)

So the secret word starts with ""P I _ _ _""

And C is in the word but not in positions 1,2,4. So the only possibilities for C are position 3 or 5.

But we also have T and H eliminated: they are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous feedback, we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D, T, H.

Now, the known fixed positions:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: I

We need to fill positions 3,4,5.

Constraints:
- Position 3: cannot be T or H, and cannot be any of the absent letters. Also, if C is in position 3, that's possible. Otherwise, it must be another letter.
- Position 4: cannot be C (because in ""pitch"" it was in position 4 and marked as wrong position, meaning it's not in position 4). Also, cannot be T or H or absent letters.
- Position 5: cannot be T or H or absent letters. And if C is not in position 3, then it must be in position 5.

We also know that the word must contain C (somewhere in 3 or 5).

Now, let's list the available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested and are not absent.

Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D, T, H.

So absent: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D,T,H.

Available letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I and P are already in the word (fixed in positions 1 and 2). We can reuse letters? But the feedback hasn't indicated any duplicates so far. However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. But in this case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback. Since we are not forced to avoid duplicates, we can consider words with duplicate letters? But we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

But to be safe, we should avoid using P and I again? Actually, we can use them if necessary, but since they are already fixed, we don't need to test them again. But in positions 3,4,5, we can have other letters.

However, the feedback for ""pitch"" showed that T and H are absent, so we cannot use them.

Now, the secret word is ""P I _ _ _"", and we know C must be in position 3 or 5.

Case 1: C in position 3 -> then the word is ""P I C _ _""
Case 2: C in position 5 -> then the word is ""P I _ _ C""

We need to fill the remaining positions with available letters.

Also, we must form a valid English word.

Let's consider case 1: ""P I C _ _""
  The fourth and fifth positions must be filled with letters from: B, F, G, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I? but I is already used, but duplicates? not sure).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We should avoid duplicates for now? Because if we use a duplicate, we might not get new information.

But let's see: if we use a duplicate, the feedback might tell us if there is a duplicate? But we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so maybe the word has no duplicates? We don't know.

To be safe, we can avoid using P and I again. So for the remaining positions, use new letters.

So for ""P I C _ _"", we need two letters from: B, F, G, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What words are there? 
  ""pick"" is 4 letters. 
  ""picky"" -> P,I,C,K,Y -> but we have Y? and K. 
  ""piccy"" not a word.

  ""picks"" -> but S is eliminated.

  ""picot"" -> O eliminated.

  ""picul"" -> L eliminated.

  ""picas"" -> A and S eliminated.

  ""pice"" is 4 letters.

  ""picky"" is a word: P,I,C,K,Y -> but we have position 3 as C? Then positions 4 and 5: K and Y.

  So ""picky"" would be: P(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 

But we are not sure if C is in position 3? We are just considering the case.

But we don't know if the word is ""picky"". We have to test.

Alternatively, case 2: C in position 5: ""P I _ _ C""

Then we need to fill positions 3 and 4.

Words: 
  ""pithy"" -> but T and H are eliminated -> not allowed.
  ""pinto"" -> O eliminated.
  ""pinch"" -> N and H eliminated.
  ""pink"" is 4 letters.
  ""pious"" -> O and S eliminated.
  ""pique"" -> E and U? P,I,Q,U,E -> but E is eliminated.

  ""pixie"" -> has E? and X? P,I,X,I,E -> but E eliminated and duplicate I? 
  Actually, ""pixie"": P,I,X,I,E -> but E is eliminated.

  ""piety"" -> E eliminated.

  ""pig"" is 3 letters.

  ""pirog"" -> not a common word? and O? 

  ""pivot"" -> O and T eliminated.

### Analysis of Feedback

From the feedback for **Guess 3 (pitch)**:
- **P(✓)**: Correct and in position 1.
- **I(✓)**: Correct and in position 2.
- **T(x)**: Absent from the secret word.
- **C(-)**: Present but not in position 4.
- **H(x)**: Absent from the secret word.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **P**  
   - Position 2: **I**  
   The secret word starts with **""PI""**.  

2. **C's position**:  
   - C is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from Guesses 1–3).  
   - Thus, **C must be in position 3 or 5**.  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - Eliminated: **R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D, T, H** (from all feedback).  
   - Available letters: **B, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z** (and **C**, which is required).  

4. **Structure**:  
   - The secret word is **""PI_ _ _""**, with positions 3, 4, 5 to be filled.  
   - Position 3: Must be **C** or another available letter (if C is in position 5).  
   - Position 5: Must be **C** if position 3 is not C.  

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- **Test C in position 5** (since position 3 is riskier and has fewer valid words).  
- Use **""PI _ _ C""** structure to verify if C is at the end.  
- Fill positions 3–4 with **high-frequency untested letters** (e.g., **K, M, U, Y**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all eliminated letters and reuse of fixed letters (P/I) unless necessary.  

### Selected Guess: **""PICKY""**
- **P(✓)**: Confirms position 1 (fixed).  
- **I(✓)**: Confirms position 2 (fixed).  
- **C**: Placed in **position 3** (tests if C is here or forces it to position 5).  
- **K**: Untested consonant (position 4).  
- **Y**: Untested vowel (position 5, tests if Y is present).  

**Why ""PICKY""?**  
- If C is in position 3, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
- If C is absent from position 3 (marked `-` or `x`), it **must be in position 5** (since C is in the word).  
- Tests **K** and **Y**—common letters that could appear in positions 4/5.  
- Avoids all eliminated letters and fits common English words (e.g., ""picky"" is valid).  

<guess>picky</guess>",picky,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""pitch"":
  P(✓) I(✓) T(x) C(-) H(x)

Interpretation:
- P is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- I is correct and in the correct position (position 2).
- T is absent from the secret word (x).
- C is present but in the wrong position (since it's marked -). Note: C is in position 4 in this guess, so it cannot be in position 4 in the secret word.
- H is absent (x).

From previous guesses, we also know:
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 2 (from guess 2). Now we also know it's not in position 4 (from this guess). Therefore, C must be in position 3 or 5? But wait, the secret word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We have:
  Position 1: P (fixed)
  Position 2: I (fixed)

So the secret word starts with ""P I _ _ _""

And C is in the word but not in positions 1,2,4. So the only possibilities for C are position 3 or 5.

But we also have T and H eliminated: they are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous feedback, we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D, T, H.

Now, the known fixed positions:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: I

We need to fill positions 3,4,5.

Constraints:
- Position 3: cannot be T or H, and cannot be any of the absent letters. Also, if C is in position 3, that's possible. Otherwise, it must be another letter.
- Position 4: cannot be C (because in ""pitch"" it was in position 4 and marked as wrong position, meaning it's not in position 4). Also, cannot be T or H or absent letters.
- Position 5: cannot be T or H or absent letters. And if C is not in position 3, then it must be in position 5.

We also know that the word must contain C (somewhere in 3 or 5).

Now, let's list the available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested and are not absent.

Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D, T, H.

So absent: R,A,N,E,S,O,L,D,T,H.

Available letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I and P are already in the word (fixed in positions 1 and 2). We can reuse letters? But the feedback hasn't indicated any duplicates so far. However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. But in this case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback. Since we are not forced to avoid duplicates, we can consider words with duplicate letters? But we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

But to be safe, we should avoid using P and I again? Actually, we can use them if necessary, but since they are already fixed, we don't need to test them again. But in positions 3,4,5, we can have other letters.

However, the feedback for ""pitch"" showed that T and H are absent, so we cannot use them.

Now, the secret word is ""P I _ _ _"", and we know C must be in position 3 or 5.

Case 1: C in position 3 -> then the word is ""P I C _ _""
Case 2: C in position 5 -> then the word is ""P I _ _ C""

We need to fill the remaining positions with available letters.

Also, we must form a valid English word.

Let's consider case 1: ""P I C _ _""
  The fourth and fifth positions must be filled with letters from: B, F, G, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I? but I is already used, but duplicates? not sure).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We should avoid duplicates for now? Because if we use a duplicate, we might not get new information.

But let's see: if we use a duplicate, the feedback might tell us if there is a duplicate? But we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so maybe the word has no duplicates? We don't know.

To be safe, we can avoid using P and I again. So for the remaining positions, use new letters.

So for ""P I C _ _"", we need two letters from: B, F, G, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What words are there? 
  ""pick"" is 4 letters. 
  ""picky"" -> P,I,C,K,Y -> but we have Y? and K. 
  ""piccy"" not a word.

  ""picks"" -> but S is eliminated.

  ""picot"" -> O eliminated.

  ""picul"" -> L eliminated.

  ""picas"" -> A and S eliminated.

  ""pice"" is 4 letters.

  ""picky"" is a word: P,I,C,K,Y -> but we have position 3 as C? Then positions 4 and 5: K and Y.

  So ""picky"" would be: P(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 

But we are not sure if C is in position 3? We are just considering the case.

But we don't know if the word is ""picky"". We have to test.

Alternatively, case 2: C in position 5: ""P I _ _ C""

Then we need to fill positions 3 and 4.

Words: 
  ""pithy"" -> but T and H are eliminated -> not allowed.
  ""pinto"" -> O eliminated.
  ""pinch"" -> N and H eliminated.
  ""pink"" is 4 letters.
  ""pious"" -> O and S eliminated.
  ""pique"" -> E and U? P,I,Q,U,E -> but E is eliminated.

  ""pixie"" -> has E? and X? P,I,X,I,E -> but E eliminated and duplicate I? 
  Actually, ""pixie"": P,I,X,I,E -> but E is eliminated.

  ""piety"" -> E eliminated.

  ""pig"" is 3 letters.

  ""pirog"" -> not a common word? and O? 

  ""pivot"" -> O and T eliminated.

  ""pinas极速赛车开奖结果官网### Analysis of Feedback

From the feedback for **Guess 3 (pitch)**:
- **P(✓)**: Correct and in position 1.
- **I(✓)**: Correct and in position 2.
- **T(x)**: Absent from the secret word.
- **C(-)**: Present but not in position 4.
- **H(x)**: Absent from the secret word.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **P**  
   - Position 2: **I**  
   The secret word starts with **""PI""**.  

2. **C's position**:  
   - C is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from Guesses 1–3).  
   - Thus, **C must be in position 3 or 5**.  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - Eliminated: **R, A, N, E, S, O, L, D, T, H** (from all feedback).  
   - Available letters: **B, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z** (and **C**, which is required).  

4. **Structure**:  
   - The secret word is **""PI_ _ _""**, with positions 3, 4, 5 to be filled.  
   - Position 3: Must be **C** or another available letter (if C is in position 5).  
   - Position 5: Must be **C** if position 3 is not C.  

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- **Test C in position 5** (since position 3 is riskier and has fewer valid words).  
- Use **""PI _ _ C""** structure to verify if C is at the end.  
- Fill positions 3–4 with **high-frequency untested letters** (e.g., **K, M, U, Y**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all eliminated letters and reuse of fixed letters (P/I) unless necessary.  

### Selected Guess: **""PICKY""**
- **P(✓)**: Confirms position 1 (fixed).  
- **I(✓)**: Confirms position 2 (fixed).  
- **C**: Placed in **position 3** (tests if C is here or forces it to position 5).  
- **K**: Untested consonant (position 4).  
- **Y**: Untested vowel (position 5, tests if Y is present).  

**Why ""PICKY""?**  
- If C is in position 3, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
- If C is absent from position 3 (marked `-` or `x`), it **must be in position 5** (since C is in the word).  
- Tests **K** and **Y**—common letters that could appear in positions 4/5.  
- Avoids all eliminated letters and fits common English words (e.g., ""picky"" is valid).",Guess 4: picky -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
