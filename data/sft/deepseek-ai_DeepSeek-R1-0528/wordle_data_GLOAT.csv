We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 Feedback interpretation:
   - C is not in the secret word (x)
   - R is not in the secret word (x)
   - A in the word but in the wrong position (-)
   - N is not in the secret word (x)
   - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Important deductions:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since our guess had A in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 We know the secret word is 5 letters and must include A (but not in the third position).

 Since we have eliminated several common letters (C, R, N, E), we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes A, but not in the third position (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
   - Does NOT include any of C, R, N, E.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: Since it's not in the third position, we can try placing it in the first, second, fourth, or fifth.

 Because we have so many eliminated letters, a good strategy is to try a word that uses other vowels and common consonants.

 Note: The secret word contains at least one A (and possibly more).

 Since A is the only letter we know is present, we want to maximize information by including other new common letters.

 Consider the word: ""SAINT"" -> but N is eliminated so we can't use that.
 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Try to think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
   ""ALOFT"" -> A first, then L, O, F, T - all new letters.
   ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T - but A is in the third position? Wait, in ""PLAIT"", A is third? We can avoid putting A in the third since we know it's not there? Actually, we must avoid putting A in the third position? Not necessarily: we know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third position and it was wrong position. But in the secret word, A could be in a different position. However, if we put A in the third position again, and if the secret word has A but not in third, we'll get wrong position again. It's inefficient to reuse the same position. So better to put A in a different position to narrow down.

 Therefore, avoid the third position for A.

 Let me try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but E and U? E is eliminated. We cannot use E.

 Words without E: 
   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.

 However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.

 But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).

 Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don't know if there could be two A's).

 However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn't tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.

 It's possible that the word has only one A? We don't know.

 Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven't tested duplicates.

 We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 So let's try a word with one A and four new letters.

 Options:
   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.

 Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.

 Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.

 How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A's? It's convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.

 Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".

 Also, note: we know only A is present. We don't know about others.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don't want to put A in the third? So avoid.

 How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.

 Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.

 Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.

 We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.

 Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.

 We must not use eliminated letters.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.

 But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.

 Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.

 But duplicate A: we don't know about duplicates? We can try.

 But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.

 Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.

 How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that's different.

 So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

 But we don't know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.

 Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.

 However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it's not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? 

 How about we try to put it in the first? That's what ""ABOUT"" does.

 Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.

 In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).
 In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).

 Both are good. Let's choose ""ABOUT"".

 But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.

 If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we'll get a check. If not, but it has A, we'll get a dash? So we might learn.

 Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.

 But note: we don't know if A might be in first? So let's try first position.

 Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? 

 However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven't tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.

 So both are valid.

 Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.

 Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.

 Let me compare:
   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T
   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y

 We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? 

 But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? 

 Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? 

 So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.

 However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? 

 Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? 

 So I'll go with ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don't know.

 Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can't use N.

 How about ""SPALT""? not word.

 I decide to use ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.

 Also, L is common.

 Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.

 But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

 We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it's safe.

 How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? 
   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y

 Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? 

 Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don't care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? 

 Both words are valid. I'll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.

 But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:
   position1: S
   position2: A
   position3: L
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 And in HASTY:
   position1: H
   position2: A
   position3: S
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don't know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? 

 So actually, we have:
   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? 
   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? 

 Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.

 Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That's good? 

 But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? 

 If I put A in second, I'll get:
   If the secret A is in second: ✓
   Else: -

 And then we'll know.

 Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? 

 So between SALTY and HASTY? 
   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y

 They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? 

 SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? 

 But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? 

 However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? 

 Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don't care? 

 So I'd prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? 

 But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? 

 Alternatively, let's choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A's and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: 
   For ""PASTA"": 
        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? 

 Actually the feedback for duplicates: 
   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don't know? 

 To keep it simple? Let's avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".

 So my second guess: ""SALTY""

 But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? 

 Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: 
   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? 

 Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? 

 Therefore, with SALTY, we get:
   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? 
   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?

 Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? 

 So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? 

 I think that's good.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").
- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).
- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A strong option is **""SALTY""**:
- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.
- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn't in the third).
- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.
- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).
- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.

 How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that's different.

 So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

 But we don't know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.

 How about we try to put it in the first? That's what ""ABOUT"" does.

 Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.

 In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).
 In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).

 Both are good. Let's choose ""ABOUT"".

 But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.

 If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we'll get a check. If not, but it has A, we'll get a dash? So we might learn.

 Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.

 But note: we don't know if A might be in first? So let's try first position.

 Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? 

 However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven't tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.

 So both are valid.

 Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.

 Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.

 Let me compare:
   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T
   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y

 We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? 

 But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? 

 Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? 

 So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.

 However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? 

 Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? 

 So I'll go with ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don't know.

 Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can't use N.

 How about ""SPALT""? not word.

 I decide to use ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.

 Also, L is common.

 Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.

 But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

 We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it's safe.

 How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? 
   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y

 Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? 

 Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don't care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? 

 Both words are valid. I'll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.

 But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:
   position1: S
   position2: A
   position3: L
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 And in HASTY:
   position1: H
   position2: A
   position3: S
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don't know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? 

 So actually, we have:
   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? 
   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? 

 Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.

 Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That's good? 

 But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? 

 If I put A in second, I'll get:
   If the secret A is in second: ✓
   Else: -

 And then we'll know.

 Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? 

 So between SALTY and HASTY? 
   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y

 They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? 

 SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? 

 But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? 

 However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? 

 Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don't care? 

 So I'd prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? 

 But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? 

 Alternatively, let's choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A's and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: 
   For ""PASTA"": 
        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? 

 Actually the feedback for duplicates: 
   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don't know? 

 To keep it simple? Let's avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".

 So my second guess: ""SALTY""

 But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? 

 Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: 
   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? 

 Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? 

 Therefore, with SALTY, we get:
   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? 
   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?

 Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? 

 So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? 

 I think that's good.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").
- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).
- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A strong option is **""SALTY""**:
- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.
- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn't in the third).
- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.
- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).
- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.",Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,GLOAT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 Feedback interpretation:
   - C is not in the secret word (x)
   - R is not in the secret word (x)
   - A in the word but in the wrong position (-)
   - N is not in the secret word (x)
   - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Important deductions:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since our guess had A in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 We know the secret word is 5 letters and must include A (but not in the third position).

 Since we have eliminated several common letters (C, R, N, E), we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes A, but not in the third position (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
   - Does NOT include any of C, R, N, E.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: Since it's not in the third position, we can try placing it in the first, second, fourth, or fifth.

 Because we have so many eliminated letters, a good strategy is to try a word that uses other vowels and common consonants.

 Note: The secret word contains at least one A (and possibly more).

 Since A is the only letter we know is present, we want to maximize information by including other new common letters.

 Consider the word: ""SAINT"" -> but N is eliminated so we can't use that.
 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Try to think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
   ""ALOFT"" -> A first, then L, O, F, T - all new letters.
   ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T - but A is in the third position? Wait, in ""PLAIT"", A is third? We can avoid putting A in the third since we know it's not there? Actually, we must avoid putting A in the third position? Not necessarily: we know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third position and it was wrong position. But in the secret word, A could be in a different position. However, if we put A in the third position again, and if the secret word has A but not in third, we'll get wrong position again. It's inefficient to reuse the same position. So better to put A in a different position to narrow down.

 Therefore, avoid the third position for A.

 Let me try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but E and U? E is eliminated. We cannot use E.

 Words without E: 
   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.

 However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.

 But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).

 Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don't know if there could be two A's).

 However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn't tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.

 It's possible that the word has only one A? We don't know.

 Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven't tested duplicates.

 We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 So let's try a word with one A and four new letters.

 Options:
   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.

 Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.

 Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.

 How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A's? It's convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.

 Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".

 Also, note: we know only A is present. We don't know about others.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don't want to put A in the third? So avoid.

 How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.

 Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.

 Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.

 We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.

 Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.

 We must not use eliminated letters.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.

 But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.

 Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.

 But duplicate A: we don't know about duplicates? We can try.

 But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.

 Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.

 How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that's different.

 So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

 But we don't know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.

 Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.

 However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it's not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? 

 How about we try to put it in the first? That's what ""ABOUT"" does.

 Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.

 In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).
 In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).

 Both are good. Let's choose ""ABOUT"".

 But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.

 If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we'll get a check. If not, but it has A, we'll get a dash? So we might learn.

 Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.

 But note: we don't know if A might be in first? So let's try first position.

 Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? 

 However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven't tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.

 So both are valid.

 Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.

 Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.

 Let me compare:
   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T
   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y

 We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? 

 But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? 

 Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? 

 So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.

 However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? 

 Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? 

 So I'll go with ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don't know.

 Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can't use N.

 How about ""SPALT""? not word.

 I decide to use ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.

 Also, L is common.

 Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.

 But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

 We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it's safe.

 How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? 
   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y

 Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? 

 Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don't care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? 

 Both words are valid. I'll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.

 But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:
   position1: S
   position2: A
   position3: L
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 And in HASTY:
   position1: H
   position2: A
   position3: S
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don't know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? 

 So actually, we have:
   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? 
   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? 

 Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.

 Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That's good? 

 But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? 

 If I put A in second, I'll get:
   If the secret A is in second: ✓
   Else: -

 And then we'll know.

 Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? 

 So between SALTY and HASTY? 
   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y

 They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? 

 SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? 

 But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? 

 However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? 

 Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don't care? 

 So I'd prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? 

 But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? 

 Alternatively, let's choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A's and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: 
   For ""PASTA"": 
        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? 

 Actually the feedback for duplicates: 
   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don't know? 

 To keep it simple? Let's avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".

 So my second guess: ""SALTY""

 But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? 

 Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: 
   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? 

 Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? 

 Therefore, with SALTY, we get:
   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? 
   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?

 Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? 

 So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? 

 I think that's good.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").
- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).
- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A strong option is **""SALTY""**:
- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.
- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn't in the third).
- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.
- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).
- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.

The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\n We know the secret word is 5 letters and must include A (but not in the third position).\n\n Since we have eliminated several common letters (C, R, N, E), we should choose a new word that:\n   - Includes A, but not in the third position (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)\n   - Does NOT include any of C, R, N, E.\n   - Uses other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, etc.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have the letter A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Possible positions for A: Since it\'s not in the third position, we can try placing it in the first, second, fourth, or fifth.\n\n Because we have so many eliminated letters, a good strategy is to try a word that uses other vowels and common consonants.\n\n Note: The secret word contains at least one A (and possibly more).\n\n Since A is the only letter we know is present, we want to maximize information by including other new common letters.\n\n Consider the word: ""SAINT"" -> but N is eliminated so we can\'t use that.\n We must avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\n Try to think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.\n\n Example words:\n   ""ALOFT"" -> A first, then L, O, F, T - all new letters.\n   ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T - but A is in the third position? Wait, in ""PLAIT"", A is third? We can avoid putting A in the third since we know it\'s not there? Actually, we must avoid putting A in the third position? Not necessarily: we know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third position and it was wrong position. But in the secret word, A could be in a different position. However, if we put A in the third position again, and if the secret word has A but not in third, we\'ll get wrong position again. It\'s inefficient to reuse the same position. So better to put A in a different position to narrow down.\n\n Therefore, avoid the third position for A.\n\n Let me try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but E and U? E is eliminated. We cannot use E.\n\n Words without E: \n   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.\n\n However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.\n\n But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).\n\n Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don\'t know if there could be two A\'s).\n\n However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn\'t tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.\n\n It\'s possible that the word has only one A? We don\'t know.\n\n Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven\'t tested duplicates.\n\n We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n So let\'s try a word with one A and four new letters.\n\n Options:\n   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.\n\n Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.\n\n How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it\'s not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A\'s? It\'s convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.\n\n Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".\n\n Also, note: we know only A is present. We don\'t know about others.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don\'t want to put A in the third? So avoid.\n\n How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.\n\n Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.\n\n We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.\n\n We must not use eliminated letters.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.\n\n But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.\n\n Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.\n\n But duplicate A: we don\'t know about duplicates? We can try.\n\n But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.\n\n Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.\n\n How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that\'s different.\n\n So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.\n\n Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.\n\n However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it\'s not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? \n\n How about we try to put it in the first? That\'s what ""ABOUT"" does.\n\n Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.\n\n In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).\n In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).\n\n Both are good. Let\'s choose ""ABOUT"".\n\n But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.\n\n If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we\'ll get a check. If not, but it has A, we\'ll get a dash? So we might learn.\n\n Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if A might be in first? So let\'s try first position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? \n\n However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven\'t tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.\n\n So both are valid.\n\n Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.\n\n Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T\n   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y\n\n We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? \n\n But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? \n\n Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? \n\n So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.\n\n However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? \n\n Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""HASTY"".\n\n But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can\'t use N.\n\n How about ""SPALT""? not word.\n\n I decide to use ""HASTY"".\n\n But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\n Also, L is common.\n\n Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.\n\n But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.\n\n We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it\'s safe.\n\n How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? \n   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y\n   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y\n\n Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? \n\n Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don\'t care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? \n\n Both words are valid. I\'ll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.\n\n But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:\n   position1: S\n   position2: A\n   position3: L\n   position4: T\n   position5: Y\n\n And in HASTY:\n   position1: H\n   position2: A\n   position3: S\n   position4: T\n   position5: Y\n\n Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don\'t know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? \n\n So actually, we have:\n   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? \n   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? \n\n Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.\n\n Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That\'s good? \n\n But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? \n\n If I put A in second, I\'ll get:\n   If the secret A is in second: ✓\n   Else: -\n\n And then we\'ll know.\n\n Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? \n\n So between SALTY and HASTY? \n   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y\n   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y\n\n They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? \n\n SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? \n\n But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? \n\n However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? \n\n Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don\'t care? \n\n So I\'d prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? \n\n But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don\'t know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A\'s and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: \n   For ""PASTA"": \n        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? \n\n Actually the feedback for duplicates: \n   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don\'t know? \n\n To keep it simple? Let\'s avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? \n\n Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".\n\n So my second guess: ""SALTY""\n\n But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? \n\n Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: \n   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? \n\n Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? \n\n Therefore, with SALTY, we get:\n   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? \n   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?\n\n Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? \n\n So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? \n\n I think that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess ""SALTY"".\n\n<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:\n- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").\n- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a word that:\n- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).\n- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information.\n\nA strong option is **""SALTY""**:\n- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.\n- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn\'t in the third).\n- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.\n- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.\n\nThis guess will clarify:\n- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).\n- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We now have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""salty"" → S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)

Analyzing feedback:

From ""crane"":
- A is in the word, but not in the third position.

From ""salty"":
- S(x): S is NOT in the word. (new information)
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we placed it second).
- L(-): L is in the word, but not in the third position (we placed L third).
- T(-): T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (we placed T fourth).
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word. (new information)

Summary of knowledge:

Letters definitely in the word: A, L, T (confirmed by two dashes: A from ""crane"" and ""salty"", and L and T from ""salty"").

Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E (from first guess), S (from second guess), Y (from second guess). Also, note we haven't seen others, so we can assume absent?

Additionally, we know:
- A is not in position 2 (from ""salty"") or position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""salty""). Since we only placed L in position 3, we don't know its correct position yet.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""salty""). We don't know its correct position.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A, L, T. There must be at least three letters: A, L, T. Possibly more? But we only know three letters.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Includes A, L, T (all must be present).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.
- Places A in a new position (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out: 1, 4, or 5).
- Places L not in position 3? But that's the only position we tried? We need to test L in other positions.
- Similarly for T: not in position 4.

Also, note: we might have more letters? But we don't know which ones? So we should test new common letters? Like O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

Possible scenarios:

- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L can be in position 1,2,4,5? But we don't know where.
- T can be in position 1,2,3,5? Since not 4.

We need to form a word that has A, L, T and satisfies these.

List of words that contain A, L, T and avoid denied letters? And also not repeating positions we know are wrong.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.

Common words: 
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and R are eliminated? R is eliminated (from first guess), so no.
- ""LATIN"" -> N is eliminated? no.
- ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> but A is third? We know A isn't in third? So we must avoid putting A in third? And in ""PLAIT"", A is third? So we cannot use that? Also, if we use that, we will get A marked as wrong position? But we already know it's not third? So it's inefficient? But if we think the word might have A in third? But we have two feedbacks indicating A isn't in third? Actually, from first guess: A in position 3: wrong position? and we have confirmed A is present? So we know A is not in position 3? So using a word with A in third is wasting a position? So avoid.

Therefore, no word should put A in positions 2 or 3? Similarly for L: we know L isn't in position 3? So avoid putting L in third? Because it's incorrect? So similarly.

So let's avoid:

- A in position 2 or 3? Actually, position 2 and 3 are forbidden for A? But we only know positions 2 and 3 are not correct? So we must try position 1,4, or5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? For T: avoid position 4? 

Also, note: we have tried S (which is absent) and Y (absent) so avoid.

Now, think of words that contain A, L, T and avoid the eliminated letters.

Possible words:

1. ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> has A, L, T? Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 
   - A is in position 1 (permissible).
   - L is in position 4 (we haven't tried: so possible? and it avoids position 3=good).
   - T is in position 5 (we haven't tried position 5: and it avoids position 4=good).

   But does it avoid eliminated letters? C, R, N, E, S, Y? Yes, since it uses A,D,U,L,T.

2. ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> but E is eliminated? NO. E is eliminated? So invalid.

3. ""FAULT"": F,A,U,L,T -> avoids eliminated? Letters: F(not eliminated), A,U,L,T -> yes. Positions: F(1),A(2)? But wait, we know A isn't in position 2? Because of ""salty"" feedback: A in position 2: wrong? So A can't be 2? Therefore, putting A in position 2 here? It will be wrong? But we are using it? We could? But it's inefficient because we already know A isn't 2? So don't put A in 2 again? Avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for ""FAULT"": A is in position 2: which is known to be wrong? So it will waste a dash? Similarly, we can avoid putting A in positions we know are wrong.

Therefore, we prefer putting A in a position we haven't tried? So positions 1,4,5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? so positions 1,2,4,5? For T: avoid position 4? so positions 1,2,3,5? 

Now, back to ""ADULT"": A in 1, L in 4, T in 5? Good? 

But note: L is in position 4: we haven't tried L in position 4? So acceptable? 

Similarly, T in position 5: haven't tried.

Another word: ""ALTAR"": A,L,T,A,R -> but duplicate A? And R is eliminated? No.

Another: ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> positions: A(1),L(2),O(3),F(4),T(5). 
   - L in position 2: we haven't tried? And avoids position 3? 
   - T in position 5? avoids position 4? 
   - A in 1? good? 

And letters: O and F are new? and allowed? Avoid eliminated: O and F? yes.

Also, ""ALOFT"" vs ""ADULT"": both have A,L,T? But different additional letters: D,U vs O,F.

Which is better? 

But note: we have more vowels? O? We don't know if O is present? 

Similarly, we can test common letters? 

Another: ""PLANT"": N is eliminated? And also, A in position 2? which we know is wrong? 

How about ""GALT""? Not word? 

Another: ""THAL"": Not letter.

So possible words: ""ADULT"", ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"" (but A in 2: avoid?), ""VISTA""? But S is absent? 

""S"" is eliminated? So we cannot use VISTA? Because has S? 

Another: ""ULTRA"": U,L,T,R,A -> but R is eliminated? So no.

Therefore, two good candidates: ""ADULT"" and ""ALOFT"".

Now, which one tests more new letters? Both test two new letters: ""ADULT"": D,U; ""ALOFT"": O,F.

Common letters? O is more common than F? Also, U is common? 

But perhaps F is less common? 

Since we have three letters confirmed: A, L, T? And we don't know the other two? We need to discover them? 

So guessing ""ADULT"" might test D and U? Whereas ""ALOFT"" tests O and F? 

We also must think about the positions? 

For ""ALOFT"": 
   A in 1? 
   L in 2? 
   O in 3? 
   F in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is in the word? But we put T in position 5? so if T is not in 5? we'll get dash? 

Similarly for ""ADULT"": 
   A in 1? 
   D in 2? 
   U in 3? 
   L in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is not in 4? but we don't know where? Position 5 could be? 

So both are valid? 

But we also want to cover a variety of letters? 

Alternatively, how about ""ADAPT""? But A in 1? and P? But D,P? Duplicate A? Also, we have T? But A is in 1? However, ""ADAPT"" has A in first and fourth? Duplicate? Also, we have P? But eliminated? No? 

But note: we know A is in the word? But it could be more than one? The feedback doesn't tell us? 

In the first guess: only one A? and dash? so possibly one? but maybe more? 

But guessing a word with two A's might not be bad? 

But we have guesses left? 

Another candidate: ""AUNTY""? N,Y eliminated? 

No.

""PARTY"": R and Y eliminated? No.

So I think ""ALOFT"" or ""ADULT"".

Perhaps ""ATOLL"": A,T,O,L,L? Duplicate L? And L is in positions 4 and 5? Also, O? Avoid? 

But has duplicate L? Which may not be? 

But we don't know? 

So back? 

I choose ""ALOFT"" because L is in position 2? Which hasn't been tested? And also, O is common vowel? 

Additionally, it avoids putting L in 4? Which ""ADULT"" does? 

But in ""ADULT"", T is in position 5? so we are testing position for T? 

But note: we haven't tested any position for T? So equally good? 

Perhaps we can combine? 

I'll choose ""ALOFT"" 

So guess ""ALOFT""

But let me check letters: A,L,O,F,T. All allowed? 

Eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y? O and F? OK? Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""ALOFT""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (marked as misplaced).  
     - **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is **not in position 2** (misplaced, so must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
     - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (both misplaced).  
     - **S and Y are absent**.  
     - **A, L, T are confirmed in the word** (from both guesses).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: A, L, T.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
  - L cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A, L, T and cover untested common letters (e.g., O, F, D, U, I).  

### Strategic Reasoning:
- Since **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5**, we prioritize placing it in **position 1** (untested so far) to maximize positional information.  
- **L and T** should be placed in untested positions: L avoids position 3, and T avoids position 4.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, Y) and include new high-frequency letters like **O** or **F** to test for presence.  
- **Selected word: ""ALOFT""**  
  - A in **position 1** (tests if A is correct in position 1).  
  - L in **position 2** (untested position, avoids position 3).  
  - T in **position 5** (untested position, avoids position 4).  
  - Introduces **O** and **F** (common letters, not previously tested).  
  - Distinct letters: A, L, O, F, T (no duplicates).  

If ""ALOFT"" doesn't fully solve the puzzle, feedback will narrow down the positions for A, L, T and reveal if O/F are present or absent.

<guess>aloft</guess>",aloft,"We now have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""salty"" → S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)

Analyzing feedback:

From ""crane"":
- A is in the word, but not in the third position.

From ""salty"":
- S(x): S is NOT in the word. (new information)
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we placed it second).
- L(-): L is in the word, but not in the third position (we placed L third).
- T(-): T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (we placed T fourth).
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word. (new information)

Summary of knowledge:

Letters definitely in the word: A, L, T (confirmed by two dashes: A from ""crane"" and ""salty"", and L and T from ""salty"").

Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E (from first guess), S (from second guess), Y (from second guess). Also, note we haven't seen others, so we can assume absent?

Additionally, we know:
- A is not in position 2 (from ""salty"") or position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""salty""). Since we only placed L in position 3, we don't know its correct position yet.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""salty""). We don't know its correct position.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A, L, T. There must be at least three letters: A, L, T. Possibly more? But we only know three letters.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Includes A, L, T (all must be present).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.
- Places A in a new position (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out: 1, 4, or 5).
- Places L not in position 3? But that's the only position we tried? We need to test L in other positions.
- Similarly for T: not in position 4.

Also, note: we might have more letters? But we don't know which ones? So we should test new common letters? Like O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

Possible scenarios:

- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L can be in position 1,2,4,5? But we don't know where.
- T can be in position 1,2,3,5? Since not 4.

We need to form a word that has A, L, T and satisfies these.

List of words that contain A, L, T and avoid denied letters? And also not repeating positions we know are wrong.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.

Common words: 
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and R are eliminated? R is eliminated (from first guess), so no.
- ""LATIN"" -> N is eliminated? no.
- ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> but A is third? We know A isn't in third? So we must avoid putting A in third? And in ""PLAIT"", A is third? So we cannot use that? Also, if we use that, we will get A marked as wrong position? But we already know it's not third? So it's inefficient? But if we think the word might have A in third? But we have two feedbacks indicating A isn't in third? Actually, from first guess: A in position 3: wrong position? and we have confirmed A is present? So we know A is not in position 3? So using a word with A in third is wasting a position? So avoid.

Therefore, no word should put A in positions 2 or 3? Similarly for L: we know L isn't in position 3? So avoid putting L in third? Because it's incorrect? So similarly.

So let's avoid:

- A in position 2 or 3? Actually, position 2 and 3 are forbidden for A? But we only know positions 2 and 3 are not correct? So we must try position 1,4, or5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? For T: avoid position 4? 

Also, note: we have tried S (which is absent) and Y (absent) so avoid.

Now, think of words that contain A, L, T and avoid the eliminated letters.

Possible words:

1. ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> has A, L, T? Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 
   - A is in position 1 (permissible).
   - L is in position 4 (we haven't tried: so possible? and it avoids position 3=good).
   - T is in position 5 (we haven't tried position 5: and it avoids position 4=good).

   But does it avoid eliminated letters? C, R, N, E, S, Y? Yes, since it uses A,D,U,L,T.

2. ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> but E is eliminated? NO. E is eliminated? So invalid.

3. ""FAULT"": F,A,U,L,T -> avoids eliminated? Letters: F(not eliminated), A,U,L,T -> yes. Positions: F(1),A(2)? But wait, we know A isn't in position 2? Because of ""salty"" feedback: A in position 2: wrong? So A can't be 2? Therefore, putting A in position 2 here? It will be wrong? But we are using it? We could? But it's inefficient because we already know A isn't 2? So don't put A in 2 again? Avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for ""FAULT"": A is in position 2: which is known to be wrong? So it will waste a dash? Similarly, we can avoid putting A in positions we know are wrong.

Therefore, we prefer putting A in a position we haven't tried? So positions 1,4,5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? so positions 1,2,4,5? For T: avoid position 4? so positions 1,2,3,5? 

Now, back to ""ADULT"": A in 1, L in 4, T in 5? Good? 

But note: L is in position 4: we haven't tried L in position 4? So acceptable? 

Similarly, T in position 5: haven't tried.

Another word: ""ALTAR"": A,L,T,A,R -> but duplicate A? And R is eliminated? No.

Another: ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> positions: A(1),L(2),O(3),F(4),T(5). 
   - L in position 2: we haven't tried? And avoids position 3? 
   - T in position 5? avoids position 4? 
   - A in 1? good? 

And letters: O and F are new? and allowed? Avoid eliminated: O and F? yes.

Also, ""ALOFT"" vs ""ADULT"": both have A,L,T? But different additional letters: D,U vs O,F.

Which is better? 

But note: we have more vowels? O? We don't know if O is present? 

Similarly, we can test common letters? 

Another: ""PLANT"": N is eliminated? And also, A in position 2? which we know is wrong? 

How about ""GALT""? Not word? 

Another: ""THAL"": Not letter.

So possible words: ""ADULT"", ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"" (but A in 2: avoid?), ""VISTA""? But S is absent? 

""S"" is eliminated? So we cannot use VISTA? Because has S? 

Another: ""ULTRA"": U,L,T,R,A -> but R is eliminated? So no.

Therefore, two good candidates: ""ADULT"" and ""ALOFT"".

Now, which one tests more new letters? Both test two new letters: ""ADULT"": D,U; ""ALOFT"": O,F.

Common letters? O is more common than F? Also, U is common? 

But perhaps F is less common? 

Since we have three letters confirmed: A, L, T? And we don't know the other two? We need to discover them? 

So guessing ""ADULT"" might test D and U? Whereas ""ALOFT"" tests O and F? 

We also must think about the positions? 

For ""ALOFT"": 
   A in 1? 
   L in 2? 
   O in 3? 
   F in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is in the word? But we put T in position 5? so if T is not in 5? we'll get dash? 

Similarly for ""ADULT"": 
   A in 1? 
   D in 2? 
   U in 3? 
   L in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is not in 4? but we don't know where? Position 5 could be? 

So both are valid? 

But we also want to cover a variety of letters? 

Alternatively, how about ""ADAPT""? But A in 1? and P? But D,P? Duplicate A? Also, we have T? But A is in 1? However, ""ADAPT"" has A in first and fourth? Duplicate? Also, we have P? But eliminated? No? 

But note: we know A is in the word? But it could be more than one? The feedback doesn't tell us? 

In the first guess: only one A? and dash? so possibly one? but maybe more? 

But guessing a word with two A's might not be bad? 

But we have guesses left? 

Another candidate: ""AUNTY""? N,Y eliminated? 

No.

""PARTY"": R and Y eliminated? No.

So I think ""ALOFT"" or ""ADULT"".

Perhaps ""ATOLL"": A,T,O,L,L? Duplicate L? And L is in positions 4 and 5? Also, O? Avoid? 

But has duplicate L? Which may not be? 

But we don't know? 

So back? 

I choose ""ALOFT"" because L is in position 2? Which hasn't been tested? And also, O is common vowel? 

Additionally, it avoids putting L in 4? Which ""ADULT"" does? 

But in ""ADULT"", T is in position 5? so we are testing position for T? 

But note: we haven't tested any position for T? So equally good? 

Perhaps we can combine? 

I'll choose ""ALOFT"" 

So guess ""ALOFT""

But let me check letters: A,L,O,F,T. All allowed? 

Eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y? O and F? OK? Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""ALOFT""

<guess>aloft</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (marked as misplaced).  
     - **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is **not in position 2** (misplaced, so must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
     - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (both misplaced).  
     - **S and Y are absent**.  
     - **A, L, T are confirmed in the word** (from both guesses).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: A, L, T.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
  - L cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A, L, T and cover untested common letters (e.g., O, F, D, U, I).  

### Strategic Reasoning:
- Since **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5**, we prioritize placing it in **position 1** (untested so far) to maximize positional information.  
- **L and T** should be placed in untested positions: L avoids position 3, and T avoids position 4.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, Y) and include new high-frequency letters like **O** or **F** to test for presence.  
- **Selected word: ""ALOFT""**  
  - A in **position 1** (tests if A is correct in position 1).  
  - L in **position 2** (untested position, avoids position 3).  
  - T in **position 5** (untested position, avoids position 4).  
  - Introduces **O** and **F** (common letters, not previously tested).  
  - Distinct letters: A, L, O, F, T (no duplicates).  

If ""ALOFT"" doesn't fully solve the puzzle, feedback will narrow down the positions for A, L, T and reveal if O/F are present or absent.",Guess 3: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 Feedback interpretation:
   - C is not in the secret word (x)
   - R is not in the secret word (x)
   - A in the word but in the wrong position (-)
   - N is not in the secret word (x)
   - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Important deductions:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since our guess had A in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 We know the secret word is 5 letters and must include A (but not in the third position).

 Since we have eliminated several common letters (C, R, N, E), we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes A, but not in the third position (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
   - Does NOT include any of C, R, N, E.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: Since it's not in the third position, we can try placing it in the first, second, fourth, or fifth.

 Because we have so many eliminated letters, a good strategy is to try a word that uses other vowels and common consonants.

 Note: The secret word contains at least one A (and possibly more).

 Since A is the only letter we know is present, we want to maximize information by including other new common letters.

 Consider the word: ""SAINT"" -> but N is eliminated so we can't use that.
 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Try to think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
   ""ALOFT"" -> A first, then L, O, F, T - all new letters.
   ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T - but A is in the third position? Wait, in ""PLAIT"", A is third? We can avoid putting A in the third since we know it's not there? Actually, we must avoid putting A in the third position? Not necessarily: we know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third position and it was wrong position. But in the secret word, A could be in a different position. However, if we put A in the third position again, and if the secret word has A but not in third, we'll get wrong position again. It's inefficient to reuse the same position. So better to put A in a different position to narrow down.

 Therefore, avoid the third position for A.

 Let me try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but E and U? E is eliminated. We cannot use E.

 Words without E: 
   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.

 However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.

 But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).

 Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don't know if there could be two A's).

 However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn't tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.

 It's possible that the word has only one A? We don't know.

 Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven't tested duplicates.

 We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 So let's try a word with one A and four new letters.

 Options:
   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.

 Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.

 Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.

 How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A's? It's convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.

 Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".

 Also, note: we know only A is present. We don't know about others.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don't want to put A in the third? So avoid.

 How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.

 Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.

 Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.

 We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.

 Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.

 We must not use eliminated letters.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.

 But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.

 Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.

 But duplicate A: we don't know about duplicates? We can try.

 But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.

 Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.

 How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that's different.

 So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

 But we don't know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.

 Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.

 However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it's not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? 

 How about we try to put it in the first? That's what ""ABOUT"" does.

 Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.

 In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).
 In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).

 Both are good. Let's choose ""ABOUT"".

 But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.

 If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we'll get a check. If not, but it has A, we'll get a dash? So we might learn.

 Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.

 But note: we don't know if A might be in first? So let's try first position.

 Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? 

 However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven't tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.

 So both are valid.

 Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.

 Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.

 Let me compare:
   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T
   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y

 We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? 

 But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? 

 Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? 

 So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.

 However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? 

 Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? 

 So I'll go with ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don't know.

 Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can't use N.

 How about ""SPALT""? not word.

 I decide to use ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.

 Also, L is common.

 Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.

 But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

 We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it's safe.

 How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? 
   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y

 Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? 

 Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don't care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? 

 Both words are valid. I'll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.

 But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:
   position1: S
   position2: A
   position3: L
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 And in HASTY:
   position1: H
   position2: A
   position3: S
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don't know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? 

 So actually, we have:
   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? 
   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? 

 Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.

 Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That's good? 

 But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? 

 If I put A in second, I'll get:
   If the secret A is in second: ✓
   Else: -

 And then we'll know.

 Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? 

 So between SALTY and HASTY? 
   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y

 They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? 

 SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? 

 But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? 

 However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? 

 Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don't care? 

 So I'd prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? 

 But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? 

 Alternatively, let's choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A's and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: 
   For ""PASTA"": 
        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? 

 Actually the feedback for duplicates: 
   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don't know? 

 To keep it simple? Let's avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".

 So my second guess: ""SALTY""

 But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? 

 Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: 
   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? 

 Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? 

 Therefore, with SALTY, we get:
   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? 
   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?

 Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? 

 So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? 

 I think that's good.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").
- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).
- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A strong option is **""SALTY""**:
- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.
- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn't in the third).
- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.
- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).
- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We now have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""salty"" → S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)

Analyzing feedback:

From ""crane"":
- A is in the word, but not in the third position.

From ""salty"":
- S(x): S is NOT in the word. (new information)
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we placed it second).
- L(-): L is in the word, but not in the third position (we placed L third).
- T(-): T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (we placed T fourth).
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word. (new information)

Summary of knowledge:

Letters definitely in the word: A, L, T (confirmed by two dashes: A from ""crane"" and ""salty"", and L and T from ""salty"").

Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E (from first guess), S (from second guess), Y (from second guess). Also, note we haven't seen others, so we can assume absent?

Additionally, we know:
- A is not in position 2 (from ""salty"") or position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""salty""). Since we only placed L in position 3, we don't know its correct position yet.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""salty""). We don't know its correct position.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A, L, T. There must be at least three letters: A, L, T. Possibly more? But we only know three letters.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Includes A, L, T (all must be present).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.
- Places A in a new position (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out: 1, 4, or 5).
- Places L not in position 3? But that's the only position we tried? We need to test L in other positions.
- Similarly for T: not in position 4.

Also, note: we might have more letters? But we don't know which ones? So we should test new common letters? Like O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

Possible scenarios:

- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L can be in position 1,2,4,5? But we don't know where.
- T can be in position 1,2,3,5? Since not 4.

We need to form a word that has A, L, T and satisfies these.

List of words that contain A, L, T and avoid denied letters? And also not repeating positions we know are wrong.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.

Common words: 
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and R are eliminated? R is eliminated (from first guess), so no.
- ""LATIN"" -> N is eliminated? no.
- ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> but A is third? We know A isn't in third? So we must avoid putting A in third? And in ""PLAIT"", A is third? So we cannot use that? Also, if we use that, we will get A marked as wrong position? But we already know it's not third? So it's inefficient? But if we think the word might have A in third? But we have two feedbacks indicating A isn't in third? Actually, from first guess: A in position 3: wrong position? and we have confirmed A is present? So we know A is not in position 3? So using a word with A in third is wasting a position? So avoid.

Therefore, no word should put A in positions 2 or 3? Similarly for L: we know L isn't in position 3? So avoid putting L in third? Because it's incorrect? So similarly.

So let's avoid:

- A in position 2 or 3? Actually, position 2 and 3 are forbidden for A? But we only know positions 2 and 3 are not correct? So we must try position 1,4, or5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? For T: avoid position 4? 

Also, note: we have tried S (which is absent) and Y (absent) so avoid.

Now, think of words that contain A, L, T and avoid the eliminated letters.

Possible words:

1. ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> has A, L, T? Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 
   - A is in position 1 (permissible).
   - L is in position 4 (we haven't tried: so possible? and it avoids position 3=good).
   - T is in position 5 (we haven't tried position 5: and it avoids position 4=good).

   But does it avoid eliminated letters? C, R, N, E, S, Y? Yes, since it uses A,D,U,L,T.

2. ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> but E is eliminated? NO. E is eliminated? So invalid.

3. ""FAULT"": F,A,U,L,T -> avoids eliminated? Letters: F(not eliminated), A,U,L,T -> yes. Positions: F(1),A(2)? But wait, we know A isn't in position 2? Because of ""salty"" feedback: A in position 2: wrong? So A can't be 2? Therefore, putting A in position 2 here? It will be wrong? But we are using it? We could? But it's inefficient because we already know A isn't 2? So don't put A in 2 again? Avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for ""FAULT"": A is in position 2: which is known to be wrong? So it will waste a dash? Similarly, we can avoid putting A in positions we know are wrong.

Therefore, we prefer putting A in a position we haven't tried? So positions 1,4,5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? so positions 1,2,4,5? For T: avoid position 4? so positions 1,2,3,5? 

Now, back to ""ADULT"": A in 1, L in 4, T in 5? Good? 

But note: L is in position 4: we haven't tried L in position 4? So acceptable? 

Similarly, T in position 5: haven't tried.

Another word: ""ALTAR"": A,L,T,A,R -> but duplicate A? And R is eliminated? No.

Another: ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> positions: A(1),L(2),O(3),F(4),T(5). 
   - L in position 2: we haven't tried? And avoids position 3? 
   - T in position 5? avoids position 4? 
   - A in 1? good? 

And letters: O and F are new? and allowed? Avoid eliminated: O and F? yes.

Also, ""ALOFT"" vs ""ADULT"": both have A,L,T? But different additional letters: D,U vs O,F.

Which is better? 

But note: we have more vowels? O? We don't know if O is present? 

Similarly, we can test common letters? 

Another: ""PLANT"": N is eliminated? And also, A in position 2? which we know is wrong? 

How about ""GALT""? Not word? 

Another: ""THAL"": Not letter.

So possible words: ""ADULT"", ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"" (but A in 2: avoid?), ""VISTA""? But S is absent? 

""S"" is eliminated? So we cannot use VISTA? Because has S? 

Another: ""ULTRA"": U,L,T,R,A -> but R is eliminated? So no.

Therefore, two good candidates: ""ADULT"" and ""ALOFT"".

Now, which one tests more new letters? Both test two new letters: ""ADULT"": D,U; ""ALOFT"": O,F.

Common letters? O is more common than F? Also, U is common? 

But perhaps F is less common? 

Since we have three letters confirmed: A, L, T? And we don't know the other two? We need to discover them? 

So guessing ""ADULT"" might test D and U? Whereas ""ALOFT"" tests O and F? 

We also must think about the positions? 

For ""ALOFT"": 
   A in 1? 
   L in 2? 
   O in 3? 
   F in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is in the word? But we put T in position 5? so if T is not in 5? we'll get dash? 

Similarly for ""ADULT"": 
   A in 1? 
   D in 2? 
   U in 3? 
   L in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is not in 4? but we don't know where? Position 5 could be? 

So both are valid? 

But we also want to cover a variety of letters? 

Alternatively, how about ""ADAPT""? But A in 1? and P? But D,P? Duplicate A? Also, we have T? But A is in 1? However, ""ADAPT"" has A in first and fourth? Duplicate? Also, we have P? But eliminated? No? 

But note: we know A is in the word? But it could be more than one? The feedback doesn't tell us? 

In the first guess: only one A? and dash? so possibly one? but maybe more? 

But guessing a word with two A's might not be bad? 

But we have guesses left? 

Another candidate: ""AUNTY""? N,Y eliminated? 

No.

""PARTY"": R and Y eliminated? No.

So I think ""ALOFT"" or ""ADULT"".

Perhaps ""ATOLL"": A,T,O,L,L? Duplicate L? And L is in positions 4 and 5? Also, O? Avoid? 

But has duplicate L? Which may not be? 

But we don't know? 

So back? 

I choose ""ALOFT"" because L is in position 2? Which hasn't been tested? And also, O is common vowel? 

Additionally, it avoids putting L in 4? Which ""ADULT"" does? 

But in ""ADULT"", T is in position 5? so we are testing position for T? 

But note: we haven't tested any position for T? So equally good? 

Perhaps we can combine? 

I'll choose ""ALOFT"" 

So guess ""ALOFT""

But let me check letters: A,L,O,F,T. All allowed? 

Eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y? O and F? OK? Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""ALOFT""

<guess>aloft</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (marked as misplaced).  
     - **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is **not in position 2** (misplaced, so must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
     - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (both misplaced).  
     - **S and Y are absent**.  
     - **A, L, T are confirmed in the word** (from both guesses).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: A, L, T.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
  - L cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A, L, T and cover untested common letters (e.g., O, F, D, U, I).  

### Strategic Reasoning:
- Since **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5**, we prioritize placing it in **position 1** (untested so far) to maximize positional information.  
- **L and T** should be placed in untested positions: L avoids position 3, and T avoids position 4.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, Y) and include new high-frequency letters like **O** or **F** to test for presence.  
- **Selected word: ""ALOFT""**  
  - A in **position 1** (tests if A is correct in position 1).  
  - L in **position 2** (untested position, avoids position 3).  
  - T in **position 5** (untested position, avoids position 4).  
  - Introduces **O** and **F** (common letters, not previously tested).  
  - Distinct letters: A, L, O, F, T (no duplicates).  

If ""ALOFT"" doesn't fully solve the puzzle, feedback will narrow down the positions for A, L, T and reveal if O/F are present or absent.

Wait, in ""PLAIT"", A is third? We can avoid putting A in the third since we know it\'s not there? Actually, we must avoid putting A in the third position? Not necessarily: we know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third position and it was wrong position. But in the secret word, A could be in a different position. However, if we put A in the third position again, and if the secret word has A but not in third, we\'ll get wrong position again. It\'s inefficient to reuse the same position. So better to put A in a different position to narrow down.\n\n Therefore, avoid the third position for A.\n\n Let me try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but E and U? E is eliminated. We cannot use E.\n\n Words without E: \n   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.\n\n However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.\n\n But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).\n\n Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don\'t know if there could be two A\'s).\n\n However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn\'t tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.\n\n It\'s possible that the word has only one A? We don\'t know.\n\n Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven\'t tested duplicates.\n\n We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n So let\'s try a word with one A and four new letters.\n\n Options:\n   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.\n\n Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.\n\n How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it\'s not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A\'s? It\'s convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.\n\n Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".\n\n Also, note: we know only A is present. We don\'t know about others.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don\'t want to put A in the third? So avoid.\n\n How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.\n\n Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.\n\n We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.\n\n We must not use eliminated letters.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.\n\n But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.\n\n Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.\n\n But duplicate A: we don\'t know about duplicates? We can try.\n\n But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.\n\n Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.\n\n How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that\'s different.\n\n So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.\n\n Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.\n\n However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it\'s not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? \n\n How about we try to put it in the first? That\'s what ""ABOUT"" does.\n\n Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.\n\n In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).\n In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).\n\n Both are good. Let\'s choose ""ABOUT"".\n\n But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.\n\n If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we\'ll get a check. If not, but it has A, we\'ll get a dash? So we might learn.\n\n Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if A might be in first? So let\'s try first position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? \n\n However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven\'t tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.\n\n So both are valid.\n\n Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.\n\n Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T\n   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y\n\n We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? \n\n But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? \n\n Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? \n\n So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.\n\n However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? \n\n Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""HASTY"".\n\n But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can\'t use N.\n\n How about ""SPALT""? not word.\n\n I decide to use ""HASTY"".\n\n But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\n Also, L is common.\n\n Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.\n\n But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.\n\n We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it\'s safe.\n\n How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? \n   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y\n   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y\n\n Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? \n\n Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don\'t care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? \n\n Both words are valid. I\'ll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.\n\n But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:\n   position1: S\n   position2: A\n   position3: L\n   position4: T\n   position5: Y\n\n And in HASTY:\n   position1: H\n   position2: A\n   position3: S\n   position4: T\n   position5: Y\n\n Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don\'t know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? \n\n So actually, we have:\n   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? \n   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? \n\n Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.\n\n Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That\'s good? \n\n But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? \n\n If I put A in second, I\'ll get:\n   If the secret A is in second: ✓\n   Else: -\n\n And then we\'ll know.\n\n Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? \n\n So between SALTY and HASTY? \n   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y\n   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y\n\n They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? \n\n SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? \n\n But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? \n\n However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? \n\n Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don\'t care? \n\n So I\'d prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? \n\n But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don\'t know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A\'s and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: \n   For ""PASTA"": \n        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? \n\n Actually the feedback for duplicates: \n   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don\'t know? \n\n To keep it simple? Let\'s avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? \n\n Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".\n\n So my second guess: ""SALTY""\n\n But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? \n\n Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: \n   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? \n\n Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? \n\n Therefore, with SALTY, we get:\n   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? \n   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?\n\n Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? \n\n So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? \n\n I think that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess ""SALTY"".\n\n<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:\n- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").\n- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a word that:\n- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).\n- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information.\n\nA strong option is **""SALTY""**:\n- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.\n- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn\'t in the third).\n- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.\n- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.\n\nThis guess will clarify:\n- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).\n- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nSecond guess: ""salty"" → S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n\nAnalyzing feedback:\n\nFrom ""crane"":\n- A is in the word, but not in the third position.\n\nFrom ""salty"":\n- S(x): S is NOT in the word.

(new information)\n\nSummary of knowledge:\n\nLetters definitely in the word: A, L, T (confirmed by two dashes: A from ""crane"" and ""salty"", and L and T from ""salty"").\n\nLetters definitely absent: C, R, N, E (from first guess), S (from second guess), Y (from second guess). Also, note we haven\'t seen others, so we can assume absent?\n\nAdditionally, we know:\n- A is not in position 2 (from ""salty"") or position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""salty""). Since we only placed L in position 3, we don\'t know its correct position yet.\n- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""salty""). We don\'t know its correct position.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters and contains A, L, T. There must be at least three letters: A, L, T. Possibly more? But we only know three letters.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that:\n- Includes A, L, T (all must be present).\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.\n- Places A in a new position (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out: 1, 4, or 5).\n- Places L not in position 3? But that\'s the only position we tried? We need to test L in other positions.\n- Similarly for T: not in position 4.\n\nAlso, note: we might have more letters? But we don\'t know which ones? So we should test new common letters? Like O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- L can be in position 1,2,4,5? But we don\'t know where.\n- T can be in position 1,2,3,5? Since not 4.\n\nWe need to form a word that has A, L, T and satisfies these.\n\nList of words that contain A, L, T and avoid denied letters? And also not repeating positions we know are wrong.\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ALERT"" -> but E and R are eliminated? R is eliminated (from first guess), so no.\n- ""LATIN"" -> N is eliminated? no.\n- ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> but A is third? We know A isn\'t in third? So we must avoid putting A in third? And in ""PLAIT"", A is third? So we cannot use that? Also, if we use that, we will get A marked as wrong position? But we already know it\'s not third? So it\'s inefficient? But if we think the word might have A in third? But we have two feedbacks indicating A isn\'t in third? Actually, from first guess: A in position 3: wrong position? and we have confirmed A is present? So we know A is not in position 3? So using a word with A in third is wasting a position? So avoid.\n\nTherefore, no word should put A in positions 2 or 3? Similarly for L: we know L isn\'t in position 3? So avoid putting L in third? Because it\'s incorrect? So similarly.\n\nSo let\'s avoid:\n\n- A in position 2 or 3? Actually, position 2 and 3 are forbidden for A? But we only know positions 2 and 3 are not correct? So we must try position 1,4, or5? \n\nSimilarly for L: avoid position 3? For T: avoid position 4? \n\nAlso, note: we have tried S (which is absent) and Y (absent) so avoid.\n\nNow, think of words that contain A, L, T and avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n1. ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> has A, L, T? Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). \n   - A is in position 1 (permissible).\n   - L is in position 4 (we haven\'t tried: so possible? and it avoids position 3=good).\n   - T is in position 5 (we haven\'t tried position 5: and it avoids position 4=good).\n\n   But does it avoid eliminated letters? C, R, N, E, S, Y? Yes, since it uses A,D,U,L,T.\n\n2. ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> but E is eliminated? NO. E is eliminated? So invalid.\n\n3. ""FAULT"": F,A,U,L,T -> avoids eliminated? Letters: F(not eliminated), A,U,L,T -> yes. Positions: F(1),A(2)? But wait, we know A isn\'t in position 2? Because of ""salty"" feedback: A in position 2: wrong? So A can\'t be 2? Therefore, putting A in position 2 here? It will be wrong? But we are using it? We could? But it\'s inefficient because we already know A isn\'t 2? So don\'t put A in 2 again? Avoid positions we know are wrong.\n\nSo for ""FAULT"": A is in position 2: which is known to be wrong? So it will waste a dash? Similarly, we can avoid putting A in positions we know are wrong.\n\nTherefore, we prefer putting A in a position we haven\'t tried? So positions 1,4,5? \n\nSimilarly for L: avoid position 3? so positions 1,2,4,5? For T: avoid position 4? so positions 1,2,3,5? \n\nNow, back to ""ADULT"": A in 1, L in 4, T in 5? Good? \n\nBut note: L is in position 4: we haven\'t tried L in position 4? So acceptable? \n\nSimilarly, T in position 5: haven\'t tried.\n\nAnother word: ""ALTAR"": A,L,T,A,R -> but duplicate A? And R is eliminated? No.\n\nAnother: ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> positions: A(1),L(2),O(3),F(4),T(5). \n   - L in position 2: we haven\'t tried? And avoids position 3? \n   - T in position 5? avoids position 4? \n   - A in 1? good? \n\nAnd letters: O and F are new? and allowed? Avoid eliminated: O and F? yes.\n\nAlso, ""ALOFT"" vs ""ADULT"": both have A,L,T? But different additional letters: D,U vs O,F.\n\nWhich is better? \n\nBut note: we have more vowels? O? We don\'t know if O is present? \n\nSimilarly, we can test common letters? \n\nAnother: ""PLANT"": N is eliminated? And also, A in position 2? which we know is wrong? \n\nHow about ""GALT""? Not word? \n\nAnother: ""THAL"": Not letter.\n\nSo possible words: ""ADULT"", ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"" (but A in 2: avoid?), ""VISTA""? But S is absent? \n\n""S"" is eliminated? So we cannot use VISTA? Because has S? \n\nAnother: ""ULTRA"": U,L,T,R,A -> but R is eliminated? So no.\n\nTherefore, two good candidates: ""ADULT"" and ""ALOFT"".\n\nNow, which one tests more new letters? Both test two new letters: ""ADULT"": D,U; ""ALOFT"": O,F.\n\nCommon letters? O is more common than F? Also, U is common? \n\nBut perhaps F is less common? \n\nSince we have three letters confirmed: A, L, T? And we don\'t know the other two? We need to discover them? \n\nSo guessing ""ADULT"" might test D and U? Whereas ""ALOFT"" tests O and F? \n\nWe also must think about the positions? \n\nFor ""ALOFT"": \n   A in 1? \n   L in 2? \n   O in 3? \n   F in 4? \n   T in 5? \n\nWe know T is in the word? But we put T in position 5? so if T is not in 5? we\'ll get dash? \n\nSimilarly for ""ADULT"": \n   A in 1? \n   D in 2? \n   U in 3? \n   L in 4? \n   T in 5? \n\nWe know T is not in 4? but we don\'t know where? Position 5 could be? \n\nSo both are valid? \n\nBut we also want to cover a variety of letters? \n\nAlternatively, how about ""ADAPT""? But A in 1? and P? But D,P? Duplicate A? Also, we have T? But A is in 1? However, ""ADAPT"" has A in first and fourth? Duplicate? Also, we have P? But eliminated? No? \n\nBut note: we know A is in the word? But it could be more than one? The feedback doesn\'t tell us? \n\nIn the first guess: only one A? and dash? so possibly one? but maybe more? \n\nBut guessing a word with two A\'s might not be bad? \n\nBut we have guesses left? \n\nAnother candidate: ""AUNTY""? N,Y eliminated? \n\nNo.\n\n""PARTY"": R and Y eliminated? No.\n\nSo I think ""ALOFT"" or ""ADULT"".\n\nPerhaps ""ATOLL"": A,T,O,L,L? Duplicate L? And L is in positions 4 and 5? Also, O? Avoid? \n\nBut has duplicate L? Which may not be? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nSo back? \n\nI choose ""ALOFT"" because L is in position 2? Which hasn\'t been tested? And also, O is common vowel? \n\nAdditionally, it avoids putting L in 4? Which ""ADULT"" does? \n\nBut in ""ADULT"", T is in position 5? so we are testing position for T? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested any position for T? So equally good? \n\nPerhaps we can combine? \n\nI\'ll choose ""ALOFT"" \n\nSo guess ""ALOFT""\n\nBut let me check letters: A,L,O,F,T. All allowed? \n\nEliminated letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y? O and F? OK? Yes.\n\nTherefore, guess: ""ALOFT""\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - **Key deductions**:  \n     - **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (marked as misplaced).  \n     - **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the word.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  \n   - **Key deductions**:  \n     - **A** is **not in position 2** (misplaced, so must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  \n     - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (both misplaced).  \n     - **S and Y are absent**.  \n     - **A, L, T are confirmed in the word** (from both guesses).  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Secret word contains**: A, L, T.  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  \n  - L cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  \n  - T cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A, L, T and cover untested common letters (e.g., O, F, D, U, I).  \n\n### Strategic Reasoning:\n- Since **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5**, we prioritize placing it in **position 1** (untested so far) to maximize positional information.  \n- **L and T** should be placed in untested positions: L avoids position 3, and T avoids position 4.  \n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, Y) and include new high-frequency letters like **O** or **F** to test for presence.  \n- **Selected word: ""ALOFT""**  \n  - A in **position 1** (tests if A is correct in position 1).  \n  - L in **position 2** (untested position, avoids position 3).  \n  - T in **position 5** (untested position, avoids position 4).  \n  - Introduces **O** and **F** (common letters, not previously tested).  \n  - Distinct letters: A, L, O, F, T (no duplicates).  \n\nIf ""ALOFT"" doesn\'t fully solve the puzzle, feedback will narrow down the positions for A, L, T and reveal if O/F are present or absent.\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. ""salty"": S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - T is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - S and Y are absent.

3. ""aloft"": A(-), L(✓), O(✓), F(x), T(✓)
   - L is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has L in the second position).
   - O is correct in position 3 (so the secret word has O in the third position).
   - T is correct in position 5 (so the secret word has T in the fifth position).
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for A in position 1).
   - F is absent.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: T

So the word pattern is: _ L O _ T

- We also know that the word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from the dashes in guesses 1, 2, and 3). Since position 2 and 3 are fixed as L and O, and position 1 is now ruled out (from ""aloft"" feedback), A must be in position 4.

But wait: the word has only 5 positions. We have:
  Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A in position 1 was marked as dash in ""aloft"")
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: T

We know A is in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the only possibility is position 4.

So the word pattern becomes: _ L O A T

Now, we only need to find the first letter.

What do we know about the first letter?

- It cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F (from the feedback of all three guesses: C, R, N, E from first; S, Y from second; F from third).

- Also, it cannot be A (because A is in position 4) and cannot be L, O, T (because they are in other positions and we assume no duplicates? But we must consider duplicates?).

But note: in the feedback for ""aloft"", we have A marked as dash (meaning present but wrong position) even though we put A in position 1. But if the word has only one A (in position 4), then that dash is because it's in the word but not in position 1. So if there were two A's, we might have seen two dashes? But we only have one A in the guess? So we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but the feedback would only mark the correct number of occurrences. But in our case, we have only one A in the guess, and it was marked as dash, meaning at least one A is present. Since we know A is in position 4, and we have no evidence of a second A, we assume only one A? But we cannot be sure? However, the pattern _ L O A T has A in position 4, so the first letter cannot be A? Because if it were, then we would have two A's? But we don't know? 

But let's look at the feedback: in ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 1. Since we have A in position 4, that accounts for the A. Therefore, the first letter is not A.

Similarly, the first letter cannot be L, O, or T because they are already placed in the word? But if there were duplicates, it could be? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be a duplicate? But we have no feedback suggesting duplicates? 

Moreover, the feedback for ""aloft"" showed:
  A: dash (so one A present, but not in position 1)
  L: correct in position 2 (so one L? or at least one L in the correct position? but if there were two, we might have seen another dash? but we didn't, so probably only one L? Similarly for O and T: they are marked correct, so at least one in the correct position? but if there were duplicates, we might have seen more? 

Given that, it's safer to assume no duplicates for now? But we don't have to assume? We can just avoid using duplicates? 

But the first letter must be a letter that is not eliminated and not A, L, O, T? 

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.

So available letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word that starts with one of these and ends with the pattern: L O A T? Actually, the word is: [letter] L O A T.

So the word must be ? L O A T.

We need to find a valid English word that fits: _ L O A T

Possible words: 
  BLOAT, GLOAT, FLOAT? But F is eliminated? So FLOAT is out.
  BLOAT: B, L, O, A, T -> B is available? 
  GLOAT: G, L, O, A, T -> G is available.

Also, are there others? 
  PLOAT? Not a word.
  SLOAT? Not a word? And S is eliminated.
  CLOAT? C eliminated.
  RLOAT? R eliminated.
  NLOAT? N eliminated.
  ELOAT? E eliminated.
  YLOAT? Y eliminated.

So only BLOAT and GLOAT? 

But wait: what about ""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT""? 

Also, ""FLOAT"" is a word but F is eliminated? 

Another? ""ALOAT""? But A is already in position 4? and we have A in position 1? But we know A cannot be in position 1? So not.

So the only possibilities are BLOAT and GLOAT? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess either? 

But note: we have not tested B or G? So we don't know which one? 

But we have only two possibilities? So we can guess one? 

If we guess ""BLOAT"", and it's wrong, then we know it's ""GLOAT""? 

But we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 4? So we can do that? 

Alternatively, we can think if there are more words? 

What about ""THOAT""? Not a word? 

""CLOAT""? Not a word? 

""PLOAT""? Not a word? 

""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT"" are the only common ones? 

Also, ""FLOAT"" is common but F is eliminated? 

So we have two candidates: BLOAT and GLOAT.

We can guess ""BLOAT"" for example? 

But let me confirm the pattern: 
  B L O A T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:A, 5:T -> matches the pattern.

Similarly, G L O A T.

Now, we have to choose one? 

We have no information about B or G? So we can pick arbitrarily? 

But note: we have not used B or G in previous guesses? So we don't know? 

We can choose ""BLOAT"" because B is more common? 

But actually, we are forced to choose one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven't eliminated? 

But both are valid? 

I'll choose ""BLOAT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""GLOAT""? Then we get it wrong? But we have two guesses left? 

But we are on guess 4? We can do that? 

But we might get it in 4? 

So let's guess ""BLOAT"".

But note: we are not sure if the first letter is B or G? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that tests both? But no? 

So I'll go with ""BLOAT"".

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash -> meaning A is present but not in 1? and we have A in position 4? So if we put A in position 4? then it should be correct? 

In ""BLOAT"", we have A in position 4? So it should be correct? 

Similarly, L in 2, O in 3, T in 5: all correct? 

So if the word is ""BLOAT"", we get all correct? 

If the word is ""GLOAT"", then we get B wrong? 

But we are guessing ""BLOAT"", so if it's correct, we win? If not, we know it's ""GLOAT"" for the next guess? 

So it's safe? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""BLOAT"".

But note: we have to make sure that ""BLOAT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So <guess>bloat</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
   - **C, R, N, E** are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **A** is **not in position 2**.  
   - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (respectively).  
   - **S, Y** are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""aloft"" → Feedback: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)**  
   - **L** is **correct in position 2**.  
   - **O** is **correct in position 3**.  
   - **T** is **correct in position 5**.  
   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - **F** is **absent**.  

### Consolidated Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  - Position 2: **L** (fixed).  
  - Position 3: **O** (fixed).  
  - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  
  - **A** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3** → **must be in position 4**.  
  - Thus, the word pattern is: **? L O A T** (only position 1 is unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.  
- **Remaining possibilities for position 1**:  
  - Must be a letter not eliminated and not conflicting with known positions (i.e., not A, L, O, T).  
  - Valid options: **B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.  
- **Possible words**:  
  - **""BLOAT""** (B in position 1).  
  - **""GLOAT""** (G in position 1).  
  - *Other combinations (e.g., ""FLOAT"") are invalid due to eliminated letters.*  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most probable word to solve the puzzle.  
- **""BLOAT"" is selected** because:  
  - It fits the pattern **? L O A T** with **B** (a common letter) in position 1.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved. If incorrect, feedback will confirm the word is **""GLOAT""** (the only other valid option).  
- This guess maximizes efficiency with minimal risk (only 2 possibilities remain).

<guess>bloat</guess>",bloat,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. ""salty"": S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - T is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - S and Y are absent.

3. ""aloft"": A(-), L(✓), O(✓), F(x), T(✓)
   - L is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has L in the second position).
   - O is correct in position 3 (so the secret word has O in the third position).
   - T is correct in position 5 (so the secret word has T in the fifth position).
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for A in position 1).
   - F is absent.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: T

So the word pattern is: _ L O _ T

- We also know that the word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from the dashes in guesses 1, 2, and 3). Since position 2 and 3 are fixed as L and O, and position 1 is now ruled out (from ""aloft"" feedback), A must be in position 4.

But wait: the word has only 5 positions. We have:
  Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A in position 1 was marked as dash in ""aloft"")
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: T

We know A is in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the only possibility is position 4.

So the word pattern becomes: _ L O A T

Now, we only need to find the first letter.

What do we know about the first letter?

- It cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F (from the feedback of all three guesses: C, R, N, E from first; S, Y from second; F from third).

- Also, it cannot be A (because A is in position 4) and cannot be L, O, T (because they are in other positions and we assume no duplicates? But we must consider duplicates?).

But note: in the feedback for ""aloft"", we have A marked as dash (meaning present but wrong position) even though we put A in position 1. But if the word has only one A (in position 4), then that dash is because it's in the word but not in position 1. So if there were two A's, we might have seen two dashes? But we only have one A in the guess? So we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but the feedback would only mark the correct number of occurrences. But in our case, we have only one A in the guess, and it was marked as dash, meaning at least one A is present. Since we know A is in position 4, and we have no evidence of a second A, we assume only one A? But we cannot be sure? However, the pattern _ L O A T has A in position 4, so the first letter cannot be A? Because if it were, then we would have two A's? But we don't know? 

But let's look at the feedback: in ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 1. Since we have A in position 4, that accounts for the A. Therefore, the first letter is not A.

Similarly, the first letter cannot be L, O, or T because they are already placed in the word? But if there were duplicates, it could be? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be a duplicate? But we have no feedback suggesting duplicates? 

Moreover, the feedback for ""aloft"" showed:
  A: dash (so one A present, but not in position 1)
  L: correct in position 2 (so one L? or at least one L in the correct position? but if there were two, we might have seen another dash? but we didn't, so probably only one L? Similarly for O and T: they are marked correct, so at least one in the correct position? but if there were duplicates, we might have seen more? 

Given that, it's safer to assume no duplicates for now? But we don't have to assume? We can just avoid using duplicates? 

But the first letter must be a letter that is not eliminated and not A, L, O, T? 

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.

So available letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word that starts with one of these and ends with the pattern: L O A T? Actually, the word is: [letter] L O A T.

So the word must be ? L O A T.

We need to find a valid English word that fits: _ L O A T

Possible words: 
  BLOAT, GLOAT, FLOAT? But F is eliminated? So FLOAT is out.
  BLOAT: B, L, O, A, T -> B is available? 
  GLOAT: G, L, O, A, T -> G is available.

Also, are there others? 
  PLOAT? Not a word.
  SLOAT? Not a word? And S is eliminated.
  CLOAT? C eliminated.
  RLOAT? R eliminated.
  NLOAT? N eliminated.
  ELOAT? E eliminated.
  YLOAT? Y eliminated.

So only BLOAT and GLOAT? 

But wait: what about ""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT""? 

Also, ""FLOAT"" is a word but F is eliminated? 

Another? ""ALOAT""? But A is already in position 4? and we have A in position 1? But we know A cannot be in position 1? So not.

So the only possibilities are BLOAT and GLOAT? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess either? 

But note: we have not tested B or G? So we don't know which one? 

But we have only two possibilities? So we can guess one? 

If we guess ""BLOAT"", and it's wrong, then we know it's ""GLOAT""? 

But we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 4? So we can do that? 

Alternatively, we can think if there are more words? 

What about ""THOAT""? Not a word? 

""CLOAT""? Not a word? 

""PLOAT""? Not a word? 

""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT"" are the only common ones? 

Also, ""FLOAT"" is common but F is eliminated? 

So we have two candidates: BLOAT and GLOAT.

We can guess ""BLOAT"" for example? 

But let me confirm the pattern: 
  B L O A T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:A, 5:T -> matches the pattern.

Similarly, G L O A T.

Now, we have to choose one? 

We have no information about B or G? So we can pick arbitrarily? 

But note: we have not used B or G in previous guesses? So we don't know? 

We can choose ""BLOAT"" because B is more common? 

But actually, we are forced to choose one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven't eliminated? 

But both are valid? 

I'll choose ""BLOAT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""GLOAT""? Then we get it wrong? But we have two guesses left? 

But we are on guess 4? We can do that? 

But we might get it in 4? 

So let's guess ""BLOAT"".

But note: we are not sure if the first letter is B or G? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that tests both? But no? 

So I'll go with ""BLOAT"".

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash -> meaning A is present but not in 1? and we have A in position 4? So if we put A in position 4? then it should be correct? 

In ""BLOAT"", we have A in position 4? So it should be correct? 

Similarly, L in 2, O in 3, T in 5: all correct? 

So if the word is ""BLOAT"", we get all correct? 

If the word is ""GLOAT"", then we get B wrong? 

But we are guessing ""BLOAT"", so if it's correct, we win? If not, we know it's ""GLOAT"" for the next guess? 

So it's safe? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""BLOAT"".

But note: we have to make sure that ""BLOAT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So <guess>bloat</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
   - **C, R, N, E** are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **A** is **not in position 2**.  
   - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (respectively).  
   - **S, Y** are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""aloft"" → Feedback: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)**  
   - **L** is **correct in position 2**.  
   - **O** is **correct in position 3**.  
   - **T** is **correct in position 5**.  
   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - **F** is **absent**.  

### Consolidated Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  - Position 2: **L** (fixed).  
  - Position 3: **O** (fixed).  
  - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  
  - **A** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3** → **must be in position 4**.  
  - Thus, the word pattern is: **? L O A T** (only position 1 is unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.  
- **Remaining possibilities for position 1**:  
  - Must be a letter not eliminated and not conflicting with known positions (i.e., not A, L, O, T).  
  - Valid options: **B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.  
- **Possible words**:  
  - **""BLOAT""** (B in position 1).  
  - **""GLOAT""** (G in position 1).  
  - *Other combinations (e.g., ""FLOAT"") are invalid due to eliminated letters.*  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most probable word to solve the puzzle.  
- **""BLOAT"" is selected** because:  
  - It fits the pattern **? L O A T** with **B** (a common letter) in position 1.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved. If incorrect, feedback will confirm the word is **""GLOAT""** (the only other valid option).  
- This guess maximizes efficiency with minimal risk (only 2 possibilities remain).",Guess 4: bloat -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 Feedback interpretation:
   - C is not in the secret word (x)
   - R is not in the secret word (x)
   - A in the word but in the wrong position (-)
   - N is not in the secret word (x)
   - E is not in the secret word (x)

 Important deductions:
 1. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since our guess had A in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
 2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 We know the secret word is 5 letters and must include A (but not in the third position).

 Since we have eliminated several common letters (C, R, N, E), we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes A, but not in the third position (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
   - Does NOT include any of C, R, N, E.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: Since it's not in the third position, we can try placing it in the first, second, fourth, or fifth.

 Because we have so many eliminated letters, a good strategy is to try a word that uses other vowels and common consonants.

 Note: The secret word contains at least one A (and possibly more).

 Since A is the only letter we know is present, we want to maximize information by including other new common letters.

 Consider the word: ""SAINT"" -> but N is eliminated so we can't use that.
 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Try to think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

 Example words:
   ""ALOFT"" -> A first, then L, O, F, T - all new letters.
   ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T - but A is in the third position? Wait, in ""PLAIT"", A is third? We can avoid putting A in the third since we know it's not there? Actually, we must avoid putting A in the third position? Not necessarily: we know that in the first guess (crane) A was in the third position and it was wrong position. But in the secret word, A could be in a different position. However, if we put A in the third position again, and if the secret word has A but not in third, we'll get wrong position again. It's inefficient to reuse the same position. So better to put A in a different position to narrow down.

 Therefore, avoid the third position for A.

 Let me try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but E and U? E is eliminated. We cannot use E.

 Words without E: 
   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.

 However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.

 But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).

 Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don't know if there could be two A's).

 However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn't tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.

 It's possible that the word has only one A? We don't know.

 Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven't tested duplicates.

 We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 So let's try a word with one A and four new letters.

 Options:
   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.

 Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.

 Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.

 How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A's? It's convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.

 Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".

 Also, note: we know only A is present. We don't know about others.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don't want to put A in the third? So avoid.

 How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.

 Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.

 Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.

 We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.

 Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.

 We must not use eliminated letters.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.

 But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.

 Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.

 But duplicate A: we don't know about duplicates? We can try.

 But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.

 Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.

 How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that's different.

 So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

 But we don't know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.

 Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.

 However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it's not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? 

 How about we try to put it in the first? That's what ""ABOUT"" does.

 Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.

 In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).
 In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).

 Both are good. Let's choose ""ABOUT"".

 But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.

 If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we'll get a check. If not, but it has A, we'll get a dash? So we might learn.

 Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.

 But note: we don't know if A might be in first? So let's try first position.

 Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? 

 However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven't tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.

 So both are valid.

 Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.

 Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.

 Let me compare:
   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T
   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y

 We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? 

 But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? 

 Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? 

 So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.

 However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? 

 Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? 

 So I'll go with ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don't know.

 Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can't use N.

 How about ""SPALT""? not word.

 I decide to use ""HASTY"".

 But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.

 Also, L is common.

 Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.

 But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

 We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it's safe.

 How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? 
   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y

 Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? 

 Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don't care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? 

 Both words are valid. I'll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.

 But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:
   position1: S
   position2: A
   position3: L
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 And in HASTY:
   position1: H
   position2: A
   position3: S
   position4: T
   position5: Y

 Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don't know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? 

 So actually, we have:
   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? 
   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? 

 Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.

 Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That's good? 

 But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? 

 If I put A in second, I'll get:
   If the secret A is in second: ✓
   Else: -

 And then we'll know.

 Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? 

 So between SALTY and HASTY? 
   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y
   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y

 They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? 

 SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? 

 But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? 

 However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? 

 Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don't care? 

 So I'd prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? 

 But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? 

 Alternatively, let's choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A's and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: 
   For ""PASTA"": 
        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? 

 Actually the feedback for duplicates: 
   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don't know? 

 To keep it simple? Let's avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".

 So my second guess: ""SALTY""

 But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? 

 Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: 
   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? 

 Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? 

 Therefore, with SALTY, we get:
   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? 
   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?

 Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? 

 So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? 

 I think that's good.

 Therefore, I'll guess ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").
- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).
- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A strong option is **""SALTY""**:
- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.
- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn't in the third).
- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.
- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).
- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.

- A is in the word, but not in the third position.

From ""salty"":
- S(x): S is NOT in the word. (new information)
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we placed it second).
- L(-): L is in the word, but not in the third position (we placed L third).
- T(-): T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (we placed T fourth).
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word. (new information)

Summary of knowledge:

Letters definitely in the word: A, L, T (confirmed by two dashes: A from ""crane"" and ""salty"", and L and T from ""salty"").

Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E (from first guess), S (from second guess), Y (from second guess). Also, note we haven't seen others, so we can assume absent?

Additionally, we know:
- A is not in position 2 (from ""salty"") or position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""salty""). Since we only placed L in position 3, we don't know its correct position yet.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""salty""). We don't know its correct position.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A, L, T. There must be at least three letters: A, L, T. Possibly more? But we only know three letters.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Includes A, L, T (all must be present).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.
- Places A in a new position (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out: 1, 4, or 5).
- Places L not in position 3? But that's the only position we tried? We need to test L in other positions.
- Similarly for T: not in position 4.

Also, note: we might have more letters? But we don't know which ones? So we should test new common letters? Like O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

Possible scenarios:

- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- L can be in position 1,2,4,5? But we don't know where.
- T can be in position 1,2,3,5? Since not 4.

We need to form a word that has A, L, T and satisfies these.

List of words that contain A, L, T and avoid denied letters? And also not repeating positions we know are wrong.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.

Common words: 
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and R are eliminated? R is eliminated (from first guess), so no.
- ""LATIN"" -> N is eliminated? no.
- ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> but A is third? We know A isn't in third? So we must avoid putting A in third? And in ""PLAIT"", A is third? So we cannot use that? Also, if we use that, we will get A marked as wrong position? But we already know it's not third? So it's inefficient? But if we think the word might have A in third? But we have two feedbacks indicating A isn't in third? Actually, from first guess: A in position 3: wrong position? and we have confirmed A is present? So we know A is not in position 3? So using a word with A in third is wasting a position? So avoid.

Therefore, no word should put A in positions 2 or 3? Similarly for L: we know L isn't in position 3? So avoid putting L in third? Because it's incorrect? So similarly.

So let's avoid:

- A in position 2 or 3? Actually, position 2 and 3 are forbidden for A? But we only know positions 2 and 3 are not correct? So we must try position 1,4, or5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? For T: avoid position 4? 

Also, note: we have tried S (which is absent) and Y (absent) so avoid.

Now, think of words that contain A, L, T and avoid the eliminated letters.

Possible words:

1. ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> has A, L, T? Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). 
   - A is in position 1 (permissible).
   - L is in position 4 (we haven't tried: so possible? and it avoids position 3=good).
   - T is in position 5 (we haven't tried position 5: and it avoids position 4=good).

   But does it avoid eliminated letters? C, R, N, E, S, Y? Yes, since it uses A,D,U,L,T.

2. ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> but E is eliminated? NO. E is eliminated? So invalid.

3. ""FAULT"": F,A,U,L,T -> avoids eliminated? Letters: F(not eliminated), A,U,L,T -> yes. Positions: F(1),A(2)? But wait, we know A isn't in position 2? Because of ""salty"" feedback: A in position 2: wrong? So A can't be 2? Therefore, putting A in position 2 here? It will be wrong? But we are using it? We could? But it's inefficient because we already know A isn't 2? So don't put A in 2 again? Avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for ""FAULT"": A is in position 2: which is known to be wrong? So it will waste a dash? Similarly, we can avoid putting A in positions we know are wrong.

Therefore, we prefer putting A in a position we haven't tried? So positions 1,4,5? 

Similarly for L: avoid position 3? so positions 1,2,4,5? For T: avoid position 4? so positions 1,2,3,5? 

Now, back to ""ADULT"": A in 1, L in 4, T in 5? Good? 

But note: L is in position 4: we haven't tried L in position 4? So acceptable? 

Similarly, T in position 5: haven't tried.

Another word: ""ALTAR"": A,L,T,A,R -> but duplicate A? And R is eliminated? No.

Another: ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> positions: A(1),L(2),O(3),F(4),T(5). 
   - L in position 2: we haven't tried? And avoids position 3? 
   - T in position 5? avoids position 4? 
   - A in 1? good? 

And letters: O and F are new? and allowed? Avoid eliminated: O and F? yes.

Also, ""ALOFT"" vs ""ADULT"": both have A,L,T? But different additional letters: D,U vs O,F.

Which is better? 

But note: we have more vowels? O? We don't know if O is present? 

Similarly, we can test common letters? 

Another: ""PLANT"": N is eliminated? And also, A in position 2? which we know is wrong? 

How about ""GALT""? Not word? 

Another: ""THAL"": Not letter.

So possible words: ""ADULT"", ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"" (but A in 2: avoid?), ""VISTA""? But S is absent? 

""S"" is eliminated? So we cannot use VISTA? Because has S? 

Another: ""ULTRA"": U,L,T,R,A -> but R is eliminated? So no.

Therefore, two good candidates: ""ADULT"" and ""ALOFT"".

Now, which one tests more new letters? Both test two new letters: ""ADULT"": D,U; ""ALOFT"": O,F.

Common letters? O is more common than F? Also, U is common? 

But perhaps F is less common? 

Since we have three letters confirmed: A, L, T? And we don't know the other two? We need to discover them? 

So guessing ""ADULT"" might test D and U? Whereas ""ALOFT"" tests O and F? 

We also must think about the positions? 

For ""ALOFT"": 
   A in 1? 
   L in 2? 
   O in 3? 
   F in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is in the word? But we put T in position 5? so if T is not in 5? we'll get dash? 

Similarly for ""ADULT"": 
   A in 1? 
   D in 2? 
   U in 3? 
   L in 4? 
   T in 5? 

We know T is not in 4? but we don't know where? Position 5 could be? 

So both are valid? 

But we also want to cover a variety of letters? 

Alternatively, how about ""ADAPT""? But A in 1? and P? But D,P? Duplicate A? Also, we have T? But A is in 1? However, ""ADAPT"" has A in first and fourth? Duplicate? Also, we have P? But eliminated? No? 

But note: we know A is in the word? But it could be more than one? The feedback doesn't tell us? 

In the first guess: only one A? and dash? so possibly one? but maybe more? 

But guessing a word with two A's might not be bad? 

But we have guesses left? 

Another candidate: ""AUNTY""? N,Y eliminated? 

No.

""PARTY"": R and Y eliminated? No.

So I think ""ALOFT"" or ""ADULT"".

Perhaps ""ATOLL"": A,T,O,L,L? Duplicate L? And L is in positions 4 and 5? Also, O? Avoid? 

But has duplicate L? Which may not be? 

But we don't know? 

So back? 

I choose ""ALOFT"" because L is in position 2? Which hasn't been tested? And also, O is common vowel? 

Additionally, it avoids putting L in 4? Which ""ADULT"" does? 

But in ""ADULT"", T is in position 5? so we are testing position for T? 

But note: we haven't tested any position for T? So equally good? 

Perhaps we can combine? 

I'll choose ""ALOFT"" 

So guess ""ALOFT""

But let me check letters: A,L,O,F,T. All allowed? 

Eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y? O and F? OK? Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""ALOFT""

<guess>aloft</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (marked as misplaced).  
     - **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - **A** is **not in position 2** (misplaced, so must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
     - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (both misplaced).  
     - **S and Y are absent**.  
     - **A, L, T are confirmed in the word** (from both guesses).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word contains**: A, L, T.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
  - L cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A, L, T and cover untested common letters (e.g., O, F, D, U, I).  

### Strategic Reasoning:
- Since **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5**, we prioritize placing it in **position 1** (untested so far) to maximize positional information.  
- **L and T** should be placed in untested positions: L avoids position 3, and T avoids position 4.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, Y) and include new high-frequency letters like **O** or **F** to test for presence.  
- **Selected word: ""ALOFT""**  
  - A in **position 1** (tests if A is correct in position 1).  
  - L in **position 2** (untested position, avoids position 3).  
  - T in **position 5** (untested position, avoids position 4).  
  - Introduces **O** and **F** (common letters, not previously tested).  
  - Distinct letters: A, L, O, F, T (no duplicates).  

If ""ALOFT"" doesn't fully solve the puzzle, feedback will narrow down the positions for A, L, T and reveal if O/F are present or absent.

<guess>aloft</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. ""salty"": S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - T is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - S and Y are absent.

3. ""aloft"": A(-), L(✓), O(✓), F(x), T(✓)
   - L is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has L in the second position).
   - O is correct in position 3 (so the secret word has O in the third position).
   - T is correct in position 5 (so the secret word has T in the fifth position).
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for A in position 1).
   - F is absent.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: T

So the word pattern is: _ L O _ T

- We also know that the word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from the dashes in guesses 1, 2, and 3). Since position 2 and 3 are fixed as L and O, and position 1 is now ruled out (from ""aloft"" feedback), A must be in position 4.

But wait: the word has only 5 positions. We have:
  Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A in position 1 was marked as dash in ""aloft"")
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: T

We know A is in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the only possibility is position 4.

So the word pattern becomes: _ L O A T

Now, we only need to find the first letter.

What do we know about the first letter?

- It cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F (from the feedback of all three guesses: C, R, N, E from first; S, Y from second; F from third).

- Also, it cannot be A (because A is in position 4) and cannot be L, O, T (because they are in other positions and we assume no duplicates? But we must consider duplicates?).

But note: in the feedback for ""aloft"", we have A marked as dash (meaning present but wrong position) even though we put A in position 1. But if the word has only one A (in position 4), then that dash is because it's in the word but not in position 1. So if there were two A's, we might have seen two dashes? But we only have one A in the guess? So we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but the feedback would only mark the correct number of occurrences. But in our case, we have only one A in the guess, and it was marked as dash, meaning at least one A is present. Since we know A is in position 4, and we have no evidence of a second A, we assume only one A? But we cannot be sure? However, the pattern _ L O A T has A in position 4, so the first letter cannot be A? Because if it were, then we would have two A's? But we don't know? 

But let's look at the feedback: in ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 1. Since we have A in position 4, that accounts for the A. Therefore, the first letter is not A.

Similarly, the first letter cannot be L, O, or T because they are already placed in the word? But if there were duplicates, it could be? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be a duplicate? But we have no feedback suggesting duplicates? 

Moreover, the feedback for ""aloft"" showed:
  A: dash (so one A present, but not in position 1)
  L: correct in position 2 (so one L? or at least one L in the correct position? but if there were two, we might have seen another dash? but we didn't, so probably only one L? Similarly for O and T: they are marked correct, so at least one in the correct position? but if there were duplicates, we might have seen more? 

Given that, it's safer to assume no duplicates for now? But we don't have to assume? We can just avoid using duplicates? 

But the first letter must be a letter that is not eliminated and not A, L, O, T? 

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.

So available letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word that starts with one of these and ends with the pattern: L O A T? Actually, the word is: [letter] L O A T.

So the word must be ? L O A T.

We need to find a valid English word that fits: _ L O A T

Possible words: 
  BLOAT, GLOAT, FLOAT? But F is eliminated? So FLOAT is out.
  BLOAT: B, L, O, A, T -> B is available? 
  GLOAT: G, L, O, A, T -> G is available.

Also, are there others? 
  PLOAT? Not a word.
  SLOAT? Not a word? And S is eliminated.
  CLOAT? C eliminated.
  RLOAT? R eliminated.
  NLOAT? N eliminated.
  ELOAT? E eliminated.
  YLOAT? Y eliminated.

So only BLOAT and GLOAT? 

But wait: what about ""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT""? 

Also, ""FLOAT"" is a word but F is eliminated? 

Another? ""ALOAT""? But A is already in position 4? and we have A in position 1? But we know A cannot be in position 1? So not.

So the only possibilities are BLOAT and GLOAT? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess either? 

But note: we have not tested B or G? So we don't know which one? 

But we have only two possibilities? So we can guess one? 

If we guess ""BLOAT"", and it's wrong, then we know it's ""GLOAT""? 

But we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 4? So we can do that? 

Alternatively, we can think if there are more words? 

What about ""THOAT""? Not a word? 

""CLOAT""? Not a word? 

""PLOAT""? Not a word? 

""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT"" are the only common ones? 

Also, ""FLOAT"" is common but F is eliminated? 

So we have two candidates: BLOAT and GLOAT.

We can guess ""BLOAT"" for example? 

But let me confirm the pattern: 
  B L O A T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:A, 5:T -> matches the pattern.

Similarly, G L O A T.

Now, we have to choose one? 

We have no information about B or G? So we can pick arbitrarily? 

But note: we have not used B or G in previous guesses? So we don't know? 

We can choose ""BLOAT"" because B is more common? 

But actually, we are forced to choose one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven't eliminated? 

But both are valid? 

I'll choose ""BLOAT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""GLOAT""? Then we get it wrong? But we have two guesses left? 

But we are on guess 4? We can do that? 

But we might get it in 4? 

So let's guess ""BLOAT"".

But note: we are not sure if the first letter is B or G? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that tests both? But no? 

So I'll go with ""BLOAT"".

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash -> meaning A is present but not in 1? and we have A in position 4? So if we put A in position 4? then it should be correct? 

In ""BLOAT"", we have A in position 4? So it should be correct? 

Similarly, L in 2, O in 3, T in 5: all correct? 

So if the word is ""BLOAT"", we get all correct? 

If the word is ""GLOAT"", then we get B wrong? 

But we are guessing ""BLOAT"", so if it's correct, we win? If not, we know it's ""GLOAT"" for the next guess? 

So it's safe? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""BLOAT"".

But note: we have to make sure that ""BLOAT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

So <guess>bloat</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
   - **C, R, N, E** are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - **A** is **not in position 2**.  
   - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (respectively).  
   - **S, Y** are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""aloft"" → Feedback: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)**  
   - **L** is **correct in position 2**.  
   - **O** is **correct in position 3**.  
   - **T** is **correct in position 5**.  
   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - **F** is **absent**.  

### Consolidated Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  - Position 2: **L** (fixed).  
  - Position 3: **O** (fixed).  
  - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  
  - **A** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3** → **must be in position 4**.  
  - Thus, the word pattern is: **? L O A T** (only position 1 is unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.  
- **Remaining possibilities for position 1**:  
  - Must be a letter not eliminated and not conflicting with known positions (i.e., not A, L, O, T).  
  - Valid options: **B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.  
- **Possible words**:  
  - **""BLOAT""** (B in position 1).  
  - **""GLOAT""** (G in position 1).  
  - *Other combinations (e.g., ""FLOAT"") are invalid due to eliminated letters.*  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most probable word to solve the puzzle.  
- **""BLOAT"" is selected** because:  
  - It fits the pattern **? L O A T** with **B** (a common letter) in position 1.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved. If incorrect, feedback will confirm the word is **""GLOAT""** (the only other valid option).  
- This guess maximizes efficiency with minimal risk (only 2 possibilities remain).

E is eliminated. We cannot use E.\n\n Words without E: \n   ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O: this has A in first. But note that we also eliminated R but we can use D,I,O,U.\n\n However, we have eliminated R, but not U, D, I, O.\n\n But wait, let me check: eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n So ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O: none of the eliminated letters. And A is in first position (a new position).\n\n Another idea: ""SAULT"" (but not common) or ""SALAD"" (duplicate A? we don\'t know if there could be two A\'s).\n\n However, duplicate A: the feedback for A is only one dash. But it doesn\'t tell us if there are more. It just says one A is in the word but wrong position.\n\n It\'s possible that the word has only one A? We don\'t know.\n\n Since the wordle rules allow duplicate letters, but in feedback, if a letter appears twice, the hints would reflect that. But in our case, we only got one dash for A in crane, so we cannot infer duplicates. However, when we have duplicate letters in guess, we must see feedback accordingly. For now, we haven\'t tested duplicates.\n\n We might want to avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n So let\'s try a word with one A and four new letters.\n\n Options:\n   ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all distinct and not eliminated. Positions: A in first.\n\n Another: ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position? So not third? Also, avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""OASIS"" -> O, A, S, I, S -> but duplicate S? Avoid for now.\n\n How about ""PLAID""? P, L, A, I, D -> but A is third? same position of the first guess? we should avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it\'s not there? Actually, we know that position 3 in the first word is not A? Correct: the A was in the third position and wrong. So in the secret word, if we put A in third again, it will still be wrong? Not necessarily: the secret word might have an A in a different position? The first feedback only tells that the A in the third position of the guess is wrong. But if there are two A\'s? It\'s convoluted. To keep it simple, avoid the third position for A in this guess.\n\n Therefore, let me choose ""AUDIO"" or ""PATIO"".\n\n Also, note: we know only A is present. We don\'t know about others.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT?"": but wait, the word ""plait"" has A in the third? We don\'t want to put A in the third? So avoid.\n\n How about ""STAD""? Not five letters. ""STALD""? Not word.\n\n Another word: ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. This avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Consider: ""ABOUT"" -> A in position 1.\n\n We get information about B, O, U, T and also A in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, ""TALON"": T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So invalid because cannot use N.\n\n We must not use eliminated letters.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems good: A, B, O, U, T -> all new.\n\n But note: we have two vowels? A and O? and U? Maybe too many vowels? But we are also testing consonants.\n\n Alternatively, ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And S and T are common.\n\n But duplicate A: we don\'t know about duplicates? We can try.\n\n But I think ""ABOUT"" is a decent choice.\n\n Another idea: ""MASTY"" -> not common. Or ""HASTY""? H is available, but we have eliminated R? Let me see: eliminated are C,R,N,E. So H, A,S,T,Y available.\n\n How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y? But we want A in a position different than third? In ""HASTY"", A is in second? So that\'s different.\n\n So ""HASTY"": positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if the secret word might have H? Or S? Etc.\n\n Compared to ""ABOUT"": both are valid.\n\n However, since we know A is in the word, placing it in different positions will help. We know it\'s not in the third? So we try to put it in second? or first? \n\n How about we try to put it in the first? That\'s what ""ABOUT"" does.\n\n Another factor: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). There are 26-4=22 letters left. We want to maximize coverage.\n\n In ""ABOUT"": we cover A, B, O, U, T (5 new letters).\n In ""HASTY"": we cover H, A, S, T, Y (5 new letters).\n\n Both are good. Let\'s choose ""ABOUT"".\n\n But wait: we also want information about the position of A? We currently know A is not in third (from previous guess). But we need to test a different position.\n\n If we put A in first (like in ""about""), if the actual word has A in first, we\'ll get a check. If not, but it has A, we\'ll get a dash? So we might learn.\n\n Similarly, if we put A in second (like ""hasty""), then same.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if A might be in first? So let\'s try first position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try fourth? fifth? \n\n However, a common strategy is to try a word that tests A in one of the positions we haven\'t tested? But we have only tested the third. So any of first, second, fourth, fifth is new.\n\n So both are valid.\n\n Considering common letters: B, O are common? Actually, S, T, L are more common than U? But we are testing U too.\n\n Perhaps ""HASTY"" is better? Because S and T are very common.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""ABOUT"": letters A, B, O, U, T\n   ""HASTY"": letters H, A, S, T, Y\n\n We know A is present, so we are guaranteed one dash at least? Actually, not: if A is in the same position as we put? Then it would be check. But we are putting A in a new position? \n\n But note: we might get a check for A in the first position? Or a dash? \n\n Given that, I think ""HASTY"" covers S and T which are more common than B and U? \n\n So perhaps ""HASTY"" might be better for gathering more common letters.\n\n However, the word ""HASTY"" has A in the second position? So we are testing whether A is in second? \n\n Also, note: we have no information about the other positions? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""HASTY"".\n\n But wait: ""HASTY"" has S and T and Y? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""PAINT"" -> but N and T? Wait, N is eliminated... can\'t use N.\n\n How about ""SPALT""? not word.\n\n I decide to use ""HASTY"".\n\n But wait: ""salty""? S, A, L, T, Y -> but L and T? And A in second? Avoid third? Second is different. Letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\n Also, L is common.\n\n Actually, ""SALTY"" might be a better word? Because L is a common consonant? And S, T are common.\n\n But the issue: does ""salty"" have A in second position? Same as ""hasty"" but substituting H with S? Actually ""SALTY"": S in first, A in second, L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.\n\n We want to avoid A in third? Here A is in second. So it\'s safe.\n\n How does ""SALTY"" compare to ""HASTY""? \n   SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y\n   HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y\n\n Both cover A, T, Y? SALTY has L and S? HASTY has H and S? We have S in both? Actually, HASTY: S is third letter? And SALTY: S is first? \n\n Since we have not tested any position with S? Therefore, SALTY tests S in first? And HASTY tests S in third? But we don\'t care? Actually we are testing multiple positions? \n\n Both words are valid. I\'ll pick ""SALTY"" because it has L which is common.\n\n But wait: in SALTY, we are testing:\n   position1: S\n   position2: A\n   position3: L\n   position4: T\n   position5: Y\n\n And in HASTY:\n   position1: H\n   position2: A\n   position3: S\n   position4: T\n   position5: Y\n\n Since we know the word has A, and we are testing it in the second position? So if we get a dash for A in second, then we know A is in the word but not second? Then positions 1,4,5? Or possibly third? Wait, but we have eliminated third? Actually, we don\'t know? We only know that the third position of the word is not the A? That is, the letter in the third position of the secret word is not A? Because in the first guess, the A was in third and got dash? So we know that the third letter of the secret word is not A? \n\n So actually, we have:\n   Position 3: cannot be A? Because of the feedback? \n   We are testing two words: SALTY and HASTY? Both put A in the second? \n\n Therefore, if the secret word has A in the second, then we get a check? Otherwise, dash.\n\n Since we are avoiding the third position for A? That\'s good? \n\n But note: the secret word might have A in position 1? or 4? or 5? \n\n If I put A in second, I\'ll get:\n   If the secret A is in second: ✓\n   Else: -\n\n And then we\'ll know.\n\n Actually, regardless, we need to test A in a new position? So I do second? \n\n So between SALTY and HASTY? \n   SALTY: tests S, A, L, T, Y\n   HASTY: tests H, A, S, T, Y\n\n They both have A,T,Y? and one of S? \n\n SALTY has L (which is common) and S (also common) in first and third respectively? But HASTY has H (less common) and S in third? \n\n But also, SALTY has T in fourth? HASTY has T in fourth? same? \n\n However, we have eliminated R? So R is out? L is more common than H? \n\n Also, S in the first position? vs third? We don\'t care? \n\n So I\'d prefer SALTY? because L is a common letter? \n\n But wait: we are guessing five-letter words? And how many letters are left? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose ""PASTA""? P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? But we don\'t know? So we avoid duplicates? Because if there are two A\'s and we guess one A, we might not see the feedback? Actually, feedback: \n   For ""PASTA"": \n        if secret is ? A ? ? ? and we have A in first? then duplicate? \n\n Actually the feedback for duplicates: \n   The rules: each letter only counts as many times as it appears? But we don\'t know? \n\n To keep it simple? Let\'s avoid duplicates? Because if we get feedback we might misinterpret? \n\n Therefore, let me choose ""SALTY"".\n\n So my second guess: ""SALTY""\n\n But wait, let me double check: the feedback told us that in ""crane"", A was in the third and wrong? So the secret word does have A? but not in third? So if we put A in second? how is that? \n\n Let me think: if the secret word is, say, ""AGAPE""? Then for crane: A would be in fifth? So the feedback for crane: \n   For A: we guessed third but actual fifth? so dash? \n\n Now, in ""SALTY"": we have A in second? then if the secret word has A in first? Then A in second would be wrong position? We get a dash? \n\n Therefore, with SALTY, we get:\n   - If we get A at position 2? mark ✓? then the secret word has A in second? \n   - Else? dash? then we know A is not in second? and also not in third? so it must be in 1, 4, or 5?\n\n Also, we get feedback for S in first? L in third? T in fourth? Y in fifth? \n\n So we get coverage for S, L, T, Y? \n\n I think that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess ""SALTY"".\n\n<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:\n- The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the third position** (since it was misplaced in the third position of ""crane"").\n- The letters **C, R, N, and E** are **absent** from the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a word that:\n- Includes **A** (in a position other than third).\n- Excludes the eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information.\n\nA strong option is **""SALTY""**:\n- **S, A, L, T, Y** are letters not yet tested.\n- **A** is placed in the **second position**, testing if it belongs there (since we know it isn\'t in the third).\n- **S, L, T, Y** are high-frequency letters, helping to explore more possibilities.\n- Avoids duplicate letters and eliminated letters.\n\nThis guess will clarify:\n- If **A** is in the second position (feedback: ✓), or elsewhere (feedback: -).\n- The presence/absence of **S, L, T, Y** in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nSecond guess: ""salty"" → S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n\nAnalyzing feedback:\n\nFrom ""crane"":\n- A is in the word, but not in the third position.\n\nFrom ""salty"":\n- S(x): S is NOT in the word. (new information)\n- A(-): A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we placed it second).\n- L(-): L is in the word, but not in the third position (we placed L third).\n- T(-): T is in the word, but not in the fourth position (we placed T fourth).\n- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word. (new information)\n\nSummary of knowledge:\n\nLetters definitely in the word: A, L, T (confirmed by two dashes: A from ""crane"" and ""salty"", and L and T from ""salty"").\n\nLetters definitely absent: C, R, N, E (from first guess), S (from second guess), Y (from second guess). Also, note we haven\'t seen others, so we can assume absent?\n\nAdditionally, we know:\n- A is not in position 2 (from ""salty"") or position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""salty""). Since we only placed L in position 3, we don\'t know its correct position yet.\n- T is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""salty""). We don\'t know its correct position.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters and contains A, L, T. There must be at least three letters: A, L, T. Possibly more? But we only know three letters.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that:\n- Includes A, L, T (all must be present).\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.\n- Places A in a new position (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out: 1, 4, or 5).\n- Places L not in position 3? But that\'s the only position we tried? We need to test L in other positions.\n- Similarly for T: not in position 4.\n\nAlso, note: we might have more letters? But we don\'t know which ones? So we should test new common letters? Like O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- L can be in position 1,2,4,5? But we don\'t know where.\n- T can be in position 1,2,3,5? Since not 4.\n\nWe need to form a word that has A, L, T and satisfies these.\n\nList of words that contain A, L, T and avoid denied letters? And also not repeating positions we know are wrong.\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ALERT"" -> but E and R are eliminated? R is eliminated (from first guess), so no.\n- ""LATIN"" -> N is eliminated? no.\n- ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> but A is third? We know A isn\'t in third? So we must avoid putting A in third? And in ""PLAIT"", A is third? So we cannot use that? Also, if we use that, we will get A marked as wrong position? But we already know it\'s not third? So it\'s inefficient? But if we think the word might have A in third? But we have two feedbacks indicating A isn\'t in third? Actually, from first guess: A in position 3: wrong position? and we have confirmed A is present? So we know A is not in position 3? So using a word with A in third is wasting a position? So avoid.\n\nTherefore, no word should put A in positions 2 or 3? Similarly for L: we know L isn\'t in position 3? So avoid putting L in third? Because it\'s incorrect? So similarly.\n\nSo let\'s avoid:\n\n- A in position 2 or 3? Actually, position 2 and 3 are forbidden for A? But we only know positions 2 and 3 are not correct? So we must try position 1,4, or5? \n\nSimilarly for L: avoid position 3? For T: avoid position 4? \n\nAlso, note: we have tried S (which is absent) and Y (absent) so avoid.\n\nNow, think of words that contain A, L, T and avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n1. ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T -> has A, L, T? Positions: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5). \n   - A is in position 1 (permissible).\n   - L is in position 4 (we haven\'t tried: so possible? and it avoids position 3=good).\n   - T is in position 5 (we haven\'t tried position 5: and it avoids position 4=good).\n\n   But does it avoid eliminated letters? C, R, N, E, S, Y? Yes, since it uses A,D,U,L,T.\n\n2. ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> but E is eliminated? NO. E is eliminated? So invalid.\n\n3. ""FAULT"": F,A,U,L,T -> avoids eliminated? Letters: F(not eliminated), A,U,L,T -> yes. Positions: F(1),A(2)? But wait, we know A isn\'t in position 2? Because of ""salty"" feedback: A in position 2: wrong? So A can\'t be 2? Therefore, putting A in position 2 here? It will be wrong? But we are using it? We could? But it\'s inefficient because we already know A isn\'t 2? So don\'t put A in 2 again? Avoid positions we know are wrong.\n\nSo for ""FAULT"": A is in position 2: which is known to be wrong? So it will waste a dash? Similarly, we can avoid putting A in positions we know are wrong.\n\nTherefore, we prefer putting A in a position we haven\'t tried? So positions 1,4,5? \n\nSimilarly for L: avoid position 3? so positions 1,2,4,5? For T: avoid position 4? so positions 1,2,3,5? \n\nNow, back to ""ADULT"": A in 1, L in 4, T in 5? Good? \n\nBut note: L is in position 4: we haven\'t tried L in position 4? So acceptable? \n\nSimilarly, T in position 5: haven\'t tried.\n\nAnother word: ""ALTAR"": A,L,T,A,R -> but duplicate A? And R is eliminated? No.\n\nAnother: ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> positions: A(1),L(2),O(3),F(4),T(5). \n   - L in position 2: we haven\'t tried? And avoids position 3? \n   - T in position 5? avoids position 4? \n   - A in 1? good? \n\nAnd letters: O and F are new? and allowed? Avoid eliminated: O and F? yes.\n\nAlso, ""ALOFT"" vs ""ADULT"": both have A,L,T? But different additional letters: D,U vs O,F.\n\nWhich is better? \n\nBut note: we have more vowels? O? We don\'t know if O is present? \n\nSimilarly, we can test common letters? \n\nAnother: ""PLANT"": N is eliminated? And also, A in position 2? which we know is wrong? \n\nHow about ""GALT""? Not word? \n\nAnother: ""THAL"": Not letter.\n\nSo possible words: ""ADULT"", ""ALOFT"", ""FAULT"" (but A in 2: avoid?), ""VISTA""? But S is absent? \n\n""S"" is eliminated? So we cannot use VISTA? Because has S? \n\nAnother: ""ULTRA"": U,L,T,R,A -> but R is eliminated? So no.\n\nTherefore, two good candidates: ""ADULT"" and ""ALOFT"".\n\nNow, which one tests more new letters? Both test two new letters: ""ADULT"": D,U; ""ALOFT"": O,F.\n\nCommon letters? O is more common than F? Also, U is common? \n\nBut perhaps F is less common? \n\nSince we have three letters confirmed: A, L, T? And we don\'t know the other two? We need to discover them? \n\nSo guessing ""ADULT"" might test D and U? Whereas ""ALOFT"" tests O and F? \n\nWe also must think about the positions? \n\nFor ""ALOFT"": \n   A in 1? \n   L in 2? \n   O in 3? \n   F in 4? \n   T in 5? \n\nWe know T is in the word? But we put T in position 5? so if T is not in 5? we\'ll get dash? \n\nSimilarly for ""ADULT"": \n   A in 1? \n   D in 2? \n   U in 3? \n   L in 4? \n   T in 5? \n\nWe know T is not in 4? but we don\'t know where? Position 5 could be? \n\nSo both are valid? \n\nBut we also want to cover a variety of letters? \n\nAlternatively, how about ""ADAPT""? But A in 1? and P? But D,P? Duplicate A? Also, we have T? But A is in 1? However, ""ADAPT"" has A in first and fourth? Duplicate? Also, we have P? But eliminated? No? \n\nBut note: we know A is in the word? But it could be more than one? The feedback doesn\'t tell us? \n\nIn the first guess: only one A? and dash? so possibly one? but maybe more? \n\nBut guessing a word with two A\'s might not be bad? \n\nBut we have guesses left? \n\nAnother candidate: ""AUNTY""? N,Y eliminated? \n\nNo.\n\n""PARTY"": R and Y eliminated? No.\n\nSo I think ""ALOFT"" or ""ADULT"".\n\nPerhaps ""ATOLL"": A,T,O,L,L? Duplicate L? And L is in positions 4 and 5? Also, O? Avoid? \n\nBut has duplicate L? Which may not be? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nSo back? \n\nI choose ""ALOFT"" because L is in position 2? Which hasn\'t been tested? And also, O is common vowel? \n\nAdditionally, it avoids putting L in 4? Which ""ADULT"" does? \n\nBut in ""ADULT"", T is in position 5? so we are testing position for T? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested any position for T? So equally good? \n\nPerhaps we can combine? \n\nI\'ll choose ""ALOFT"" \n\nSo guess ""ALOFT""\n\nBut let me check letters: A,L,O,F,T. All allowed? \n\nEliminated letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y? O and F? OK? Yes.\n\nTherefore, guess: ""ALOFT""\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - **Key deductions**:  \n     - **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (marked as misplaced).  \n     - **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the word.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  \n   - **Key deductions**:  \n     - **A** is **not in position 2** (misplaced, so must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  \n     - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (both misplaced).  \n     - **S and Y are absent**.  \n     - **A, L, T are confirmed in the word** (from both guesses).  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Secret word contains**: A, L, T.  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  \n  - L cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  \n  - T cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A, L, T and cover untested common letters (e.g., O, F, D, U, I).  \n\n### Strategic Reasoning:\n- Since **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5**, we prioritize placing it in **position 1** (untested so far) to maximize positional information.  \n- **L and T** should be placed in untested positions: L avoids position 3, and T avoids position 4.  \n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, Y) and include new high-frequency letters like **O** or **F** to test for presence.  \n- **Selected word: ""ALOFT""**  \n  - A in **position 1** (tests if A is correct in position 1).  \n  - L in **position 2** (untested position, avoids position 3).  \n  - T in **position 5** (untested position, avoids position 4).  \n  - Introduces **O** and **F** (common letters, not previously tested).  \n  - Distinct letters: A, L, O, F, T (no duplicates).  \n\nIf ""ALOFT"" doesn\'t fully solve the puzzle, feedback will narrow down the positions for A, L, T and reveal if O/F are present or absent.\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

We have:\n  Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A in position 1 was marked as dash in ""aloft"")\n  Position 2: L\n  Position 3: O\n  Position 4: unknown\n  Position 5: T\n\nWe know A is in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the only possibility is position 4.\n\nSo the word pattern becomes: _ L O A T\n\nNow, we only need to find the first letter.\n\nWhat do we know about the first letter?\n\n- It cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F (from the feedback of all three guesses: C, R, N, E from first; S, Y from second; F from third).\n\n- Also, it cannot be A (because A is in position 4) and cannot be L, O, T (because they are in other positions and we assume no duplicates? But we must consider duplicates?).\n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""aloft"", we have A marked as dash (meaning present but wrong position) even though we put A in position 1. But if the word has only one A (in position 4), then that dash is because it\'s in the word but not in position 1. So if there were two A\'s, we might have seen two dashes? But we only have one A in the guess? So we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? However, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but the feedback would only mark the correct number of occurrences. But in our case, we have only one A in the guess, and it was marked as dash, meaning at least one A is present. Since we know A is in position 4, and we have no evidence of a second A, we assume only one A? But we cannot be sure? However, the pattern _ L O A T has A in position 4, so the first letter cannot be A? Because if it were, then we would have two A\'s? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s look at the feedback: in ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 1. Since we have A in position 4, that accounts for the A. Therefore, the first letter is not A.\n\nSimilarly, the first letter cannot be L, O, or T because they are already placed in the word? But if there were duplicates, it could be? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? \n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be a duplicate? But we have no feedback suggesting duplicates? \n\nMoreover, the feedback for ""aloft"" showed:\n  A: dash (so one A present, but not in position 1)\n  L: correct in position 2 (so one L? or at least one L in the correct position? but if there were two, we might have seen another dash? but we didn\'t, so probably only one L? Similarly for O and T: they are marked correct, so at least one in the correct position? but if there were duplicates, we might have seen more? \n\nGiven that, it\'s safer to assume no duplicates for now? But we don\'t have to assume? We can just avoid using duplicates? \n\nBut the first letter must be a letter that is not eliminated and not A, L, O, T? \n\nEliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need a word that starts with one of these and ends with the pattern: L O A T? Actually, the word is: [letter] L O A T.\n\nSo the word must be ? L O A T.\n\nWe need to find a valid English word that fits: _ L O A T\n\nPossible words: \n  BLOAT, GLOAT, FLOAT? But F is eliminated? So FLOAT is out.\n  BLOAT: B, L, O, A, T -> B is available? \n  GLOAT: G, L, O, A, T -> G is available.\n\nAlso, are there others? \n  PLOAT? Not a word.\n  SLOAT? Not a word? And S is eliminated.\n  CLOAT? C eliminated.\n  RLOAT? R eliminated.\n  NLOAT? N eliminated.\n  ELOAT? E eliminated.\n  YLOAT? Y eliminated.\n\nSo only BLOAT and GLOAT? \n\nBut wait: what about ""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT""? \n\nAlso, ""FLOAT"" is a word but F is eliminated? \n\nAnother? ""ALOAT""? But A is already in position 4? and we have A in position 1? But we know A cannot be in position 1? So not.\n\nSo the only possibilities are BLOAT and GLOAT? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nWe can guess either? \n\nBut note: we have not tested B or G? So we don\'t know which one? \n\nBut we have only two possibilities? So we can guess one? \n\nIf we guess ""BLOAT"", and it\'s wrong, then we know it\'s ""GLOAT""? \n\nBut we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 4? So we can do that? \n\nAlternatively, we can think if there are more words? \n\nWhat about ""THOAT""? Not a word? \n\n""CLOAT""? Not a word? \n\n""PLOAT""? Not a word? \n\n""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT"" are the only common ones? \n\nAlso, ""FLOAT"" is common but F is eliminated? \n\nSo we have two candidates: BLOAT and GLOAT.\n\nWe can guess ""BLOAT"" for example? \n\nBut let me confirm the pattern: \n  B L O A T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:A, 5:T -> matches the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, G L O A T.\n\nNow, we have to choose one? \n\nWe have no information about B or G? So we can pick arbitrarily? \n\nBut note: we have not used B or G in previous guesses? So we don\'t know? \n\nWe can choose ""BLOAT"" because B is more common? \n\nBut actually, we are forced to choose one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven\'t eliminated? \n\nBut both are valid? \n\nI\'ll choose ""BLOAT"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""GLOAT""? Then we get it wrong? But we have two guesses left? \n\nBut we are on guess 4? We can do that? \n\nBut we might get it in 4? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""BLOAT"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the first letter is B or G? But we have to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that tests both? But no? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BLOAT"".\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback: \n\nIn ""aloft"", we have A in position 1: dash -> meaning A is present but not in 1? and we have A in position 4? So if we put A in position 4? then it should be correct? \n\nIn ""BLOAT"", we have A in position 4? So it should be correct? \n\nSimilarly, L in 2, O in 3, T in 5: all correct? \n\nSo if the word is ""BLOAT"", we get all correct? \n\nIf the word is ""GLOAT"", then we get B wrong? \n\nBut we are guessing ""BLOAT"", so if it\'s correct, we win? If not, we know it\'s ""GLOAT"" for the next guess? \n\nSo it\'s safe? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""BLOAT"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that ""BLOAT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nSo <guess>bloat</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  \n   - **C, R, N, E** are **absent**.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)**  \n   - **A** is **not in position 2**.  \n   - **L** and **T** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 4** (respectively).  \n   - **S, Y** are **absent**.  \n\n3. **Guess 3: ""aloft"" → Feedback: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓)**  \n   - **L** is **correct in position 2**.  \n   - **O** is **correct in position 3**.  \n   - **T** is **correct in position 5**.  \n   - **A** is in the word but **not in position 1**.  \n   - **F** is **absent**.  \n\n### Consolidated Knowledge:\n- **Secret word structure**:  \n  - Position 2: **L** (fixed).  \n  - Position 3: **O** (fixed).  \n  - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  \n  - **A** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3** → **must be in position 4**.  \n  - Thus, the word pattern is: **?

L O A T** with **B** (a common letter) in position 1.  \n  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.

We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""bloat"": B(x) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) T(✓)
 This means:
   - B is absent (x)
   - L is correct and in position 2 (✓)
   - O is correct and in position 3 (✓)
   - A is correct and in position 4 (✓)
   - T is correct and in position 5 (✓)

 So the word has the form: _ L O A T

 We already knew from previous feedback that positions 2, 3, and 5 are L, O, T respectively, and A must be in position 4 (as deduced). Now we have confirmed that A is indeed in position 4.

 The only missing letter is the first one. We know it's not B (from this feedback) and not any of the previously eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.

 The only remaining common possibility is ""GLOAT"", which has G in the first position.

 Therefore, the secret word must be ""GLOAT"".

 We can now guess ""GLOAT"" to solve the puzzle.

 However, note that we are to make a new 5-letter word guess. Since we are confident, we guess ""GLOAT"".

 But let's confirm the eliminated letters: 
   From guess1: C, R, N, E
   From guess2: S, Y
   From guess3: F
   From guess4: B

 So G is not eliminated? And it's the only possibility? 

 Also, note: are there any other words? 
   The pattern is _ L O A T. 
   We have ""BLOAT"" (which was wrong) and ""GLOAT"". 
   Are there others? 
     ""FLOAT"" -> F is eliminated? So no.
     ""SLOAT"" -> S eliminated? and not a word? 
     ""CLOAT"" -> C eliminated? 
     etc.

 So only ""GLOAT"" remains.

 Therefore, we guess ""GLOAT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 2: **L** (correct in ""aloft"" and ""bloat"")
   - Position 3: **O** (correct in ""aloft"" and ""bloat"")
   - Position 4: **A** (correct in ""bloat"")
   - Position 5: **T** (correct in ""aloft"" and ""bloat"")

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   C, R, N, E (from ""crane""), S, Y (from ""salty""), F (from ""aloft""), B (from ""bloat"").

3. **Word Structure**:  
   The secret word must be of the form: **? L O A T**  
   (Only position 1 is unknown).

4. **Analysis of Position 1**:  
   - The only common English word fitting **? L O A T** is **""GLOAT""** (since ""BLOAT"" was incorrect and ""FLOAT"" uses eliminated letter F).  
   - **G** is the only viable option for position 1 (not eliminated and forms a valid word).

### Final Guess: ""GLOAT""  
This solves the puzzle with the pattern **G L O A T**.

<guess>gloat</guess>",gloat,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""bloat"": B(x) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) T(✓)

   - B is absent (x)
   - L is correct and in position 2 (✓)
   - O is correct and in position 3 (✓)
   - A is correct and in position 4 (✓)
   - T is correct and in position 5 (✓)

 So the word has the form: _ L O A T

 We already knew from previous feedback that positions 2, 3, and 5 are L, O, T respectively, and A must be in position 4 (as deduced). Now we have confirmed that A is indeed in position 4.

 The only missing letter is the first one. We know it's not B (from this feedback) and not any of the previously eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, F.

 The only remaining common possibility is ""GLOAT"", which has G in the first position.

 Therefore, the secret word must be ""GLOAT"".

 We can now guess ""GLOAT"" to solve the puzzle.

 However, note that we are to make a new 5-letter word guess. Since we are confident, we guess ""GLOAT"".

 But let's confirm the eliminated letters: 
   From guess1: C, R, N, E
   From guess2: S, Y
   From guess3: F
   From guess4: B

 So G is not eliminated? And it's the only possibility? 

 Also, note: are there any other words? 
   The pattern is _ L O A T. 
   We have ""BLOAT"" (which was wrong) and ""GLOAT"". 
   Are there others? 
     ""FLOAT"" -> F is eliminated? So no.
     ""SLOAT"" -> S eliminated? and not a word? 
     ""CLOAT"" -> C eliminated? 
     etc.

 So only ""GLOAT"" remains.

 Therefore, we guess ""GLOAT"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 2: **L** (correct in ""aloft"" and ""bloat"")
   - Position 3: **O** (correct in ""aloft"" and ""bloat"")
   - Position 4: **A** (correct in ""bloat"")
   - Position 5: **T** (correct in ""aloft"" and ""bloat"")

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   C, R, N, E (from ""crane""), S, Y (from ""salty""), F (from ""aloft""), B (from ""bloat"").

3. **Word Structure**:  
   The secret word must be of the form: **? L O A T**  
   (Only position 1 is unknown).

4. **Analysis of Position 1**:  
   - The only common English word fitting **? L O A T** is **""GLOAT""** (since ""BLOAT"" was incorrect and ""FLOAT"" uses eliminated letter F).  
   - **G** is the only viable option for position 1 (not eliminated and forms a valid word).

### Final Guess: ""GLOAT""
