We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The second letter is R and the third letter is A. So the word has the form _ R A _ _
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position and A in the third position.
- Avoids the letters C, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to test for the remaining positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits _ R A _ _

Possible words that come to mind:
- TRACK: but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also K is new.
- TRAMP: T is new, R is fixed, A is fixed, M is new, P is new. But we have to avoid C, N, E. T, M, P are allowed.
- GRASP: G is new, R, A, S is new, P is new. Avoids C, N, E.
- DRAIN: D is new, R, A, I is new, N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.
- BRAID: B is new, R, A, I, D. Avoids C, N, E.

But note: we have two positions to fill: first and last two (since the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5; we have 2,3 fixed as R and A; so positions 1,4,5 are unknown).

We also know that the word does not contain C, N, E.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R A _ _

Some options:
- TRADE: T, R, A, D, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So invalid.
- GRACE: G, R, A, C, E -> C and E are not allowed. Invalid.
- BRASH: B, R, A, S, H -> avoids C, N, E. So B, S, H are new.
- CRASH: but C is not allowed. Invalid.
- FRANK: F, R, A, N, K -> N is not allowed. Invalid.
- TRASH: T, R, A, S, H -> avoids C, N, E. So T, S, H are new.

We can also consider:
- DRAMA: D, R, A, M, A -> but we have two A's? The pattern is _ R A _ _, so the last two are M and A. Also, we don't know if A can be repeated? The rules don't say the word must have distinct letters, so it's possible. But we have to check: the feedback for ""crane"" didn't have any duplicate letters so we don't know. However, we know A is in the third position and we have an A at the end? That might be acceptable.

But let's stick to words without known bad letters.

Another idea: ""TRAMP"" as I thought earlier: T, R, A, M, P -> all new letters and avoids C, N, E.

Similarly, ""GRASP"": G, R, A, S, P -> avoids C, N, E.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""TRAMP"", we test T, M, P. In ""GRASP"", we test G, S, P.

Alternatively, we can try to include a vowel in the first position to get more information. For example, ""ORATE"" but E is not allowed. ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E -> E is not allowed.

""BRAVE"": B, R, A, V, E -> E is not allowed.

""BRAWL"": B, R, A, W, L -> avoids C, N, E. So B, W, L are new.

""BRASS"": B, R, A, S, S -> has two S's. We don't know if S is in the word, but we can test it.

But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try to cover more common letters.

I think ""TRAMP"" is a good choice because it uses T, M, P which are common and we haven't tested them.

Another common word: ""STAMP"" but that doesn't have R in the second position and A in the third. We must have R in second and A in third.

So the word must be of the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]

We can also consider ""DRAWL"": D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C, N, E.

But let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, N, E:

- BRASS: B, R, A, S, S -> tests B and S (and double S might be an issue, but it's valid)
- GRASS: G, R, A, S, S -> same as above
- TRASS: not a common word? (I think it's not very common)
- PRASE: but E is not allowed.
- FRATS: F, R, A, T, S -> avoids C, N, E. But is it a word? (FRAT is a root, but FRATS? plural of FRAT? maybe, but let's stick to common words)
- BRATS: B, R, A, T, S -> common word, meaning children. Avoids C, N, E.

So ""BRATS"" is a possibility.

But I think ""TRAMP"" is a solid choice because it tests three new common consonants: T, M, P.

Alternatively, ""GRASP"" tests G, S, P.

I'll go with ""TRAMP"" for the second guess.

So the guess is ""TRAMP"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the word.
- R is in the correct second position.
- A is in the correct third position.

The secret word must be of the form _ R A _ _, and it cannot contain C, N, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""tramp"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ R A _ _ (with T in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, M in 4, P in 5).
- It avoids the excluded letters C, N, E.
- It tests new common consonants (T, M, P) to gather more information about the remaining positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

So the word has the form: _ R A _ _

Guess 2: ""tramp"" -> Feedback: T(-), R(✓), A(✓), M(x), P(x)
This means:
- R and A are again confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (as we already knew).
- T is in the word but not in the first position (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and A).
- M and P are not in the word.

Additionally, we know from the first guess that C, N, E are not in the word, and now we also know M and P are not in the word.

So the word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- T is present, but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, T must be in position 4 or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, E, N, M, P.

We need to find a word that fits: _ R A _ _

And the letters we cannot use: C, E, N, M, P.

Also, we have T in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

Now, let's think of possible words.

The first position can be any letter except the ones we know are not in the word (C, E, N, M, P) and also we know T is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 cannot be T. So position 1 must be a letter we haven't tried yet.

Similarly, positions 4 and 5: one of them must be T (since T is present) and the other is a letter we haven't tried and not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, E, N, M, P.

We have tried the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.

So available letters: we can use any letter not in {C, E, N, M, P} and not R, A, T (but T is already in the word, so we can use it again? No, because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But note: T is already in the word, so if we put T in position 4 or 5, that's the same T. We don't need to avoid T in other positions because we know it's present, but we know it's not in position 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.

Now, what about the other position? It must be a letter not in the exclusion list and not T (if we are putting T in one of them, then the other is a different letter).

Possible patterns:

Option 1: Position 4 is T, then position 5 is some other letter (say X): so the word is _ R A T X

Option 2: Position 5 is T, then position 4 is some other letter (say Y): so the word is _ R A Y T

We need to fill the first position as well.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, option 1: _ R A T _

The first position must be a consonant or vowel that is not excluded and not T (since T is in position 4). Available letters: we have many, but common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.

But the word must be a valid English word.

Examples:
- GRATE: but E is excluded -> invalid.
- FRAT: not 5 letters.
- BRAT: not 5 letters.
- DRATS: not a common word? (DRAT is an interjection, but DRATS might be plural? but let's avoid rare words)
- WRATH: W, R, A, T, H -> W is allowed, H is allowed. And the word is common. Also, we haven't tried W or H.

But note: in WRATH, the T is in position 4, which is good. And H is new.

But we must check if H is allowed: yes, not excluded.

Another: CRAFT -> but C is excluded.

So WRATH is a candidate.

Another: BRATS -> but we have S, but BRATS is 5 letters? B-R-A-T-S. But in our pattern, if we put T in position 4, then the word would be _ R A T S. So BRATS: B in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. But we know from guess2 that P is not in the word, but S is new and allowed. However, in guess2 we had ""tramp"" and M and P are not in the word, but S is not excluded.

But wait, in the feedback for guess2, we have T marked as present but not in position 1. In BRATS, T is in position 4, which is consistent.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had no S, so we don't know about S.

However, BRATS uses S, which is not excluded.

But let's see option 2: _ R A _ T

The word ends with T.

Examples:
- GRANT: but N is excluded -> invalid.
- BRANT: N is excluded -> invalid.
- CRAPT: not a word, and C excluded.
- DRAPT: not common.
- FRACT: not 5 letters? F-R-A-C-T, but C excluded.
- WRAPT: W, R, A, P, T -> but P is excluded (from guess2: P(x)).

So WRAPT is invalid because P is excluded.

Another: TRAIT: but T is in position 1? We have _ R A _ T, so position 1 cannot be T because T is not in position 1 (from guess2, T is present but not in position 1). So TRAIT would have T in position 1 and 5? But we know T is not in position 1, so TRAIT is invalid for position 1.

What about CRAWL: but C excluded.

BRAWL: B, R, A, W, L -> but this is _ R A W L, so it doesn't end with T. And we need T in the word? Yes, because T is present.

In this pattern _ R A _ T, we have T at the end.

But we also need to have T in the word, which is satisfied.

But let's find words: 

- DRAFT: D, R, A, F, T -> F is allowed? Yes. And D is allowed. So DRAFT: positions 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=F, 5=T.

This fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

Similarly, GRAFT: G, R, A, F, T -> but F is the same, but G is new.

But GRAFT has G, which is allowed.

However, we have two candidates so far: WRATH (from option1) and DRAFT (from option2).

But note: in option1, WRATH has T in position 4, and in option2, DRAFT has T in position 5.

We also have to consider the first letter.

In WRATH: first letter W, which is new.

In DRAFT: first letter D, which is new.

But we also have to think about other possibilities.

What about S? We haven't tried S.

For example, in option1: _ R A T _ -> we can have BRATS, which is B-R-A-T-S.

Or we can have GRATS: G-R-A-T-S.

But GRATS is a word (meaning, in informal, gratuities).

But let's list all possibilities.

We know T must be in position 4 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 4 -> word: _ R A T X

X can be: any letter not excluded and not T (unless duplicate, but we don't know). But we don't have evidence of duplicate, so let's assume no duplicate for now.

So X not in {C, E, N, M, P, T}? But T is already used, so if no duplicate, X != T.

Similarly, the first position: not in {C, E, N, M, P, T} and not R, A (but R and A are fixed, so we can't use them again? Unless duplicate, but again, no indication).

So first position: any letter except C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A? But R and A are in the word, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn't show duplicate, but it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid using R or A again because we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Similarly, for X, avoid R, A, T.

So for _ R A T X:

- Position 1: not C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A -> so B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.
- Position 5: X, same restrictions, and also not the same as position 1? Not necessarily, but we are avoiding duplicates for now.

Words:
- WRATH: W (position1), R, A, T, H (position5) -> H is not excluded.
- BRATS: B (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> S not excluded.
- GRATS: G (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> same as above but with G.
- DRATS: D (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> D and S allowed.
- FRATS: F (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> F allowed.

But note: in the feedback for guess2, we had T in ""tramp"" at position1 marked as present but wrong position. In BRATS, T is at position4, which is a different position, so that's consistent.

Similarly, for case 2: T in position5 -> word: _ R A Y T

Position4: Y, which must be a letter not excluded and not T (if no duplicate). And position1: same as above.

Words:
- DRAFT: D (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> F allowed.
- GRAFT: G (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> same.
- CRAFT: C excluded -> invalid.
- WRAFT: not a word.
- BRAFT: not a word.
- HAFT: not 5 letters.
- SHAFT: S, H, A, F, T -> but this is S H A F T, which would be position1=S, position2=H? But we need position2=R and position3=A. So not matching pattern.

The pattern is _ R A _ T, so position2 must be R and position3 must be A.

So DRAFT and GRAFT are the only common words I can think of for this case.

Now, we also have to consider that in the first case, we have words like WRATH, BRATS, etc.

But we need to make a guess that helps us distinguish.

We also know that T is present, so in our guess, we should include T in either position4 or position5, but we don't know which.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.

But we also have the first position to fill.

Let's list the letters we have not tried: from the alphabet, excluding C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T (R, A, T are in the word but we can use other letters).

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, and others.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test the presence of other common letters and also try to resolve the position of T.

But we know T is in the word, so we don't need to test for T again. We just need to find where it is and what the other letters are.

So we can choose a word that has the form _ R A _ _ with T in either position4 or position5, and a new letter in the other positions.

But we have to decide: if we put T in position4, then we can test a new letter in position5 and in position1.

Similarly, if we put T in position5, then we test a new letter in position4 and position1.

But we don't know which one is correct.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in position4 or 5? But we know T is in the word, so if we don't put T in position4 or 5, then we are putting it in position1? But we know T is not in position1, so we must put T in position4 or 5.

So we have to choose one of the two cases.

We can pick a word that fits one of the patterns and uses common letters.

For example, let's pick ""draft"" which is in the second pattern: _ R A _ T with D and F.

Or ""wrath"" in the first pattern: _ R A T H with W and H.

But we also have ""brats"": _ R A T S with B and S.

I think ""draft"" is a good choice because it tests D and F, which are common.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 and a vowel in position5? But we don't know.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the same pattern but with different letters to test more.

But we have three positions to fill: 1,4,5, but one of 4 or 5 is T.

So effectively, we have two new letters to find: the first letter and either the fourth or fifth (with the other being T).

In our guess, we can only test one scenario.

But we have to make a guess.

I think ""wrath"" is a good choice because it uses W and H, which are less common, but it's a valid word.

""brats"" is also common.

But let's consider that in the first guess, we had no S, and in the second guess, we had no S, so S is untested.

Similarly, D, F, G, H, etc.

I think we should go with ""draft"" because it tests two new consonants: D and F.

So I'll guess ""draft"".

But let's confirm: ""draft"" has D in position1, R in2, A in3, F in4, T in5.

This fits the pattern for case2.

If we are wrong, we get feedback that will help us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 to test that case.

But I think either is fine.

Another common word: ""grasp"" but we already tried ""tramp"" and M and P are out, and ""grasp"" has P which is excluded.

Not allowed.

""blast"": but L and S, but pattern is not _ R A _ _, because B-L-A-S-T, so position2 is L, not R. Invalid pattern.

So I think ""draft"" is a good choice.

But let's see if there is a word that has T in position4 and a common letter in position5.

For example, ""brats"" with S.

S is very common, so it might be good to test S.

Similarly, ""wrath"" with H.

H is less common.

So perhaps ""brats"" is better because S is more common.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

""brats"": B, R, A, T, S.

Excluded letters: C, E, N, M, P. None of these are in ""brats"", so it's valid.

Similarly, ""draft"": D, R, A, F, T -> no excluded letters.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""brats"" to test S.

So guess: ""brats""

But in ""brats"", T is in position4, which is case1.

Then we can see if T is in position4 or not.

If the feedback for ""brats"" shows T in correct position, then we know T is in position4. If not, then T must be in position5.

Similarly, we get information about B and S.

So let's do that.

<guess>brats</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(correct position), N(not in word), E(not in word). This means:
  - The word has R in position 2 and A in position 3 (so the pattern is `_ R A _ _`).
  - C, N, and E are absent from the word.
- **Guess 2: ""tramp""** → Feedback: T(in word but wrong position), R(correct position), A(correct position), M(not in word), P(not in word). This means:
  - R and A are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (consistent with Guess 1).
  - T is present in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
  - M and P are absent from the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is in the form `_ R A _ _`.
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, A, T.
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, E, N, M, P.
- T must be in position 4 or 5 (since it's not in position 1, and positions 2–3 are fixed).
- The first position must be a letter not yet tested (not C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T) to avoid duplicates unless necessary.
- The remaining position (4 or 5, depending on T) must also be a new letter not excluded.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of T by placing it in position 4 (since position 5 is also possible, but we need to resolve this uncertainty).
- Use new common letters for the first position and the open slot (position 5 if T is in 4, or position 4 if T is in 5) to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters (C, E, N, M, P) and confirmed letters in wrong positions (e.g., T cannot be in position 1).
- ""BRATS"" fits the pattern `_ R A _ _` with B in position 1, T in position 4, and S in position 5. This tests:
  - B as a possible first letter.
  - T in position 4 (if correct, it confirms T's position; if not, T must be in position 5).
  - S as a possible letter in position 5 (or elsewhere if misplaced).
- ""BRATS"" uses common letters and avoids all excluded letters.

<guess>brats</guess>",brats,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

So the word has the form: _ R A _ _

Guess 2: ""tramp"" -> Feedback: T(-), R(✓), A(✓), M(x), P(x)
This means:
- R and A are again confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (as we already knew).
- T is in the word but not in the first position (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and A).
- M and P are not in the word.

Additionally, we know from the first guess that C, N, E are not in the word, and now we also know M and P are not in the word.

So the word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- T is present, but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, T must be in position 4 or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, E, N, M, P.

We need to find a word that fits: _ R A _ _

And the letters we cannot use: C, E, N, M, P.

Also, we have T in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

Now, let's think of possible words.

The first position can be any letter except the ones we know are not in the word (C, E, N, M, P) and also we know T is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 cannot be T. So position 1 must be a letter we haven't tried yet.

Similarly, positions 4 and 5: one of them must be T (since T is present) and the other is a letter we haven't tried and not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, E, N, M, P.

We have tried the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.

So available letters: we can use any letter not in {C, E, N, M, P} and not R, A, T (but T is already in the word, so we can use it again? No, because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But note: T is already in the word, so if we put T in position 4 or 5, that's the same T. We don't need to avoid T in other positions because we know it's present, but we know it's not in position 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.

Now, what about the other position? It must be a letter not in the exclusion list and not T (if we are putting T in one of them, then the other is a different letter).

Possible patterns:

Option 1: Position 4 is T, then position 5 is some other letter (say X): so the word is _ R A T X

Option 2: Position 5 is T, then position 4 is some other letter (say Y): so the word is _ R A Y T

We need to fill the first position as well.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, option 1: _ R A T _

The first position must be a consonant or vowel that is not excluded and not T (since T is in position 4). Available letters: we have many, but common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.

But the word must be a valid English word.

Examples:
- GRATE: but E is excluded -> invalid.
- FRAT: not 5 letters.
- BRAT: not 5 letters.
- DRATS: not a common word? (DRAT is an interjection, but DRATS might be plural? but let's avoid rare words)
- WRATH: W, R, A, T, H -> W is allowed, H is allowed. And the word is common. Also, we haven't tried W or H.

But note: in WRATH, the T is in position 4, which is good. And H is new.

But we must check if H is allowed: yes, not excluded.

Another: CRAFT -> but C is excluded.

So WRATH is a candidate.

Another: BRATS -> but we have S, but BRATS is 5 letters? B-R-A-T-S. But in our pattern, if we put T in position 4, then the word would be _ R A T S. So BRATS: B in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. But we know from guess2 that P is not in the word, but S is new and allowed. However, in guess2 we had ""tramp"" and M and P are not in the word, but S is not excluded.

But wait, in the feedback for guess2, we have T marked as present but not in position 1. In BRATS, T is in position 4, which is consistent.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had no S, so we don't know about S.

However, BRATS uses S, which is not excluded.

But let's see option 2: _ R A _ T

The word ends with T.

Examples:
- GRANT: but N is excluded -> invalid.
- BRANT: N is excluded -> invalid.
- CRAPT: not a word, and C excluded.
- DRAPT: not common.
- FRACT: not 5 letters? F-R-A-C-T, but C excluded.
- WRAPT: W, R, A, P, T -> but P is excluded (from guess2: P(x)).

So WRAPT is invalid because P is excluded.

Another: TRAIT: but T is in position 1? We have _ R A _ T, so position 1 cannot be T because T is not in position 1 (from guess2, T is present but not in position 1). So TRAIT would have T in position 1 and 5? But we know T is not in position 1, so TRAIT is invalid for position 1.

What about CRAWL: but C excluded.

BRAWL: B, R, A, W, L -> but this is _ R A W L, so it doesn't end with T. And we need T in the word? Yes, because T is present.

In this pattern _ R A _ T, we have T at the end.

But we also need to have T in the word, which is satisfied.

But let's find words: 

- DRAFT: D, R, A, F, T -> F is allowed? Yes. And D is allowed. So DRAFT: positions 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=F, 5=T.

This fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

Similarly, GRAFT: G, R, A, F, T -> but F is the same, but G is new.

But GRAFT has G, which is allowed.

However, we have two candidates so far: WRATH (from option1) and DRAFT (from option2).

But note: in option1, WRATH has T in position 4, and in option2, DRAFT has T in position 5.

We also have to consider the first letter.

In WRATH: first letter W, which is new.

In DRAFT: first letter D, which is new.

But we also have to think about other possibilities.

What about S? We haven't tried S.

For example, in option1: _ R A T _ -> we can have BRATS, which is B-R-A-T-S.

Or we can have GRATS: G-R-A-T-S.

But GRATS is a word (meaning, in informal, gratuities).

But let's list all possibilities.

We know T must be in position 4 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 4 -> word: _ R A T X

X can be: any letter not excluded and not T (unless duplicate, but we don't know). But we don't have evidence of duplicate, so let's assume no duplicate for now.

So X not in {C, E, N, M, P, T}? But T is already used, so if no duplicate, X != T.

Similarly, the first position: not in {C, E, N, M, P, T} and not R, A (but R and A are fixed, so we can't use them again? Unless duplicate, but again, no indication).

So first position: any letter except C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A? But R and A are in the word, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn't show duplicate, but it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid using R or A again because we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Similarly, for X, avoid R, A, T.

So for _ R A T X:

- Position 1: not C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A -> so B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.
- Position 5: X, same restrictions, and also not the same as position 1? Not necessarily, but we are avoiding duplicates for now.

Words:
- WRATH: W (position1), R, A, T, H (position5) -> H is not excluded.
- BRATS: B (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> S not excluded.
- GRATS: G (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> same as above but with G.
- DRATS: D (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> D and S allowed.
- FRATS: F (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> F allowed.

But note: in the feedback for guess2, we had T in ""tramp"" at position1 marked as present but wrong position. In BRATS, T is at position4, which is a different position, so that's consistent.

Similarly, for case 2: T in position5 -> word: _ R A Y T

Position4: Y, which must be a letter not excluded and not T (if no duplicate). And position1: same as above.

Words:
- DRAFT: D (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> F allowed.
- GRAFT: G (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> same.
- CRAFT: C excluded -> invalid.
- WRAFT: not a word.
- BRAFT: not a word.
- HAFT: not 5 letters.
- SHAFT: S, H, A, F, T -> but this is S H A F T, which would be position1=S, position2=H? But we need position2=R and position3=A. So not matching pattern.

The pattern is _ R A _ T, so position2 must be R and position3 must be A.

So DRAFT and GRAFT are the only common words I can think of for this case.

Now, we also have to consider that in the first case, we have words like WRATH, BRATS, etc.

But we need to make a guess that helps us distinguish.

We also know that T is present, so in our guess, we should include T in either position4 or position5, but we don't know which.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.

But we also have the first position to fill.

Let's list the letters we have not tried: from the alphabet, excluding C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T (R, A, T are in the word but we can use other letters).

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, and others.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test the presence of other common letters and also try to resolve the position of T.

But we know T is in the word, so we don't need to test for T again. We just need to find where it is and what the other letters are.

So we can choose a word that has the form _ R A _ _ with T in either position4 or position5, and a new letter in the other positions.

But we have to decide: if we put T in position4, then we can test a new letter in position5 and in position1.

Similarly, if we put T in position5, then we test a new letter in position4 and position1.

But we don't know which one is correct.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in position4 or 5? But we know T is in the word, so if we don't put T in position4 or 5, then we are putting it in position1? But we know T is not in position1, so we must put T in position4 or 5.

So we have to choose one of the two cases.

We can pick a word that fits one of the patterns and uses common letters.

For example, let's pick ""draft"" which is in the second pattern: _ R A _ T with D and F.

Or ""wrath"" in the first pattern: _ R A T H with W and H.

But we also have ""brats"": _ R A T S with B and S.

I think ""draft"" is a good choice because it tests D and F, which are common.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 and a vowel in position5? But we don't know.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the same pattern but with different letters to test more.

But we have three positions to fill: 1,4,5, but one of 4 or 5 is T.

So effectively, we have two new letters to find: the first letter and either the fourth or fifth (with the other being T).

In our guess, we can only test one scenario.

But we have to make a guess.

I think ""wrath"" is a good choice because it uses W and H, which are less common, but it's a valid word.

""brats"" is also common.

But let's consider that in the first guess, we had no S, and in the second guess, we had no S, so S is untested.

Similarly, D, F, G, H, etc.

I think we should go with ""draft"" because it tests two new consonants: D and F.

So I'll guess ""draft"".

But let's confirm: ""draft"" has D in position1, R in2, A in3, F in4, T in5.

This fits the pattern for case2.

If we are wrong, we get feedback that will help us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 to test that case.

But I think either is fine.

Another common word: ""grasp"" but we already tried ""tramp"" and M and P are out, and ""grasp"" has P which is excluded.

Not allowed.

""blast"": but L and S, but pattern is not _ R A _ _, because B-L-A-S-T, so position2 is L, not R. Invalid pattern.

So I think ""draft"" is a good choice.

But let's see if there is a word that has T in position4 and a common letter in position5.

For example, ""brats"" with S.

S is very common, so it might be good to test S.

Similarly, ""wrath"" with H.

H is less common.

So perhaps ""brats"" is better because S is more common.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

""brats"": B, R, A, T, S.

Excluded letters: C, E, N, M, P. None of these are in ""brats"", so it's valid.

Similarly, ""draft"": D, R, A, F, T -> no excluded letters.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""brats"" to test S.

So guess: ""brats""

But in ""brats"", T is in position4, which is case1.

Then we can see if T is in position4 or not.

If the feedback for ""brats"" shows T in correct position, then we know T is in position4. If not, then T must be in position5.

Similarly, we get information about B and S.

So let's do that.

<guess>brats</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(correct position), N(not in word), E(not in word). This means:
  - The word has R in position 2 and A in position 3 (so the pattern is `_ R A _ _`).
  - C, N, and E are absent from the word.
- **Guess 2: ""tramp""** → Feedback: T(in word but wrong position), R(correct position), A(correct position), M(not in word), P(not in word). This means:
  - R and A are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (consistent with Guess 1).
  - T is present in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
  - M and P are absent from the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is in the form `_ R A _ _`.
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, A, T.
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, E, N, M, P.
- T must be in position 4 or 5 (since it's not in position 1, and positions 2–3 are fixed).
- The first position must be a letter not yet tested (not C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T) to avoid duplicates unless necessary.
- The remaining position (4 or 5, depending on T) must also be a new letter not excluded.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of T by placing it in position 4 (since position 5 is also possible, but we need to resolve this uncertainty).
- Use new common letters for the first position and the open slot (position 5 if T is in 4, or position 4 if T is in 5) to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters (C, E, N, M, P) and confirmed letters in wrong positions (e.g., T cannot be in position 1).
- ""BRATS"" fits the pattern `_ R A _ _` with B in position 1, T in position 4, and S in position 5. This tests:
  - B as a possible first letter.
  - T in position 4 (if correct, it confirms T's position; if not, T must be in position 5).
  - S as a possible letter in position 5 (or elsewhere if misplaced).
- ""BRATS"" uses common letters and avoids all excluded letters.",Guess 3: brats -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,DRAFT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The second letter is R and the third letter is A. So the word has the form _ R A _ _
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position and A in the third position.
- Avoids the letters C, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to test for the remaining positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits _ R A _ _

Possible words that come to mind:
- TRACK: but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also K is new.
- TRAMP: T is new, R is fixed, A is fixed, M is new, P is new. But we have to avoid C, N, E. T, M, P are allowed.
- GRASP: G is new, R, A, S is new, P is new. Avoids C, N, E.
- DRAIN: D is new, R, A, I is new, N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.
- BRAID: B is new, R, A, I, D. Avoids C, N, E.

But note: we have two positions to fill: first and last two (since the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5; we have 2,3 fixed as R and A; so positions 1,4,5 are unknown).

We also know that the word does not contain C, N, E.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R A _ _

Some options:
- TRADE: T, R, A, D, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So invalid.
- GRACE: G, R, A, C, E -> C and E are not allowed. Invalid.
- BRASH: B, R, A, S, H -> avoids C, N, E. So B, S, H are new.
- CRASH: but C is not allowed. Invalid.
- FRANK: F, R, A, N, K -> N is not allowed. Invalid.
- TRASH: T, R, A, S, H -> avoids C, N, E. So T, S, H are new.

We can also consider:
- DRAMA: D, R, A, M, A -> but we have two A's? The pattern is _ R A _ _, so the last two are M and A. Also, we don't know if A can be repeated? The rules don't say the word must have distinct letters, so it's possible. But we have to check: the feedback for ""crane"" didn't have any duplicate letters so we don't know. However, we know A is in the third position and we have an A at the end? That might be acceptable.

But let's stick to words without known bad letters.

Another idea: ""TRAMP"" as I thought earlier: T, R, A, M, P -> all new letters and avoids C, N, E.

Similarly, ""GRASP"": G, R, A, S, P -> avoids C, N, E.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""TRAMP"", we test T, M, P. In ""GRASP"", we test G, S, P.

Alternatively, we can try to include a vowel in the first position to get more information. For example, ""ORATE"" but E is not allowed. ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E -> E is not allowed.

""BRAVE"": B, R, A, V, E -> E is not allowed.

""BRAWL"": B, R, A, W, L -> avoids C, N, E. So B, W, L are new.

""BRASS"": B, R, A, S, S -> has two S's. We don't know if S is in the word, but we can test it.

But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try to cover more common letters.

I think ""TRAMP"" is a good choice because it uses T, M, P which are common and we haven't tested them.

Another common word: ""STAMP"" but that doesn't have R in the second position and A in the third. We must have R in second and A in third.

So the word must be of the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]

We can also consider ""DRAWL"": D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C, N, E.

But let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, N, E:

- BRASS: B, R, A, S, S -> tests B and S (and double S might be an issue, but it's valid)
- GRASS: G, R, A, S, S -> same as above
- TRASS: not a common word? (I think it's not very common)
- PRASE: but E is not allowed.
- FRATS: F, R, A, T, S -> avoids C, N, E. But is it a word? (FRAT is a root, but FRATS? plural of FRAT? maybe, but let's stick to common words)
- BRATS: B, R, A, T, S -> common word, meaning children. Avoids C, N, E.

So ""BRATS"" is a possibility.

But I think ""TRAMP"" is a solid choice because it tests three new common consonants: T, M, P.

Alternatively, ""GRASP"" tests G, S, P.

I'll go with ""TRAMP"" for the second guess.

So the guess is ""TRAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the word.
- R is in the correct second position.
- A is in the correct third position.

The secret word must be of the form _ R A _ _, and it cannot contain C, N, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""tramp"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ R A _ _ (with T in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, M in 4, P in 5).
- It avoids the excluded letters C, N, E.
- It tests new common consonants (T, M, P) to gather more information about the remaining positions.

<guess>tramp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tramp -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

So the word has the form: _ R A _ _

Guess 2: ""tramp"" -> Feedback: T(-), R(✓), A(✓), M(x), P(x)
This means:
- R and A are again confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (as we already knew).
- T is in the word but not in the first position (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and A).
- M and P are not in the word.

Additionally, we know from the first guess that C, N, E are not in the word, and now we also know M and P are not in the word.

So the word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- T is present, but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, T must be in position 4 or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, E, N, M, P.

We need to find a word that fits: _ R A _ _

And the letters we cannot use: C, E, N, M, P.

Also, we have T in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

Now, let's think of possible words.

The first position can be any letter except the ones we know are not in the word (C, E, N, M, P) and also we know T is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 cannot be T. So position 1 must be a letter we haven't tried yet.

Similarly, positions 4 and 5: one of them must be T (since T is present) and the other is a letter we haven't tried and not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, E, N, M, P.

We have tried the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.

So available letters: we can use any letter not in {C, E, N, M, P} and not R, A, T (but T is already in the word, so we can use it again? No, because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But in the feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But note: T is already in the word, so if we put T in position 4 or 5, that's the same T. We don't need to avoid T in other positions because we know it's present, but we know it's not in position 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.

Now, what about the other position? It must be a letter not in the exclusion list and not T (if we are putting T in one of them, then the other is a different letter).

Possible patterns:

Option 1: Position 4 is T, then position 5 is some other letter (say X): so the word is _ R A T X

Option 2: Position 5 is T, then position 4 is some other letter (say Y): so the word is _ R A Y T

We need to fill the first position as well.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, option 1: _ R A T _

The first position must be a consonant or vowel that is not excluded and not T (since T is in position 4). Available letters: we have many, but common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.

But the word must be a valid English word.

Examples:
- GRATE: but E is excluded -> invalid.
- FRAT: not 5 letters.
- BRAT: not 5 letters.
- DRATS: not a common word? (DRAT is an interjection, but DRATS might be plural? but let's avoid rare words)
- WRATH: W, R, A, T, H -> W is allowed, H is allowed. And the word is common. Also, we haven't tried W or H.

But note: in WRATH, the T is in position 4, which is good. And H is new.

But we must check if H is allowed: yes, not excluded.

Another: CRAFT -> but C is excluded.

So WRATH is a candidate.

Another: BRATS -> but we have S, but BRATS is 5 letters? B-R-A-T-S. But in our pattern, if we put T in position 4, then the word would be _ R A T S. So BRATS: B in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. But we know from guess2 that P is not in the word, but S is new and allowed. However, in guess2 we had ""tramp"" and M and P are not in the word, but S is not excluded.

But wait, in the feedback for guess2, we have T marked as present but not in position 1. In BRATS, T is in position 4, which is consistent.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had no S, so we don't know about S.

However, BRATS uses S, which is not excluded.

But let's see option 2: _ R A _ T

The word ends with T.

Examples:
- GRANT: but N is excluded -> invalid.
- BRANT: N is excluded -> invalid.
- CRAPT: not a word, and C excluded.
- DRAPT: not common.
- FRACT: not 5 letters? F-R-A-C-T, but C excluded.
- WRAPT: W, R, A, P, T -> but P is excluded (from guess2: P(x)).

So WRAPT is invalid because P is excluded.

Another: TRAIT: but T is in position 1? We have _ R A _ T, so position 1 cannot be T because T is not in position 1 (from guess2, T is present but not in position 1). So TRAIT would have T in position 1 and 5? But we know T is not in position 1, so TRAIT is invalid for position 1.

What about CRAWL: but C excluded.

BRAWL: B, R, A, W, L -> but this is _ R A W L, so it doesn't end with T. And we need T in the word? Yes, because T is present.

In this pattern _ R A _ T, we have T at the end.

But we also need to have T in the word, which is satisfied.

But let's find words: 

- DRAFT: D, R, A, F, T -> F is allowed? Yes. And D is allowed. So DRAFT: positions 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=F, 5=T.

This fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

Similarly, GRAFT: G, R, A, F, T -> but F is the same, but G is new.

But GRAFT has G, which is allowed.

However, we have two candidates so far: WRATH (from option1) and DRAFT (from option2).

But note: in option1, WRATH has T in position 4, and in option2, DRAFT has T in position 5.

We also have to consider the first letter.

In WRATH: first letter W, which is new.

In DRAFT: first letter D, which is new.

But we also have to think about other possibilities.

What about S? We haven't tried S.

For example, in option1: _ R A T _ -> we can have BRATS, which is B-R-A-T-S.

Or we can have GRATS: G-R-A-T-S.

But GRATS is a word (meaning, in informal, gratuities).

But let's list all possibilities.

We know T must be in position 4 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 4 -> word: _ R A T X

X can be: any letter not excluded and not T (unless duplicate, but we don't know). But we don't have evidence of duplicate, so let's assume no duplicate for now.

So X not in {C, E, N, M, P, T}? But T is already used, so if no duplicate, X != T.

Similarly, the first position: not in {C, E, N, M, P, T} and not R, A (but R and A are fixed, so we can't use them again? Unless duplicate, but again, no indication).

So first position: any letter except C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A? But R and A are in the word, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn't show duplicate, but it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid using R or A again because we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Similarly, for X, avoid R, A, T.

So for _ R A T X:

- Position 1: not C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A -> so B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.
- Position 5: X, same restrictions, and also not the same as position 1? Not necessarily, but we are avoiding duplicates for now.

Words:
- WRATH: W (position1), R, A, T, H (position5) -> H is not excluded.
- BRATS: B (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> S not excluded.
- GRATS: G (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> same as above but with G.
- DRATS: D (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> D and S allowed.
- FRATS: F (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> F allowed.

But note: in the feedback for guess2, we had T in ""tramp"" at position1 marked as present but wrong position. In BRATS, T is at position4, which is a different position, so that's consistent.

Similarly, for case 2: T in position5 -> word: _ R A Y T

Position4: Y, which must be a letter not excluded and not T (if no duplicate). And position1: same as above.

Words:
- DRAFT: D (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> F allowed.
- GRAFT: G (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> same.
- CRAFT: C excluded -> invalid.
- WRAFT: not a word.
- BRAFT: not a word.
- HAFT: not 5 letters.
- SHAFT: S, H, A, F, T -> but this is S H A F T, which would be position1=S, position2=H? But we need position2=R and position3=A. So not matching pattern.

The pattern is _ R A _ T, so position2 must be R and position3 must be A.

So DRAFT and GRAFT are the only common words I can think of for this case.

Now, we also have to consider that in the first case, we have words like WRATH, BRATS, etc.

But we need to make a guess that helps us distinguish.

We also know that T is present, so in our guess, we should include T in either position4 or position5, but we don't know which.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.

But we also have the first position to fill.

Let's list the letters we have not tried: from the alphabet, excluding C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T (R, A, T are in the word but we can use other letters).

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, and others.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test the presence of other common letters and also try to resolve the position of T.

But we know T is in the word, so we don't need to test for T again. We just need to find where it is and what the other letters are.

So we can choose a word that has the form _ R A _ _ with T in either position4 or position5, and a new letter in the other positions.

But we have to decide: if we put T in position4, then we can test a new letter in position5 and in position1.

Similarly, if we put T in position5, then we test a new letter in position4 and position1.

But we don't know which one is correct.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T in position4 or 5? But we know T is in the word, so if we don't put T in position4 or 5, then we are putting it in position1? But we know T is not in position1, so we must put T in position4 or 5.

So we have to choose one of the two cases.

We can pick a word that fits one of the patterns and uses common letters.

For example, let's pick ""draft"" which is in the second pattern: _ R A _ T with D and F.

Or ""wrath"" in the first pattern: _ R A T H with W and H.

But we also have ""brats"": _ R A T S with B and S.

I think ""draft"" is a good choice because it tests D and F, which are common.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 and a vowel in position5? But we don't know.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the same pattern but with different letters to test more.

But we have three positions to fill: 1,4,5, but one of 4 or 5 is T.

So effectively, we have two new letters to find: the first letter and either the fourth or fifth (with the other being T).

In our guess, we can only test one scenario.

But we have to make a guess.

I think ""wrath"" is a good choice because it uses W and H, which are less common, but it's a valid word.

""brats"" is also common.

But let's consider that in the first guess, we had no S, and in the second guess, we had no S, so S is untested.

Similarly, D, F, G, H, etc.

I think we should go with ""draft"" because it tests two new consonants: D and F.

So I'll guess ""draft"".

But let's confirm: ""draft"" has D in position1, R in2, A in3, F in4, T in5.

This fits the pattern for case2.

If we are wrong, we get feedback that will help us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 to test that case.

But I think either is fine.

Another common word: ""grasp"" but we already tried ""tramp"" and M and P are out, and ""grasp"" has P which is excluded.

Not allowed.

""blast"": but L and S, but pattern is not _ R A _ _, because B-L-A-S-T, so position2 is L, not R. Invalid pattern.

So I think ""draft"" is a good choice.

But let's see if there is a word that has T in position4 and a common letter in position5.

For example, ""brats"" with S.

S is very common, so it might be good to test S.

Similarly, ""wrath"" with H.

H is less common.

So perhaps ""brats"" is better because S is more common.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

""brats"": B, R, A, T, S.

Excluded letters: C, E, N, M, P. None of these are in ""brats"", so it's valid.

Similarly, ""draft"": D, R, A, F, T -> no excluded letters.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""brats"" to test S.

So guess: ""brats""

But in ""brats"", T is in position4, which is case1.

Then we can see if T is in position4 or not.

If the feedback for ""brats"" shows T in correct position, then we know T is in position4. If not, then T must be in position5.

Similarly, we get information about B and S.

So let's do that.

<guess>brats</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(correct position), N(not in word), E(not in word). This means:
  - The word has R in position 2 and A in position 3 (so the pattern is `_ R A _ _`).
  - C, N, and E are absent from the word.
- **Guess 2: ""tramp""** → Feedback: T(in word but wrong position), R(correct position), A(correct position), M(not in word), P(not in word). This means:
  - R and A are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (consistent with Guess 1).
  - T is present in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
  - M and P are absent from the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is in the form `_ R A _ _`.
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, A, T.
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, E, N, M, P.
- T must be in position 4 or 5 (since it's not in position 1, and positions 2–3 are fixed).
- The first position must be a letter not yet tested (not C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T) to avoid duplicates unless necessary.
- The remaining position (4 or 5, depending on T) must also be a new letter not excluded.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of T by placing it in position 4 (since position 5 is also possible, but we need to resolve this uncertainty).
- Use new common letters for the first position and the open slot (position 5 if T is in 4, or position 4 if T is in 5) to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters (C, E, N, M, P) and confirmed letters in wrong positions (e.g., T cannot be in position 1).
- ""BRATS"" fits the pattern `_ R A _ _` with B in position 1, T in position 4, and S in position 5. This tests:
  - B as a possible first letter.
  - T in position 4 (if correct, it confirms T's position; if not, T must be in position 5).
  - S as a possible letter in position 5 (or elsewhere if misplaced).
- ""BRATS"" uses common letters and avoids all excluded letters.

So position 1 must be a letter we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nSimilarly, positions 4 and 5: one of them must be T (since T is present) and the other is a letter we haven\'t tried and not in the exclusion list.\n\nExclusion list: C, E, N, M, P.\n\nWe have tried the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.\n\nSo available letters: we can use any letter not in {C, E, N, M, P} and not R, A, T (but T is already in the word, so we can use it again? No, because we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But in the feedback, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut note: T is already in the word, so if we put T in position 4 or 5, that\'s the same T. We don\'t need to avoid T in other positions because we know it\'s present, but we know it\'s not in position 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.\n\nNow, what about the other position? It must be a letter not in the exclusion list and not T (if we are putting T in one of them, then the other is a different letter).\n\nPossible patterns:\n\nOption 1: Position 4 is T, then position 5 is some other letter (say X): so the word is _ R A T X\n\nOption 2: Position 5 is T, then position 4 is some other letter (say Y): so the word is _ R A Y T\n\nWe need to fill the first position as well.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, option 1: _ R A T _\n\nThe first position must be a consonant or vowel that is not excluded and not T (since T is in position 4). Available letters: we have many, but common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut the word must be a valid English word.\n\nExamples:\n- GRATE: but E is excluded -> invalid.\n- FRAT: not 5 letters.\n- BRAT: not 5 letters.\n- DRATS: not a common word? (DRAT is an interjection, but DRATS might be plural? but let\'s avoid rare words)\n- WRATH: W, R, A, T, H -> W is allowed, H is allowed. And the word is common. Also, we haven\'t tried W or H.\n\nBut note: in WRATH, the T is in position 4, which is good. And H is new.\n\nBut we must check if H is allowed: yes, not excluded.\n\nAnother: CRAFT -> but C is excluded.\n\nSo WRATH is a candidate.\n\nAnother: BRATS -> but we have S, but BRATS is 5 letters? B-R-A-T-S. But in our pattern, if we put T in position 4, then the word would be _ R A T S. So BRATS: B in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. But we know from guess2 that P is not in the word, but S is new and allowed. However, in guess2 we had ""tramp"" and M and P are not in the word, but S is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, in the feedback for guess2, we have T marked as present but not in position 1. In BRATS, T is in position 4, which is consistent.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had no S, so we don\'t know about S.\n\nHowever, BRATS uses S, which is not excluded.\n\nBut let\'s see option 2: _ R A _ T\n\nThe word ends with T.\n\nExamples:\n- GRANT: but N is excluded -> invalid.\n- BRANT: N is excluded -> invalid.\n- CRAPT: not a word, and C excluded.\n- DRAPT: not common.\n- FRACT: not 5 letters? F-R-A-C-T, but C excluded.\n- WRAPT: W, R, A, P, T -> but P is excluded (from guess2: P(x)).\n\nSo WRAPT is invalid because P is excluded.\n\nAnother: TRAIT: but T is in position 1? We have _ R A _ T, so position 1 cannot be T because T is not in position 1 (from guess2, T is present but not in position 1). So TRAIT would have T in position 1 and 5? But we know T is not in position 1, so TRAIT is invalid for position 1.\n\nWhat about CRAWL: but C excluded.\n\nBRAWL: B, R, A, W, L -> but this is _ R A W L, so it doesn\'t end with T. And we need T in the word? Yes, because T is present.\n\nIn this pattern _ R A _ T, we have T at the end.\n\nBut we also need to have T in the word, which is satisfied.\n\nBut let\'s find words: \n\n- DRAFT: D, R, A, F, T -> F is allowed? Yes. And D is allowed. So DRAFT: positions 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=F, 5=T.\n\nThis fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, GRAFT: G, R, A, F, T -> but F is the same, but G is new.\n\nBut GRAFT has G, which is allowed.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates so far: WRATH (from option1) and DRAFT (from option2).\n\nBut note: in option1, WRATH has T in position 4, and in option2, DRAFT has T in position 5.\n\nWe also have to consider the first letter.\n\nIn WRATH: first letter W, which is new.\n\nIn DRAFT: first letter D, which is new.\n\nBut we also have to think about other possibilities.\n\nWhat about S? We haven\'t tried S.\n\nFor example, in option1: _ R A T _ -> we can have BRATS, which is B-R-A-T-S.\n\nOr we can have GRATS: G-R-A-T-S.\n\nBut GRATS is a word (meaning, in informal, gratuities).\n\nBut let\'s list all possibilities.\n\nWe know T must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nCase 1: T in position 4 -> word: _ R A T X\n\nX can be: any letter not excluded and not T (unless duplicate, but we don\'t know). But we don\'t have evidence of duplicate, so let\'s assume no duplicate for now.\n\nSo X not in {C, E, N, M, P, T}? But T is already used, so if no duplicate, X != T.\n\nSimilarly, the first position: not in {C, E, N, M, P, T} and not R, A (but R and A are fixed, so we can\'t use them again? Unless duplicate, but again, no indication).\n\nSo first position: any letter except C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A? But R and A are in the word, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicate, but it\'s possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid using R or A again because we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, for X, avoid R, A, T.\n\nSo for _ R A T X:\n\n- Position 1: not C, E, N, M, P, T, R, A -> so B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, etc.\n- Position 5: X, same restrictions, and also not the same as position 1? Not necessarily, but we are avoiding duplicates for now.\n\nWords:\n- WRATH: W (position1), R, A, T, H (position5) -> H is not excluded.\n- BRATS: B (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> S not excluded.\n- GRATS: G (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> same as above but with G.\n- DRATS: D (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> D and S allowed.\n- FRATS: F (1), R, A, T, S (5) -> F allowed.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for guess2, we had T in ""tramp"" at position1 marked as present but wrong position. In BRATS, T is at position4, which is a different position, so that\'s consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: T in position5 -> word: _ R A Y T\n\nPosition4: Y, which must be a letter not excluded and not T (if no duplicate). And position1: same as above.\n\nWords:\n- DRAFT: D (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> F allowed.\n- GRAFT: G (1), R, A, F (4), T (5) -> same.\n- CRAFT: C excluded -> invalid.\n- WRAFT: not a word.\n- BRAFT: not a word.\n- HAFT: not 5 letters.\n- SHAFT: S, H, A, F, T -> but this is S H A F T, which would be position1=S, position2=H? But we need position2=R and position3=A. So not matching pattern.\n\nThe pattern is _ R A _ T, so position2 must be R and position3 must be A.\n\nSo DRAFT and GRAFT are the only common words I can think of for this case.\n\nNow, we also have to consider that in the first case, we have words like WRATH, BRATS, etc.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that helps us distinguish.\n\nWe also know that T is present, so in our guess, we should include T in either position4 or position5, but we don\'t know which.\n\nAlternatively, we can make a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.\n\nBut we also have the first position to fill.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we have not tried: from the alphabet, excluding C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T (R, A, T are in the word but we can use other letters).\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P.\n\nSo available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, S, U, W, Y, and others.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test the presence of other common letters and also try to resolve the position of T.\n\nBut we know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to test for T again. We just need to find where it is and what the other letters are.\n\nSo we can choose a word that has the form _ R A _ _ with T in either position4 or position5, and a new letter in the other positions.\n\nBut we have to decide: if we put T in position4, then we can test a new letter in position5 and in position1.\n\nSimilarly, if we put T in position5, then we test a new letter in position4 and position1.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T in position4 or 5? But we know T is in the word, so if we don\'t put T in position4 or 5, then we are putting it in position1? But we know T is not in position1, so we must put T in position4 or 5.\n\nSo we have to choose one of the two cases.\n\nWe can pick a word that fits one of the patterns and uses common letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s pick ""draft"" which is in the second pattern: _ R A _ T with D and F.\n\nOr ""wrath"" in the first pattern: _ R A T H with W and H.\n\nBut we also have ""brats"": _ R A T S with B and S.\n\nI think ""draft"" is a good choice because it tests D and F, which are common.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 and a vowel in position5? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has the same pattern but with different letters to test more.\n\nBut we have three positions to fill: 1,4,5, but one of 4 or 5 is T.\n\nSo effectively, we have two new letters to find: the first letter and either the fourth or fifth (with the other being T).\n\nIn our guess, we can only test one scenario.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nI think ""wrath"" is a good choice because it uses W and H, which are less common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\n""brats"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s consider that in the first guess, we had no S, and in the second guess, we had no S, so S is untested.\n\nSimilarly, D, F, G, H, etc.\n\nI think we should go with ""draft"" because it tests two new consonants: D and F.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""draft"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""draft"" has D in position1, R in2, A in3, F in4, T in5.\n\nThis fits the pattern for case2.\n\nIf we are wrong, we get feedback that will help us.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position4 to test that case.\n\nBut I think either is fine.\n\nAnother common word: ""grasp"" but we already tried ""tramp"" and M and P are out, and ""grasp"" has P which is excluded.\n\nNot allowed.\n\n""blast"": but L and S, but pattern is not _ R A _ _, because B-L-A-S-T, so position2 is L, not R. Invalid pattern.\n\nSo I think ""draft"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that has T in position4 and a common letter in position5.\n\nFor example, ""brats"" with S.\n\nS is very common, so it might be good to test S.\n\nSimilarly, ""wrath"" with H.\n\nH is less common.\n\nSo perhaps ""brats"" is better because S is more common.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\n""brats"": B, R, A, T, S.\n\nExcluded letters: C, E, N, M, P. None of these are in ""brats"", so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""draft"": D, R, A, F, T -> no excluded letters.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""brats"" to test S.\n\nSo guess: ""brats""\n\nBut in ""brats"", T is in position4, which is case1.\n\nThen we can see if T is in position4 or not.\n\nIf the feedback for ""brats"" shows T in correct position, then we know T is in position4. If not, then T must be in position5.\n\nSimilarly, we get information about B and S.\n\nSo let\'s do that.\n\n<guess>brats</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(correct position), N(not in word), E(not in word). This means:\n  - The word has R in position 2 and A in position 3 (so the pattern is `_ R A _ _`).\n  - C, N, and E are absent from the word.\n- **Guess 2: ""tramp""** → Feedback: T(in word but wrong position), R(correct position), A(correct position), M(not in word), P(not in word). This means:\n  - R and A are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (consistent with Guess 1).\n  - T is present in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).\n  - M and P are absent from the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word is in the form `_ R A _ _`.\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, A, T.\n- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, E, N, M, P.\n- T must be in position 4 or 5 (since it\'s not in position 1, and positions 2–3 are fixed).\n- The first position must be a letter not yet tested (not C, E, N, M, P, R, A, T) to avoid duplicates unless necessary.\n- The remaining position (4 or 5, depending on T) must also be a new letter not excluded.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test the position of T by placing it in position 4 (since position 5 is also possible, but we need to resolve this uncertainty).\n- Use new common letters for the first position and the open slot (position 5 if T is in 4, or position 4 if T is in 5) to maximize information.\n- Avoid excluded letters (C, E, N, M, P) and confirmed letters in wrong positions (e.g., T cannot be in position 1).\n- ""BRATS"" fits the pattern `_ R A _ _` with B in position 1, T in position 4, and S in position 5. This tests:\n  - B as a possible first letter.\n  - T in position 4 (if correct, it confirms T\'s position; if not, T must be in position 5).\n  - S as a possible letter in position 5 (or elsewhere if misplaced).\n- ""BRATS"" uses common letters and avoids all excluded letters.\n\n<guess>brats</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: tramp -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: brats -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(correct position), N(not in word), E(not in word). 
- So the word has R in position 2 and A in position 3. Pattern: _ R A _ _
- C, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""tramp"" → Feedback: T(in word but wrong position), R(correct position), A(correct position), M(not in word), P(not in word).
- Confirms R and A in positions 2 and 3.
- T is present but not in position 1. So T must be in position 4 or 5.
- M and P are absent.

Guess 3: ""brats"" → Feedback: B(not in word), R(correct position), A(correct position), T(in word but wrong position), S(not in word).
- B is not in the word.
- R and A are correct in positions 2 and 3.
- T is present but not in position 4 (because in ""brats"", T is in position 4, and the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, meaning position 4 is incorrect for T).
- S is not in the word.

Now, combining all:

- The word is _ R A _ _
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (from guess2) and not in position 4 (from guess3). Therefore, T must be in position 5 (the only remaining position).
- So the word is _ R A _ T

Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, E, N, M, P, B, S.

We have tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, M, P, B, S.

Absent letters: C, E, N, M, P, B, S.

Present letters: R, A, T (with R in pos2, A in pos3, T in pos5).

We need to find the first letter and the fourth letter.

The first letter must be a letter not in the absent list and not R, A, T (since we don't have duplicates indicated, we avoid them for now).

Similarly, the fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list and not R, A, T.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y, etc. (any letter not in {C, E, N, M, P, B, S, R, A, T}).

The word pattern is: [letter1] R A [letter4] T

We need to find a valid English word that fits.

Possible words:

- DRAFT: D in pos1, R, A, F in pos4, T -> F is available? Yes, not excluded. D is available.
- GRAFT: G in pos1, R, A, F in pos4, T -> G and F available.
- CRAFT: C is excluded -> invalid.
- WRAPT: P is excluded -> invalid.
- HAFT: not 5 letters.

Other possibilities:

- DRAWT: not a common word? (DRAW is 4 letters, DRAWN is 5 but ends with N, excluded).
- BRAWT: not a word.
- FRAWT: not a word.

What about ""GRANT""? But N is excluded.

""PRATT"": P excluded.

""WRATH"": but in WRATH, the T is in position 5? W-R-A-T-H, so position 4 is T and position 5 is H. But we have the pattern _ R A _ T, so position 5 must be T. In WRATH, position 5 is H, not T. So it doesn't fit.

We need the word to end with T.

Another word: ""DROIT""? D-R-O-I-T -> but position 3 is O, not A. We need position 3 to be A.

So the word must have A in position 3.

So back to ""DRAFT"" and ""GRAFT"".

Also, ""CRAWL"" but C excluded and ends with L, not T.

""TRAIT"": but T in position 1 is not allowed (we know T is not in position 1) and also has two T's? But in ""TRAIT"", position 1 is T (invalid) and position 5 is T, but we don't know about duplicates. However, position 1 cannot be T.

""FRAUD"": F-R-A-U-D -> ends with D, not T.

""GRAVY"": G-R-A-V-Y -> ends with Y, not T.

""BRAVO"": B is excluded.

So the only common words I can think of are ""DRAFT"" and ""GRAFT"".

We can also consider ""KRAFT"", but K is allowed? Yes, not excluded. ""KRAFT"" is a word (as in kraft paper).

Similarly, ""DRAFT"" and ""GRAFT"" are the main ones.

Now, we need to choose between these.

We haven't tried D, F, G, K, etc.

Since we have two options, we can guess one of them.

But note: in ""DRAFT"", the fourth letter is F, and in ""GRAFT"", it is also F? No, both have F in position 4? 

DRAFT: D-R-A-F-T
GRAFT: G-R-A-F-T

So both have F in position 4.

The only difference is the first letter: D or G.

We also have ""KRAFT"": K-R-A-F-T, which is also valid.

So possible words: DRAFT, GRAFT, KRAFT.

We need to test one of them.

We can choose ""draft"" as it is a common word.

But let's see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests other letters, but we have to fit the pattern _ R A _ T.

And we know the fourth letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but in the examples, it is.

What about ""TRAIT""? But position 1 is T, which is not allowed.

""BEAUT"": not a word.

So I think DRAFT, GRAFT, KRAFT are the candidates.

We can guess ""draft"".

But note: we haven't tried F yet, so if we guess ""draft"", we test D and F.

If it's not correct, we still have G and K as possibilities.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

We can also consider if there are words with a vowel in position 4? For example, ""GRAVY"" but doesn't end with T.

""GRATE"": but E is excluded.

""GRANT"": N excluded.

So no.

Another word: ""DWAIT""? Not a word.

I think we have to go with one of the F words.

But let's list all 5-letter words ending with T, with R in position 2 and A in position 3.

From common vocabulary:

- draft
- graft
- kraft
- wrath? But wrath is W-R-A-T-H, so not ending with T.

""WRATH"" ends with H.

""BRUNT"": but position 3 is U, not A.

So only draft, graft, kraft.

We can also consider ""CRAST"" but not a word.

So I'll go with ""draft"".

But in the feedback for guess3, we had T marked as present but wrong position. In ""draft"", T is in position 5, which is a new position, so it might be correct.

Similarly, in ""brats"", T was in position 4 and was wrong, so position 5 is the only possibility left.

So the word must end with T.

Therefore, we can guess ""draft"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with a different fourth letter.

For example, ""DRAWL"" ends with L, not T.

""TRAIL"" has T in position 1, invalid.

So I think draft, graft, kraft are the options.

We'll guess ""draft"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)`  
   - **R** is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
   - **A** is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
   - **C, N, E** are not in the word.  
   - **Pattern deduced**: The secret word is `_ R A _ _`.

2. **Guess 2: ""tramp""** → Feedback: `T(-) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)`  
   - **R** and **A** are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (consistent with Guess 1).  
   - **T** is in the word but **not in position 1** (so it must be in position 4 or 5).  
   - **M** and **P** are not in the word.  
   - **New exclusions**: M, P added to absent letters (C, E, N already excluded).

3. **Guess 3: ""brats""** → Feedback: `B(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) S(x)`  
   - **R** and **A** are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (consistent).  
   - **T** is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was placed in position 4 here and marked wrong).  
   - **B** and **S** are not in the word.  
   - **New exclusions**: B, S added to absent letters.  
   - **Key deduction**: Since T cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 2) or position 4 (from this guess), **T must be in position 5**. The pattern is now `_ R A _ T`.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1] R A [letter4] T`  
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - **R** (position 2), **A** (position 3), **T** (position 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, M, P, B, S (cannot be in the word).  
- **Untested letters**: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y, etc. (available for positions 1 and 4).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Position 1 must be a letter not in the absent list and not R, A, T (no duplicates indicated).  
  - Position 4 must be a letter not in the absent list and not R, A, T.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The word must end with **T** (position 5), and position 4 is the only remaining unknown.  
- Common words fitting `_ R A _ T` include **DRAFT** (D in pos1, F in pos4), **GRAFT** (G in pos1, F in pos4), and **KRAFT** (K in pos1, F in pos4).  
- **DRAFT** is chosen because:  
  - It tests **D** (position 1) and **F** (position 4), both common letters not yet tried.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on D and F will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., GRAFT or KRAFT).  
- Avoids all excluded letters and fits the deduced pattern.
