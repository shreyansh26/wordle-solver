We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. Common strategies include starting with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants. A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but since we are allowed any valid English word, let's pick one that uses five distinct letters and covers common letters.

I'll pick ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help us test several vowels and common consonants at once.

So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, the secret word has:
- An 'E' in the last position (5th letter).
- The letter 'I' is present, but not in the 3rd position (since it was guessed there and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at that spot).
- The letters R, A, S are absent.

We know the word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E

The letter 'I' is somewhere else. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is wrong).

For the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of 'I' and also test other common letters.

We should avoid using R, A, S since they are not in the word.

We know E is at the end, so let's choose a word that:
- Ends with E (to keep that known position)
- Has the letter 'I' in a different position (1, 2, or 4)
- Uses new letters to test for more information.

Possible words: ""ALIKE"", but A is eliminated (feedback said A is not in the word). So avoid A.

Other words: ""OXIDE"", ""UNTIE"", ""UTILE"", etc.

But we need to use letters that haven't been tested. We haven't tested many consonants yet. Also, we know that the word must contain 'I' and 'E'.

Let me think of words ending with E and having I.

Consider the letters we haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants: T, N, L, etc.

Word possibilities:
- ""TITLE"": has T and L, ends with E, but two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, I is in the second position? But we have to test I in new positions.

""TITLE"": positions: T (1), I (2), T (3) — wait, double T? The feedback rules don't specify about repeated letters. But the secret word might have duplicates? However, in the example given (BRISK) there were no duplicates, but we can't assume.

In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but we have to handle them carefully. However, the feedback given for ""raise"" didn't have duplicates, so let's stick to words without duplicates for simplicity unless necessary.

We haven't tested T, L. Also, I would be in position 2.

Another option: ""QUITE"" — but Q is uncommon, and we have U, I, T, E. But we have E at the end, and I in position 4? Quite: Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). But in our feedback, I was marked wrong in position 3? But now we are putting I at position 3? Wait, in ""raise"" I was position 3 and got ""-"" meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put I at position 3 in the new guess? Actually, we can, because we don't know if the word has multiple I's? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple I's, so probably it's safe to assume one I for now? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, it might be better to put I in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 3 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

Another idea: ""SLIME"" — but S is eliminated (from feedback), so cannot use S.

Avoid letters R, A, S.

Word: ""GUISE"" — G(1), U(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). But we have I at position 3 again — but position 3 was tried and not correct, and S is eliminated, so bad.

We need a word without A, R, S.

Try ""WHILE"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But again, I is at position 3, which we know is not correct for I? We shouldn't put I at position 3 again because the feedback said I is in the word but not at position 3. Putting I at the same position again might not yield new information. We should try I at a different position.

What about ""DEBIT""? D(1), E(2) — but then E is not at the end? We know E is at the end, so the word must be _ _ _ _ E. So we cannot have E in position 2.

The word must end with E.

So, words like: ""BIBLE"" — but B and B, and E at end. But I at position 4? B(1), I(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). So I at position 2? We haven't tried position 2.

Another word: ""UTILE"" — U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). Again, I at 3 which we know is wrong? Or we can use it to test? But we know I isn't at 3, so putting it at 3 again might waste a chance to test another position.

To maximize information, let's put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Position 1: ""IGLOO"" — but O and O? And no E at end. Must be 5 letters and end in E.

""I"" at position 1 and end with E: isn't common? Words like ""IMAGE"" — but A is eliminated. ""INANE"" — N's? But A is eliminated. ""INCLE"" not a word. ""INDEX"" — D, E, but E at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""INDEX"" has E? No: I-N-D-E-X, so E at position 4? Not position 5. Must be 5th position E.

So, words with I at position 1: Not many common words? ""ISSUE"" — but S is eliminated. ""IMPEL"" — but may not be common? Let's think.

Position 2: Words like ""WHILE"" — W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But I at 3? We tried I at position 3 in ""raise"" and it was marked ""-"" meaning wrong position. In ""WHILE"", I is at position 3 again — that's the same position, so we won't get new info about position. If the word has only one I, we know position 3 is wrong for I, so putting I again at position 3 in a new word won't help.

Therefore, for more information, put I at a new position: either 1, 2, or 4.

Available positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4: Words like ""UNTIE"" — U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). This has U, N, T, I, E. And E at end. I at position 4.

Similarly, ""MOVIE"" — M(1), O(2), V(3), I(4), E(5).

""TULIP"" — but doesn't end with E.

""UNTIE"" seems good: ends with E, has I at position 4, uses new letters U, N, T.

We have not tested U, N, T — all common letters.

So, ""UNTIE"" can test:
- U in position 1
- N in position 2
- T in position 3
- I in position 4 (which we hope might be correct? or get info)
- E at position 5 (already known)

Also, we know the word has one I, and here we put it at 4. If we get ✓ for I, then it's correct. If -, then I is elsewhere. If x, but we know I is in the word, so x would not happen? Since we know I is in the word, only ✓ or - possible.

Similarly, T, U, N: we might get feedback.

So, let's choose ""UNTIE"".

But note: the word ""UNTIE"" means unfasten, valid word.

Alternatively, ""UTILE"" — U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But then I at position 3 which we already know is wrong? So putting I at 3 might not be productive. Feedback: I at position 3 was marked ""-"" in the first guess, meaning it's in the word but not at position 3. If we put I at position 3 again, what can we learn? 
- If we get ✓, it would contradict previous feedback? 
- But we won't get ✓ because we know it's not at position 3. 
- We might get ""-"" again, meaning it's still not at position 3 and present? 
- Or if we get ""x"", but that can't happen because we know I is in the word. 
So, no new information. Avoid repeating positions for letters known to be misplaced unless necessary.

Therefore, better to put I at a new position: here position 4.

Other option: position 2 — ""OPINE""? P and I at 3? ""OPINE"" has I at position 3 again? Let's count: O-P-I-N-E, so I at 3. Same problem.

Position 2: ""QUITE"" — Q-U-I-T-E: I at 3? Position: U is 2, I is 3? No.

Words with I at position 2: ""TIGER"" — but ends with R, not E? Can't use.

""WHILE"" I at 3? Hard to find.

""MINCE"" — M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So I at position 2? That's new.

""MINCE"" is a word: meaning chop finely.

We can use ""MINCE"": 
- M in position 1
- I in position 2
- N in position 3
- C in position 4
- E in position 5

But note, position 3 for I was tried and wrong, now position 2 for I — that's a new position.

Similarly, ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4.

Both ""MINCE"" and ""UNTIE"" are good.

I'd go with either.

Also, ""CHIVE"" — but H? And V.

""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T — all common.

Let me decide: ""UNTIE"" because we can test three new consonants: U, N, T.

But U is a vowel? Still, T and N are common consonants.

Both are valid.

I'll pick ""UNTIE"".

So, next guess: ""UNTIE""

Then, we'll see feedback.

But note: E is known to be correct at position 5, so in the new guess, E at position 5 is fixed. We don't test E again? But it's already known.

In the feedback, for E at position 5, we should still get a ✓ because it's correct? In the response, it will show.

So, I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

If we get lucky with I at position 4 being correct.

We are testing new letters: U, N, T.

So, let's guess ""UNTIE"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S are **absent** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- I is **present** but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").
- E is **correct** and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word ends with E: `_ _ _ _ E`.
- I must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is invalid).
- Avoid using letters R, A, S, as they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Goal: Test new letters and check the position of I (ideally in a new position like 1, 2, or 4).
- Since E is fixed in position 5, choose a word ending with E and containing I in a different position than 3.
- Leverage common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) for information gain.

Selected word: **UNTIE**  
- U in position 1 (untested letter).  
- N in position 2 (untested letter).  
- T in position 3 (untested letter).  
- I in position 4 (testing a new position for I).  
- E in position 5 (known correct position).  

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (U, N, T) and checks I at position 4 while maintaining the fixed E at the end.

So, let's guess ""UNTIE"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S are **absent** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- I is **present** but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").
- E is **correct** and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word ends with E: `_ _ _ _ E`.
- I must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is invalid).
- Avoid using letters R, A, S, as they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Goal: Test new letters and check the position of I (ideally in a new position like 1, 2, or 4).
- Since E is fixed in position 5, choose a word ending with E and containing I in a different position than 3.
- Leverage common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) for information gain.

Selected word: **UNTIE**  
- U in position 1 (untested letter).  
- N in position 2 (untested letter).  
- T in position 3 (untested letter).  
- I in position 4 (testing a new position for I).  
- E in position 5 (known correct position).  

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (U, N, T) and checks I at position 4 while maintaining the fixed E at the end.",Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,midge,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. Common strategies include starting with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants. A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but since we are allowed any valid English word, let's pick one that uses five distinct letters and covers common letters.

I'll pick ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help us test several vowels and common consonants at once.

So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, the secret word has:
- An 'E' in the last position (5th letter).
- The letter 'I' is present, but not in the 3rd position (since it was guessed there and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at that spot).
- The letters R, A, S are absent.

We know the word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E

The letter 'I' is somewhere else. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is wrong).

For the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of 'I' and also test other common letters.

We should avoid using R, A, S since they are not in the word.

We know E is at the end, so let's choose a word that:
- Ends with E (to keep that known position)
- Has the letter 'I' in a different position (1, 2, or 4)
- Uses new letters to test for more information.

Possible words: ""ALIKE"", but A is eliminated (feedback said A is not in the word). So avoid A.

Other words: ""OXIDE"", ""UNTIE"", ""UTILE"", etc.

But we need to use letters that haven't been tested. We haven't tested many consonants yet. Also, we know that the word must contain 'I' and 'E'.

Let me think of words ending with E and having I.

Consider the letters we haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants: T, N, L, etc.

Word possibilities:
- ""TITLE"": has T and L, ends with E, but two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, I is in the second position? But we have to test I in new positions.

""TITLE"": positions: T (1), I (2), T (3) — wait, double T? The feedback rules don't specify about repeated letters. But the secret word might have duplicates? However, in the example given (BRISK) there were no duplicates, but we can't assume.

In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but we have to handle them carefully. However, the feedback given for ""raise"" didn't have duplicates, so let's stick to words without duplicates for simplicity unless necessary.

We haven't tested T, L. Also, I would be in position 2.

Another option: ""QUITE"" — but Q is uncommon, and we have U, I, T, E. But we have E at the end, and I in position 4? Quite: Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). But in our feedback, I was marked wrong in position 3? But now we are putting I at position 3? Wait, in ""raise"" I was position 3 and got ""-"" meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put I at position 3 in the new guess? Actually, we can, because we don't know if the word has multiple I's? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple I's, so probably it's safe to assume one I for now? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, it might be better to put I in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 3 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

Another idea: ""SLIME"" — but S is eliminated (from feedback), so cannot use S.

Avoid letters R, A, S.

Word: ""GUISE"" — G(1), U(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). But we have I at position 3 again — but position 3 was tried and not correct, and S is eliminated, so bad.

We need a word without A, R, S.

Try ""WHILE"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But again, I is at position 3, which we know is not correct for I? We shouldn't put I at position 3 again because the feedback said I is in the word but not at position 3. Putting I at the same position again might not yield new information. We should try I at a different position.

What about ""DEBIT""? D(1), E(2) — but then E is not at the end? We know E is at the end, so the word must be _ _ _ _ E. So we cannot have E in position 2.

The word must end with E.

So, words like: ""BIBLE"" — but B and B, and E at end. But I at position 4? B(1), I(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). So I at position 2? We haven't tried position 2.

Another word: ""UTILE"" — U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). Again, I at 3 which we know is wrong? Or we can use it to test? But we know I isn't at 3, so putting it at 3 again might waste a chance to test another position.

To maximize information, let's put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Position 1: ""IGLOO"" — but O and O? And no E at end. Must be 5 letters and end in E.

""I"" at position 1 and end with E: isn't common? Words like ""IMAGE"" — but A is eliminated. ""INANE"" — N's? But A is eliminated. ""INCLE"" not a word. ""INDEX"" — D, E, but E at position 4? We need E at position 5. ""INDEX"" has E? No: I-N-D-E-X, so E at position 4? Not position 5. Must be 5th position E.

So, words with I at position 1: Not many common words? ""ISSUE"" — but S is eliminated. ""IMPEL"" — but may not be common? Let's think.

Position 2: Words like ""WHILE"" — W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But I at 3? We tried I at position 3 in ""raise"" and it was marked ""-"" meaning wrong position. In ""WHILE"", I is at position 3 again — that's the same position, so we won't get new info about position. If the word has only one I, we know position 3 is wrong for I, so putting I again at position 3 in a new word won't help.

Therefore, for more information, put I at a new position: either 1, 2, or 4.

Available positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4: Words like ""UNTIE"" — U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). This has U, N, T, I, E. And E at end. I at position 4.

Similarly, ""MOVIE"" — M(1), O(2), V(3), I(4), E(5).

""TULIP"" — but doesn't end with E.

""UNTIE"" seems good: ends with E, has I at position 4, uses new letters U, N, T.

We have not tested U, N, T — all common letters.

So, ""UNTIE"" can test:
- U in position 1
- N in position 2
- T in position 3
- I in position 4 (which we hope might be correct? or get info)
- E at position 5 (already known)

Also, we know the word has one I, and here we put it at 4. If we get ✓ for I, then it's correct. If -, then I is elsewhere. If x, but we know I is in the word, so x would not happen? Since we know I is in the word, only ✓ or - possible.

Similarly, T, U, N: we might get feedback.

So, let's choose ""UNTIE"".

But note: the word ""UNTIE"" means unfasten, valid word.

Alternatively, ""UTILE"" — U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But then I at position 3 which we already know is wrong? So putting I at 3 might not be productive. Feedback: I at position 3 was marked ""-"" in the first guess, meaning it's in the word but not at position 3. If we put I at position 3 again, what can we learn? 
- If we get ✓, it would contradict previous feedback? 
- But we won't get ✓ because we know it's not at position 3. 
- We might get ""-"" again, meaning it's still not at position 3 and present? 
- Or if we get ""x"", but that can't happen because we know I is in the word. 
So, no new information. Avoid repeating positions for letters known to be misplaced unless necessary.

Therefore, better to put I at a new position: here position 4.

Other option: position 2 — ""OPINE""? P and I at 3? ""OPINE"" has I at position 3 again? Let's count: O-P-I-N-E, so I at 3. Same problem.

Position 2: ""QUITE"" — Q-U-I-T-E: I at 3? Position: U is 2, I is 3? No.

Words with I at position 2: ""TIGER"" — but ends with R, not E? Can't use.

""WHILE"" I at 3? Hard to find.

""MINCE"" — M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So I at position 2? That's new.

""MINCE"" is a word: meaning chop finely.

We can use ""MINCE"": 
- M in position 1
- I in position 2
- N in position 3
- C in position 4
- E in position 5

But note, position 3 for I was tried and wrong, now position 2 for I — that's a new position.

Similarly, ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4.

Both ""MINCE"" and ""UNTIE"" are good.

I'd go with either.

Also, ""CHIVE"" — but H? And V.

""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T — all common.

Let me decide: ""UNTIE"" because we can test three new consonants: U, N, T.

But U is a vowel? Still, T and N are common consonants.

Both are valid.

I'll pick ""UNTIE"".

So, next guess: ""UNTIE""

Then, we'll see feedback.

But note: E is known to be correct at position 5, so in the new guess, E at position 5 is fixed. We don't test E again? But it's already known.

In the feedback, for E at position 5, we should still get a ✓ because it's correct? In the response, it will show.

So, I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

If we get lucky with I at position 4 being correct.

We are testing new letters: U, N, T.

So, let's guess ""UNTIE"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S are **absent** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- I is **present** but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").
- E is **correct** and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word ends with E: `_ _ _ _ E`.
- I must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is invalid).
- Avoid using letters R, A, S, as they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Goal: Test new letters and check the position of I (ideally in a new position like 1, 2, or 4).
- Since E is fixed in position 5, choose a word ending with E and containing I in a different position than 3.
- Leverage common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) for information gain.

Selected word: **UNTIE**  
- U in position 1 (untested letter).  
- N in position 2 (untested letter).  
- T in position 3 (untested letter).  
- I in position 4 (testing a new position for I).  
- E in position 5 (known correct position).  

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (U, N, T) and checks I at position 4 while maintaining the fixed E at the end.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""raise""
- R: x → absent
- A: x → absent
- I: - → present but not in position 3
- S: x → absent
- E: ✓ → present and correct at position 5

Second guess: ""untie""
- U: x → absent
- N: x → absent
- T: x → absent
- I: - → present but not in position 4 (since it's guessed at position 4 and marked as ""-"")
- E: ✓ → present and correct at position 5

Summary of known information:
1. The word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
2. I is present, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, I must be in either position 1 or 2.
3. Absent letters: R, A, S, U, N, T. We must avoid these.
4. We have tested the positions for I: position 3 and 4 are incorrect, leaving only position 1 or 2.

Available positions for I: 1 or 2.

We need to test a word that:
- Has E at position 5 (fixed)
- Contains I at either position 1 or 2 (to pin down its location)
- Uses only letters that haven't been tested (except E and I, which we know are present)
- Tests new common letters to gain more information.

Letters tested and absent: R, A, S, U, N, T.
Letters known present: E (position 5) and I (in position 1 or 2).

Untested letters: many, like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing common consonants like L, C, D, M, etc.

Option: Put I at position 1 or 2.

First, try I at position 1? Possible words: ""IMPEL"", ""IMAGE"", but ""IMAGE"" has A which is absent → invalid. ""IGLOE"" not a word? Common words ending with E and starting with I: ""INVITE"" has V, T; but T is absent → cannot use. We must avoid absent letters.

We cannot use any of the absent letters: R, A, S, U, N, T.

So, word must avoid R,A,S,U,N,T and contain E at end.

Possible words with I at position 1 and E at end: ""IMPLE"" not common? ""IDIOM"" ends with M, not E. ""ICICLE"" too long? 5-letter: ""IDLE"", but E at end? ""IDLE"" is I-D-L-E → 4 letters? No. 5-letter words: ""IVIZE""? Not word. ""IMAGE"" has A → absent. So, few common options for I at position 1? Maybe ""INKLE"" but K,L,E; but N is absent? N is absent (from second guess: N marked x). ""INKLE"" has N → cannot use because N is absent. ""IMPEL"": I-M-P-E-L → ends with L, not E? Positions: I(1), M(2), P(3), E(4), L(5) → not ending with E? We need position 5 E. ""IMPEL"" has E at position 4. Another: ""IMBUE"" ends with U,E but U at end? U absent? and E in 5th? ""IMBUE"" has U → absent. Not good.

Alternatively, put I at position 2. Easier to find words.

Structure: _ I _ _ E

The first letter can be various consonants.

But must avoid used absent letters: R,A,S,U,N,T.

Common options: Words like ""PIECE"" has E at position 3 and E at end? ""PIECE"": P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5) → but E in position 3? We don't know if E can be elsewhere? But we only know E is at position 5, not necessarily others absent? We have E as present only at position 5? Actually, we don't know if there are other E's? The feedback so far only shows E at position 5, but could there be another E?

From the feedback: in ""raise"", E was at position 5 and marked ✓, meaning that E is correct at 5. But it doesn't rule out another E? Similarly in ""untie"", E was at 5 and correct.

So far, we have not tested E at other positions? So, it's possible that E might appear elsewhere? But typically, we assume one E unless feedback suggests duplicates? But we don't know. However, when we guess, we can use multiple E's if needed? Not restricted until feedback.

But to be safe, we can test a word that doesn't reuse E unnecessarily? Or we can test an extra E to check?

Given the constraints, we need to pick a word with I at position 2 and E at 5.

Try ""WHILE"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) → but here I is at position 3? Not 2. We need I at position 2.

For position 2: ""PIECE"" as above, but has E at position 3 and 5? ""PIECE"": P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But E at position 3 is an extra E? And we haven't tested E elsewhere? Also, letters: P, I, C, E. I is present as per reason, E is fixed at 5. C and P are new.

But E at position 3? If it's present there, we might get a ✓ or -, but it's a test.

Problem: we know E is at 5, but if there is a duplicate E at say 3, it might show up as ✓ if guessed? So not a problem? But we want to test new letters? Using E again might not test as many new letters? However, efficient.

But note: in ""PIECE"", we have I at position 2, which is what we want. But E at position 3: if the secret word doesn't have E at 3, it might show x? But if it does, we learn.

However, let's consider avoiding reuse to maximize new letters.

Alternative with I at position 2: ""BIKER"" → no E at end? ""BICEP"" → no. ""FILME"" not common? ""LIMEY"" → Y at end? Not E.

Common words: ""DICE"" not 5 letter? ""SIDE"" not 5. 5-letter: ""VOICE"" → V(1), O(2), I(3), C(4), E(5) → I at position 3 again? We need I at position 2.

Word like ""WIKI"" not ending E? ""SIEVE"" → S(1), I(2), E(3), V(4), E(5). But S is absent → cannot use. ""GLIDE"" → G(1), L(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) → I at 3.

Struggle to find words with I at position 2 and E at end? How about ""QUITE"" → Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) → I at 3 and U,T absent? Not useful.

Another: ""BRIDE"" → B(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) → I at 3? Need I at position 2.

Perhaps ""MICEY"" not standard? ""MIDGE"" → M(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). Yes! ""MIDGE"" is an insect? Valid word.

Similarly, ""PIKIE"" not common? ""DOGIE"" → O, G, but I at position 3? ""DOGIE"": D(1), O(2), G(3), I(4), E(5) → I at position 4? We know position 4 is not correct for I (from second guess), so ""MIDGE"" might be better.

""MIDGE"": 
- Position 1: M (untested)
- Position 2: I (we are testing I at position 2) 
- Position 3: D (untested)
- Position 4: G (untested)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

We avoid all absent letters: R,A,S,U,N,T are not used.

We test M, D, G as new letters.

If I at position 2 is correct, we get ✓ for I. If wrong, it would be ""-"", meaning I is not at position 2, so must be at position 1? Because position 3 and 4 are eliminated, leaving only position 1 if not 2.

So, regardless, we will learn if I is at position 2 or must be at position 1.

Also, we test other letters.

Similarly, another word like ""LIFTE"" not common? ""LIVE"" not 5? ""JIVE"" same. ""CHIME"" → C(1), H(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) → I at position 3.

""MIDGE"" seems good.

Another option: ""BIDET"" → B(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), T(5) → but E not at position 5? Ends with T? No.

""VIMEN"" not a word? ""WIPED"" → ends with D? ""WIFE"" not 5? ""SIZED"" → S absent.

""MIDGE"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning small fly.

So, I'll go with ""MIDGE"".

If feedback shows I at position 2 is marked ""-"", then I must be position 1.

Similarly, we'll see about M,D,G.

So, guess ""MIDGE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:

- **First Guess (""raise""):** R, A, S are absent. I is present but not at position 3. E is correct at position 5.
- **Second Guess (""untie""):** U, N, T are absent. I is present but not at position 4. E confirms correct at position 5.

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern:** `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).
- **I position:** Must be at position 1 or 2 (since position 3 and 4 are invalidated by previous feedback).
- **Absent letters:** R, A, S, U, N, T (must avoid these).
- **Present letters:** E (position 5) and I (position 1 or 2).
- **Goal:** Test the position of I (1 vs. 2) while introducing new common consonants to gather more information. Avoid reusing absent letters.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Choose a word with I at position 2 to directly test that location for I (if it's not correct, I must be at position 1).
- End with E to maintain the known position.
- Use untested common letters like M, D, G to maximize information gain.
- Selected word: **MIDGE**  
  - M (untested) at position 1  
  - I (test position 2) at position 2  
  - D (untested) at position 3  
  - G (untested) at position 4  
  - E (fixed) at position 5  

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of I and tests three new consonants (M, D, G), covering common letters.
