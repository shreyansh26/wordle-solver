We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We got feedback for ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (because it's marked with - meaning wrong position).
   - R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).
   - E is present in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""crane"", E is the fifth letter and it's marked with -).

 So, we know:
   - The secret word contains C and E, but not R, A, N.
   - C is not in the first position (so the word does not start with C). 
   - E is not in the fifth position.

 Also, since C is present but not in first position, it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
 But note: we have five positions, and E is also present but not in fifth.

 Let's list the letters we know: 
   Included: C, E
   Excluded: R, A, N

 For our next guess, we must:
   - Include C and E (since they are in the word).
   - Exclude R, A, N.
   - Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since C is not in first position, we can try putting C in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But note that E is also present and not in fifth.

 However, we have to consider that E is not in fifth, so it must be in one of the first four positions.

 Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5? But note: if C is in position 5, then E cannot be in position 5, which we already know because E is not in fifth.

 We don't know the positions for C and E.

 We also know that the first letter was not C (from feedback: C(-) and in position1, so it's wrong position meaning the letter in position1 is not C).

 So, let's think of words that contain C and E, exclude R,A,N, and have C not in first and E not in fifth.

 We can try to use common letters. Since we don't have many letters, we can look for words that have C and E.

 Let me think of some words:
   - words with C and E: ""slice"", ""price"", ""dice"", ""nice"", ""piece"", etc.

 But note the feedback: In the previous guess, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is present but not in fifth. So in our next word, we know E must not be in fifth? Actually, we can put E in any position except fifth? Not necessarily: the feedback only said the E was not in fifth in the secret word. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we must avoid putting E in fifth again because we know it's not there.

 Similarly, C was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not in position1. So we cannot put C in position1.

 Therefore, for our next guess:
   - Must include C and E (we know they are in the word).
   - Exclude R,A,N.
   - C cannot be in position1.
   - E cannot be in position5.

 We also want to cover new letters to get information.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
   - C in position 2,3, or 4? We don't know, so we can try a different position.
   - E in position 1,2,3,4.

 Example: 
   Let's try ""SPICE"":
     S (new) at position1, P (new) at position2, I (new) at position3, C at position4, E at position5.

 But wait, we cannot put E in position5! Because we know E is not in fifth position. So ""SPICE"" has E in fifth -> invalid for our knowledge.

 Let's try ""PIECE"": 
   P at1, I at2, E at3, C at4, E at5? But not only E appears twice? And E is in fifth -> invalid.

 How about ""CLIMB""? But it doesn't have E.

 We need a word with both C and E.

 Consider ""SCENE"": 
   S at1, C at2, E at3, N at4, E at5. But N is excluded? We know N is not in the word because in ""crane"" N got marked 'x'. So we cannot use N.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at1, C at2, O at3, P at4, E at5 -> E at fifth? Not allowed.

 So we must avoid E in fifth.

 What about ""CELLO""? 
   C at position1 -> not allowed. We cannot put C at first.

 We must avoid C at first and E at fifth.

 Let me think: words starting with a different letter, then C somewhere else and E in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   ""EXCEL"": 
     E at1, X at2, C at3, E at4, L at5. 
     This has E at1 and at4? But also note: the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters, but we know E is present and may appear multiple times? We don't know yet.

 However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E marked as present but not in fifth. It doesn't say anything about how many times E appears. So duplicate letters are possible? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol. So if there's one E and we guessed one E, it will be marked accordingly.

 But in ""EXCEL"": 
   Letter E: appears in position1 and 4? 
   But the secret word has E? We don't know if there are two E's. We only know that at least one E is present.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are excluded: R,A,N.

 ""EXCEL"": 
   E (okay), X (new), C (known), E, L (new). 
   Positions: 
     E at1 -> we don't know if E can be at first? The feedback said E is not at fifth, so it can be at first? Yes.
     C at3 -> not position1.

 Also, no excluded letters.

 But note: in ""crane"", C was in position1 and marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in first. When we move C to position3, we are testing a new position.

 Let's consider: 
   If the secret word has E at first, we will see E at1 marked with (✓) if exactly at that position? 
   But if not, then it might be marked (-) meaning present but not there? or if the secret word doesn't have E at first, then the E at1 might be marked with (-) meaning present elsewhere? 

 However, we also have to note: if the secret word has only one E and it is in position4, then in ""EXCEL"", the first E would get (-) because wrong position? And the last E in position4? But our word has E at4 and E at1? Actually, note: we have two E's in ""EXCEL"". So if the secret word has one E and it is in position4, then the first E might get (-) because we have to mark the first E? But wait: feedback marks each occurrence. Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it becomes tricky.

 How the game handles duplicates:
   Example: secret word is APPLE. Guess: POINT. P is marked (-) for position1? But wait, secret has only one P? And in position2? So the P in position1 would show (-) meaning the letter P appears but not in first position? 

   However, if you guess two P's: e.g., PAPER. Secret: APPLE. Then the first P would be marked (-) because the secret has P at position2? But the second P might be marked (✓) because position2? Or how?

 Let me recall: 
   - The rules say: each letter in the guess gets one of the symbols.
   - The game compares the secret and the guess. For duplicate letters: 
        If the guess has two of the same letter and the secret has only one, then one of them might be marked with (✓) if it's correct, and the other one might be marked with (x) if the secret doesn't have that many? Actually, the standard Wordle approach is: 
          For each letter in the secret, it is used for one matching guess letter (starting from the exact matches first, then the wrong position).

   So if secret has one P and guess has two P, one in correct position and one not? Actually, the example: secret APPLE, guess PAPER:
      Positions: 
        1: P in guess -> secret position1 is A -> so not correct -> but secret has a P in position2? So the first P gets (-) because there exists a P? 
        Then for the second P: in guess position2, secret has P in position2 -> so correct (✓). 
        Then if we get the third P? There isn't a third P. But we don't have three P's.

   However, in our case: we don't know if the secret has duplicate letters.

 Given the complexity, we want to avoid duplicates if possible? But we don't have much choice.

 But let's think: the word ""EXCEL"" might be valid? However, we have two E's. We don't know if the secret has two E's. We are going to get feedback that might be confusing? 

 Alternative: can we find a word without duplicate letters, with C in a position other than first and E in a position other than fifth? And without R,A,N.

 List of letters we haven't used: 
   We guessed: C,R,A,N,E -> so we know about C and E (present), R,A,N (absent).
   Remaining letters: many, except these.

 Let me think of words that meet the criteria:

   We want: 
      [Letter1] (not C), [Letter2], C, [Letter3], [Letter4] - but E must be in one of positions 2,3,4? Or positions1? Actually, E can be in any position except fifth.

   So E could be in position1? Then we have: E at1, and then C can be in 2,3,4? And then the word must have E in the first part.

   Example: ""ECLAT"" -> but A? A is excluded.

   Example: ""EDUCE"": 
        E at1 (okay), D at2 (new), U at3 (new), C at4 (okay, position not first), E at5 -> wait, E at5: we know E cannot be at fifth? So invalid.

   Example: ""OUNCE"": 
        O at1 (new), U at2 (new), N at3 -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

   Example: ""SLEET"": 
        S at1, L at2, E at3, E at4, T at5 -> but has E at3 and 4: duplicate? And E at3 is not fifth? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, it has two E's and one L and S and T.

   But I don't want duplicate E if possible? 

   Example: ""STOIC"":
        S at1, T at2?, O at3, I at4, C at5 -> but no E? We must include E because we know it is required.

   Another: ""PIECE"" has E twice? 

   How about ""CEDED"": 
        C at1 -> not allowed? We cannot put C at first. 

   Let me try: ""BELCH"": 
        B at1, E at2 (okay), L at3, C at4 (okay, not first), H at5 -> no E at fifth? But it has E at2. So valid? And includes E and C, no A,R,N.

   Also, ""BELCH"": 
        Letters: B, E, L, C, H -> all new? We know C and E.

   Let me check: 
        B at1: new? yes.
        E at2: known -> and we are testing if E is at2? 
        L at3: new
        C at4: known -> and we move C from previous position1 to position4.

   This might be a good guess? It covers:
        Position1: new letter B
        Position2: E (we know E is in the word, but where? Now testing position2)
        Position3: L
        Position4: C (we know C is in the word, but not in first -> so somewhere else: now position4)
        Position5: H

   So we'll get feedback on B, L, H? And if E is at2 then we'll get ✓ at2? Else if E is elsewhere then -. Similarly for C at4.

   Alternatively, if the secret word has E at2 and C at4? Then we might get ✓ for both? 

   Or, if the secret word doesn't have E at2, then E will be marked as (-) meaning present but not in that position? Similarly for C.

   Also, we'll check if B, L, H are in the word? 

   There might be other words? Let me think of ""CHOLE"" -> but that's a root word? Might not be common. 

   Another common word: ""TEACH"": 
        T at1 (new), E at2 (okay), A? A is excluded -> invalid.

   ""CHESS"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we cannot put C at first.

   ""SPEED"": 
        S at1? Then P at2, E at3, E at4, D at5 -> two E's? And D? And no C? So missing C -> invalid.

   Therefore, I choose ""BELCH"".

   However, note: the feedback we got for ""crane"" shows that the secret word has both C and E? So why not include them? Yes.

   Alternatively: ""CEDES"" -> C at1? Not allowed.

   Another: ""COMET"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we can't put C at first.

   ""SCREAM"": but that's 6 letters? We need 5.

   After consideration, ""BELCH"" seems a reasonable guess.

   Let me confirm: 
        B, E, L, C, H -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""BELCH"": letters are B, E, L, C, H -> distinct? Yes. 

   So let's go with ""BELCH"".

   Feedback we might get? 
        If the secret word has E at position2? Then we'll get E marked as ✓ at2? 
        If C is at position4? Then C will be ✓ at4? 
        But note: the secret word might have E and C in different positions? 

   We are trying to cover new letters (B,L,H) and test the known letters in new positions.

   Another option: ""BLEEP"" -> has two E's? And P? And includes E? But also E at5? Not allowed.

   So ""BELCH"" seems acceptable.

   If ""BELCH"" is not a common word? But I think it is (as a verb: to eject gas noisily). 

   Alternatively, we could try ""FILET"": but no E? Wait, ""FILET"" has E? Let me check: F-I-L-E-T -> has E at position4? But no C? So missing C.

   So I'm going with ""BELCH"".

 Guess: BELCH.

<guess>belch</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C is present but not in position 1, E is present but not in position 5, and R, A, N are absent), the following is deduced:

- **C and E** must appear in the new guess, but **C cannot be in position 1** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- R, A, and N are excluded.
- The guess should introduce new letters to gain more information while adhering to the constraints.

The word ""belch"" was chosen because:
- It includes the required letters **C (position 4)** and **E (position 2)**, satisfying positional constraints.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, N.
- It tests new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), and H (position 5), maximizing information gain.
- ""Belch"" is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters, reducing ambiguity.

<guess>belch</guess>",belch,"We got feedback for ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (because it's marked with - meaning wrong position).
   - R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).
   - E is present in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""crane"", E is the fifth letter and it's marked with -).

 So, we know:
   - The secret word contains C and E, but not R, A, N.
   - C is not in the first position (so the word does not start with C). 
   - E is not in the fifth position.

 Also, since C is present but not in first position, it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
 But note: we have five positions, and E is also present but not in fifth.

 Let's list the letters we know:

   Excluded: R, A, N

 We don't know the positions for C and E.

 We also know that the first letter was not C (from feedback: C(-) and in position1, so it's wrong position meaning the letter in position1 is not C).

 So, let's think of words that contain C and E, exclude R,A,N, and have C not in first and E not in fifth.

 We can try to use common letters. Since we don't have many letters, we can look for words that have C and E.

 Let me think of some words:
   - words with C and E: ""slice"", ""price"", ""dice"", ""nice"", ""piece"", etc.

 But note the feedback: In the previous guess, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is present but not in fifth. So in our next word, we know E must not be in fifth? Actually, we can put E in any position except fifth? Not necessarily: the feedback only said the E was not in fifth in the secret word. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we must avoid putting E in fifth again because we know it's not there.

 Similarly, C was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not in position1. So we cannot put C in position1.

 Therefore, for our next guess:
   - Must include C and E (we know they are in the word).
   - Exclude R,A,N.
   - C cannot be in position1.
   - E cannot be in position5.

 We also want to cover new letters to get information.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
   - C in position 2,3, or 4? We don't know, so we can try a different position.
   - E in position 1,2,3,4.

 Example: 
   Let's try ""SPICE"":
     S (new) at position1, P (new) at position2, I (new) at position3, C at position4, E at position5.

 But wait, we cannot put E in position5! Because we know E is not in fifth position. So ""SPICE"" has E in fifth -> invalid for our knowledge.

 Let's try ""PIECE"": 
   P at1, I at2, E at3, C at4, E at5? But not only E appears twice? And E is in fifth -> invalid.

 How about ""CLIMB""? But it doesn't have E.

 We need a word with both C and E.

 Consider ""SCENE"": 
   S at1, C at2, E at3, N at4, E at5. But N is excluded? We know N is not in the word because in ""crane"" N got marked 'x'. So we cannot use N.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at1, C at2, O at3, P at4, E at5 -> E at fifth? Not allowed.

 So we must avoid E in fifth.

 What about ""CELLO""? 
   C at position1 -> not allowed. We cannot put C at first.

 We must avoid C at first and E at fifth.

 Let me think: words starting with a different letter, then C somewhere else and E in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   ""EXCEL"": 
     E at1, X at2, C at3, E at4, L at5. 
     This has E at1 and at4? But also note: the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters, but we know E is present and may appear multiple times? We don't know yet.

 However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E marked as present but not in fifth. It doesn't say anything about how many times E appears. So duplicate letters are possible? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol. So if there's one E and we guessed one E, it will be marked accordingly.

   Positions: 
     E at1 -> we don't know if E can be at first? The feedback said E is not at fifth, so it can be at first? Yes.
     C at3 -> not position1.

 Also, no excluded letters.

 But note: in ""crane"", C was in position1 and marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in first. When we move C to position3, we are testing a new position.

 Let's consider: 
   If the secret word has E at first, we will see E at1 marked with (✓) if exactly at that position? 
   But if not, then it might be marked (-) meaning present but not there? or if the secret word doesn't have E at first, then the E at1 might be marked with (-) meaning present elsewhere?

So if the secret word has one E and it is in position4, then the first E might get (-) because we have to mark the first E? But wait: feedback marks each occurrence. Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it becomes tricky.

 How the game handles duplicates:
   Example: secret word is APPLE. Guess: POINT. P is marked (-) for position1? But wait, secret has only one P? And in position2? So the P in position1 would show (-) meaning the letter P appears but not in first position? 

   However, if you guess two P's: e.g., PAPER. Secret: APPLE. Then the first P would be marked (-) because the secret has P at position2? But the second P might be marked (✓) because position2? Or how?

 Let me recall: 
   - The rules say: each letter in the guess gets one of the symbols.
   - The game compares the secret and the guess. For duplicate letters: 
        If the guess has two of the same letter and the secret has only one, then one of them might be marked with (✓) if it's correct, and the other one might be marked with (x) if the secret doesn't have that many? Actually, the standard Wordle approach is: 
          For each letter in the secret, it is used for one matching guess letter (starting from the exact matches first, then the wrong position).

   So if secret has one P and guess has two P, one in correct position and one not? Actually, the example: secret APPLE, guess PAPER:
      Positions: 
        1: P in guess -> secret position1 is A -> so not correct -> but secret has a P in position2? So the first P gets (-) because there exists a P? 
        Then for the second P: in guess position2, secret has P in position2 -> so correct (✓). 
        Then if we get the third P? There isn't a third P. But we don't have three P's.

   However, in our case: we don't know if the secret has duplicate letters.

 Given the complexity, we want to avoid duplicates if possible? But we don't have much choice.

 But let's think: the word ""EXCEL"" might be valid? However, we have two E's. We don't know if the secret has two E's. We are going to get feedback that might be confusing? 

 Alternative: can we find a word without duplicate letters, with C in a position other than first and E in a position other than fifth? And without R,A,N.

 List of letters we haven't used: 
   We guessed: C,R,A,N,E -> so we know about C and E (present), R,A,N (absent).
   Remaining letters: many, except these.

 Let me think of words that meet the criteria:

   We want: 
      [Letter1] (not C), [Letter2], C, [Letter3], [Letter4] - but E must be in one of positions 2,3,4? Or positions1? Actually, E can be in any position except fifth.

   So E could be in position1? Then we have: E at1, and then C can be in 2,3,4? And then the word must have E in the first part.

   Example: ""ECLAT"" -> but A? A is excluded.

   Example: ""EDUCE"": 
        E at1 (okay), D at2 (new), U at3 (new), C at4 (okay, position not first), E at5 -> wait, E at5: we know E cannot be at fifth? So invalid.

   Example: ""OUNCE"": 
        O at1 (new), U at2 (new), N at3 -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

   Example: ""SLEET"": 
        S at1, L at2, E at3, E at4, T at5 -> but has E at3 and 4: duplicate? And E at3 is not fifth? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, it has two E's and one L and S and T.

   But I don't want duplicate E if possible? 

   Example: ""STOIC"":
        S at1, T at2?, O at3, I at4, C at5 -> but no E? We must include E because we know it is required.

   Another: ""PIECE"" has E twice? 

   How about ""CEDED"": 
        C at1 -> not allowed? We cannot put C at first. 

   Let me try: ""BELCH"": 
        B at1, E at2 (okay), L at3, C at4 (okay, not first), H at5 -> no E at fifth? But it has E at2. So valid? And includes E and C, no A,R,N.

   Also, ""BELCH"": 
        Letters: B, E, L, C, H -> all new? We know C and E.

   Let me check: 
        B at1: new? yes.
        E at2: known -> and we are testing if E is at2? 
        L at3: new
        C at4: known -> and we move C from previous position1 to position4.

   This might be a good guess? It covers:
        Position1: new letter B
        Position2: E (we know E is in the word, but where? Now testing position2)
        Position3: L
        Position4: C (we know C is in the word, but not in first -> so somewhere else: now position4)
        Position5: H

   So we'll get feedback on B, L, H? And if E is at2 then we'll get ✓ at2? Else if E is elsewhere then -. Similarly for C at4.

   Alternatively, if the secret word has E at2 and C at4? Then we might get ✓ for both? 

   Or, if the secret word doesn't have E at2, then E will be marked as (-) meaning present but not in that position? Similarly for C.

   Also, we'll check if B, L, H are in the word? 

   There might be other words? Let me think of ""CHOLE"" -> but that's a root word? Might not be common. 

   Another common word: ""TEACH"": 
        T at1 (new), E at2 (okay), A? A is excluded -> invalid.

   ""CHESS"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we cannot put C at first.

   ""SPEED"": 
        S at1? Then P at2, E at3, E at4, D at5 -> two E's? And D? And no C? So missing C -> invalid.

   Therefore, I choose ""BELCH"".

   However, note: the feedback we got for ""crane"" shows that the secret word has both C and E? So why not include them? Yes.

   Alternatively: ""CEDES"" -> C at1? Not allowed.

   Another: ""COMET"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we can't put C at first.

   ""SCREAM"": but that's 6 letters? We need 5.

   After consideration, ""BELCH"" seems a reasonable guess.

   Let me confirm: 
        B, E, L, C, H -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""BELCH"": letters are B, E, L, C, H -> distinct? Yes. 

   So let's go with ""BELCH"".

   Feedback we might get? 
        If the secret word has E at position2? Then we'll get E marked as ✓ at2? 
        If C is at position4? Then C will be ✓ at4? 
        But note: the secret word might have E and C in different positions? 

   We are trying to cover new letters (B,L,H) and test the known letters in new positions.

   Another option: ""BLEEP"" -> has two E's? And P? And includes E? But also E at5? Not allowed.

   So ""BELCH"" seems acceptable.

   If ""BELCH"" is not a common word? But I think it is (as a verb: to eject gas noisily). 

   Alternatively, we could try ""FILET"": but no E? Wait, ""FILET"" has E? Let me check: F-I-L-E-T -> has E at position4? But no C? So missing C.

   So I'm going with ""BELCH"".

 Guess: BELCH.

<guess>belch</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C is present but not in position 1, E is present but not in position 5, and R, A, N are absent), the following is deduced:

- **C and E** must appear in the new guess, but **C cannot be in position 1** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- R, A, and N are excluded.
- The guess should introduce new letters to gain more information while adhering to the constraints.

The word ""belch"" was chosen because:
- It includes the required letters **C (position 4)** and **E (position 2)**, satisfying positional constraints.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, N.
- It tests new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), and H (position 5), maximizing information gain.
- ""Belch"" is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters, reducing ambiguity.",Guess 2: belch -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) C(-) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,gecko,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We got feedback for ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (because it's marked with - meaning wrong position).
   - R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).
   - E is present in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""crane"", E is the fifth letter and it's marked with -).

 So, we know:
   - The secret word contains C and E, but not R, A, N.
   - C is not in the first position (so the word does not start with C). 
   - E is not in the fifth position.

 Also, since C is present but not in first position, it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
 But note: we have five positions, and E is also present but not in fifth.

 Let's list the letters we know: 
   Included: C, E
   Excluded: R, A, N

 For our next guess, we must:
   - Include C and E (since they are in the word).
   - Exclude R, A, N.
   - Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since C is not in first position, we can try putting C in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But note that E is also present and not in fifth.

 However, we have to consider that E is not in fifth, so it must be in one of the first four positions.

 Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5? But note: if C is in position 5, then E cannot be in position 5, which we already know because E is not in fifth.

 We don't know the positions for C and E.

 We also know that the first letter was not C (from feedback: C(-) and in position1, so it's wrong position meaning the letter in position1 is not C).

 So, let's think of words that contain C and E, exclude R,A,N, and have C not in first and E not in fifth.

 We can try to use common letters. Since we don't have many letters, we can look for words that have C and E.

 Let me think of some words:
   - words with C and E: ""slice"", ""price"", ""dice"", ""nice"", ""piece"", etc.

 But note the feedback: In the previous guess, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is present but not in fifth. So in our next word, we know E must not be in fifth? Actually, we can put E in any position except fifth? Not necessarily: the feedback only said the E was not in fifth in the secret word. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we must avoid putting E in fifth again because we know it's not there.

 Similarly, C was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not in position1. So we cannot put C in position1.

 Therefore, for our next guess:
   - Must include C and E (we know they are in the word).
   - Exclude R,A,N.
   - C cannot be in position1.
   - E cannot be in position5.

 We also want to cover new letters to get information.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
   - C in position 2,3, or 4? We don't know, so we can try a different position.
   - E in position 1,2,3,4.

 Example: 
   Let's try ""SPICE"":
     S (new) at position1, P (new) at position2, I (new) at position3, C at position4, E at position5.

 But wait, we cannot put E in position5! Because we know E is not in fifth position. So ""SPICE"" has E in fifth -> invalid for our knowledge.

 Let's try ""PIECE"": 
   P at1, I at2, E at3, C at4, E at5? But not only E appears twice? And E is in fifth -> invalid.

 How about ""CLIMB""? But it doesn't have E.

 We need a word with both C and E.

 Consider ""SCENE"": 
   S at1, C at2, E at3, N at4, E at5. But N is excluded? We know N is not in the word because in ""crane"" N got marked 'x'. So we cannot use N.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at1, C at2, O at3, P at4, E at5 -> E at fifth? Not allowed.

 So we must avoid E in fifth.

 What about ""CELLO""? 
   C at position1 -> not allowed. We cannot put C at first.

 We must avoid C at first and E at fifth.

 Let me think: words starting with a different letter, then C somewhere else and E in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   ""EXCEL"": 
     E at1, X at2, C at3, E at4, L at5. 
     This has E at1 and at4? But also note: the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters, but we know E is present and may appear multiple times? We don't know yet.

 However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E marked as present but not in fifth. It doesn't say anything about how many times E appears. So duplicate letters are possible? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol. So if there's one E and we guessed one E, it will be marked accordingly.

 But in ""EXCEL"": 
   Letter E: appears in position1 and 4? 
   But the secret word has E? We don't know if there are two E's. We only know that at least one E is present.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are excluded: R,A,N.

 ""EXCEL"": 
   E (okay), X (new), C (known), E, L (new). 
   Positions: 
     E at1 -> we don't know if E can be at first? The feedback said E is not at fifth, so it can be at first? Yes.
     C at3 -> not position1.

 Also, no excluded letters.

 But note: in ""crane"", C was in position1 and marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in first. When we move C to position3, we are testing a new position.

 Let's consider: 
   If the secret word has E at first, we will see E at1 marked with (✓) if exactly at that position? 
   But if not, then it might be marked (-) meaning present but not there? or if the secret word doesn't have E at first, then the E at1 might be marked with (-) meaning present elsewhere? 

 However, we also have to note: if the secret word has only one E and it is in position4, then in ""EXCEL"", the first E would get (-) because wrong position? And the last E in position4? But our word has E at4 and E at1? Actually, note: we have two E's in ""EXCEL"". So if the secret word has one E and it is in position4, then the first E might get (-) because we have to mark the first E? But wait: feedback marks each occurrence. Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it becomes tricky.

 How the game handles duplicates:
   Example: secret word is APPLE. Guess: POINT. P is marked (-) for position1? But wait, secret has only one P? And in position2? So the P in position1 would show (-) meaning the letter P appears but not in first position? 

   However, if you guess two P's: e.g., PAPER. Secret: APPLE. Then the first P would be marked (-) because the secret has P at position2? But the second P might be marked (✓) because position2? Or how?

 Let me recall: 
   - The rules say: each letter in the guess gets one of the symbols.
   - The game compares the secret and the guess. For duplicate letters: 
        If the guess has two of the same letter and the secret has only one, then one of them might be marked with (✓) if it's correct, and the other one might be marked with (x) if the secret doesn't have that many? Actually, the standard Wordle approach is: 
          For each letter in the secret, it is used for one matching guess letter (starting from the exact matches first, then the wrong position).

   So if secret has one P and guess has two P, one in correct position and one not? Actually, the example: secret APPLE, guess PAPER:
      Positions: 
        1: P in guess -> secret position1 is A -> so not correct -> but secret has a P in position2? So the first P gets (-) because there exists a P? 
        Then for the second P: in guess position2, secret has P in position2 -> so correct (✓). 
        Then if we get the third P? There isn't a third P. But we don't have three P's.

   However, in our case: we don't know if the secret has duplicate letters.

 Given the complexity, we want to avoid duplicates if possible? But we don't have much choice.

 But let's think: the word ""EXCEL"" might be valid? However, we have two E's. We don't know if the secret has two E's. We are going to get feedback that might be confusing? 

 Alternative: can we find a word without duplicate letters, with C in a position other than first and E in a position other than fifth? And without R,A,N.

 List of letters we haven't used: 
   We guessed: C,R,A,N,E -> so we know about C and E (present), R,A,N (absent).
   Remaining letters: many, except these.

 Let me think of words that meet the criteria:

   We want: 
      [Letter1] (not C), [Letter2], C, [Letter3], [Letter4] - but E must be in one of positions 2,3,4? Or positions1? Actually, E can be in any position except fifth.

   So E could be in position1? Then we have: E at1, and then C can be in 2,3,4? And then the word must have E in the first part.

   Example: ""ECLAT"" -> but A? A is excluded.

   Example: ""EDUCE"": 
        E at1 (okay), D at2 (new), U at3 (new), C at4 (okay, position not first), E at5 -> wait, E at5: we know E cannot be at fifth? So invalid.

   Example: ""OUNCE"": 
        O at1 (new), U at2 (new), N at3 -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

   Example: ""SLEET"": 
        S at1, L at2, E at3, E at4, T at5 -> but has E at3 and 4: duplicate? And E at3 is not fifth? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, it has two E's and one L and S and T.

   But I don't want duplicate E if possible? 

   Example: ""STOIC"":
        S at1, T at2?, O at3, I at4, C at5 -> but no E? We must include E because we know it is required.

   Another: ""PIECE"" has E twice? 

   How about ""CEDED"": 
        C at1 -> not allowed? We cannot put C at first. 

   Let me try: ""BELCH"": 
        B at1, E at2 (okay), L at3, C at4 (okay, not first), H at5 -> no E at fifth? But it has E at2. So valid? And includes E and C, no A,R,N.

   Also, ""BELCH"": 
        Letters: B, E, L, C, H -> all new? We know C and E.

   Let me check: 
        B at1: new? yes.
        E at2: known -> and we are testing if E is at2? 
        L at3: new
        C at4: known -> and we move C from previous position1 to position4.

   This might be a good guess? It covers:
        Position1: new letter B
        Position2: E (we know E is in the word, but where? Now testing position2)
        Position3: L
        Position4: C (we know C is in the word, but not in first -> so somewhere else: now position4)
        Position5: H

   So we'll get feedback on B, L, H? And if E is at2 then we'll get ✓ at2? Else if E is elsewhere then -. Similarly for C at4.

   Alternatively, if the secret word has E at2 and C at4? Then we might get ✓ for both? 

   Or, if the secret word doesn't have E at2, then E will be marked as (-) meaning present but not in that position? Similarly for C.

   Also, we'll check if B, L, H are in the word? 

   There might be other words? Let me think of ""CHOLE"" -> but that's a root word? Might not be common. 

   Another common word: ""TEACH"": 
        T at1 (new), E at2 (okay), A? A is excluded -> invalid.

   ""CHESS"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we cannot put C at first.

   ""SPEED"": 
        S at1? Then P at2, E at3, E at4, D at5 -> two E's? And D? And no C? So missing C -> invalid.

   Therefore, I choose ""BELCH"".

   However, note: the feedback we got for ""crane"" shows that the secret word has both C and E? So why not include them? Yes.

   Alternatively: ""CEDES"" -> C at1? Not allowed.

   Another: ""COMET"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we can't put C at first.

   ""SCREAM"": but that's 6 letters? We need 5.

   After consideration, ""BELCH"" seems a reasonable guess.

   Let me confirm: 
        B, E, L, C, H -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""BELCH"": letters are B, E, L, C, H -> distinct? Yes. 

   So let's go with ""BELCH"".

   Feedback we might get? 
        If the secret word has E at position2? Then we'll get E marked as ✓ at2? 
        If C is at position4? Then C will be ✓ at4? 
        But note: the secret word might have E and C in different positions? 

   We are trying to cover new letters (B,L,H) and test the known letters in new positions.

   Another option: ""BLEEP"" -> has two E's? And P? And includes E? But also E at5? Not allowed.

   So ""BELCH"" seems acceptable.

   If ""BELCH"" is not a common word? But I think it is (as a verb: to eject gas noisily). 

   Alternatively, we could try ""FILET"": but no E? Wait, ""FILET"" has E? Let me check: F-I-L-E-T -> has E at position4? But no C? So missing C.

   So I'm going with ""BELCH"".

 Guess: BELCH.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.\n A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.\n Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose ""CRANE"" because:\n   - It has 5 distinct letters.\n   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).\n\n So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We got feedback for ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n This means:\n   - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (because it\'s marked with - meaning wrong position).\n   - R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).\n   - E is present in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""crane"", E is the fifth letter and it\'s marked with -).\n\n So, we know:\n   - The secret word contains C and E, but not R, A, N.\n   - C is not in the first position (so the word does not start with C). \n   - E is not in the fifth position.\n\n Also, since C is present but not in first position, it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.\n But note: we have five positions, and E is also present but not in fifth.\n\n Let\'s list the letters we know: \n   Included: C, E\n   Excluded: R, A, N\n\n For our next guess, we must:\n   - Include C and E (since they are in the word).\n   - Exclude R, A, N.\n   - Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Since C is not in first position, we can try putting C in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But note that E is also present and not in fifth.\n\n However, we have to consider that E is not in fifth, so it must be in one of the first four positions.\n\n Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5? But note: if C is in position 5, then E cannot be in position 5, which we already know because E is not in fifth.\n\n We don\'t know the positions for C and E.\n\n We also know that the first letter was not C (from feedback: C(-) and in position1, so it\'s wrong position meaning the letter in position1 is not C).\n\n So, let\'s think of words that contain C and E, exclude R,A,N, and have C not in first and E not in fifth.\n\n We can try to use common letters. Since we don\'t have many letters, we can look for words that have C and E.\n\n Let me think of some words:\n   - words with C and E: ""slice"", ""price"", ""dice"", ""nice"", ""piece"", etc.\n\n But note the feedback: In the previous guess, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is present but not in fifth. So in our next word, we know E must not be in fifth? Actually, we can put E in any position except fifth? Not necessarily: the feedback only said the E was not in fifth in the secret word. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n However, we must avoid putting E in fifth again because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Similarly, C was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not in position1. So we cannot put C in position1.\n\n Therefore, for our next guess:\n   - Must include C and E (we know they are in the word).\n   - Exclude R,A,N.\n   - C cannot be in position1.\n   - E cannot be in position5.\n\n We also want to cover new letters to get information.\n\n Let\'s try to choose a word that has:\n   - C in position 2,3, or 4? We don\'t know, so we can try a different position.\n   - E in position 1,2,3,4.\n\n Example: \n   Let\'s try ""SPICE"":\n     S (new) at position1, P (new) at position2, I (new) at position3, C at position4, E at position5.\n\n But wait, we cannot put E in position5! Because we know E is not in fifth position. So ""SPICE"" has E in fifth -> invalid for our knowledge.\n\n Let\'s try ""PIECE"": \n   P at1, I at2, E at3, C at4, E at5? But not only E appears twice? And E is in fifth -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CLIMB""? But it doesn\'t have E.\n\n We need a word with both C and E.\n\n Consider ""SCENE"": \n   S at1, C at2, E at3, N at4, E at5. But N is excluded? We know N is not in the word because in ""crane"" N got marked \'x\'. So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""SCOPE""? \n   S at1, C at2, O at3, P at4, E at5 -> E at fifth? Not allowed.\n\n So we must avoid E in fifth.\n\n What about ""CELLO""? \n   C at position1 -> not allowed. We cannot put C at first.\n\n We must avoid C at first and E at fifth.\n\n Let me think: words starting with a different letter, then C somewhere else and E in positions 1-4.\n\n Example: \n   ""EXCEL"": \n     E at1, X at2, C at3, E at4, L at5. \n     This has E at1 and at4? But also note: the word has two E\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters, but we know E is present and may appear multiple times? We don\'t know yet.\n\n However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E marked as present but not in fifth. It doesn\'t say anything about how many times E appears. So duplicate letters are possible? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol. So if there\'s one E and we guessed one E, it will be marked accordingly.\n\n But in ""EXCEL"": \n   Letter E: appears in position1 and 4? \n   But the secret word has E? We don\'t know if there are two E\'s. We only know that at least one E is present.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that are excluded: R,A,N.\n\n ""EXCEL"": \n   E (okay), X (new), C (known), E, L (new). \n   Positions: \n     E at1 -> we don\'t know if E can be at first? The feedback said E is not at fifth, so it can be at first? Yes.\n     C at3 -> not position1.\n\n Also, no excluded letters.\n\n But note: in ""crane"", C was in position1 and marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in first. When we move C to position3, we are testing a new position.\n\n Let\'s consider: \n   If the secret word has E at first, we will see E at1 marked with (✓) if exactly at that position? \n   But if not, then it might be marked (-) meaning present but not there? or if the secret word doesn\'t have E at first, then the E at1 might be marked with (-) meaning present elsewhere? \n\n However, we also have to note: if the secret word has only one E and it is in position4, then in ""EXCEL"", the first E would get (-) because wrong position? And the last E in position4? But our word has E at4 and E at1? Actually, note: we have two E\'s in ""EXCEL"". So if the secret word has one E and it is in position4, then the first E might get (-) because we have to mark the first E? But wait: feedback marks each occurrence. Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it becomes tricky.\n\n How the game handles duplicates:\n   Example: secret word is APPLE. Guess: POINT. P is marked (-) for position1? But wait, secret has only one P? And in position2? So the P in position1 would show (-) meaning the letter P appears but not in first position? \n\n   However, if you guess two P\'s: e.g., PAPER. Secret: APPLE. Then the first P would be marked (-) because the secret has P at position2? But the second P might be marked (✓) because position2? Or how?\n\n Let me recall: \n   - The rules say: each letter in the guess gets one of the symbols.\n   - The game compares the secret and the guess. For duplicate letters: \n        If the guess has two of the same letter and the secret has only one, then one of them might be marked with (✓) if it\'s correct, and the other one might be marked with (x) if the secret doesn\'t have that many? Actually, the standard Wordle approach is: \n          For each letter in the secret, it is used for one matching guess letter (starting from the exact matches first, then the wrong position).\n\n   So if secret has one P and guess has two P, one in correct position and one not? Actually, the example: secret APPLE, guess PAPER:\n      Positions: \n        1: P in guess -> secret position1 is A -> so not correct -> but secret has a P in position2? So the first P gets (-) because there exists a P? \n        Then for the second P: in guess position2, secret has P in position2 -> so correct (✓). \n        Then if we get the third P? There isn\'t a third P. But we don\'t have three P\'s.\n\n   However, in our case: we don\'t know if the secret has duplicate letters.\n\n Given the complexity, we want to avoid duplicates if possible? But we don\'t have much choice.\n\n But let\'s think: the word ""EXCEL"" might be valid? However, we have two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret has two E\'s. We are going to get feedback that might be confusing? \n\n Alternative: can we find a word without duplicate letters, with C in a position other than first and E in a position other than fifth? And without R,A,N.\n\n List of letters we haven\'t used: \n   We guessed: C,R,A,N,E -> so we know about C and E (present), R,A,N (absent).\n   Remaining letters: many, except these.\n\n Let me think of words that meet the criteria:\n\n   We want: \n      [Letter1] (not C), [Letter2], C, [Letter3], [Letter4] - but E must be in one of positions 2,3,4? Or positions1? Actually, E can be in any position except fifth.\n\n   So E could be in position1? Then we have: E at1, and then C can be in 2,3,4? And then the word must have E in the first part.\n\n   Example: ""ECLAT"" -> but A? A is excluded.\n\n   Example: ""EDUCE"": \n        E at1 (okay), D at2 (new), U at3 (new), C at4 (okay, position not first), E at5 -> wait, E at5: we know E cannot be at fifth? So invalid.\n\n   Example: ""OUNCE"": \n        O at1 (new), U at2 (new), N at3 -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n   Example: ""SLEET"": \n        S at1, L at2, E at3, E at4, T at5 -> but has E at3 and 4: duplicate? And E at3 is not fifth? But we don\'t know about duplicates? Also, it has two E\'s and one L and S and T.\n\n   But I don\'t want duplicate E if possible? \n\n   Example: ""STOIC"":\n        S at1, T at2?, O at3, I at4, C at5 -> but no E? We must include E because we know it is required.\n\n   Another: ""PIECE"" has E twice? \n\n   How about ""CEDED"": \n        C at1 -> not allowed? We cannot put C at first. \n\n   Let me try: ""BELCH"": \n        B at1, E at2 (okay), L at3, C at4 (okay, not first), H at5 -> no E at fifth? But it has E at2. So valid? And includes E and C, no A,R,N.\n\n   Also, ""BELCH"": \n        Letters: B, E, L, C, H -> all new? We know C and E.\n\n   Let me check: \n        B at1: new? yes.\n        E at2: known -> and we are testing if E is at2? \n        L at3: new\n        C at4: known -> and we move C from previous position1 to position4.\n\n   This might be a good guess? It covers:\n        Position1: new letter B\n        Position2: E (we know E is in the word, but where? Now testing position2)\n        Position3: L\n        Position4: C (we know C is in the word, but not in first -> so somewhere else: now position4)\n        Position5: H\n\n   So we\'ll get feedback on B, L, H? And if E is at2 then we\'ll get ✓ at2? Else if E is elsewhere then -. Similarly for C at4.\n\n   Alternatively, if the secret word has E at2 and C at4? Then we might get ✓ for both? \n\n   Or, if the secret word doesn\'t have E at2, then E will be marked as (-) meaning present but not in that position? Similarly for C.\n\n   Also, we\'ll check if B, L, H are in the word? \n\n   There might be other words? Let me think of ""CHOLE"" -> but that\'s a root word? Might not be common. \n\n   Another common word: ""TEACH"": \n        T at1 (new), E at2 (okay), A? A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""CHESS"": \n        C at1 -> invalid? Because we cannot put C at first.\n\n   ""SPEED"": \n        S at1? Then P at2, E at3, E at4, D at5 -> two E\'s? And D? And no C? So missing C -> invalid.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""BELCH"".\n\n   However, note: the feedback we got for ""crane"" shows that the secret word has both C and E? So why not include them? Yes.\n\n   Alternatively: ""CEDES"" -> C at1? Not allowed.\n\n   Another: ""COMET"": \n        C at1 -> invalid? Because we can\'t put C at first.\n\n   ""SCREAM"": but that\'s 6 letters? We need 5.\n\n   After consideration, ""BELCH"" seems a reasonable guess.\n\n   Let me confirm: \n        B, E, L, C, H -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""BELCH"": letters are B, E, L, C, H -> distinct? Yes. \n\n   So let\'s go with ""BELCH"".\n\n   Feedback we might get? \n        If the secret word has E at position2? Then we\'ll get E marked as ✓ at2? \n        If C is at position4? Then C will be ✓ at4? \n        But note: the secret word might have E and C in different positions? \n\n   We are trying to cover new letters (B,L,H) and test the known letters in new positions.\n\n   Another option: ""BLEEP"" -> has two E\'s? And P? And includes E? But also E at5? Not allowed.\n\n   So ""BELCH"" seems acceptable.\n\n   If ""BELCH"" is not a common word? But I think it is (as a verb: to eject gas noisily). \n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""FILET"": but no E? Wait, ""FILET"" has E? Let me check: F-I-L-E-T -> has E at position4? But no C? So missing C.\n\n   So I\'m going with ""BELCH"".\n\n Guess: BELCH.\n\n<guess>belch</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C is present but not in position 1, E is present but not in position 5, and R, A, N are absent), the following is deduced:\n\n- **C and E** must appear in the new guess, but **C cannot be in position 1** and **E cannot be in position 5**.\n- R, A, and N are excluded.\n- The guess should introduce new letters to gain more information while adhering to the constraints.\n\nThe word ""belch"" was chosen because:\n- It includes the required letters **C (position 4)** and **E (position 2)**, satisfying positional constraints.\n- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, N.\n- It tests new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), and H (position 5), maximizing information gain.\n- ""Belch"" is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters, reducing ambiguity.\n\n<guess>belch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: belch -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) C(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  - R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""belch"" -> Feedback: B(x), E(✓), L(x), C(-), H(x)
Interpretation:
  - E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E in the second position.
  - C is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""belch"", C is at position 4 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - B, L, H are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Known:
- The secret word has E in position 2 (from guess 2: E(✓)).
- The secret word contains C, but not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So C must be in position 3 or 5? (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by E).
  But note: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is E, so C cannot be there. So C must be in position 3 or 5? However, we have to consider that in guess 1, C was in position 1 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there. In guess 2, C was in position 4 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there. So C must be in position 3 or 5.

- Excluded letters: R, A, N (from guess1), and B, L, H (from guess2). So total excluded: R, A, N, B, L, H.

- We know the word has at least two letters: E (at position 2) and C (somewhere, not 1,2,4).

What about the other positions? We have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill, but note:
  Position 2 is fixed as E.
  Position 1: cannot be C (from guess1) and cannot be any excluded letter. Also, we don't know what it is.
  Position 3: could be C? or another letter.
  Position 4: cannot be C (from guess2) and not excluded.
  Position 5: could be C? or another letter.

But note: in guess1, E was in position 5 and got (-), meaning E is present but not at 5. But we now know E is at position 2, so that's consistent.

Now, the secret word has C in either position 3 or 5.

We also need to find the other letters. We have three positions to fill: 1, 3 (if C is not there), 4, and 5 (if C is not there). Actually, if C is in position 3, then positions 1,4,5 are open. If C is in position 5, then positions 1,3,4 are open.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, H. So we should avoid these except C and E which are in the word.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has E in position 2 (fixed).
  - Has C in either position 3 or 5? Actually, we don't know which one, so we might want to test one of the possibilities? Or we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven't tested? We have tested C in position1 and position4. The only positions left are 3 and 5.

But note: we have not tested position3 or position5 for C. So we can try to put C in one of these to see.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities? But we can only make one guess.

We also want to test new letters.

Let me list the available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones (R,A,N,B,L,H) and minus the known ones (C,E). So excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H. That's 6 letters. So 20 letters left? But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can try to form words that have E in second position and C in either 3 or 5.

Case 1: C in position 3.
  Then the word pattern: _ E C _ _
  We need to fill positions 1,4,5 with letters not in {R,A,N,B,L,H} and not C or E (but C and E are already placed).

Case 2: C in position 5.
  Then the word pattern: _ E _ _ C

We don't know which case, so we can design a guess that helps us distinguish.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position 3 and then other new letters? Or in position 5?

Let me think of words that fit each pattern.

Pattern 1: _ E C _ _ 
  Examples: 
    ""PECAN"" -> but A and N are excluded? Invalid.
    ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2, C at3, O at4, Y at5 -> D, O, Y are new? And not excluded? 
    ""RECUT"" -> R excluded? Invalid.
    ""DECKS"": D at1, E at2, C at3, K at4, S at5 -> D, K, S new? 
    ""DECOR"" -> R excluded? Invalid.

Pattern 2: _ E _ _ C
  Examples:
    ""DEUCE"" -> D at1, E at2, U at3, C at5? Wait, but we have 5 letters: D E U C E? Actually, ""DEUCE"" is D-E-U-C-E? So positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C? No, that would be DEUCE: 
        Position1: D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E -> but then C is at position4? But we are considering C at position5? 
    Actually, we need C at position5. So:
        ""PIECE"": P at1, I at2? But position2 is E? So not. 
        ""BEVYC"": B is excluded? 
        ""DEVOT"": D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, T at5? But then C is not in the word? 
        We need C at position5: so the word must end with C? 
        Examples: ""MUSIC"": M at1, U at2? But position2 must be E? So not. 
        ""TOPIC"": T at1, O at2? Not E. 
        ""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> that's a word? TEPIC is a city? 
        ""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> valid? 

So we have two candidate patterns? But we don't know which one.

We can choose a word that has C in position 3? Then if we get feedback that C is in the correct position, we know. If not, then C must be in position5? But note: if we put C in position3 and it is actually in position5, then the feedback for C will be (x) meaning not present? Or (-) meaning present but wrong position? 

Wait: if the secret word has C in position5, and we put C in position3, then the feedback for that C will be (-) because it's present but in the wrong position? Similarly, if we put C in position5 and the secret has it in position3, then we get (-) for the C in position5? 

But we already know C is in the word? So if we put C in a position and it's not the correct one, we get (-). If we put it in the correct position, we get (✓).

So we can design a guess that puts C in position3? Then:
  If we get (✓) for C, then we know C is at position3.
  If we get (-) for C, then since we know C is not in position1,2,4, and we are testing position3, then if it's (-) that means C must be in position5? Because those are the only positions left? 

Similarly, if we put C in position5 and get (✓), then it's at5. If (-), then it must be at3? 

But note: we have only two possibilities: 3 or 5? So we can choose either and we will know.

But we also want to test other letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven't tested? We have tested position1 and 4. So 3 and 5 are untested. 

I think we should choose a word that has C in position3? Because position5 is the last position and might be less common? 

But let's see the examples: 

  If we choose a word with C in position3: e.g., ""DECOY""
    Pattern: D E C O Y
    We get feedback on D, O, Y? And on C: if C is at3, then ✓. If not, then - (meaning it must be at5).

  If we choose a word with C in position5: e.g., ""MEDIC""
    Pattern: M E D I C
    Feedback: M, D, I? And C: if at5, then ✓. Else, - (meaning at3).

Both are valid. 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H.

In ""DECOY"": D, O, Y are not excluded? 
In ""MEDIC"": M, D, I are not excluded? 

But we also have to consider that we might get more information about the other positions.

We are on the third guess. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 total, so 4 left? But we are making the third.

I think either is fine. Let me choose ""DECOY"" because it has more common letters? 

But wait: in ""DECOY"", we have O and Y? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have C at all? But we know C is in the word? So we must include C? Because if we don't, we won't get information about its position? And we have to include it? 

No, we must include C? Actually, the rules don't require that we include known letters? But if we don't, we might not get the position? And we are limited in guesses. 

But we know C is in the word? So we should include it to get its position? 

So I think ""DECOY"" is a good candidate.

But let me check: 
  ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2 (fixed, so we expect ✓ for E), C at3, O at4, Y at5.

What feedback we might get?
  - If the secret word has C at position3: then C will be ✓.
  - If the secret word has C at position5: then the C in position3 will be marked as (-) because it's present but not at3? And then we know C must be at5? 
  - Also, we get feedback on D, O, Y: if they are in the word? 

But note: the secret word has E at2, so we know E at2 will be ✓.

So let's go with ""DECOY"".

But wait: what if the secret word has both C at3 and another C? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one C? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in position5? 

But I think ""DECOY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more positions? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has C in position5? And also tests common letters? 

For example, ""TOPIC"": but position2 must be E? So not. 

""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> but is ""TEPIC"" common? Maybe not.

""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> common word.

""MEDIC"" vs ""DECOY"": both are valid.

But ""DECOY"" has the advantage that it tests position3 for C? And we haven't tested position3? 

But we haven't tested position5 either? 

I think we can choose either. Let me pick ""MEDIC"" because it has more common letters? 

But note: in ""MEDIC"", we have D at position3? And if the secret word has C at position3? Then we are putting D at3? We don't know about D? 

But we are testing D? 

Actually, both words are testing three new letters. 

I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because it's a common word.

So guess: MEDIC.

But let me write it: M-E-D-I-C.

Now, what if the secret word has C at position3? Then in ""MEDIC"", the C at position5 will be marked as (-) meaning present but not at5? And we will know that C must be at3? 

Similarly, if C is at5, then we get ✓ for C at5? 

Also, we get feedback on M, D, I? 

So it's good.

Therefore, our third guess: MEDIC.

<guess>medic</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (present, wrong position), R (absent), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).
- **Guess 2: ""belch""** → B (absent), E (correct position), L (absent), C (present, wrong position), H (absent).

### Deductions:
1. **E is in position 2** (from ""belch"" feedback: E(✓)).
2. **C is in the word** but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out by feedback from ""crane"" and ""belch"").
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, B, L, H (marked absent in prior guesses).
4. **C must be in position 3 or 5** (only remaining positions not ruled out).
5. The secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ _`, with C in position 3 or 5.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test **C in position 5** to resolve its position (if C is correct in position 5, it's confirmed; if marked ""present but wrong position,"" C must be in position 3).
- Introduce **new letters** to maximize information: avoid excluded letters (R, A, N, B, L, H) and reuse E in position 2.
- Choose a valid 5-letter word fitting `_ E _ _ C`.

### Chosen word: **""MEDIC""**
- **M**: New letter (position 1).
- **E**: Correct position (position 2, confirmed).
- **D**: New letter (position 3).
- **I**: New letter (position 4).
- **C**: Tested in position 5 (to resolve C's position).

This guess efficiently:
- Confirms E in position 2.
- Tests C in position 5 (narrowing C to position 3 or 5).
- Checks three new letters (M, D, I) for presence/position.
- Avoids excluded letters.

<guess>medic</guess>",medic,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  - R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""belch"" -> Feedback: B(x), E(✓), L(x), C(-), H(x)
Interpretation:
  - E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E in the second position.
  - C is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""belch"", C is at position 4 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - B, L, H are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Known:
- The secret word has E in position 2 (from guess 2: E(✓)).
- The secret word contains C, but not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So C must be in position 3 or 5? (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by E).
  But note: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is E, so C cannot be there. So C must be in position 3 or 5? However, we have to consider that in guess 1, C was in position 1 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there. In guess 2, C was in position 4 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there. So C must be in position 3 or 5.

- Excluded letters: R, A, N (from guess1), and B, L, H (from guess2). So total excluded: R, A, N, B, L, H.

- We know the word has at least two letters: E (at position 2) and C (somewhere, not 1,2,4).

What about the other positions? We have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill, but note:
  Position 2 is fixed as E.
  Position 1: cannot be C (from guess1) and cannot be any excluded letter. Also, we don't know what it is.
  Position 3: could be C? or another letter.
  Position 4: cannot be C (from guess2) and not excluded.
  Position 5: could be C? or another letter.

But note: in guess1, E was in position 5 and got (-), meaning E is present but not at 5. But we now know E is at position 2, so that's consistent.

Now, the secret word has C in either position 3 or 5.

We also need to find the other letters. We have three positions to fill: 1, 3 (if C is not there), 4, and 5 (if C is not there). Actually, if C is in position 3, then positions 1,4,5 are open. If C is in position 5, then positions 1,3,4 are open.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, H. So we should avoid these except C and E which are in the word.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has E in position 2 (fixed).
  - Has C in either position 3 or 5? Actually, we don't know which one, so we might want to test one of the possibilities? Or we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven't tested? We have tested C in position1 and position4. The only positions left are 3 and 5.

But note: we have not tested position3 or position5 for C. So we can try to put C in one of these to see.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities? But we can only make one guess.

We also want to test new letters.

Let me list the available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones (R,A,N,B,L,H) and minus the known ones (C,E). So excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H. That's 6 letters. So 20 letters left? But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can try to form words that have E in second position and C in either 3 or 5.

Case 1: C in position 3.
  Then the word pattern: _ E C _ _
  We need to fill positions 1,4,5 with letters not in {R,A,N,B,L,H} and not C or E (but C and E are already placed).

Case 2: C in position 5.
  Then the word pattern: _ E _ _ C

We don't know which case, so we can design a guess that helps us distinguish.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position 3 and then other new letters? Or in position 5?

Let me think of words that fit each pattern.

Pattern 1: _ E C _ _ 
  Examples: 
    ""PECAN"" -> but A and N are excluded? Invalid.
    ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2, C at3, O at4, Y at5 -> D, O, Y are new? And not excluded? 
    ""RECUT"" -> R excluded? Invalid.
    ""DECKS"": D at1, E at2, C at3, K at4, S at5 -> D, K, S new? 
    ""DECOR"" -> R excluded? Invalid.

Pattern 2: _ E _ _ C
  Examples:
    ""DEUCE"" -> D at1, E at2, U at3, C at5? Wait, but we have 5 letters: D E U C E? Actually, ""DEUCE"" is D-E-U-C-E? So positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C? No, that would be DEUCE: 
        Position1: D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E -> but then C is at position4? But we are considering C at position5? 
    Actually, we need C at position5. So:
        ""PIECE"": P at1, I at2? But position2 is E? So not. 
        ""BEVYC"": B is excluded? 
        ""DEVOT"": D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, T at5? But then C is not in the word? 
        We need C at position5: so the word must end with C? 
        Examples: ""MUSIC"": M at1, U at2? But position2 must be E? So not. 
        ""TOPIC"": T at1, O at2? Not E. 
        ""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> that's a word? TEPIC is a city? 
        ""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> valid? 

So we have two candidate patterns? But we don't know which one.

We can choose a word that has C in position 3? Then if we get feedback that C is in the correct position, we know. If not, then C must be in position5? But note: if we put C in position3 and it is actually in position5, then the feedback for C will be (x) meaning not present? Or (-) meaning present but wrong position? 

Wait: if the secret word has C in position5, and we put C in position3, then the feedback for that C will be (-) because it's present but in the wrong position? Similarly, if we put C in position5 and the secret has it in position3, then we get (-) for the C in position5? 

But we already know C is in the word? So if we put C in a position and it's not the correct one, we get (-). If we put it in the correct position, we get (✓).

So we can design a guess that puts C in position3? Then:
  If we get (✓) for C, then we know C is at position3.
  If we get (-) for C, then since we know C is not in position1,2,4, and we are testing position3, then if it's (-) that means C must be in position5? Because those are the only positions left? 

Similarly, if we put C in position5 and get (✓), then it's at5. If (-), then it must be at3? 

But note: we have only two possibilities: 3 or 5? So we can choose either and we will know.

But we also want to test other letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven't tested? We have tested position1 and 4. So 3 and 5 are untested. 

I think we should choose a word that has C in position3? Because position5 is the last position and might be less common? 

But let's see the examples: 

  If we choose a word with C in position3: e.g., ""DECOY""
    Pattern: D E C O Y
    We get feedback on D, O, Y? And on C: if C is at3, then ✓. If not, then - (meaning it must be at5).

  If we choose a word with C in position5: e.g., ""MEDIC""
    Pattern: M E D I C
    Feedback: M, D, I? And C: if at5, then ✓. Else, - (meaning at3).

Both are valid. 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H.

In ""DECOY"": D, O, Y are not excluded? 
In ""MEDIC"": M, D, I are not excluded? 

But we also have to consider that we might get more information about the other positions.

We are on the third guess. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 total, so 4 left? But we are making the third.

I think either is fine. Let me choose ""DECOY"" because it has more common letters? 

But wait: in ""DECOY"", we have O and Y? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have C at all? But we know C is in the word? So we must include C? Because if we don't, we won't get information about its position? And we have to include it? 

No, we must include C? Actually, the rules don't require that we include known letters? But if we don't, we might not get the position? And we are limited in guesses. 

But we know C is in the word? So we should include it to get its position? 

So I think ""DECOY"" is a good candidate.

But let me check: 
  ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2 (fixed, so we expect ✓ for E), C at3, O at4, Y at5.

What feedback we might get?
  - If the secret word has C at position3: then C will be ✓.
  - If the secret word has C at position5: then the C in position3 will be marked as (-) because it's present but not at3? And then we know C must be at5? 
  - Also, we get feedback on D, O, Y: if they are in the word? 

But note: the secret word has E at2, so we know E at2 will be ✓.

So let's go with ""DECOY"".

But wait: what if the secret word has both C at3 and another C? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one C? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in position5? 

But I think ""DECOY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more positions? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has C in position5? And also tests common letters? 

For example, ""TOPIC"": but position2 must be E? So not. 

""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> but is ""TEPIC"" common? Maybe not.

""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> common word.

""MEDIC"" vs ""DECOY"": both are valid.

But ""DECOY"" has the advantage that it tests position3 for C? And we haven't tested position3? 

But we haven't tested position5 either? 

I think we can choose either. Let me pick ""MEDIC"" because it has more common letters? 

But note: in ""MEDIC"", we have D at position3? And if the secret word has C at position3? Then we are putting D at3? We don't know about D? 

But we are testing D? 

Actually, both words are testing three new letters. 

I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because it's a common word.

So guess: MEDIC.

But let me write it: M-E-D-I-C.

Now, what if the secret word has C at position3? Then in ""MEDIC"", the C at position5 will be marked as (-) meaning present but not at5? And we will know that C must be at3? 

Similarly, if C is at5, then we get ✓ for C at5? 

Also, we get feedback on M, D, I? 

So it's good.

Therefore, our third guess: MEDIC.

<guess>medic</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (present, wrong position), R (absent), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).
- **Guess 2: ""belch""** → B (absent), E (correct position), L (absent), C (present, wrong position), H (absent).

### Deductions:
1. **E is in position 2** (from ""belch"" feedback: E(✓)).
2. **C is in the word** but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out by feedback from ""crane"" and ""belch"").
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, B, L, H (marked absent in prior guesses).
4. **C must be in position 3 or 5** (only remaining positions not ruled out).
5. The secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ _`, with C in position 3 or 5.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test **C in position 5** to resolve its position (if C is correct in position 5, it's confirmed; if marked ""present but wrong position,"" C must be in position 3).
- Introduce **new letters** to maximize information: avoid excluded letters (R, A, N, B, L, H) and reuse E in position 2.
- Choose a valid 5-letter word fitting `_ E _ _ C`.

### Chosen word: **""MEDIC""**
- **M**: New letter (position 1).
- **E**: Correct position (position 2, confirmed).
- **D**: New letter (position 3).
- **I**: New letter (position 4).
- **C**: Tested in position 5 (to resolve C's position).

This guess efficiently:
- Confirms E in position 2.
- Tests C in position 5 (narrowing C to position 3 or 5).
- Checks three new letters (M, D, I) for presence/position.
- Avoids excluded letters.",Guess 3: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(-),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We got feedback for ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (because it's marked with - meaning wrong position).
   - R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).
   - E is present in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""crane"", E is the fifth letter and it's marked with -).

 So, we know:
   - The secret word contains C and E, but not R, A, N.
   - C is not in the first position (so the word does not start with C). 
   - E is not in the fifth position.

 Also, since C is present but not in first position, it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
 But note: we have five positions, and E is also present but not in fifth.

 Let's list the letters we know: 
   Included: C, E
   Excluded: R, A, N

 For our next guess, we must:
   - Include C and E (since they are in the word).
   - Exclude R, A, N.
   - Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since C is not in first position, we can try putting C in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But note that E is also present and not in fifth.

 However, we have to consider that E is not in fifth, so it must be in one of the first four positions.

 Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5? But note: if C is in position 5, then E cannot be in position 5, which we already know because E is not in fifth.

 We don't know the positions for C and E.

 We also know that the first letter was not C (from feedback: C(-) and in position1, so it's wrong position meaning the letter in position1 is not C).

 So, let's think of words that contain C and E, exclude R,A,N, and have C not in first and E not in fifth.

 We can try to use common letters. Since we don't have many letters, we can look for words that have C and E.

 Let me think of some words:
   - words with C and E: ""slice"", ""price"", ""dice"", ""nice"", ""piece"", etc.

 But note the feedback: In the previous guess, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning E is present but not in fifth. So in our next word, we know E must not be in fifth? Actually, we can put E in any position except fifth? Not necessarily: the feedback only said the E was not in fifth in the secret word. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we must avoid putting E in fifth again because we know it's not there.

 Similarly, C was in position1 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not in position1. So we cannot put C in position1.

 Therefore, for our next guess:
   - Must include C and E (we know they are in the word).
   - Exclude R,A,N.
   - C cannot be in position1.
   - E cannot be in position5.

 We also want to cover new letters to get information.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
   - C in position 2,3, or 4? We don't know, so we can try a different position.
   - E in position 1,2,3,4.

 Example: 
   Let's try ""SPICE"":
     S (new) at position1, P (new) at position2, I (new) at position3, C at position4, E at position5.

 But wait, we cannot put E in position5! Because we know E is not in fifth position. So ""SPICE"" has E in fifth -> invalid for our knowledge.

 Let's try ""PIECE"": 
   P at1, I at2, E at3, C at4, E at5? But not only E appears twice? And E is in fifth -> invalid.

 How about ""CLIMB""? But it doesn't have E.

 We need a word with both C and E.

 Consider ""SCENE"": 
   S at1, C at2, E at3, N at4, E at5. But N is excluded? We know N is not in the word because in ""crane"" N got marked 'x'. So we cannot use N.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at1, C at2, O at3, P at4, E at5 -> E at fifth? Not allowed.

 So we must avoid E in fifth.

 What about ""CELLO""? 
   C at position1 -> not allowed. We cannot put C at first.

 We must avoid C at first and E at fifth.

 Let me think: words starting with a different letter, then C somewhere else and E in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   ""EXCEL"": 
     E at1, X at2, C at3, E at4, L at5. 
     This has E at1 and at4? But also note: the word has two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters, but we know E is present and may appear multiple times? We don't know yet.

 However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E marked as present but not in fifth. It doesn't say anything about how many times E appears. So duplicate letters are possible? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol. So if there's one E and we guessed one E, it will be marked accordingly.

 But in ""EXCEL"": 
   Letter E: appears in position1 and 4? 
   But the secret word has E? We don't know if there are two E's. We only know that at least one E is present.

 However, we must avoid using letters that are excluded: R,A,N.

 ""EXCEL"": 
   E (okay), X (new), C (known), E, L (new). 
   Positions: 
     E at1 -> we don't know if E can be at first? The feedback said E is not at fifth, so it can be at first? Yes.
     C at3 -> not position1.

 Also, no excluded letters.

 But note: in ""crane"", C was in position1 and marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in first. When we move C to position3, we are testing a new position.

 Let's consider: 
   If the secret word has E at first, we will see E at1 marked with (✓) if exactly at that position? 
   But if not, then it might be marked (-) meaning present but not there? or if the secret word doesn't have E at first, then the E at1 might be marked with (-) meaning present elsewhere? 

 However, we also have to note: if the secret word has only one E and it is in position4, then in ""EXCEL"", the first E would get (-) because wrong position? And the last E in position4? But our word has E at4 and E at1? Actually, note: we have two E's in ""EXCEL"". So if the secret word has one E and it is in position4, then the first E might get (-) because we have to mark the first E? But wait: feedback marks each occurrence. Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it becomes tricky.

 How the game handles duplicates:
   Example: secret word is APPLE. Guess: POINT. P is marked (-) for position1? But wait, secret has only one P? And in position2? So the P in position1 would show (-) meaning the letter P appears but not in first position? 

   However, if you guess two P's: e.g., PAPER. Secret: APPLE. Then the first P would be marked (-) because the secret has P at position2? But the second P might be marked (✓) because position2? Or how?

 Let me recall: 
   - The rules say: each letter in the guess gets one of the symbols.
   - The game compares the secret and the guess. For duplicate letters: 
        If the guess has two of the same letter and the secret has only one, then one of them might be marked with (✓) if it's correct, and the other one might be marked with (x) if the secret doesn't have that many? Actually, the standard Wordle approach is: 
          For each letter in the secret, it is used for one matching guess letter (starting from the exact matches first, then the wrong position).

   So if secret has one P and guess has two P, one in correct position and one not? Actually, the example: secret APPLE, guess PAPER:
      Positions: 
        1: P in guess -> secret position1 is A -> so not correct -> but secret has a P in position2? So the first P gets (-) because there exists a P? 
        Then for the second P: in guess position2, secret has P in position2 -> so correct (✓). 
        Then if we get the third P? There isn't a third P. But we don't have three P's.

   However, in our case: we don't know if the secret has duplicate letters.

 Given the complexity, we want to avoid duplicates if possible? But we don't have much choice.

 But let's think: the word ""EXCEL"" might be valid? However, we have two E's. We don't know if the secret has two E's. We are going to get feedback that might be confusing? 

 Alternative: can we find a word without duplicate letters, with C in a position other than first and E in a position other than fifth? And without R,A,N.

 List of letters we haven't used: 
   We guessed: C,R,A,N,E -> so we know about C and E (present), R,A,N (absent).
   Remaining letters: many, except these.

 Let me think of words that meet the criteria:

   We want: 
      [Letter1] (not C), [Letter2], C, [Letter3], [Letter4] - but E must be in one of positions 2,3,4? Or positions1? Actually, E can be in any position except fifth.

   So E could be in position1? Then we have: E at1, and then C can be in 2,3,4? And then the word must have E in the first part.

   Example: ""ECLAT"" -> but A? A is excluded.

   Example: ""EDUCE"": 
        E at1 (okay), D at2 (new), U at3 (new), C at4 (okay, position not first), E at5 -> wait, E at5: we know E cannot be at fifth? So invalid.

   Example: ""OUNCE"": 
        O at1 (new), U at2 (new), N at3 -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

   Example: ""SLEET"": 
        S at1, L at2, E at3, E at4, T at5 -> but has E at3 and 4: duplicate? And E at3 is not fifth? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, it has two E's and one L and S and T.

   But I don't want duplicate E if possible? 

   Example: ""STOIC"":
        S at1, T at2?, O at3, I at4, C at5 -> but no E? We must include E because we know it is required.

   Another: ""PIECE"" has E twice? 

   How about ""CEDED"": 
        C at1 -> not allowed? We cannot put C at first. 

   Let me try: ""BELCH"": 
        B at1, E at2 (okay), L at3, C at4 (okay, not first), H at5 -> no E at fifth? But it has E at2. So valid? And includes E and C, no A,R,N.

   Also, ""BELCH"": 
        Letters: B, E, L, C, H -> all new? We know C and E.

   Let me check: 
        B at1: new? yes.
        E at2: known -> and we are testing if E is at2? 
        L at3: new
        C at4: known -> and we move C from previous position1 to position4.

   This might be a good guess? It covers:
        Position1: new letter B
        Position2: E (we know E is in the word, but where? Now testing position2)
        Position3: L
        Position4: C (we know C is in the word, but not in first -> so somewhere else: now position4)
        Position5: H

   So we'll get feedback on B, L, H? And if E is at2 then we'll get ✓ at2? Else if E is elsewhere then -. Similarly for C at4.

   Alternatively, if the secret word has E at2 and C at4? Then we might get ✓ for both? 

   Or, if the secret word doesn't have E at2, then E will be marked as (-) meaning present but not in that position? Similarly for C.

   Also, we'll check if B, L, H are in the word? 

   There might be other words? Let me think of ""CHOLE"" -> but that's a root word? Might not be common. 

   Another common word: ""TEACH"": 
        T at1 (new), E at2 (okay), A? A is excluded -> invalid.

   ""CHESS"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we cannot put C at first.

   ""SPEED"": 
        S at1? Then P at2, E at3, E at4, D at5 -> two E's? And D? And no C? So missing C -> invalid.

   Therefore, I choose ""BELCH"".

   However, note: the feedback we got for ""crane"" shows that the secret word has both C and E? So why not include them? Yes.

   Alternatively: ""CEDES"" -> C at1? Not allowed.

   Another: ""COMET"": 
        C at1 -> invalid? Because we can't put C at first.

   ""SCREAM"": but that's 6 letters? We need 5.

   After consideration, ""BELCH"" seems a reasonable guess.

   Let me confirm: 
        B, E, L, C, H -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""BELCH"": letters are B, E, L, C, H -> distinct? Yes. 

   So let's go with ""BELCH"".

   Feedback we might get? 
        If the secret word has E at position2? Then we'll get E marked as ✓ at2? 
        If C is at position4? Then C will be ✓ at4? 
        But note: the secret word might have E and C in different positions? 

   We are trying to cover new letters (B,L,H) and test the known letters in new positions.

   Another option: ""BLEEP"" -> has two E's? And P? And includes E? But also E at5? Not allowed.

   So ""BELCH"" seems acceptable.

   If ""BELCH"" is not a common word? But I think it is (as a verb: to eject gas noisily). 

   Alternatively, we could try ""FILET"": but no E? Wait, ""FILET"" has E? Let me check: F-I-L-E-T -> has E at position4? But no C? So missing C.

   So I'm going with ""BELCH"".

 Guess: BELCH.

<guess>belch</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C is present but not in position 1, E is present but not in position 5, and R, A, N are absent), the following is deduced:

- **C and E** must appear in the new guess, but **C cannot be in position 1** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- R, A, and N are excluded.
- The guess should introduce new letters to gain more information while adhering to the constraints.

The word ""belch"" was chosen because:
- It includes the required letters **C (position 4)** and **E (position 2)**, satisfying positional constraints.
- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, N.
- It tests new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), and H (position 5), maximizing information gain.
- ""Belch"" is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters, reducing ambiguity.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: belch -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) C(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  - R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""belch"" -> Feedback: B(x), E(✓), L(x), C(-), H(x)
Interpretation:
  - E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E in the second position.
  - C is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""belch"", C is at position 4 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - B, L, H are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Known:
- The secret word has E in position 2 (from guess 2: E(✓)).
- The secret word contains C, but not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So C must be in position 3 or 5? (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by E).
  But note: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is E, so C cannot be there. So C must be in position 3 or 5? However, we have to consider that in guess 1, C was in position 1 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there. In guess 2, C was in position 4 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there. So C must be in position 3 or 5.

- Excluded letters: R, A, N (from guess1), and B, L, H (from guess2). So total excluded: R, A, N, B, L, H.

- We know the word has at least two letters: E (at position 2) and C (somewhere, not 1,2,4).

What about the other positions? We have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill, but note:
  Position 2 is fixed as E.
  Position 1: cannot be C (from guess1) and cannot be any excluded letter. Also, we don't know what it is.
  Position 3: could be C? or another letter.
  Position 4: cannot be C (from guess2) and not excluded.
  Position 5: could be C? or another letter.

But note: in guess1, E was in position 5 and got (-), meaning E is present but not at 5. But we now know E is at position 2, so that's consistent.

Now, the secret word has C in either position 3 or 5.

We also need to find the other letters. We have three positions to fill: 1, 3 (if C is not there), 4, and 5 (if C is not there). Actually, if C is in position 3, then positions 1,4,5 are open. If C is in position 5, then positions 1,3,4 are open.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, H. So we should avoid these except C and E which are in the word.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has E in position 2 (fixed).
  - Has C in either position 3 or 5? Actually, we don't know which one, so we might want to test one of the possibilities? Or we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven't tested? We have tested C in position1 and position4. The only positions left are 3 and 5.

But note: we have not tested position3 or position5 for C. So we can try to put C in one of these to see.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities? But we can only make one guess.

We also want to test new letters.

Let me list the available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones (R,A,N,B,L,H) and minus the known ones (C,E). So excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H. That's 6 letters. So 20 letters left? But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can try to form words that have E in second position and C in either 3 or 5.

Case 1: C in position 3.
  Then the word pattern: _ E C _ _
  We need to fill positions 1,4,5 with letters not in {R,A,N,B,L,H} and not C or E (but C and E are already placed).

Case 2: C in position 5.
  Then the word pattern: _ E _ _ C

We don't know which case, so we can design a guess that helps us distinguish.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position 3 and then other new letters? Or in position 5?

Let me think of words that fit each pattern.

Pattern 1: _ E C _ _ 
  Examples: 
    ""PECAN"" -> but A and N are excluded? Invalid.
    ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2, C at3, O at4, Y at5 -> D, O, Y are new? And not excluded? 
    ""RECUT"" -> R excluded? Invalid.
    ""DECKS"": D at1, E at2, C at3, K at4, S at5 -> D, K, S new? 
    ""DECOR"" -> R excluded? Invalid.

Pattern 2: _ E _ _ C
  Examples:
    ""DEUCE"" -> D at1, E at2, U at3, C at5? Wait, but we have 5 letters: D E U C E? Actually, ""DEUCE"" is D-E-U-C-E? So positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C? No, that would be DEUCE: 
        Position1: D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E -> but then C is at position4? But we are considering C at position5? 
    Actually, we need C at position5. So:
        ""PIECE"": P at1, I at2? But position2 is E? So not. 
        ""BEVYC"": B is excluded? 
        ""DEVOT"": D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, T at5? But then C is not in the word? 
        We need C at position5: so the word must end with C? 
        Examples: ""MUSIC"": M at1, U at2? But position2 must be E? So not. 
        ""TOPIC"": T at1, O at2? Not E. 
        ""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> that's a word? TEPIC is a city? 
        ""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> valid? 

So we have two candidate patterns? But we don't know which one.

We can choose a word that has C in position 3? Then if we get feedback that C is in the correct position, we know. If not, then C must be in position5? But note: if we put C in position3 and it is actually in position5, then the feedback for C will be (x) meaning not present? Or (-) meaning present but wrong position? 

Wait: if the secret word has C in position5, and we put C in position3, then the feedback for that C will be (-) because it's present but in the wrong position? Similarly, if we put C in position5 and the secret has it in position3, then we get (-) for the C in position5? 

But we already know C is in the word? So if we put C in a position and it's not the correct one, we get (-). If we put it in the correct position, we get (✓).

So we can design a guess that puts C in position3? Then:
  If we get (✓) for C, then we know C is at position3.
  If we get (-) for C, then since we know C is not in position1,2,4, and we are testing position3, then if it's (-) that means C must be in position5? Because those are the only positions left? 

Similarly, if we put C in position5 and get (✓), then it's at5. If (-), then it must be at3? 

But note: we have only two possibilities: 3 or 5? So we can choose either and we will know.

But we also want to test other letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven't tested? We have tested position1 and 4. So 3 and 5 are untested. 

I think we should choose a word that has C in position3? Because position5 is the last position and might be less common? 

But let's see the examples: 

  If we choose a word with C in position3: e.g., ""DECOY""
    Pattern: D E C O Y
    We get feedback on D, O, Y? And on C: if C is at3, then ✓. If not, then - (meaning it must be at5).

  If we choose a word with C in position5: e.g., ""MEDIC""
    Pattern: M E D I C
    Feedback: M, D, I? And C: if at5, then ✓. Else, - (meaning at3).

Both are valid. 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H.

In ""DECOY"": D, O, Y are not excluded? 
In ""MEDIC"": M, D, I are not excluded? 

But we also have to consider that we might get more information about the other positions.

We are on the third guess. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 total, so 4 left? But we are making the third.

I think either is fine. Let me choose ""DECOY"" because it has more common letters? 

But wait: in ""DECOY"", we have O and Y? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have C at all? But we know C is in the word? So we must include C? Because if we don't, we won't get information about its position? And we have to include it? 

No, we must include C? Actually, the rules don't require that we include known letters? But if we don't, we might not get the position? And we are limited in guesses. 

But we know C is in the word? So we should include it to get its position? 

So I think ""DECOY"" is a good candidate.

But let me check: 
  ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2 (fixed, so we expect ✓ for E), C at3, O at4, Y at5.

What feedback we might get?
  - If the secret word has C at position3: then C will be ✓.
  - If the secret word has C at position5: then the C in position3 will be marked as (-) because it's present but not at3? And then we know C must be at5? 
  - Also, we get feedback on D, O, Y: if they are in the word? 

But note: the secret word has E at2, so we know E at2 will be ✓.

So let's go with ""DECOY"".

But wait: what if the secret word has both C at3 and another C? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one C? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in position5? 

But I think ""DECOY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more positions? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has C in position5? And also tests common letters? 

For example, ""TOPIC"": but position2 must be E? So not. 

""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> but is ""TEPIC"" common? Maybe not.

""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> common word.

""MEDIC"" vs ""DECOY"": both are valid.

But ""DECOY"" has the advantage that it tests position3 for C? And we haven't tested position3? 

But we haven't tested position5 either? 

I think we can choose either. Let me pick ""MEDIC"" because it has more common letters? 

But note: in ""MEDIC"", we have D at position3? And if the secret word has C at position3? Then we are putting D at3? We don't know about D? 

But we are testing D? 

Actually, both words are testing three new letters. 

I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because it's a common word.

So guess: MEDIC.

But let me write it: M-E-D-I-C.

Now, what if the secret word has C at position3? Then in ""MEDIC"", the C at position5 will be marked as (-) meaning present but not at5? And we will know that C must be at3? 

Similarly, if C is at5, then we get ✓ for C at5? 

Also, we get feedback on M, D, I? 

So it's good.

Therefore, our third guess: MEDIC.

<guess>medic</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (present, wrong position), R (absent), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).
- **Guess 2: ""belch""** → B (absent), E (correct position), L (absent), C (present, wrong position), H (absent).

### Deductions:
1. **E is in position 2** (from ""belch"" feedback: E(✓)).
2. **C is in the word** but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out by feedback from ""crane"" and ""belch"").
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, B, L, H (marked absent in prior guesses).
4. **C must be in position 3 or 5** (only remaining positions not ruled out).
5. The secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ _`, with C in position 3 or 5.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test **C in position 5** to resolve its position (if C is correct in position 5, it's confirmed; if marked ""present but wrong position,"" C must be in position 3).
- Introduce **new letters** to maximize information: avoid excluded letters (R, A, N, B, L, H) and reuse E in position 2.
- Choose a valid 5-letter word fitting `_ E _ _ C`.

### Chosen word: **""MEDIC""**
- **M**: New letter (position 1).
- **E**: Correct position (position 2, confirmed).
- **D**: New letter (position 3).
- **I**: New letter (position 4).
- **C**: Tested in position 5 (to resolve C's position).

This guess efficiently:
- Confirms E in position 2.
- Tests C in position 5 (narrowing C to position 3 or 5).
- Checks three new letters (M, D, I) for presence/position.
- Avoids excluded letters.

We don\'t know, so we can try a different position.\n   - E in position 1,2,3,4.\n\n Example: \n   Let\'s try ""SPICE"":\n     S (new) at position1, P (new) at position2, I (new) at position3, C at position4, E at position5.\n\n But wait, we cannot put E in position5! Because we know E is not in fifth position. So ""SPICE"" has E in fifth -> invalid for our knowledge.\n\n Let\'s try ""PIECE"": \n   P at1, I at2, E at3, C at4, E at5? But not only E appears twice? And E is in fifth -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CLIMB""? But it doesn\'t have E.\n\n We need a word with both C and E.\n\n Consider ""SCENE"": \n   S at1, C at2, E at3, N at4, E at5. But N is excluded? We know N is not in the word because in ""crane"" N got marked \'x\'. So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""SCOPE""? \n   S at1, C at2, O at3, P at4, E at5 -> E at fifth? Not allowed.\n\n So we must avoid E in fifth.\n\n What about ""CELLO""? \n   C at position1 -> not allowed. We cannot put C at first.\n\n We must avoid C at first and E at fifth.\n\n Let me think: words starting with a different letter, then C somewhere else and E in positions 1-4.\n\n Example: \n   ""EXCEL"": \n     E at1, X at2, C at3, E at4, L at5. \n     This has E at1 and at4? But also note: the word has two E\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters, but we know E is present and may appear multiple times? We don\'t know yet.\n\n However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E marked as present but not in fifth. It doesn\'t say anything about how many times E appears. So duplicate letters are possible? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol. So if there\'s one E and we guessed one E, it will be marked accordingly.\n\n But in ""EXCEL"": \n   Letter E: appears in position1 and 4? \n   But the secret word has E? We don\'t know if there are two E\'s. We only know that at least one E is present.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that are excluded: R,A,N.\n\n ""EXCEL"": \n   E (okay), X (new), C (known), E, L (new). \n   Positions: \n     E at1 -> we don\'t know if E can be at first? The feedback said E is not at fifth, so it can be at first? Yes.\n     C at3 -> not position1.\n\n Also, no excluded letters.\n\n But note: in ""crane"", C was in position1 and marked (-) meaning it is in the word but not in first. When we move C to position3, we are testing a new position.\n\n Let\'s consider: \n   If the secret word has E at first, we will see E at1 marked with (✓) if exactly at that position? \n   But if not, then it might be marked (-) meaning present but not there? or if the secret word doesn\'t have E at first, then the E at1 might be marked with (-) meaning present elsewhere? \n\n However, we also have to note: if the secret word has only one E and it is in position4, then in ""EXCEL"", the first E would get (-) because wrong position? And the last E in position4? But our word has E at4 and E at1? Actually, note: we have two E\'s in ""EXCEL"". So if the secret word has one E and it is in position4, then the first E might get (-) because we have to mark the first E? But wait: feedback marks each occurrence. Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it becomes tricky.\n\n How the game handles duplicates:\n   Example: secret word is APPLE. Guess: POINT. P is marked (-) for position1? But wait, secret has only one P? And in position2? So the P in position1 would show (-) meaning the letter P appears but not in first position? \n\n   However, if you guess two P\'s: e.g., PAPER. Secret: APPLE. Then the first P would be marked (-) because the secret has P at position2? But the second P might be marked (✓) because position2? Or how?\n\n Let me recall: \n   - The rules say: each letter in the guess gets one of the symbols.\n   - The game compares the secret and the guess. For duplicate letters: \n        If the guess has two of the same letter and the secret has only one, then one of them might be marked with (✓) if it\'s correct, and the other one might be marked with (x) if the secret doesn\'t have that many? Actually, the standard Wordle approach is: \n          For each letter in the secret, it is used for one matching guess letter (starting from the exact matches first, then the wrong position).\n\n   So if secret has one P and guess has two P, one in correct position and one not? Actually, the example: secret APPLE, guess PAPER:\n      Positions: \n        1: P in guess -> secret position1 is A -> so not correct -> but secret has a P in position2? So the first P gets (-) because there exists a P? \n        Then for the second P: in guess position2, secret has P in position2 -> so correct (✓). \n        Then if we get the third P? There isn\'t a third P. But we don\'t have three P\'s.\n\n   However, in our case: we don\'t know if the secret has duplicate letters.\n\n Given the complexity, we want to avoid duplicates if possible? But we don\'t have much choice.\n\n But let\'s think: the word ""EXCEL"" might be valid? However, we have two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret has two E\'s. We are going to get feedback that might be confusing? \n\n Alternative: can we find a word without duplicate letters, with C in a position other than first and E in a position other than fifth? And without R,A,N.\n\n List of letters we haven\'t used: \n   We guessed: C,R,A,N,E -> so we know about C and E (present), R,A,N (absent).\n   Remaining letters: many, except these.\n\n Let me think of words that meet the criteria:\n\n   We want: \n      [Letter1] (not C), [Letter2], C, [Letter3], [Letter4] - but E must be in one of positions 2,3,4? Or positions1? Actually, E can be in any position except fifth.\n\n   So E could be in position1? Then we have: E at1, and then C can be in 2,3,4? And then the word must have E in the first part.\n\n   Example: ""ECLAT"" -> but A? A is excluded.\n\n   Example: ""EDUCE"": \n        E at1 (okay), D at2 (new), U at3 (new), C at4 (okay, position not first), E at5 -> wait, E at5: we know E cannot be at fifth? So invalid.\n\n   Example: ""OUNCE"": \n        O at1 (new), U at2 (new), N at3 -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n   Example: ""SLEET"": \n        S at1, L at2, E at3, E at4, T at5 -> but has E at3 and 4: duplicate? And E at3 is not fifth? But we don\'t know about duplicates? Also, it has two E\'s and one L and S and T.\n\n   But I don\'t want duplicate E if possible? \n\n   Example: ""STOIC"":\n        S at1, T at2?, O at3, I at4, C at5 -> but no E? We must include E because we know it is required.\n\n   Another: ""PIECE"" has E twice? \n\n   How about ""CEDED"": \n        C at1 -> not allowed? We cannot put C at first. \n\n   Let me try: ""BELCH"": \n        B at1, E at2 (okay), L at3, C at4 (okay, not first), H at5 -> no E at fifth? But it has E at2. So valid? And includes E and C, no A,R,N.\n\n   Also, ""BELCH"": \n        Letters: B, E, L, C, H -> all new? We know C and E.\n\n   Let me check: \n        B at1: new? yes.\n        E at2: known -> and we are testing if E is at2? \n        L at3: new\n        C at4: known -> and we move C from previous position1 to position4.\n\n   This might be a good guess? It covers:\n        Position1: new letter B\n        Position2: E (we know E is in the word, but where? Now testing position2)\n        Position3: L\n        Position4: C (we know C is in the word, but not in first -> so somewhere else: now position4)\n        Position5: H\n\n   So we\'ll get feedback on B, L, H? And if E is at2 then we\'ll get ✓ at2? Else if E is elsewhere then -. Similarly for C at4.\n\n   Alternatively, if the secret word has E at2 and C at4? Then we might get ✓ for both? \n\n   Or, if the secret word doesn\'t have E at2, then E will be marked as (-) meaning present but not in that position? Similarly for C.\n\n   Also, we\'ll check if B, L, H are in the word? \n\n   There might be other words? Let me think of ""CHOLE"" -> but that\'s a root word? Might not be common. \n\n   Another common word: ""TEACH"": \n        T at1 (new), E at2 (okay), A? A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""CHESS"": \n        C at1 -> invalid? Because we cannot put C at first.\n\n   ""SPEED"": \n        S at1? Then P at2, E at3, E at4, D at5 -> two E\'s? And D? And no C? So missing C -> invalid.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""BELCH"".\n\n   However, note: the feedback we got for ""crane"" shows that the secret word has both C and E? So why not include them? Yes.\n\n   Alternatively: ""CEDES"" -> C at1? Not allowed.\n\n   Another: ""COMET"": \n        C at1 -> invalid? Because we can\'t put C at first.\n\n   ""SCREAM"": but that\'s 6 letters? We need 5.\n\n   After consideration, ""BELCH"" seems a reasonable guess.\n\n   Let me confirm: \n        B, E, L, C, H -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""BELCH"": letters are B, E, L, C, H -> distinct? Yes. \n\n   So let\'s go with ""BELCH"".\n\n   Feedback we might get? \n        If the secret word has E at position2? Then we\'ll get E marked as ✓ at2? \n        If C is at position4? Then C will be ✓ at4? \n        But note: the secret word might have E and C in different positions? \n\n   We are trying to cover new letters (B,L,H) and test the known letters in new positions.\n\n   Another option: ""BLEEP"" -> has two E\'s? And P? And includes E? But also E at5? Not allowed.\n\n   So ""BELCH"" seems acceptable.\n\n   If ""BELCH"" is not a common word? But I think it is (as a verb: to eject gas noisily). \n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""FILET"": but no E? Wait, ""FILET"" has E? Let me check: F-I-L-E-T -> has E at position4? But no C? So missing C.\n\n   So I\'m going with ""BELCH"".\n\n Guess: BELCH.\n\n<guess>belch</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C is present but not in position 1, E is present but not in position 5, and R, A, N are absent), the following is deduced:\n\n- **C and E** must appear in the new guess, but **C cannot be in position 1** and **E cannot be in position 5**.\n- R, A, and N are excluded.\n- The guess should introduce new letters to gain more information while adhering to the constraints.\n\nThe word ""belch"" was chosen because:\n- It includes the required letters **C (position 4)** and **E (position 2)**, satisfying positional constraints.\n- It avoids the excluded letters R, A, N.\n- It tests new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), and H (position 5), maximizing information gain.\n- ""Belch"" is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters, reducing ambiguity.\n\n<guess>belch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: belch -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) C(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nInterpretation:\n  - C is in the word but not in position 1.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n  - R, A, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""belch"" -> Feedback: B(x), E(✓), L(x), C(-), H(x)\nInterpretation:\n  - E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E in the second position.\n  - C is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""belch"", C is at position 4 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).\n  - B, L, H are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nKnown:\n- The secret word has E in position 2 (from guess 2: E(✓)).\n- The secret word contains C, but not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So C must be in position 3 or 5? (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by E).\n  But note: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is E, so C cannot be there. So C must be in position 3 or 5? However, we have to consider that in guess 1, C was in position 1 and got (-), meaning it\'s present but not there. In guess 2, C was in position 4 and got (-), meaning it\'s present but not there. So C must be in position 3 or 5.\n\n- Excluded letters: R, A, N (from guess1), and B, L, H (from guess2). So total excluded: R, A, N, B, L, H.\n\n- We know the word has at least two letters: E (at position 2) and C (somewhere, not 1,2,4).\n\nWhat about the other positions? We have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill, but note:\n  Position 2 is fixed as E.\n  Position 1: cannot be C (from guess1) and cannot be any excluded letter. Also, we don\'t know what it is.\n  Position 3: could be C? or another letter.\n  Position 4: cannot be C (from guess2) and not excluded.\n  Position 5: could be C? or another letter.\n\nBut note: in guess1, E was in position 5 and got (-), meaning E is present but not at 5. But we now know E is at position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n\nNow, the secret word has C in either position 3 or 5.\n\nWe also need to find the other letters. We have three positions to fill: 1, 3 (if C is not there), 4, and 5 (if C is not there). Actually, if C is in position 3, then positions 1,4,5 are open. If C is in position 5, then positions 1,3,4 are open.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, H. So we should avoid these except C and E which are in the word.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n  - Has E in position 2 (fixed).\n  - Has C in either position 3 or 5? Actually, we don\'t know which one, so we might want to test one of the possibilities? Or we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested C in position1 and position4. The only positions left are 3 and 5.\n\nBut note: we have not tested position3 or position5 for C. So we can try to put C in one of these to see.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities? But we can only make one guess.\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nLet me list the available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones (R,A,N,B,L,H) and minus the known ones (C,E). So excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H. That\'s 6 letters. So 20 letters left? But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nWe can try to form words that have E in second position and C in either 3 or 5.\n\nCase 1: C in position 3.\n  Then the word pattern: _ E C _ _\n  We need to fill positions 1,4,5 with letters not in {R,A,N,B,L,H} and not C or E (but C and E are already placed).\n\nCase 2: C in position 5.\n  Then the word pattern: _ E _ _ C\n\nWe don\'t know which case, so we can design a guess that helps us distinguish.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has C in position 3 and then other new letters? Or in position 5?\n\nLet me think of words that fit each pattern.\n\nPattern 1: _ E C _ _ \n  Examples: \n    ""PECAN"" -> but A and N are excluded? Invalid.\n    ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2, C at3, O at4, Y at5 -> D, O, Y are new? And not excluded? \n    ""RECUT"" -> R excluded? Invalid.\n    ""DECKS"": D at1, E at2, C at3, K at4, S at5 -> D, K, S new? \n    ""DECOR"" -> R excluded? Invalid.\n\nPattern 2: _ E _ _ C\n  Examples:\n    ""DEUCE"" -> D at1, E at2, U at3, C at5? Wait, but we have 5 letters: D E U C E? Actually, ""DEUCE"" is D-E-U-C-E? So positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C? No, that would be DEUCE: \n        Position1: D, 2:E, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E -> but then C is at position4? But we are considering C at position5? \n    Actually, we need C at position5. So:\n        ""PIECE"": P at1, I at2? But position2 is E? So not. \n        ""BEVYC"": B is excluded? \n        ""DEVOT"": D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, T at5? But then C is not in the word? \n        We need C at position5: so the word must end with C? \n        Examples: ""MUSIC"": M at1, U at2? But position2 must be E? So not. \n        ""TOPIC"": T at1, O at2? Not E. \n        ""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> that\'s a word? TEPIC is a city? \n        ""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> valid? \n\nSo we have two candidate patterns? But we don\'t know which one.\n\nWe can choose a word that has C in position 3? Then if we get feedback that C is in the correct position, we know. If not, then C must be in position5? But note: if we put C in position3 and it is actually in position5, then the feedback for C will be (x) meaning not present? Or (-) meaning present but wrong position? \n\nWait: if the secret word has C in position5, and we put C in position3, then the feedback for that C will be (-) because it\'s present but in the wrong position? Similarly, if we put C in position5 and the secret has it in position3, then we get (-) for the C in position5? \n\nBut we already know C is in the word? So if we put C in a position and it\'s not the correct one, we get (-). If we put it in the correct position, we get (✓).\n\nSo we can design a guess that puts C in position3? Then:\n  If we get (✓) for C, then we know C is at position3.\n  If we get (-) for C, then since we know C is not in position1,2,4, and we are testing position3, then if it\'s (-) that means C must be in position5? Because those are the only positions left? \n\nSimilarly, if we put C in position5 and get (✓), then it\'s at5. If (-), then it must be at3? \n\nBut note: we have only two possibilities: 3 or 5? So we can choose either and we will know.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has C in a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested position1 and 4. So 3 and 5 are untested. \n\nI think we should choose a word that has C in position3? Because position5 is the last position and might be less common? \n\nBut let\'s see the examples: \n\n  If we choose a word with C in position3: e.g., ""DECOY""\n    Pattern: D E C O Y\n    We get feedback on D, O, Y? And on C: if C is at3, then ✓. If not, then - (meaning it must be at5).\n\n  If we choose a word with C in position5: e.g., ""MEDIC""\n    Pattern: M E D I C\n    Feedback: M, D, I? And C: if at5, then ✓. Else, - (meaning at3).\n\nBoth are valid. \n\nBut note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H.\n\nIn ""DECOY"": D, O, Y are not excluded? \nIn ""MEDIC"": M, D, I are not excluded? \n\nBut we also have to consider that we might get more information about the other positions.\n\nWe are on the third guess. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 total, so 4 left? But we are making the third.\n\nI think either is fine. Let me choose ""DECOY"" because it has more common letters? \n\nBut wait: in ""DECOY"", we have O and Y? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have C at all? But we know C is in the word? So we must include C? Because if we don\'t, we won\'t get information about its position? And we have to include it? \n\nNo, we must include C? Actually, the rules don\'t require that we include known letters? But if we don\'t, we might not get the position? And we are limited in guesses. \n\nBut we know C is in the word? So we should include it to get its position? \n\nSo I think ""DECOY"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let me check: \n  ""DECOY"": D at1, E at2 (fixed, so we expect ✓ for E), C at3, O at4, Y at5.\n\nWhat feedback we might get?\n  - If the secret word has C at position3: then C will be ✓.\n  - If the secret word has C at position5: then the C in position3 will be marked as (-) because it\'s present but not at3? And then we know C must be at5? \n  - Also, we get feedback on D, O, Y: if they are in the word? \n\nBut note: the secret word has E at2, so we know E at2 will be ✓.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""DECOY"".\n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has both C at3 and another C? We don\'t know. But we are only required to have at least one C? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has C in position5? \n\nBut I think ""DECOY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests more positions? \n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has C in position5? And also tests common letters? \n\nFor example, ""TOPIC"": but position2 must be E? So not. \n\n""TEPIC"": T at1, E at2, P at3, I at4, C at5 -> but is ""TEPIC"" common? Maybe not.\n\n""MEDIC"": M at1, E at2, D at3, I at4, C at5 -> common word.\n\n""MEDIC"" vs ""DECOY"": both are valid.\n\nBut ""DECOY"" has the advantage that it tests position3 for C? And we haven\'t tested position3? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position5 either? \n\nI think we can choose either. Let me pick ""MEDIC"" because it has more common letters? \n\nBut note: in ""MEDIC"", we have D at position3? And if the secret word has C at position3? Then we are putting D at3? We don\'t know about D? \n\nBut we are testing D? \n\nActually, both words are testing three new letters. \n\nI\'ll go with ""MEDIC"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nSo guess: MEDIC.\n\nBut let me write it: M-E-D-I-C.\n\nNow, what if the secret word has C at position3? Then in ""MEDIC"", the C at position5 will be marked as (-) meaning present but not at5? And we will know that C must be at3? \n\nSimilarly, if C is at5, then we get ✓ for C at5? \n\nAlso, we get feedback on M, D, I? \n\nSo it\'s good.\n\nTherefore, our third guess: MEDIC.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (present, wrong position), R (absent), A (absent), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).\n- **Guess 2: ""belch""** → B (absent), E (correct position), L (absent), C (present, wrong position), H (absent).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **E is in position 2** (from ""belch"" feedback: E(✓)).\n2. **C is in the word** but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out by feedback from ""crane"" and ""belch"").\n3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, B, L, H (marked absent in prior guesses).\n4. **C must be in position 3 or 5** (only remaining positions not ruled out).\n5. The secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ _`, with C in position 3 or 5.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Test **C in position 5** to resolve its position (if C is correct in position 5, it\'s confirmed; if marked ""present but wrong position,"" C must be in position 3).\n- Introduce **new letters** to maximize information: avoid excluded letters (R, A, N, B, L, H) and reuse E in position 2.\n- Choose a valid 5-letter word fitting `_ E _ _ C`.\n\n### Chosen word: **""MEDIC""**\n- **M**: New letter (position 1).\n- **E**: Correct position (position 2, confirmed).\n- **D**: New letter (position 3).\n- **I**: New letter (position 4).\n- **C**: Tested in position 5 (to resolve C\'s position).\n\nThis guess efficiently:\n- Confirms E in position 2.\n- Tests C in position 5 (narrowing C to position 3 or 5).\n- Checks three new letters (M, D, I) for presence/position.\n- Avoids excluded letters.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: belch -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) C(-) H(x)\nGuess 3: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(-): C present but not position 1; R(x): R absent; A(x): A absent; N(x): N absent; E(-): E present but not position 5.
Guess 2: ""belch"" → B(x): B absent; E(✓): E correct in position 2; L(x): L absent; C(-): C present but not position 4; H(x): H absent.
Guess 3: ""medic"" → M(x): M absent; E(✓): E correct in position 2 (confirmed); D(x): D absent; I(x): I absent; C(-): C present but not position 5.

Summary of known facts:
- The secret word has E in position 2 (fixed).
- The secret word contains C, but C is not in position 1 (from guess1), not in position 4 (from guess2), and not in position 5 (from guess3). 
  Therefore, C must be in position 3 (since position 2 is taken by E, so only positions 1,3,4,5 are possible, and 1,4,5 are ruled out).
- Excluded letters: R, A, N (from guess1), B, L, H (from guess2), and M, D, I (from guess3). 
  Total excluded: R, A, N, B, L, H, M, D, I.

So the secret word must have C in position 3 and E in position 2. Thus, the pattern is: _ E C _ _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

Excluded letters: R, A, N, B, L, H, M, D, I. That's 9 letters excluded.

We know the word must be _ E C _ _, and the remaining letters must not be any of the excluded ones.

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that have not been excluded or might be new.

Since we know E and C positions, we focus on positions 1,4,5.

The word must be an English word.

Possible words? Let's think:

Pattern: ? E C ? ?

We've used: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, H, M, D, I from guesses? Actually, we know E and C are in the word, but the others are excluded.

Available letters: not in the excluded list. The alphabet: A-Z minus excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H,M,D,I → we've excluded A,B,D,H,I,L,M,N,R. So the rest: C, E (but they are fixed), and available: F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we might need to use new letters.

The secret word must have letters in position1, position4, position5 from the available ones.

Common words with pattern ?EC?? 

Examples:
- PECK: but 4 letters? Not 5.
- BECKS: but B excluded? And 5 letters: B is excluded? Not.
- SECCO: S at1, E at2, C at3, C at4, O at5 → duplicate C? But C is known, but we don't know if duplicated? However, we have C at3. In ""SECCO"", the C in position3 and also position4? But we are putting C at4? That might be?

But let's see: our pattern must have C at3? Yes. But the word ""SECCO"" has C at3 and C at4? So it would have two C's? Is that allowed? Yes, possible.

Now, is ""SECCO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a style of painting? Or musical term? It's valid.

But in our guess, would we mark C at4? 

But note: we are making a guess that includes C at3? And if the secret word has C at3? Then we get ✓ for C at3? But we also have an extra C at4? That might be marked:

If the secret word has two C's? Then C at3 would be ✓ and C at4 might be (-) if the secret has another C? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's list words:

- ""TESCO"": T at1, E at2, C at3, S at4, O at5 → but S and T are available? 
- Or ""PECAN"": but A excluded and N excluded? No.
- ""RECCY"": R excluded? No.

""SECCO"": 
  S at1: S is available?
  E at2: known
  C at3: known, fixed? So we expect ✓ for C at3? 
  C at4: duplicate C? 
  O at5: O available?

But the problem: we don't know if the secret word has two C's? So this guess might be valid? But we are on the fourth guess? We have 3 tries left? 

But to avoid duplication? Maybe we can choose a word without duplicates?

Let me try: ""JETTY"": but no C? We are forced to have C at3? Our guess must include the known C at3? Because we know it must be there? 

Actually, since we deduced C must be in position3, in our next guess, we should include C at position3? And E at2? 

So the pattern is fixed: the third letter must be C? 

So the guess must have the form: [letter1] E C [letter4] [letter5]

We need to fill letter1, letter4, letter5, with letters not excluded and not tested? Or at least to see if they are present.

But we have tried many letters? So we must choose from remaining: F,G,J,K,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let me list possible words? 

Examples:
- ""PECKS"": P at1? E at2, C at3, K at4, S at5? 
  But K and S are available? 
- ""SPECS"": S at1, P at2? But P is not E? We have fixed E at2? So we cannot do that? 
  Our pattern: ? E C ? ? → Therefore, position2 is E? So ""SPECS"" has S at1, P at2? But we need E at2? So not. 

Therefore, we must have E at2? 

So the guess must be: [available] E C [available] [available]

Examples: 
  - ""TECUM"" → T at1, C at3? But the word is T-E-C-U-M → U, M? But M is excluded? No.
  - ""SECKS"" → not a word? 
  - ""JECUS"" → not a word.
  - ""GECKO"": G at1, E at2, C at3, K at4, O at5? This is a word: G-E-C-K-O.
  - ""PECKS"": P-E-C-K-S
  - ""SECCO"": S-E-C-C-O → two C's? 
  - ""EXCEL"": but X? And E at1? But position2 is E? So ""EXCEL"" is E at1, E at2? Not matching pattern? 

Now, ""GECKO"" and ""PECKS"" are valid? Also ""WECHT""? Not a word. ""YECCH""? Not standard.

So let's choose ""GECKO"": 
  G at1: new
  E at2: ✓
  C at3: ✓ (since we know C must be at3)
  K at4: new
  O at5: new

If the secret word has C at3? Then C will be ✓? And if it has K? O? G? 

Similarly, ""PECKS"": 
  P at1: new? 
  K at4: new
  S at5: new

But note: we know C is at3? So in the guess, we are setting C at3? We expect it to be ✓? 

But is there a risk? What if our deduction is wrong? We think C must be at3? But what if it's not? 

Recall why C must be at3? Because:
- Position1: ruled out by ""crane"" (C(-) at pos1)
- Position2: fixed as E (so C can't be there)
- Position4: ruled out by ""belch"" (C(-) at pos4)
- Position5: ruled out by ""medic"" (C(-) at pos5)

Therefore, only position3 remains. So C must be at3? 

So our guess should have C at3? 

Now, the words ""GECKO"" and ""PECKS"" both have C at3? 

But ""SECCO"" has C at3 and C at4? That might give extra information? 

But we don't know if there is a duplicate? 

I think we should choose a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

So ""GECKO"" has distinct letters: G, E, C, K, O. All distinct? 
Similarly, ""PECKS"" has distinct: P, E, C, K, S? 

Both are valid.

But we have excluded letters: and K is available for both? 

I'll choose ""GECKO"" because it's a common animal? 

Alternatively, ""PECKY"" not 5? 

Another option: ""DECOY"" but D excluded? 

So ""GECKO"" seems good.

Guess: GECKO

But what if the secret word does not have G, K, or O? Then we get feedback that those are absent? And we narrow down.

Because we know positions 1,4,5 must be filled with available letters? 

Let me check: G, E, C, K, O → all distinct and available.

So we'll get feedback:
  Position1: G - if not in word? Or if present? 
  Position2: E ✓
  Position3: C ✓ (we expect)
  Position4: K
  Position5: O

Then we can figure out?

After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights from Previous Guesses:
1. **""crane"" (Guess 1)**:
   - C: Present (but not position 1).
   - R, A, N: Absent.
   - E: Present (but not position 5).
  
2. **""belch"" (Guess 2)**:
   - E: Correct position (position 2).
   - B, L, H: Absent.
   - C: Present (but not position 4).

3. **""medic"" (Guess 3)**:
   - E: Correct position (position 2, confirmed).
   - M, D, I: Absent.
   - C: Present (but not position 5).

### Deductions:
- **E is fixed in position 2**.
- **C must be in position 3**: 
  - Position 1 ruled out (from ""crane""), position 4 ruled out (from ""belch""), position 5 ruled out (from ""medic"").
  - Position 2 is occupied by E, leaving position 3 as the only valid spot.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, B, L, H, M, D, I (all marked absent).
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ E C _ _`.
- **Available letters**: F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (not excluded).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test new letters** for positions 1, 4, and 5 (all unknown).
- **Include C in position 3** (deduced) and E in position 2 (fixed).
- Maximize information with distinct unused letters: G, E, C, K, O.

### Chosen Word: **""GECKO""**
- **G** (position 1): New letter.
- **E** (position 2): Correct (known).
- **C** (position 3): Correct (deduced).
- **K** (position 4): New letter.
- **O** (position 5): New letter.

This guess:
- Confirms C in position 3.
- Tests three new letters (G, K, O) efficiently.
- Uses available letters to cover common sounds.
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters.

<guess>gecko</guess>",gecko,"We have feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(-): C present but not position 1; R(x): R absent; A(x): A absent; N(x): N absent; E(-): E present but not position 5.
Guess 2: ""belch"" → B(x): B absent; E(✓): E correct in position 2; L(x): L absent; C(-): C present but not position 4; H(x): H absent.
Guess 3: ""medic"" → M(x): M absent; E(✓): E correct in position 2 (confirmed); D(x): D absent; I(x): I absent; C(-): C present but not position 5.

Summary of known facts:
- The secret word has E in position 2 (fixed).
- The secret word contains C, but C is not in position 1 (from guess1), not in position 4 (from guess2), and not in position 5 (from guess3). 
  Therefore, C must be in position 3 (since position 2 is taken by E, so only positions 1,3,4,5 are possible, and 1,4,5 are ruled out).
- Excluded letters: R, A, N (from guess1), B, L, H (from guess2), and M, D, I (from guess3). 
  Total excluded: R, A, N, B, L, H, M, D, I.

So the secret word must have C in position 3 and E in position 2. Thus, the pattern is: _ E C _ _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

Excluded letters: R, A, N, B, L, H, M, D, I. That's 9 letters excluded.

We know the word must be _ E C _ _, and the remaining letters must not be any of the excluded ones.

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that have not been excluded or might be new.

Since we know E and C positions, we focus on positions 1,4,5.

The word must be an English word.

Possible words? Let's think:

Pattern: ? E C ? ?

We've used: C, R, A, N, E, B, L, H, M, D, I from guesses? Actually, we know E and C are in the word, but the others are excluded.

Available letters: not in the excluded list. The alphabet: A-Z minus excluded: R,A,N,B,L,H,M,D,I → we've excluded A,B,D,H,I,L,M,N,R. So the rest: C, E (but they are fixed), and available: F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we might need to use new letters.

The secret word must have letters in position1, position4, position5 from the available ones.

Common words with pattern ?EC?? 

Examples:
- PECK: but 4 letters? Not 5.
- BECKS: but B excluded? And 5 letters: B is excluded? Not.
- SECCO: S at1, E at2, C at3, C at4, O at5 → duplicate C? But C is known, but we don't know if duplicated? However, we have C at3. In ""SECCO"", the C in position3 and also position4? But we are putting C at4? That might be?

But let's see: our pattern must have C at3? Yes. But the word ""SECCO"" has C at3 and C at4? So it would have two C's? Is that allowed? Yes, possible.

Now, is ""SECCO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a style of painting? Or musical term? It's valid.

But in our guess, would we mark C at4? 

But note: we are making a guess that includes C at3? And if the secret word has C at3? Then we get ✓ for C at3? But we also have an extra C at4? That might be marked:

If the secret word has two C's? Then C at3 would be ✓ and C at4 might be (-) if the secret has another C? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's list words:

- ""TESCO"": T at1, E at2, C at3, S at4, O at5 → but S and T are available? 
- Or ""PECAN"": but A excluded and N excluded? No.
- ""RECCY"": R excluded? No.

""SECCO"": 
  S at1: S is available?
  E at2: known
  C at3: known, fixed? So we expect ✓ for C at3? 
  C at4: duplicate C? 
  O at5: O available?

But the problem: we don't know if the secret word has two C's? So this guess might be valid? But we are on the fourth guess? We have 3 tries left? 

But to avoid duplication? Maybe we can choose a word without duplicates?

Let me try: ""JETTY"": but no C? We are forced to have C at3? Our guess must include the known C at3? Because we know it must be there? 

Actually, since we deduced C must be in position3, in our next guess, we should include C at position3? And E at2? 

So the pattern is fixed: the third letter must be C? 

So the guess must have the form: [letter1] E C [letter4] [letter5]

We need to fill letter1, letter4, letter5, with letters not excluded and not tested? Or at least to see if they are present.

But we have tried many letters? So we must choose from remaining: F,G,J,K,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let me list possible words? 

Examples:
- ""PECKS"": P at1? E at2, C at3, K at4, S at5? 
  But K and S are available? 
- ""SPECS"": S at1, P at2? But P is not E? We have fixed E at2? So we cannot do that? 
  Our pattern: ? E C ? ? → Therefore, position2 is E? So ""SPECS"" has S at1, P at2? But we need E at2? So not. 

Therefore, we must have E at2? 

So the guess must be: [available] E C [available] [available]

Examples: 
  - ""TECUM"" → T at1, C at3? But the word is T-E-C-U-M → U, M? But M is excluded? No.
  - ""SECKS"" → not a word? 
  - ""JECUS"" → not a word.
  - ""GECKO"": G at1, E at2, C at3, K at4, O at5? This is a word: G-E-C-K-O.
  - ""PECKS"": P-E-C-K-S
  - ""SECCO"": S-E-C-C-O → two C's? 
  - ""EXCEL"": but X? And E at1? But position2 is E? So ""EXCEL"" is E at1, E at2? Not matching pattern? 

Now, ""GECKO"" and ""PECKS"" are valid? Also ""WECHT""? Not a word. ""YECCH""? Not standard.

So let's choose ""GECKO"": 
  G at1: new
  E at2: ✓
  C at3: ✓ (since we know C must be at3)
  K at4: new
  O at5: new

If the secret word has C at3? Then C will be ✓? And if it has K? O? G? 

Similarly, ""PECKS"": 
  P at1: new? 
  K at4: new
  S at5: new

But note: we know C is at3? So in the guess, we are setting C at3? We expect it to be ✓? 

But is there a risk? What if our deduction is wrong? We think C must be at3? But what if it's not? 

Recall why C must be at3? Because:
- Position1: ruled out by ""crane"" (C(-) at pos1)
- Position2: fixed as E (so C can't be there)
- Position4: ruled out by ""belch"" (C(-) at pos4)
- Position5: ruled out by ""medic"" (C(-) at pos5)

Therefore, only position3 remains. So C must be at3? 

So our guess should have C at3? 

Now, the words ""GECKO"" and ""PECKS"" both have C at3? 

But ""SECCO"" has C at3 and C at4? That might give extra information? 

But we don't know if there is a duplicate? 

I think we should choose a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

So ""GECKO"" has distinct letters: G, E, C, K, O. All distinct? 
Similarly, ""PECKS"" has distinct: P, E, C, K, S? 

Both are valid.

But we have excluded letters: and K is available for both? 

I'll choose ""GECKO"" because it's a common animal? 

Alternatively, ""PECKY"" not 5? 

Another option: ""DECOY"" but D excluded? 

So ""GECKO"" seems good.

Guess: GECKO

But what if the secret word does not have G, K, or O? Then we get feedback that those are absent? And we narrow down.

Because we know positions 1,4,5 must be filled with available letters? 

Let me check: G, E, C, K, O → all distinct and available.

So we'll get feedback:
  Position1: G - if not in word? Or if present? 
  Position2: E ✓
  Position3: C ✓ (we expect)
  Position4: K
  Position5: O

Then we can figure out?
