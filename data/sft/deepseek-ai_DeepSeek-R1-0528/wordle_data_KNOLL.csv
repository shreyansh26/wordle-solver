We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (since ""crane"" has N at position 4, but it's marked as '-', meaning it's present but in a different position).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked 'x').

 So, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E. And it does contain an N, but not in the 4th position.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, we should try a word that includes N and places it in a different position.
 Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that include N and exclude C, R, A, E.

 The word must have N, and we know it's not at position 4. So positions for N could be 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Available letters: We still have most consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we are missing vowels (A and E are out), we should consider using I and O or U.

 Common vowels: I, O, U.

 We can try words that have multiple common letters and include N.

 Let me list some possibilities:

 Option: ""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T. This has N at position 4? But wait, we need N not at position 4? Actually, no: our first guess had N at position 4, but that was wrong. So the secret word has N, but not at position 4. In ""POINT"", if we put N at position 4, that would be the same position? But the feedback says that position is wrong, so we don't want N at position 4 again? Actually, we can use a word with N at position 4 again? No, because we know it's wrong. But we don't have to avoid position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. Better to move N to another position.

 So let's try to put N at a new position.

 Possibilities for positions: We can put N at position 1? Like ""N _ _ _ _"", or position 2, 3, or 5.

 Example words:
   N at position 1: ""NOISY"", ""NIGHT"" (but contains H? and we don't know) - however, avoid R,A,E. ""NOISY"" has O and I, which are good.

 But we also want to cover more common letters. Let's consider S, T, L, O, etc.

 Another good starting word might be ""POINT"", but that places N at position 4, which we already know is incorrect? Actually, we can use it if we want, but then the N at position 4 will be marked wrong again, which doesn't give new information. So better to put N in a new position.

 How about ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N is at position 4? So same position. We can try ""POINT"" but we'll know if N appears again? Actually, the feedback will tell us again that N is present but wrong position? If the secret word has N in position 4, then it would be correct? But we know it's not in position 4 because the first guess had N there and it was wrong? So no, the secret word does not have N at position 4.

 Therefore, if we use ""POINT"", the N will be at position 4 again and we'll get '-' again (if N is present). But that doesn't help us find the position of N.

 So we should avoid the 4th position for N in this guess.

 Let's choose a word with N at position 5? That might be good. For example, ""LEMON"" but L, E is out (E is not allowed because we had E(x)). Or ""MANGO"" has A (which is out).

 We must avoid A and E. So words like ""POINT"" might not work because N is at 4 (same position) and also we don't know if O,I are in?

 Alternatively, let's try N at position 2? For example, ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. This avoids A,E and also R? It avoids the forbidden letters.

 ""SNOUT"" has S, N, O, U, T. All letters are among the available ones.

 Let's check: S, N, O, U, T. We haven't tried any of these except N? But we already know N is present, so it's okay.

 Alternatively, N at position 5: ""TOWNS""? T-O-W-N-S has W and S? Avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are also testing other letters. We want to maximize information.

 Since we know N is in the word, and we are going to put it in a new position, we can also test other common consonants.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" is not good because position 4 is same. So avoid that.

 How about ""BLIND""? B-L-I-N-D has N at position 4, so same as before? Then again we'd get a '-' for N? And that doesn't help. So let's choose a word that places N at a position that hasn't been tried: either 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Since position 4 was tried and wrong, we should try 1,2,3, or 5.

 Let's list words with N in positions 1,2,3,5 that don't use C,R,A,E.

 Position 1: ""N"" words: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is forbidden. ""NOISY""? N-O-I-S-Y. Letters: N,O,I,S,Y. All allowed? Yes. But O,I,S,Y are new.

 Position 2: ""SNAIL""? But A is forbidden. ""SNOUT"" (S-N-O-U-T). This has U? Not common, but okay.

 Position 3: ""POINT"" only if we move N? But N is at 4 in that. ""POINT"" cannot be changed. ""ALIGN"" has A? Forbidden. ""PLUMB""? No N. How about ""POINT"" but we skip? Not good.

 Actually, ""HINGE"" has E? Forbidden.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"": N at position 1. This will break new ground.

 Or ""UPSET""? But U is less common. And E is forbidden? E? Wait, we cannot use E.

 So ""NOISY"" seems good: N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

 What about ""SONIC""? But C is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C,R,A,E.

 Another word: ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N at position 4? Same as before? So I think we should skip that.

 Alternatively, ""WORDY""? W-O-R-D-Y -> but R is forbidden? R is out? Because in first guess R was marked 'x', meaning not in the word. So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

 So in ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. Does not contain C,R,A,E. And N is at position 2.

 Similarly, ""NOISY"": N-O-I-S-Y. Also avoids forbidden letters.

 Both are valid. Which one gives more information?

 We want to test common letters. S and T are very common. So ""SNOUT"" has T at the end? And O and U? U is less common.

 ""NOISY"" has O, I, S, Y.

 I think ""SNOUT"" might be better because it includes T and S? Also, if the secret word has S or T, that would be helpful.

 But note: we know the secret word has at least one N? So let's check the frequency.

 Also, we are avoiding R,A,E and C.

 Another possibility: ""STOMP""? But no N? We need to include N because we know it's present? Actually, we don't have to? But including N might help us locate it? And it's efficient.

 We have two goals: find the position of N and test new letters.

 Since N is the only known letter to be in the word, we should try to find its position.

 Therefore, let's include N in the guess and place it in a new position.

 So for ""NOISY"": N at position 1 -> that hasn't been tested. Previously N was at 4.

 For ""SNOUT"": N at position 2 -> also new.

 For ""TUNIC""? But C is forbidden? And U? And also, N is at position 3? So that's also new.

 How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N: but has two N's? It might be valid, but then if the secret word has only one N, we might get mixed feedback? But it's okay.

 However, to keep it simple, let's start with ""SNOUT"" because it has S,T which are common.

 So I'll go with ""SNOUT"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has S? Then we'll get information.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is avoided because position 4 is the same and we avoid R? Wait, ""POINT"" does not have R? It has P,O,I,N,T. And R is forbidden? So we can't use R? But ""POINT"" doesn't have R? So it is allowed? But N at position 4? Which is the same as before? Then we would get '-' for N again? And we already know it's present? That doesn't help.

 So I avoid ""POINT"".

 Final decision: ""SNOUT""

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (all marked ❌).
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ➖).

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include **N** (since we know it's in the word) but **avoid position 4** for N.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, E.
- Help test new common letters to gather more information.

After considering common letters like S, T, O, I, and L, I chose **""SNOUT""** because:
- It places **N** in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and the disqualified position for N (position 4).
- It contains new high-frequency consonants (**S**, **T**) and vowels (**O**, **U**), maximizing potential feedback.

This guess tests multiple unknown positions efficiently.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, we should try a word that includes N and places it in a different position.
 Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that include N and exclude C, R, A, E.

 The word must have N, and we know it's not at position 4. So positions for N could be 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Available letters: We still have most consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we are missing vowels (A and E are out), we should consider using I and O or U.

 Common vowels: I, O, U.

 We can try words that have multiple common letters and include N.

 Let me list some possibilities:

 Option: ""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T. This has N at position 4? But wait, we need N not at position 4? Actually, no: our first guess had N at position 4, but that was wrong. So the secret word has N, but not at position 4. In ""POINT"", if we put N at position 4, that would be the same position? But the feedback says that position is wrong, so we don't want N at position 4 again? Actually, we can use a word with N at position 4 again? No, because we know it's wrong. But we don't have to avoid position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. Better to move N to another position.

 So let's try to put N at a new position.

 Possibilities for positions: We can put N at position 1? Like ""N _ _ _ _"", or position 2, 3, or 5.

 Example words:
   N at position 1: ""NOISY"", ""NIGHT"" (but contains H? and we don't know) - however, avoid R,A,E. ""NOISY"" has O and I, which are good.

 But we also want to cover more common letters. Let's consider S, T, L, O, etc.

 Another good starting word might be ""POINT"", but that places N at position 4, which we already know is incorrect? Actually, we can use it if we want, but then the N at position 4 will be marked wrong again, which doesn't give new information. So better to put N in a new position.

 How about ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N is at position 4? So same position. We can try ""POINT"" but we'll know if N appears again? Actually, the feedback will tell us again that N is present but wrong position? If the secret word has N in position 4, then it would be correct? But we know it's not in position 4 because the first guess had N there and it was wrong? So no, the secret word does not have N at position 4.

 Therefore, if we use ""POINT"", the N will be at position 4 again and we'll get '-' again (if N is present). But that doesn't help us find the position of N.

 So we should avoid the 4th position for N in this guess.

 Let's choose a word with N at position 5? That might be good. For example, ""LEMON"" but L, E is out (E is not allowed because we had E(x)). Or ""MANGO"" has A (which is out).

 We must avoid A and E. So words like ""POINT"" might not work because N is at 4 (same position) and also we don't know if O,I are in?

 Alternatively, let's try N at position 2? For example, ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. This avoids A,E and also R? It avoids the forbidden letters.

 ""SNOUT"" has S, N, O, U, T. All letters are among the available ones.

 Let's check: S, N, O, U, T. We haven't tried any of these except N? But we already know N is present, so it's okay.

 Alternatively, N at position 5: ""TOWNS""? T-O-W-N-S has W and S? Avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are also testing other letters. We want to maximize information.

 Since we know N is in the word, and we are going to put it in a new position, we can also test other common consonants.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" is not good because position 4 is same. So avoid that.

 How about ""BLIND""? B-L-I-N-D has N at position 4, so same as before? Then again we'd get a '-' for N? And that doesn't help. So let's choose a word that places N at a position that hasn't been tried: either 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Since position 4 was tried and wrong, we should try 1,2,3, or 5.

 Let's list words with N in positions 1,2,3,5 that don't use C,R,A,E.

 Position 1: ""N"" words: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is forbidden. ""NOISY""? N-O-I-S-Y. Letters: N,O,I,S,Y. All allowed? Yes. But O,I,S,Y are new.

 Position 2: ""SNAIL""? But A is forbidden. ""SNOUT"" (S-N-O-U-T). This has U? Not common, but okay.

 Position 3: ""POINT"" only if we move N? But N is at 4 in that. ""POINT"" cannot be changed. ""ALIGN"" has A? Forbidden. ""PLUMB""? No N. How about ""POINT"" but we skip? Not good.

 Actually, ""HINGE"" has E? Forbidden.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"": N at position 1. This will break new ground.

 Or ""UPSET""? But U is less common. And E is forbidden? E? Wait, we cannot use E.

 So ""NOISY"" seems good: N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

 What about ""SONIC""? But C is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C,R,A,E.

 Another word: ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N at position 4? Same as before? So I think we should skip that.

 Alternatively, ""WORDY""? W-O-R-D-Y -> but R is forbidden? R is out? Because in first guess R was marked 'x', meaning not in the word. So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

 So in ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. Does not contain C,R,A,E. And N is at position 2.

 Similarly, ""NOISY"": N-O-I-S-Y. Also avoids forbidden letters.

 Both are valid. Which one gives more information?

 We want to test common letters. S and T are very common. So ""SNOUT"" has T at the end? And O and U? U is less common.

 ""NOISY"" has O, I, S, Y.

 I think ""SNOUT"" might be better because it includes T and S? Also, if the secret word has S or T, that would be helpful.

 But note: we know the secret word has at least one N? So let's check the frequency.

 Also, we are avoiding R,A,E and C.

 Another possibility: ""STOMP""? But no N? We need to include N because we know it's present? Actually, we don't have to? But including N might help us locate it? And it's efficient.

 We have two goals: find the position of N and test new letters.

 Since N is the only known letter to be in the word, we should try to find its position.

 Therefore, let's include N in the guess and place it in a new position.

 So for ""NOISY"": N at position 1 -> that hasn't been tested. Previously N was at 4.

 For ""SNOUT"": N at position 2 -> also new.

 For ""TUNIC""? But C is forbidden? And U? And also, N is at position 3? So that's also new.

 How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N: but has two N's? It might be valid, but then if the secret word has only one N, we might get mixed feedback? But it's okay.

 However, to keep it simple, let's start with ""SNOUT"" because it has S,T which are common.

 So I'll go with ""SNOUT"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has S? Then we'll get information.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is avoided because position 4 is the same and we avoid R? Wait, ""POINT"" does not have R? It has P,O,I,N,T. And R is forbidden? So we can't use R? But ""POINT"" doesn't have R? So it is allowed? But N at position 4? Which is the same as before? Then we would get '-' for N again? And we already know it's present? That doesn't help.

 So I avoid ""POINT"".

 Final decision: ""SNOUT""

<guess>snout</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (all marked ❌).
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ➖).

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include **N** (since we know it's in the word) but **avoid position 4** for N.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, E.
- Help test new common letters to gather more information.

After considering common letters like S, T, O, I, and L, I chose **""SNOUT""** because:
- It places **N** in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and the disqualified position for N (position 4).
- It contains new high-frequency consonants (**S**, **T**) and vowels (**O**, **U**), maximizing potential feedback.

This guess tests multiple unknown positions efficiently.

We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""snout"" -> S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - S, U, T are not in the word.
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""snout"" is S-N-O-U-T, so N is the second letter).
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since O is the third letter in ""snout"").

So, from the second guess:
  - N is confirmed at position 2 (second letter).
  - O is confirmed at position 3 (third letter).

Also, we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

We now know two letters in the secret word: 
  - The second letter is N.
  - The third letter is O.

So the secret word has the form: _ N O _ _

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

We have 4 guesses left.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ N O _ _ and uses only letters that are not excluded.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use O and N again, but we know their positions).

But note: we already know O and N are in the word and in the correct positions, so we can use them to confirm, but we need to test the other positions.

We should avoid using known absent letters.

We want to test common letters for the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Common letters that are still available: L, I, D, H, P, M, B, G, etc.

We can try a word that has the form _ N O _ _ and uses new letters to test.

For example, we can try:

- Using I: since it's a common vowel. But we don't know if I is in the word.
- Or L, D, etc.

Possible words that fit _ N O _ _ and use available letters:

Let's think of words: 
  - ""INBOX""? But B and X? And we don't know if B or X are in. Also, ""INBOX"" has I at position 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. But we don't know about I, B, X.

But we must avoid the forbidden letters: C,R,A,E,S,U,T.

""INBOX"" is valid in terms of avoiding forbidden letters? Yes.

But we might want to use more common letters.

Another word: ""DINGO""? D-I-N-G-O -> but that would be D at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2, so that doesn't fit the pattern. We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.

So the pattern is fixed: [letter1] N O [letter4] [letter5]

So words like:
  - ""SNOWY""? But S is forbidden? S is out, so no.
  - ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters.
  - ""MINOR""? M-I-N-O-R -> but R is forbidden? R is out, so no.
  - ""PINOT""? P-I-N-O-T -> T is forbidden? T is out, so no.
  - ""WINOS""? W-I-N-O-S -> S is forbidden? S is out, and also T? But S is out. Also, it has S at the end? And we need 5 letters? ""WINOS"" is 5 letters: W-I-N-O-S. But S is forbidden? Yes, so invalid.

We need to avoid S, T, R, A, E, C, U.

So let's list possible words:

  - ""INBOX"": I, N, O, B, X -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. But X is uncommon.
  - ""DONOR""? D-O-N-O-R -> but that's D at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2 and O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? So pattern is wrong. We need _ N O _ _, so second letter N, third letter O.

  - ""MINOR"": M-I-N-O-R -> but that's M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4? Not matching. We need N at 2 and O at 3.

  - ""BONGO"": B-O-N-G-O -> B at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and 5? Not matching.

  - ""CONDO""? C is forbidden? No, C is out.

  - ""PONGO"": P-O-N-G-O -> P at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? This has N at 3? Not matching.

  - ""JUMBO""? J-U-M-B-O -> but U is forbidden? U is out.

  - ""LIMBO""? L-I-M-B-O -> L at 1, I at 2, M at 3, B at 4, O at 5? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

  - ""NINON""? N at 1? But we don't know if N is at 1? And we have N at 2? This word has two N's? But pattern: N at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2? So no.

  - ""BONEY""? B-O-N-E-Y -> but E is forbidden? E is out.

  - ""ZONAL""? Z-O-N-A-L -> A is forbidden? A is out.

  - ""HONEY""? H-O-N-E-Y -> E is forbidden.

  - ""FONDU""? F-O-N-D-U -> U is forbidden.

  - ""GONAD""? G-O-N-A-D -> A is forbidden.

  - ""MONTH""? M-O-N-T-H -> T is forbidden? T is out.

  - ""BONNY""? B-O-N-N-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? Not matching.

  - ""BIOME""? B-I-O-M-E -> E is forbidden.

  - ""GIVEN""? G-I-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.

  - ""LIVID""? L-I-V-I-D -> no O? Doesn't have O at 3? We don't need to have O? But we know O is at position 3? So we must have O at 3.

  - ""MOLDY""? M-O-L-D-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

  - ""POLYP""? P-O-L-Y-P -> O at 2? Not matching.

  - ""WOVEN""? W-O-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.

  - ""YOGIC""? Y-O-G-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""YONIC""? Y-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""YONIS""? Y-O-N-I-S -> S is forbidden.

  - ""YOWIE""? Y-O-W-I-E -> E is forbidden.

This is getting difficult. Maybe we need to consider that the word might have double letters? But we don't know.

Another idea: ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters. ""KNOWN""? But that's 5 letters: K-N-O-W-N. Let's check:

  - ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

This fits the pattern: _ N O _ _ -> K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

And it avoids forbidden letters? 
  - K: not forbidden? 
  - W: not forbidden? 
  - N: we know is in, and we are using it at 2 and 5? But we know position 2 is correct, so we can use it again? 
  - O: at position 3, which is correct.

But we are testing if there is another N? And also testing K and W.

Also, the forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,U,T. So K, W, N, O are allowed.

So ""KNOWN"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using N at position 5? We don't know if there is an N at position 5? But we know there is at least one N (at position 2). It could have two N's.

Another word: ""MINOR"" doesn't fit. ""DONOR"" doesn't fit.

""POUND""? P-O-U-N-D -> but U is forbidden? And also, pattern: P at 1, O at 2, U at 3? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

""FOUND""? F-O-U-N-D -> U forbidden.

""BOUND""? Same.

""WOUND""? Same.

""JOINT""? J-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""POINT""? P-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""MOIST""? M-O-I-S-T -> S and T forbidden.

""NOISY""? We tried? No, we tried ""SNOUT"", not ""NOISY"". But ""NOISY"" is N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

But we know O is at position 3? So we must have the third letter O.

So back to ""KNOWN"": it fits the pattern: K-N-O-W-N.

We can also consider ""MINOX""? But not common? And X? ""MINOX"" is M-I-N-O-X? Pattern: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""BONZE""? B-O-N-Z-E -> E forbidden.

""CONKY""? C forbidden.

""JONTY""? J-O-N-T-Y -> T forbidden.

""KNOPS""? K-N-O-P-S -> S forbidden.

""KNOSP""? Same.

""NOBLY""? N-O-B-L-Y -> O at 2? Not matching.

""NOLLY""? Same.

""NOXAL""? N-O-X-A-L -> A forbidden.

""NYLON""? N-Y-L-O-N -> N at 1 and 5, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

""ONION""? O-N-I-O-N -> O at 1? But we need the first letter to be anything and then N at 2? This has O at 1, N at 2, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5. But we need O at 3? This has I at 3? So not matching.

""ONLAY""? O-N-L-A-Y -> A forbidden.

""PINON""? P-I-N-O-N -> P at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""SONLY""? S forbidden.

""TONDO""? T forbidden.

""VODOU""? V-O-D-O-U -> U forbidden.

""YONKS""? Y-O-N-K-S -> S forbidden.

So ""KNOWN"" seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""GNOW""? Not 5 letters.

""GROWN""? G-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.

""PROWL""? P-R-O-W-L -> R forbidden.

""BROWN""? B-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.

So ""KNOWN"" is acceptable.

We can also try ""KNOWP""? Not a word.

""KNOWE""? E forbidden.

So I think ""KNOWN"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

But note: we are using two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's? But that's okay because we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have N at the end? But we don't know the other positions.

Another word: ""INBOX"" doesn't fit because it has I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. That fits the pattern? Yes: _ N O _ _ -> I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5.

And it avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, B, X are not forbidden? I is allowed, B is allowed, X is allowed? X is less common, but it's a valid letter.

But ""INBOX"" is a word? Yes, it means a box for incoming mail.

But ""KNOWN"" is more common? Or not? We can choose.

We can also consider ""DINGO"" but it doesn't fit.

Another word: ""BINGO""? B-I-N-G-O -> B at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""JINGO""? Same.

""LINGO""? L-I-N-G-O -> same.

So not.

""WINDO""? Not a word? Or ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.

""BLOND""? B-L-O-N-D -> pattern: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 3? And N at 4? But we know N is at 2? So this has L at 2? Not matching.

We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.

So ""BLOND"" has L at 2? Not N.

So not.

Therefore, I think ""KNOWN"" and ""INBOX"" are two options.

Let me choose ""KNOWN"" because it uses more common letters? Or ""INBOX"" uses I and B which are common? But X is less common.

But we have to test the letters.

We can also consider ""PINOT"" but T is forbidden.

Another word: ""DONOR"" doesn't fit.

""MINOR"" doesn't fit.

""FINCH""? F-I-N-C-H -> C forbidden.

""LINCH""? Not a word.

""VINYL""? V-I-N-Y-L -> pattern: V at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

So I think we should go with ""KNOWN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: we know the word is _ N O _ _

So ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. That matches.

We can also try ""KNOWP"" not a word.

Or ""KNOWE"" not allowed because of E.

So I choose ""KNOWN"".

But note: we are using N at position 5. If the secret word has only one N, then the N at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we know N is at position 2, so if there is no second N, then the fifth letter N will be marked as not present? Or if it is present but in the wrong position? But position 5 is new, so it could be.

But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at the end? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""DONKO""? Not common.

""JONNY""? J-O-N-N-Y -> J at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

""CONVO""? C forbidden.

""BONGO"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""KNOWN"" is a good choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""KNOWN""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`  
  Meaning:  
  - ❌ `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ `N` is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""snout""**  
  Feedback: `S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)`  
  Meaning:  
  - ❌ `S`, `U`, `T` are **not** in the word.  
  - ✓ `N` is **correct and in position 2**.  
  - ✓ `O` is **correct and in position 3**.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N O _ _` (second letter is `N`, third letter is `O`).  
- Excluded letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T` (cannot be used).  
- Confirmed letters: `N` (position 2), `O` (position 3).  
- Remaining positions to solve: **1st, 4th, and 5th letters**.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test common letters for positions 1, 4, and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Use a word that fits `_ N O _ _` and includes high-frequency unused letters (e.g., `I`, `L`, `D`, `H`, `P`, `M`, `B`, `G`, `Y`).  
  - Prioritize words that test multiple new letters to maximize information.  
- **Chosen word**: **""KNOWN""**  
  - Fits the pattern: `K` (position 1), `N` (position 2, confirmed), `O` (position 3, confirmed), `W` (position 4), `N` (position 5).  
  - Tests new letters: `K` (position 1), `W` (position 4), and `N` (position 5—to check for a possible second `N`).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T`).  

This guess efficiently probes the unknown positions while leveraging confirmed letters to narrow possibilities.

<guess>known</guess>",known,"We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""snout"" -> S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - S, U, T are not in the word.
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""snout"" is S-N-O-U-T, so N is the second letter).
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since O is the third letter in ""snout"").

So, from the second guess:
  - N is confirmed at position 2 (second letter).
  - O is confirmed at position 3 (third letter).

Also, we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

We now know two letters in the secret word: 
  - The second letter is N.
  - The third letter is O.

So the secret word has the form: _ N O _ _

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

We have 4 guesses left.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ N O _ _ and uses only letters that are not excluded.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use O and N again, but we know their positions).

But note: we already know O and N are in the word and in the correct positions, so we can use them to confirm, but we need to test the other positions.

We should avoid using known absent letters.

We want to test common letters for the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Common letters that are still available: L, I, D, H, P, M, B, G, etc.

We can try a word that has the form _ N O _ _ and uses new letters to test.

For example, we can try:

- Using I: since it's a common vowel. But we don't know if I is in the word.
- Or L, D, etc.

Possible words that fit _ N O _ _ and use available letters:

Let's think of words: 
  - ""INBOX""? But B and X? And we don't know if B or X are in. Also, ""INBOX"" has I at position 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. But we don't know about I, B, X.

But we must avoid the forbidden letters: C,R,A,E,S,U,T.

""INBOX"" is valid in terms of avoiding forbidden letters? Yes.

But we might want to use more common letters.

Another word: ""DINGO""? D-I-N-G-O -> but that would be D at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2, so that doesn't fit the pattern. We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.

So the pattern is fixed: [letter1] N O [letter4] [letter5]

So words like:
  - ""SNOWY""? But S is forbidden? S is out, so no.
  - ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters.
  - ""MINOR""? M-I-N-O-R -> but R is forbidden? R is out, so no.
  - ""PINOT""? P-I-N-O-T -> T is forbidden? T is out, so no.
  - ""WINOS""? W-I-N-O-S -> S is forbidden? S is out, and also T? But S is out. Also, it has S at the end? And we need 5 letters? ""WINOS"" is 5 letters: W-I-N-O-S. But S is forbidden? Yes, so invalid.

We need to avoid S, T, R, A, E, C, U.

So let's list possible words:

  - ""INBOX"": I, N, O, B, X -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. But X is uncommon.
  - ""DONOR""? D-O-N-O-R -> but that's D at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2 and O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? So pattern is wrong. We need _ N O _ _, so second letter N, third letter O.

  - ""MINOR"": M-I-N-O-R -> but that's M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4? Not matching. We need N at 2 and O at 3.

  - ""BONGO"": B-O-N-G-O -> B at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and 5? Not matching.

  - ""CONDO""? C is forbidden? No, C is out.

  - ""PONGO"": P-O-N-G-O -> P at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? This has N at 3? Not matching.

  - ""JUMBO""? J-U-M-B-O -> but U is forbidden? U is out.

  - ""LIMBO""? L-I-M-B-O -> L at 1, I at 2, M at 3, B at 4, O at 5? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

  - ""NINON""? N at 1? But we don't know if N is at 1? And we have N at 2? This word has two N's? But pattern: N at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2? So no.

  - ""BONEY""? B-O-N-E-Y -> but E is forbidden? E is out.

  - ""ZONAL""? Z-O-N-A-L -> A is forbidden? A is out.

  - ""HONEY""? H-O-N-E-Y -> E is forbidden.

  - ""FONDU""? F-O-N-D-U -> U is forbidden.

  - ""GONAD""? G-O-N-A-D -> A is forbidden.

  - ""IONIC""? I-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""MONTH""? M-O-N-T-H -> T is forbidden? T is out.

  - ""BONNY""? B-O-N-N-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? Not matching.

  - ""DONUT""? D-O-N-U-T -> U and T are forbidden.

  - ""PIOUS""? P-I-O-U-S -> U and S are forbidden.

  - ""VIOLA""? V-I-O-L-A -> A is forbidden.

  - ""BIOME""? B-I-O-M-E -> E is forbidden.

  - ""GIVEN""? G-I-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.

  - ""LIVID""? L-I-V-I-D -> no O? Doesn't have O at 3? We don't need to have O? But we know O is at position 3? So we must have O at 3.

  - ""MOLDY""? M-O-L-D-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

  - ""POLYP""? P-O-L-Y-P -> O at 2? Not matching.

  - ""WOVEN""? W-O-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.

  - ""YOGIC""? Y-O-G-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""YONIC""? Y-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""YONIS""? Y-O-N-I-S -> S is forbidden.

  - ""YOWIE""? Y-O-W-I-E -> E is forbidden.

This is getting difficult. Maybe we need to consider that the word might have double letters? But we don't know.

Another idea: ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters. ""KNOWN""? But that's 5 letters: K-N-O-W-N. Let's check:

  - ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

This fits the pattern: _ N O _ _ -> K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

And it avoids forbidden letters? 
  - K: not forbidden? 
  - W: not forbidden? 
  - N: we know is in, and we are using it at 2 and 5? But we know position 2 is correct, so we can use it again? 
  - O: at position 3, which is correct.

But we are testing if there is another N? And also testing K and W.

Also, the forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,U,T. So K, W, N, O are allowed.

So ""KNOWN"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using N at position 5? We don't know if there is an N at position 5? But we know there is at least one N (at position 2). It could have two N's.

Another word: ""MINOR"" doesn't fit. ""DONOR"" doesn't fit.

""POUND""? P-O-U-N-D -> but U is forbidden? And also, pattern: P at 1, O at 2, U at 3? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

""FOUND""? F-O-U-N-D -> U forbidden.

""BOUND""? Same.

""WOUND""? Same.

""JOINT""? J-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""POINT""? P-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""MOIST""? M-O-I-S-T -> S and T forbidden.

""NOISY""? We tried? No, we tried ""SNOUT"", not ""NOISY"". But ""NOISY"" is N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

But we know O is at position 3? So we must have the third letter O.

So back to ""KNOWN"": it fits the pattern: K-N-O-W-N.

We can also consider ""MINOX""? But not common? And X? ""MINOX"" is M-I-N-O-X? Pattern: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""BONZE""? B-O-N-Z-E -> E forbidden.

""CONKY""? C forbidden.

""JONTY""? J-O-N-T-Y -> T forbidden.

""KNOPS""? K-N-O-P-S -> S forbidden.

""KNOSP""? Same.

""NOBLY""? N-O-B-L-Y -> O at 2? Not matching.

""NOLLY""? Same.

""NOXAL""? N-O-X-A-L -> A forbidden.

""NYLON""? N-Y-L-O-N -> N at 1 and 5, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

""ONION""? O-N-I-O-N -> O at 1? But we need the first letter to be anything and then N at 2? This has O at 1, N at 2, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5. But we need O at 3? This has I at 3? So not matching.

""ONLAY""? O-N-L-A-Y -> A forbidden.

""PINON""? P-I-N-O-N -> P at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""SONLY""? S forbidden.

""TONDO""? T forbidden.

""VODOU""? V-O-D-O-U -> U forbidden.

""YONKS""? Y-O-N-K-S -> S forbidden.

So ""KNOWN"" seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""GNOW""? Not 5 letters.

""GROWN""? G-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.

""PROWL""? P-R-O-W-L -> R forbidden.

""BROWN""? B-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.

So ""KNOWN"" is acceptable.

We can also try ""KNOWP""? Not a word.

""KNOWE""? E forbidden.

So I think ""KNOWN"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

But note: we are using two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's? But that's okay because we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have N at the end? But we don't know the other positions.

Another word: ""INBOX"" doesn't fit because it has I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. That fits the pattern? Yes: _ N O _ _ -> I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5.

And it avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, B, X are not forbidden? I is allowed, B is allowed, X is allowed? X is less common, but it's a valid letter.

But ""INBOX"" is a word? Yes, it means a box for incoming mail.

But ""KNOWN"" is more common? Or not? We can choose.

We can also consider ""DINGO"" but it doesn't fit.

Another word: ""BINGO""? B-I-N-G-O -> B at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""JINGO""? Same.

""LINGO""? L-I-N-G-O -> same.

So not.

""WINDO""? Not a word? Or ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.

""BLOND""? B-L-O-N-D -> pattern: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 3? And N at 4? But we know N is at 2? So this has L at 2? Not matching.

We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.

So ""BLOND"" has L at 2? Not N.

So not.

Therefore, I think ""KNOWN"" and ""INBOX"" are two options.

Let me choose ""KNOWN"" because it uses more common letters? Or ""INBOX"" uses I and B which are common? But X is less common.

But we have to test the letters.

We can also consider ""PINOT"" but T is forbidden.

Another word: ""DONOR"" doesn't fit.

""MINOR"" doesn't fit.

""FINCH""? F-I-N-C-H -> C forbidden.

""LINCH""? Not a word.

""VINYL""? V-I-N-Y-L -> pattern: V at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

So I think we should go with ""KNOWN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: we know the word is _ N O _ _

So ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. That matches.

We can also try ""KNOWP"" not a word.

Or ""KNOWE"" not allowed because of E.

So I choose ""KNOWN"".

But note: we are using N at position 5. If the secret word has only one N, then the N at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we know N is at position 2, so if there is no second N, then the fifth letter N will be marked as not present? Or if it is present but in the wrong position? But position 5 is new, so it could be.

But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at the end? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""DONKO""? Not common.

""JONNY""? J-O-N-N-Y -> J at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

""CONVO""? C forbidden.

""BONGO"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""KNOWN"" is a good choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""KNOWN""

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (since ""crane"" has N at position 4, but it's marked as '-', meaning it's present but in a different position).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked 'x').

 So, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E. And it does contain an N, but not in the 4th position.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, we should try a word that includes N and places it in a different position.
 Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that include N and exclude C, R, A, E.

 The word must have N, and we know it's not at position 4. So positions for N could be 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Available letters: We still have most consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we are missing vowels (A and E are out), we should consider using I and O or U.

 Common vowels: I, O, U.

 We can try words that have multiple common letters and include N.

 Let me list some possibilities:

 Option: ""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T. This has N at position 4? But wait, we need N not at position 4? Actually, no: our first guess had N at position 4, but that was wrong. So the secret word has N, but not at position 4. In ""POINT"", if we put N at position 4, that would be the same position? But the feedback says that position is wrong, so we don't want N at position 4 again? Actually, we can use a word with N at position 4 again? No, because we know it's wrong. But we don't have to avoid position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. Better to move N to another position.

 So let's try to put N at a new position.

 Possibilities for positions: We can put N at position 1? Like ""N _ _ _ _"", or position 2, 3, or 5.

 Example words:
   N at position 1: ""NOISY"", ""NIGHT"" (but contains H? and we don't know) - however, avoid R,A,E. ""NOISY"" has O and I, which are good.

 But we also want to cover more common letters. Let's consider S, T, L, O, etc.

 Another good starting word might be ""POINT"", but that places N at position 4, which we already know is incorrect? Actually, we can use it if we want, but then the N at position 4 will be marked wrong again, which doesn't give new information. So better to put N in a new position.

 How about ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N is at position 4? So same position. We can try ""POINT"" but we'll know if N appears again? Actually, the feedback will tell us again that N is present but wrong position? If the secret word has N in position 4, then it would be correct? But we know it's not in position 4 because the first guess had N there and it was wrong? So no, the secret word does not have N at position 4.

 Therefore, if we use ""POINT"", the N will be at position 4 again and we'll get '-' again (if N is present). But that doesn't help us find the position of N.

 So we should avoid the 4th position for N in this guess.

 Let's choose a word with N at position 5? That might be good. For example, ""LEMON"" but L, E is out (E is not allowed because we had E(x)). Or ""MANGO"" has A (which is out).

 We must avoid A and E. So words like ""POINT"" might not work because N is at 4 (same position) and also we don't know if O,I are in?

 Alternatively, let's try N at position 2? For example, ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. This avoids A,E and also R? It avoids the forbidden letters.

 ""SNOUT"" has S, N, O, U, T. All letters are among the available ones.

 Let's check: S, N, O, U, T. We haven't tried any of these except N? But we already know N is present, so it's okay.

 Alternatively, N at position 5: ""TOWNS""? T-O-W-N-S has W and S? Avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are also testing other letters. We want to maximize information.

 Since we know N is in the word, and we are going to put it in a new position, we can also test other common consonants.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" is not good because position 4 is same. So avoid that.

 How about ""BLIND""? B-L-I-N-D has N at position 4, so same as before? Then again we'd get a '-' for N? And that doesn't help. So let's choose a word that places N at a position that hasn't been tried: either 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Since position 4 was tried and wrong, we should try 1,2,3, or 5.

 Let's list words with N in positions 1,2,3,5 that don't use C,R,A,E.

 Position 1: ""N"" words: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is forbidden. ""NOISY""? N-O-I-S-Y. Letters: N,O,I,S,Y. All allowed? Yes. But O,I,S,Y are new.

 Position 2: ""SNAIL""? But A is forbidden. ""SNOUT"" (S-N-O-U-T). This has U? Not common, but okay.

 Position 3: ""POINT"" only if we move N? But N is at 4 in that. ""POINT"" cannot be changed. ""ALIGN"" has A? Forbidden. ""PLUMB""? No N. How about ""POINT"" but we skip? Not good.

 Actually, ""HINGE"" has E? Forbidden.

 So let's go with ""NOISY"": N at position 1. This will break new ground.

 Or ""UPSET""? But U is less common. And E is forbidden? E? Wait, we cannot use E.

 So ""NOISY"" seems good: N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

 What about ""SONIC""? But C is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C,R,A,E.

 Another word: ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N at position 4? Same as before? So I think we should skip that.

 Alternatively, ""WORDY""? W-O-R-D-Y -> but R is forbidden? R is out? Because in first guess R was marked 'x', meaning not in the word. So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

 So in ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. Does not contain C,R,A,E. And N is at position 2.

 Similarly, ""NOISY"": N-O-I-S-Y. Also avoids forbidden letters.

 Both are valid. Which one gives more information?

 We want to test common letters. S and T are very common. So ""SNOUT"" has T at the end? And O and U? U is less common.

 ""NOISY"" has O, I, S, Y.

 I think ""SNOUT"" might be better because it includes T and S? Also, if the secret word has S or T, that would be helpful.

 But note: we know the secret word has at least one N? So let's check the frequency.

 Also, we are avoiding R,A,E and C.

 Another possibility: ""STOMP""? But no N? We need to include N because we know it's present? Actually, we don't have to? But including N might help us locate it? And it's efficient.

 We have two goals: find the position of N and test new letters.

 Since N is the only known letter to be in the word, we should try to find its position.

 Therefore, let's include N in the guess and place it in a new position.

 So for ""NOISY"": N at position 1 -> that hasn't been tested. Previously N was at 4.

 For ""SNOUT"": N at position 2 -> also new.

 For ""TUNIC""? But C is forbidden? And U? And also, N is at position 3? So that's also new.

 How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N: but has two N's? It might be valid, but then if the secret word has only one N, we might get mixed feedback? But it's okay.

 However, to keep it simple, let's start with ""SNOUT"" because it has S,T which are common.

 So I'll go with ""SNOUT"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has S? Then we'll get information.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is avoided because position 4 is the same and we avoid R? Wait, ""POINT"" does not have R? It has P,O,I,N,T. And R is forbidden? So we can't use R? But ""POINT"" doesn't have R? So it is allowed? But N at position 4? Which is the same as before? Then we would get '-' for N again? And we already know it's present? That doesn't help.

 So I avoid ""POINT"".

 Final decision: ""SNOUT""

<guess>snout</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (all marked ❌).
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ➖).

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include **N** (since we know it's in the word) but **avoid position 4** for N.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, E.
- Help test new common letters to gather more information.

After considering common letters like S, T, O, I, and L, I chose **""SNOUT""** because:
- It places **N** in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and the disqualified position for N (position 4).
- It contains new high-frequency consonants (**S**, **T**) and vowels (**O**, **U**), maximizing potential feedback.

This guess tests multiple unknown positions efficiently.

<guess>snout</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: snout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""snout"" -> S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - S, U, T are not in the word.
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""snout"" is S-N-O-U-T, so N is the second letter).
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since O is the third letter in ""snout"").

So, from the second guess:
  - N is confirmed at position 2 (second letter).
  - O is confirmed at position 3 (third letter).

Also, we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

We now know two letters in the secret word: 
  - The second letter is N.
  - The third letter is O.

So the secret word has the form: _ N O _ _

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.

We have 4 guesses left.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ N O _ _ and uses only letters that are not excluded.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use O and N again, but we know their positions).

But note: we already know O and N are in the word and in the correct positions, so we can use them to confirm, but we need to test the other positions.

We should avoid using known absent letters.

We want to test common letters for the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Common letters that are still available: L, I, D, H, P, M, B, G, etc.

We can try a word that has the form _ N O _ _ and uses new letters to test.

For example, we can try:

- Using I: since it's a common vowel. But we don't know if I is in the word.
- Or L, D, etc.

Possible words that fit _ N O _ _ and use available letters:

Let's think of words: 
  - ""INBOX""? But B and X? And we don't know if B or X are in. Also, ""INBOX"" has I at position 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. But we don't know about I, B, X.

But we must avoid the forbidden letters: C,R,A,E,S,U,T.

""INBOX"" is valid in terms of avoiding forbidden letters? Yes.

But we might want to use more common letters.

Another word: ""DINGO""? D-I-N-G-O -> but that would be D at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2, so that doesn't fit the pattern. We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.

So the pattern is fixed: [letter1] N O [letter4] [letter5]

So words like:
  - ""SNOWY""? But S is forbidden? S is out, so no.
  - ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters.
  - ""MINOR""? M-I-N-O-R -> but R is forbidden? R is out, so no.
  - ""PINOT""? P-I-N-O-T -> T is forbidden? T is out, so no.
  - ""WINOS""? W-I-N-O-S -> S is forbidden? S is out, and also T? But S is out. Also, it has S at the end? And we need 5 letters? ""WINOS"" is 5 letters: W-I-N-O-S. But S is forbidden? Yes, so invalid.

We need to avoid S, T, R, A, E, C, U.

So let's list possible words:

  - ""INBOX"": I, N, O, B, X -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. But X is uncommon.
  - ""DONOR""? D-O-N-O-R -> but that's D at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2 and O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? So pattern is wrong. We need _ N O _ _, so second letter N, third letter O.

  - ""MINOR"": M-I-N-O-R -> but that's M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4? Not matching. We need N at 2 and O at 3.

  - ""BONGO"": B-O-N-G-O -> B at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and 5? Not matching.

  - ""CONDO""? C is forbidden? No, C is out.

  - ""PONGO"": P-O-N-G-O -> P at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? This has N at 3? Not matching.

  - ""JUMBO""? J-U-M-B-O -> but U is forbidden? U is out.

  - ""LIMBO""? L-I-M-B-O -> L at 1, I at 2, M at 3, B at 4, O at 5? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

  - ""NINON""? N at 1? But we don't know if N is at 1? And we have N at 2? This word has two N's? But pattern: N at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2? So no.

  - ""BONEY""? B-O-N-E-Y -> but E is forbidden? E is out.

  - ""ZONAL""? Z-O-N-A-L -> A is forbidden? A is out.

  - ""HONEY""? H-O-N-E-Y -> E is forbidden.

  - ""FONDU""? F-O-N-D-U -> U is forbidden.

  - ""GONAD""? G-O-N-A-D -> A is forbidden.

  - ""IONIC""? I-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""MONTH""? M-O-N-T-H -> T is forbidden? T is out.

  - ""BONNY""? B-O-N-N-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? Not matching.

  - ""DONUT""? D-O-N-U-T -> U and T are forbidden.

  - ""PIOUS""? P-I-O-U-S -> U and S are forbidden.

  - ""VIOLA""? V-I-O-L-A -> A is forbidden.

  - ""BIOME""? B-I-O-M-E -> E is forbidden.

  - ""GIVEN""? G-I-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.

  - ""LIVID""? L-I-V-I-D -> no O? Doesn't have O at 3? We don't need to have O? But we know O is at position 3? So we must have O at 3.

  - ""MOLDY""? M-O-L-D-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

  - ""POLYP""? P-O-L-Y-P -> O at 2? Not matching.

  - ""WOVEN""? W-O-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.

  - ""YOGIC""? Y-O-G-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""YONIC""? Y-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.

  - ""YONIS""? Y-O-N-I-S -> S is forbidden.

  - ""YOWIE""? Y-O-W-I-E -> E is forbidden.

This is getting difficult. Maybe we need to consider that the word might have double letters? But we don't know.

Another idea: ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters. ""KNOWN""? But that's 5 letters: K-N-O-W-N. Let's check:

  - ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

This fits the pattern: _ N O _ _ -> K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

And it avoids forbidden letters? 
  - K: not forbidden? 
  - W: not forbidden? 
  - N: we know is in, and we are using it at 2 and 5? But we know position 2 is correct, so we can use it again? 
  - O: at position 3, which is correct.

But we are testing if there is another N? And also testing K and W.

Also, the forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,U,T. So K, W, N, O are allowed.

So ""KNOWN"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using N at position 5? We don't know if there is an N at position 5? But we know there is at least one N (at position 2). It could have two N's.

Another word: ""MINOR"" doesn't fit. ""DONOR"" doesn't fit.

""POUND""? P-O-U-N-D -> but U is forbidden? And also, pattern: P at 1, O at 2, U at 3? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

""FOUND""? F-O-U-N-D -> U forbidden.

""BOUND""? Same.

""WOUND""? Same.

""JOINT""? J-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""POINT""? P-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""MOIST""? M-O-I-S-T -> S and T forbidden.

""NOISY""? We tried? No, we tried ""SNOUT"", not ""NOISY"". But ""NOISY"" is N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

But we know O is at position 3? So we must have the third letter O.

So back to ""KNOWN"": it fits the pattern: K-N-O-W-N.

We can also consider ""MINOX""? But not common? And X? ""MINOX"" is M-I-N-O-X? Pattern: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""BONZE""? B-O-N-Z-E -> E forbidden.

""CONKY""? C forbidden.

""JONTY""? J-O-N-T-Y -> T forbidden.

""KNOPS""? K-N-O-P-S -> S forbidden.

""KNOSP""? Same.

""NOBLY""? N-O-B-L-Y -> O at 2? Not matching.

""NOLLY""? Same.

""NOXAL""? N-O-X-A-L -> A forbidden.

""NYLON""? N-Y-L-O-N -> N at 1 and 5, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4? But we need O at 3? Not matching.

""ONION""? O-N-I-O-N -> O at 1? But we need the first letter to be anything and then N at 2? This has O at 1, N at 2, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5. But we need O at 3? This has I at 3? So not matching.

""ONLAY""? O-N-L-A-Y -> A forbidden.

""PINON""? P-I-N-O-N -> P at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""SONLY""? S forbidden.

""TONDO""? T forbidden.

""VODOU""? V-O-D-O-U -> U forbidden.

""YONKS""? Y-O-N-K-S -> S forbidden.

So ""KNOWN"" seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""GNOW""? Not 5 letters.

""GROWN""? G-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.

""PROWL""? P-R-O-W-L -> R forbidden.

""BROWN""? B-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.

So ""KNOWN"" is acceptable.

We can also try ""KNOWP""? Not a word.

""KNOWE""? E forbidden.

So I think ""KNOWN"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

But note: we are using two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's? But that's okay because we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have N at the end? But we don't know the other positions.

Another word: ""INBOX"" doesn't fit because it has I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. That fits the pattern? Yes: _ N O _ _ -> I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5.

And it avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, B, X are not forbidden? I is allowed, B is allowed, X is allowed? X is less common, but it's a valid letter.

But ""INBOX"" is a word? Yes, it means a box for incoming mail.

But ""KNOWN"" is more common? Or not? We can choose.

We can also consider ""DINGO"" but it doesn't fit.

Another word: ""BINGO""? B-I-N-G-O -> B at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

""JINGO""? Same.

""LINGO""? L-I-N-G-O -> same.

So not.

""WINDO""? Not a word? Or ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.

""BLOND""? B-L-O-N-D -> pattern: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 3? And N at 4? But we know N is at 2? So this has L at 2? Not matching.

We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.

So ""BLOND"" has L at 2? Not N.

So not.

Therefore, I think ""KNOWN"" and ""INBOX"" are two options.

Let me choose ""KNOWN"" because it uses more common letters? Or ""INBOX"" uses I and B which are common? But X is less common.

But we have to test the letters.

We can also consider ""PINOT"" but T is forbidden.

Another word: ""DONOR"" doesn't fit.

""MINOR"" doesn't fit.

""FINCH""? F-I-N-C-H -> C forbidden.

""LINCH""? Not a word.

""VINYL""? V-I-N-Y-L -> pattern: V at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.

So I think we should go with ""KNOWN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: we know the word is _ N O _ _

So ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. That matches.

We can also try ""KNOWP"" not a word.

Or ""KNOWE"" not allowed because of E.

So I choose ""KNOWN"".

But note: we are using N at position 5. If the secret word has only one N, then the N at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we know N is at position 2, so if there is no second N, then the fifth letter N will be marked as not present? Or if it is present but in the wrong position? But position 5 is new, so it could be.

But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at the end? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""DONKO""? Not common.

""JONNY""? J-O-N-N-Y -> J at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.

""CONVO""? C forbidden.

""BONGO"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""KNOWN"" is a good choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""KNOWN""

<guess>known</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`  
  Meaning:  
  - ❌ `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ `N` is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""snout""**  
  Feedback: `S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)`  
  Meaning:  
  - ❌ `S`, `U`, `T` are **not** in the word.  
  - ✓ `N` is **correct and in position 2**.  
  - ✓ `O` is **correct and in position 3**.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N O _ _` (second letter is `N`, third letter is `O`).  
- Excluded letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T` (cannot be used).  
- Confirmed letters: `N` (position 2), `O` (position 3).  
- Remaining positions to solve: **1st, 4th, and 5th letters**.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test common letters for positions 1, 4, and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Use a word that fits `_ N O _ _` and includes high-frequency unused letters (e.g., `I`, `L`, `D`, `H`, `P`, `M`, `B`, `G`, `Y`).  
  - Prioritize words that test multiple new letters to maximize information.  
- **Chosen word**: **""KNOWN""**  
  - Fits the pattern: `K` (position 1), `N` (position 2, confirmed), `O` (position 3, confirmed), `W` (position 4), `N` (position 5).  
  - Tests new letters: `K` (position 1), `W` (position 4), and `N` (position 5—to check for a possible second `N`).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `S`, `U`, `T`).  

This guess efficiently probes the unknown positions while leveraging confirmed letters to narrow possibilities.

It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\n This means:\n   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (since ""crane"" has N at position 4, but it\'s marked as \'-\', meaning it\'s present but in a different position).\n   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked \'x\').\n\n So, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E. And it does contain an N, but not in the 4th position.\n\n We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.\n\n Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, we should try a word that includes N and places it in a different position.\n Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.\n\n Let\'s think of common 5-letter words that include N and exclude C, R, A, E.\n\n The word must have N, and we know it\'s not at position 4. So positions for N could be 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n We also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Available letters: We still have most consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we are missing vowels (A and E are out), we should consider using I and O or U.\n\n Common vowels: I, O, U.\n\n We can try words that have multiple common letters and include N.\n\n Let me list some possibilities:\n\n Option: ""POINT"" - P, O, I, N, T. This has N at position 4? But wait, we need N not at position 4? Actually, no: our first guess had N at position 4, but that was wrong. So the secret word has N, but not at position 4. In ""POINT"", if we put N at position 4, that would be the same position? But the feedback says that position is wrong, so we don\'t want N at position 4 again? Actually, we can use a word with N at position 4 again? No, because we know it\'s wrong. But we don\'t have to avoid position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it\'s not there. Better to move N to another position.\n\n So let\'s try to put N at a new position.\n\n Possibilities for positions: We can put N at position 1? Like ""N _ _ _ _"", or position 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Example words:\n   N at position 1: ""NOISY"", ""NIGHT"" (but contains H? and we don\'t know) - however, avoid R,A,E. ""NOISY"" has O and I, which are good.\n\n But we also want to cover more common letters. Let\'s consider S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Another good starting word might be ""POINT"", but that places N at position 4, which we already know is incorrect? Actually, we can use it if we want, but then the N at position 4 will be marked wrong again, which doesn\'t give new information. So better to put N in a new position.\n\n How about ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N is at position 4? So same position. We can try ""POINT"" but we\'ll know if N appears again? Actually, the feedback will tell us again that N is present but wrong position? If the secret word has N in position 4, then it would be correct? But we know it\'s not in position 4 because the first guess had N there and it was wrong? So no, the secret word does not have N at position 4.\n\n Therefore, if we use ""POINT"", the N will be at position 4 again and we\'ll get \'-\' again (if N is present). But that doesn\'t help us find the position of N.\n\n So we should avoid the 4th position for N in this guess.\n\n Let\'s choose a word with N at position 5? That might be good. For example, ""LEMON"" but L, E is out (E is not allowed because we had E(x)). Or ""MANGO"" has A (which is out).\n\n We must avoid A and E. So words like ""POINT"" might not work because N is at 4 (same position) and also we don\'t know if O,I are in?\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try N at position 2? For example, ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. This avoids A,E and also R? It avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n ""SNOUT"" has S, N, O, U, T. All letters are among the available ones.\n\n Let\'s check: S, N, O, U, T. We haven\'t tried any of these except N? But we already know N is present, so it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, N at position 5: ""TOWNS""? T-O-W-N-S has W and S? Avoids forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are also testing other letters. We want to maximize information.\n\n Since we know N is in the word, and we are going to put it in a new position, we can also test other common consonants.\n\n Another idea: ""POINT"" is not good because position 4 is same. So avoid that.\n\n How about ""BLIND""? B-L-I-N-D has N at position 4, so same as before? Then again we\'d get a \'-\' for N? And that doesn\'t help. So let\'s choose a word that places N at a position that hasn\'t been tried: either 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Since position 4 was tried and wrong, we should try 1,2,3, or 5.\n\n Let\'s list words with N in positions 1,2,3,5 that don\'t use C,R,A,E.\n\n Position 1: ""N"" words: ""NOVEL""? But E and L? E is forbidden. ""NOISY""? N-O-I-S-Y. Letters: N,O,I,S,Y. All allowed? Yes. But O,I,S,Y are new.\n\n Position 2: ""SNAIL""? But A is forbidden. ""SNOUT"" (S-N-O-U-T). This has U? Not common, but okay.\n\n Position 3: ""POINT"" only if we move N? But N is at 4 in that. ""POINT"" cannot be changed. ""ALIGN"" has A? Forbidden. ""PLUMB""? No N. How about ""POINT"" but we skip? Not good.\n\n Actually, ""HINGE"" has E? Forbidden.\n\n So let\'s go with ""NOISY"": N at position 1. This will break new ground.\n\n Or ""UPSET""? But U is less common. And E is forbidden? E? Wait, we cannot use E.\n\n So ""NOISY"" seems good: N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.\n\n What about ""SONIC""? But C is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C,R,A,E.\n\n Another word: ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T: N at position 4? Same as before? So I think we should skip that.\n\n Alternatively, ""WORDY""? W-O-R-D-Y -> but R is forbidden? R is out? Because in first guess R was marked \'x\', meaning not in the word. So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.\n\n So in ""SNOUT"": S-N-O-U-T. Does not contain C,R,A,E. And N is at position 2.\n\n Similarly, ""NOISY"": N-O-I-S-Y. Also avoids forbidden letters.\n\n Both are valid. Which one gives more information?\n\n We want to test common letters. S and T are very common. So ""SNOUT"" has T at the end? And O and U? U is less common.\n\n ""NOISY"" has O, I, S, Y.\n\n I think ""SNOUT"" might be better because it includes T and S? Also, if the secret word has S or T, that would be helpful.\n\n But note: we know the secret word has at least one N? So let\'s check the frequency.\n\n Also, we are avoiding R,A,E and C.\n\n Another possibility: ""STOMP""? But no N? We need to include N because we know it\'s present? Actually, we don\'t have to? But including N might help us locate it? And it\'s efficient.\n\n We have two goals: find the position of N and test new letters.\n\n Since N is the only known letter to be in the word, we should try to find its position.\n\n Therefore, let\'s include N in the guess and place it in a new position.\n\n So for ""NOISY"": N at position 1 -> that hasn\'t been tested. Previously N was at 4.\n\n For ""SNOUT"": N at position 2 -> also new.\n\n For ""TUNIC""? But C is forbidden? And U? And also, N is at position 3? So that\'s also new.\n\n How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N: but has two N\'s? It might be valid, but then if the secret word has only one N, we might get mixed feedback? But it\'s okay.\n\n However, to keep it simple, let\'s start with ""SNOUT"" because it has S,T which are common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""SNOUT"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has S? Then we\'ll get information.\n\n Alternatively, ""POINT"" is avoided because position 4 is the same and we avoid R? Wait, ""POINT"" does not have R? It has P,O,I,N,T. And R is forbidden? So we can\'t use R? But ""POINT"" doesn\'t have R? So it is allowed? But N at position 4? Which is the same as before? Then we would get \'-\' for N again? And we already know it\'s present? That doesn\'t help.\n\n So I avoid ""POINT"".\n\n Final decision: ""SNOUT""\n\n<guess>snout</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (all marked ❌).\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ➖).\n\nTherefore, the new guess must:\n- Include **N** (since we know it\'s in the word) but **avoid position 4** for N.\n- Exclude the letters C, R, A, E.\n- Help test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter considering common letters like S, T, O, I, and L, I chose **""SNOUT""** because:\n- It places **N** in **position 2** (a new position to test).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E) and the disqualified position for N (position 4).\n- It contains new high-frequency consonants (**S**, **T**) and vowels (**O**, **U**), maximizing potential feedback.\n\nThis guess tests multiple unknown positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>snout</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.\n  - N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""snout"" -> S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S, U, T are not in the word.\n  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""snout"" is S-N-O-U-T, so N is the second letter).\n  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since O is the third letter in ""snout"").\n\nSo, from the second guess:\n  - N is confirmed at position 2 (second letter).\n  - O is confirmed at position 3 (third letter).\n\nAlso, we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.\n\nWe now know two letters in the secret word: \n  - The second letter is N.\n  - The third letter is O.\n\nSo the secret word has the form: _ N O _ _\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, U, T.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ N O _ _ and uses only letters that are not excluded.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use O and N again, but we know their positions).\n\nBut note: we already know O and N are in the word and in the correct positions, so we can use them to confirm, but we need to test the other positions.\n\nWe should avoid using known absent letters.\n\nWe want to test common letters for the first, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nCommon letters that are still available: L, I, D, H, P, M, B, G, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has the form _ N O _ _ and uses new letters to test.\n\nFor example, we can try:\n\n- Using I: since it\'s a common vowel. But we don\'t know if I is in the word.\n- Or L, D, etc.\n\nPossible words that fit _ N O _ _ and use available letters:\n\nLet\'s think of words: \n  - ""INBOX""? But B and X? And we don\'t know if B or X are in. Also, ""INBOX"" has I at position 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. But we don\'t know about I, B, X.\n\nBut we must avoid the forbidden letters: C,R,A,E,S,U,T.\n\n""INBOX"" is valid in terms of avoiding forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut we might want to use more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DINGO""? D-I-N-G-O -> but that would be D at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2, so that doesn\'t fit the pattern. We need the second letter to be N and third to be O.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: [letter1] N O [letter4] [letter5]\n\nSo words like:\n  - ""SNOWY""? But S is forbidden? S is out, so no.\n  - ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters.\n  - ""MINOR""? M-I-N-O-R -> but R is forbidden? R is out, so no.\n  - ""PINOT""? P-I-N-O-T -> T is forbidden? T is out, so no.\n  - ""WINOS""? W-I-N-O-S -> S is forbidden? S is out, and also T? But S is out. Also, it has S at the end? And we need 5 letters? ""WINOS"" is 5 letters: W-I-N-O-S. But S is forbidden? Yes, so invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid S, T, R, A, E, C, U.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n\n  - ""INBOX"": I, N, O, B, X -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. But X is uncommon.\n  - ""DONOR""? D-O-N-O-R -> but that\'s D at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2 and O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? So pattern is wrong. We need _ N O _ _, so second letter N, third letter O.\n\n  - ""MINOR"": M-I-N-O-R -> but that\'s M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4? Not matching. We need N at 2 and O at 3.\n\n  - ""BONGO"": B-O-N-G-O -> B at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and 5? Not matching.\n\n  - ""CONDO""? C is forbidden? No, C is out.\n\n  - ""PONGO"": P-O-N-G-O -> P at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? This has N at 3? Not matching.\n\n  - ""JUMBO""? J-U-M-B-O -> but U is forbidden? U is out.\n\n  - ""LIMBO""? L-I-M-B-O -> L at 1, I at 2, M at 3, B at 4, O at 5? But we need O at 3? Not matching.\n\n  - ""NINON""? N at 1? But we don\'t know if N is at 1? And we have N at 2? This word has two N\'s? But pattern: N at 1, I at 2? But we need N at 2? So no.\n\n  - ""BONEY""? B-O-N-E-Y -> but E is forbidden? E is out.\n\n  - ""ZONAL""? Z-O-N-A-L -> A is forbidden? A is out.\n\n  - ""HONEY""? H-O-N-E-Y -> E is forbidden.\n\n  - ""FONDU""? F-O-N-D-U -> U is forbidden.\n\n  - ""GONAD""? G-O-N-A-D -> A is forbidden.\n\n  - ""IONIC""? I-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.\n\n  - ""MONTH""? M-O-N-T-H -> T is forbidden? T is out.\n\n  - ""BONNY""? B-O-N-N-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2 and N at 3? Not matching.\n\n  - ""DONUT""? D-O-N-U-T -> U and T are forbidden.\n\n  - ""PIOUS""? P-I-O-U-S -> U and S are forbidden.\n\n  - ""VIOLA""? V-I-O-L-A -> A is forbidden.\n\n  - ""BIOME""? B-I-O-M-E -> E is forbidden.\n\n  - ""GIVEN""? G-I-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.\n\n  - ""LIVID""? L-I-V-I-D -> no O? Doesn\'t have O at 3? We don\'t need to have O? But we know O is at position 3? So we must have O at 3.\n\n  - ""MOLDY""? M-O-L-D-Y -> O at 2? But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.\n\n  - ""POLYP""? P-O-L-Y-P -> O at 2? Not matching.\n\n  - ""WOVEN""? W-O-V-E-N -> E is forbidden.\n\n  - ""YOGIC""? Y-O-G-I-C -> C is forbidden.\n\n  - ""YONIC""? Y-O-N-I-C -> C is forbidden.\n\n  - ""YONIS""? Y-O-N-I-S -> S is forbidden.\n\n  - ""YOWIE""? Y-O-W-I-E -> E is forbidden.\n\nThis is getting difficult. Maybe we need to consider that the word might have double letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: ""KNOW""? Not 5 letters. ""KNOWN""? But that\'s 5 letters: K-N-O-W-N. Let\'s check:\n\n  - ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.\n\nThis fits the pattern: _ N O _ _ -> K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.\n\nAnd it avoids forbidden letters? \n  - K: not forbidden? \n  - W: not forbidden? \n  - N: we know is in, and we are using it at 2 and 5? But we know position 2 is correct, so we can use it again? \n  - O: at position 3, which is correct.\n\nBut we are testing if there is another N? And also testing K and W.\n\nAlso, the forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,U,T. So K, W, N, O are allowed.\n\nSo ""KNOWN"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut note: we are using N at position 5? We don\'t know if there is an N at position 5? But we know there is at least one N (at position 2). It could have two N\'s.\n\nAnother word: ""MINOR"" doesn\'t fit. ""DONOR"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n""POUND""? P-O-U-N-D -> but U is forbidden? And also, pattern: P at 1, O at 2, U at 3? But we need O at 3? Not matching.\n\n""FOUND""? F-O-U-N-D -> U forbidden.\n\n""BOUND""? Same.\n\n""WOUND""? Same.\n\n""JOINT""? J-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.\n\n""POINT""? P-O-I-N-T -> T forbidden? And pattern: P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 2? Not matching.\n\n""MOIST""? M-O-I-S-T -> S and T forbidden.\n\n""NOISY""? We tried? No, we tried ""SNOUT"", not ""NOISY"". But ""NOISY"" is N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, Y at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 2? Not matching.\n\nBut we know O is at position 3? So we must have the third letter O.\n\nSo back to ""KNOWN"": it fits the pattern: K-N-O-W-N.\n\nWe can also consider ""MINOX""? But not common? And X? ""MINOX"" is M-I-N-O-X? Pattern: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.\n\n""BONZE""? B-O-N-Z-E -> E forbidden.\n\n""CONKY""? C forbidden.\n\n""JONTY""? J-O-N-T-Y -> T forbidden.\n\n""KNOPS""? K-N-O-P-S -> S forbidden.\n\n""KNOSP""? Same.\n\n""NOBLY""? N-O-B-L-Y -> O at 2? Not matching.\n\n""NOLLY""? Same.\n\n""NOXAL""? N-O-X-A-L -> A forbidden.\n\n""NYLON""? N-Y-L-O-N -> N at 1 and 5, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4? But we need O at 3? Not matching.\n\n""ONION""? O-N-I-O-N -> O at 1? But we need the first letter to be anything and then N at 2? This has O at 1, N at 2, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5. But we need O at 3? This has I at 3? So not matching.\n\n""ONLAY""? O-N-L-A-Y -> A forbidden.\n\n""PINON""? P-I-N-O-N -> P at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.\n\n""SONLY""? S forbidden.\n\n""TONDO""? T forbidden.\n\n""VODOU""? V-O-D-O-U -> U forbidden.\n\n""YONKS""? Y-O-N-K-S -> S forbidden.\n\nSo ""KNOWN"" seems like a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""GNOW""? Not 5 letters.\n\n""GROWN""? G-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.\n\n""PROWL""? P-R-O-W-L -> R forbidden.\n\n""BROWN""? B-R-O-W-N -> R forbidden.\n\nSo ""KNOWN"" is acceptable.\n\nWe can also try ""KNOWP""? Not a word.\n\n""KNOWE""? E forbidden.\n\nSo I think ""KNOWN"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.\n\nBut note: we are using two N\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s? But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have N at the end? But we don\'t know the other positions.\n\nAnother word: ""INBOX"" doesn\'t fit because it has I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5. That fits the pattern? Yes: _ N O _ _ -> I at 1, N at 2, O at 3, B at 4, X at 5.\n\nAnd it avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, B, X are not forbidden? I is allowed, B is allowed, X is allowed? X is less common, but it\'s a valid letter.\n\nBut ""INBOX"" is a word? Yes, it means a box for incoming mail.\n\nBut ""KNOWN"" is more common? Or not? We can choose.\n\nWe can also consider ""DINGO"" but it doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother word: ""BINGO""? B-I-N-G-O -> B at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.\n\n""JINGO""? Same.\n\n""LINGO""? L-I-N-G-O -> same.\n\nSo not.\n\n""WINDO""? Not a word? Or ""WINDOW"" is 6 letters.\n\n""BLOND""? B-L-O-N-D -> pattern: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we need O at 3? This has O at 3? And N at 4? But we know N is at 2? So this has L at 2? Not matching.\n\nWe need the second letter to be N and third to be O.\n\nSo ""BLOND"" has L at 2? Not N.\n\nSo not.\n\nTherefore, I think ""KNOWN"" and ""INBOX"" are two options.\n\nLet me choose ""KNOWN"" because it uses more common letters? Or ""INBOX"" uses I and B which are common? But X is less common.\n\nBut we have to test the letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""PINOT"" but T is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""DONOR"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n""MINOR"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n""FINCH""? F-I-N-C-H -> C forbidden.\n\n""LINCH""? Not a word.\n\n""VINYL""? V-I-N-Y-L -> pattern: V at 1, I at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? Not matching.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""KNOWN"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: we know the word is _ N O _ _\n\nSo ""KNOWN"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5. That matches.\n\nWe can also try ""KNOWP"" not a word.\n\nOr ""KNOWE"" not allowed because of E.\n\nSo I choose ""KNOWN"".\n\nBut note: we are using N at position 5. If the secret word has only one N, then the N at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we know N is at position 2, so if there is no second N, then the fifth letter N will be marked as not present? Or if it is present but in the wrong position?

We have the feedback from the third guess: ""known"" -> K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- K(✓): K is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N(✓): N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). We already knew this from guess 2.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). We already knew this from guess 2.
- W(x): W is not in the word at all.
- N(-): The N at position 5 is in the word but not in that position. Since we already know there is an N at position 2, this means there is another N in the word? But wait, the feedback for the fifth letter is marked as '-', meaning it is present but in the wrong position. However, we already have an N at position 2. This suggests that the word has at least two N's? But the fifth position is wrong for N, so the second N must be in one of the remaining positions (4 or 5, but 5 is wrong, so it must be in position 4? Or in position 1? But position 1 is K, which is correct, so not N. Position 2 is N, position 3 is O, so the only other positions are 4 and 5. But position 5 is marked as N present but wrong position? That would imply that the word has an N at position 4? But we have a W at position 4 in this guess, which is marked as absent (W(x)), so position 4 is not W and not N? 

Wait, let's clarify: the feedback for the fifth letter is N(-). This means:
- The letter N is present in the word, but not at position 5.
- Since we already have an N at position 2 (which is correct), this implies there is at least one more N in the word? Or could it be that the N at position 2 is the only N, and the feedback for the fifth letter is indicating that the N is present (which we know) but not at position 5? But that would be redundant because we already know the N is at position 2. 

However, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. The rules are:
- If a letter is in the correct position, it gets a ✓.
- For letters that are in the word but in the wrong position, they get a '-'.
- If a letter is not in the word, it gets an 'x'.

But if a letter appears more than once, the feedback only accounts for the occurrences that are either correct or present. For example, if the word has one N and you guess two N's, one of them might be marked as present and the other as absent if the word only has one. But in this case, we have:

In ""known"": 
- Position 2: N is correct (✓) — this accounts for one N.
- Position 5: N is marked as present but wrong position (-). This would typically mean that there is a second N in the word? Because if there were only one N, and it's already been used in position 2 (correct), then the N at position 5 would be marked as absent (x). But here it's marked as present (-), so that suggests there is a second N in the word, and it's not at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has at least two N's: one at position 2 and one elsewhere (but not at position 5). The only positions left are 1, 3, 4. But position 1 is K (which is correct, so not N) and position 3 is O (correct, not N). So the only possibility is that the second N is at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word must have N at position 4? But wait, in our guess, position 4 was W, which is marked as absent. So if position 4 is N, then in the guess ""known"", the fourth letter is W, which is wrong, but the fifth letter is N, which is present but in the wrong position. However, if the word has N at position 4, then the N at position 5 in the guess should be marked as absent because the word only has two N's (one at 2 and one at 4) and we've already ""used"" the two N's? 

But the feedback for position 5 is N(-), meaning it is present but in the wrong position. If the word has an N at position 4, then the N at position 5 in the guess is not matching, but it is present elsewhere? But we have two N's in the guess: one at position 2 (correct) and one at position 5. The word has two N's: at position 2 and 4. Then the feedback should be:
- Position 2: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not at 5, but there is another N at 4? But the feedback for position 5 would be that N is present but in the wrong position? However, the word has two N's, and we have two N's in the guess. The one at position 2 is accounted for, and the one at position 5: since the word has an N at 4 (which is not position 5), it should be marked as present but wrong position. So that matches.

But what about position 4? We have W at position 4, and the word has N at position 4? Then W is not in the word? So W(x) is correct.

So the secret word must be: K N O N _ 

Because:
- Position 1: K (from the ✓ in guess 3)
- Position 2: N (confirmed)
- Position 3: O (confirmed)
- Position 4: must be N? Because we have evidence of a second N and the only position left is 4? But we have position 5 left as well.

The word has two N's: one at 2 and one at 4? Then what about position 5? It could be any letter except the excluded ones.

But the feedback for the fifth letter N in ""known"" is marked as present but wrong position. If the word has N at position 4, then the N at position 5 is indeed in the wrong position (it should be at 4). So that fits.

But what if the word has three N's? Then the N at position 5 could be present but in the wrong position? But that would require the word to have an N at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? So if the word had an N at position 5, then the guess at position 5 would be correct? But it's marked as wrong position, so the word does not have an N at position 5. Therefore, the second N must be at position 4.

So the secret word is: K N O N ?

Now, we need to find the fifth letter. The fifth letter cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, S, U, T, W (because W is now excluded from the feedback of guess 3: W(x)).

Also, from guess 1, we know that N is at position 4? No, in guess 1 ""crane"", we had N at position 4 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. Now we know that the N is at position 2 and 4? So in guess 1, the N was at position 4 in the guess, but the word has N at position 2 and 4? Then the feedback for guess 1 should have shown two '-' for N? But in guess 1, we had only one N, at position 4, and it was marked as '-', which is consistent because the word has an N at position 2 (which we didn't guess) and at position 4? But we only guessed one N, so it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in guess 1, we didn't guess the N at position 2, so the feedback for the N at position 4 would be '-' because there is an N in the word (at position 2) but not at 4? But now we know the word has an N at position 4? That would be a contradiction.

Let me reexamine:

In guess 1: ""crane"" -> N at position 4 was marked as '-', meaning the letter N is in the word but not at position 4.

But if the word has an N at position 4, then the feedback for the N at position 4 in ""crane"" should have been a ✓? But it was marked as '-', which means that the word does not have an N at position 4. Therefore, the word cannot have an N at position 4.

This is a contradiction with our previous deduction.

So what's going on?

We must reconsider the feedback from guess 3.

In guess 3: ""known"" -> K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)

We have two N's in the guess: one at position 2 (correct) and one at position 5 (marked as present but wrong position).

The word has at least two N's? Or does it have only one N?

If the word has only one N (at position 2), then the N at position 5 in the guess should be marked as absent (x) because there is no other N. But it is marked as present (-), which implies that there is another N in the word.

But then, where is the second N? It cannot be at position 1, 3, or 5 because:
- Position 1 is K (correct, so not N)
- Position 3 is O (correct, so not N)
- Position 5 is marked as not N (because the feedback says it's present but not at 5, so it must be elsewhere).

The only position left is position 4. But if the word has an N at position 4, then in guess 1 (""crane""), the N at position 4 should have been marked as correct (✓) or at least present? But in guess 1, the N at position 4 was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). This would be inconsistent because if the word has an N at position 4, then when we guess N at position 4, it should be correct.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the word does not have an N at position 4. So where is the second N?

Perhaps the word has an N at position 1? But position 1 is K, which is correct, so it can't be N. Similarly, position 3 is O, correct.

So the only possibility is that the word has an N at position 5? But the feedback for position 5 in guess 3 is N(-), which means it is present but not at position 5. That would be a contradiction.

This is confusing. Let me think differently.

Alternative interpretation: the feedback for the second N in ""known"" (position 5) is marked as '-' because the word has only one N, but the feedback system is telling us that the N is present (which we know) but not at position 5? But that doesn't make sense because we already have a ✓ for the N at position 2. In Wordle, if a letter appears only once in the word, and you guess it in two positions, one correct and one incorrect, the incorrect one is marked as absent (x). 

For example, if the word is ""KNOLL"" (but we don't have that), and you guess ""KNOWN"", then:
- Position 2: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not in the word (because the word has only one N, at position 2), so it should be marked as x.

But in our feedback, it's marked as '-', which means present but wrong position. Therefore, the word must have a second N.

But then, where is it? The only positions are 1,3,4,5. But 1 and 3 are taken by K and O, which are correct, so they can't be N. Position 5 is marked as not N (because the '-' says it's present but not at 5). So position 4 must be N? But then we have a conflict with guess 1.

Unless the word has three N's? Then position 4 could be N and position 5 could be something else. But then in guess 1, when we had N at position 4, it should have been marked as correct if the word has N at position 4? But it was marked as '-', meaning not at position 4.

So the only way to resolve this is to realize that in guess 1, the N was marked as '-' because the word has an N, but not at position 4. And in guess 3, the N at position 5 is marked as '-' because there is another N in the word (besides the one at position 2) that is not at position 5. But the only position left is position 1 or 3, but they are fixed as K and O. So this is impossible.

Therefore, we must consider that the feedback for guess 3 might be indicating that the second N is in the word but not at position 5, and it must be at position 4, and then the feedback for guess 1 must be reexamined.

But in guess 1, we have ""crane"" with N at position 4. If the word has an N at position 4, then the feedback should have been a ✓ for that position. But it was not; it was '-'. So the word does not have an N at position 4.

This is a paradox.

Another possibility: the feedback for guess 3 might be misinterpreted. Let's read it again: ""K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)""

The fifth letter is N, and it is marked as '-', which means the letter N is in the word but not at position 5. But we already have an N at position 2. So there must be a second N in the word. But where? The only positions are 1,3,4,5. 1 and 3 are fixed as K and O, so they can't be N. 5 is not N (because of the '-'), so it must be at 4. But then why in guess 1 was the N at position 4 marked as '-' and not '✓'?

Unless the word does not have an N at position 4, but has an N at position 1 or 3? But they are fixed.

Perhaps the secret word has the letter N at position 2 and also at position 1 or 3, but we know position 1 is K and position 3 is O, so it can't be.

Unless the feedback for position 1 in guess 3 is wrong? But it's marked as ✓ for K, so position 1 is K.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback or in our reasoning.

Let me list what we know for sure:
- The word has at least one N, at position 2.
- The word has an O at position 3.
- The word does not have: C, R, A, E, S, U, T, W.
- From guess 3, the fifth letter N is present but not at position 5, so there is a second N in the word.
- The second N must be at position 1, 3, or 4. But position 1 is K (not N), position 3 is O (not N), so position 4 must be N.
- But then in guess 1, when we guessed N at position 4, it should have been marked as correct (✓) if the word has N at position 4. But it was marked as present but wrong position ('-'), which means the word does not have N at position 4.

This is the contradiction.

The only way out is if the word has three N's: at position 2, 4, and say 5? But then in guess 1, the N at position 4 should be correct, but it was marked as '-', so not correct. And in guess 3, the N at position 5 should be correct if the word has N at 5, but it's marked as '-', so not at 5. So positions 4 and 5 are not N, but we have a second N somewhere else? But there is no other position.

Unless the secret word has letters that are not in the first five? No, it's 5 letters.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 1's N being '-' is because the N is at position 2, but we didn't guess it at position 2 in guess 1. In guess 1, we guessed N at position 4, and the word has N at position 2, so it's present but not at 4, hence '-', which is correct. In guess 3, we have N at position 2 (correct) and N at position 5. The word has only one N? Then the N at position 5 should be 'x'. But it's '-', so there must be a second N.

But where? The only possibility is position 4 or 5. Position 5 is marked as not N (because '-'), so position 4 must be N. But then in guess 1, when we guessed N at position 4, it should be correct if the word has N at position 4. But it was not; it was '-', which means not at position 4.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word has an N at position 1 or 3, but we know position 1 is K and position 3 is O.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3 is: N at position 2 is ✓, and N at position 5 is '-', but the word has only one N, so the second N should be 'x'. But it's not, it's '-', so it must be that the word has a second N.

But then, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 1's N being '-' is because the word has N at position 2, not at 4, and in guess 3, the '-' for position 5 means there is a second N at position 4. But then the word has N at position 4, so guess 1's N at position 4 should have been correct.

This suggests that the feedback for guess 1 might have been misinterpreted.

Let's double-check the feedback for guess 1: ""crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)""

It says N(-), which means the N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

But if the word has N at position 4, then this feedback would be incorrect.

Therefore, the word cannot have N at position 4.

So we are back to square one.

Perhaps the secret word has the letter N at position 5? But in guess 3, the N at position 5 is marked as '-', which means it is in the word but not at position 5. So it can't be at position 5.

I think there's a possibility that the feedback for guess 3 is indicating that the N at position 5 is the same N as at position 2, and because the word has only one N, it should be marked as absent for the second occurrence. But the feedback says '-', which is not absent.

Unless the rules are different for duplicate letters, but in standard Wordle, if you guess a letter more times than it appears, the extras are marked as absent.

For example, if the word is ""KNOLL"", and you guess ""KNOWN"", then:
- K at 1: absent (x) if the word starts with K? But in our case, K is at 1 and correct.
Assume the word is ""KNOLL"":
- ""KNOWN"": K at 1: correct (✓)
- N at 2: correct (✓)
- O at 3: correct (✓)
- W at 4: absent (x) because the word has 'L' at 4
- N at 5: absent (x) because the word has 'L' at 5 and only one N.

But in our feedback, it's N(-) for position 5, which is not x.

So the word must have at least two N's.

Given that, and the only possible position for the second N is position 4, we must conclude that the feedback for guess 1 was in error or that the word does have N at position 4, and the feedback for guess 1 was '-' because perhaps the word has two N's, and the N at position 4 in guess 1 was not the only N, but it was in the correct position? No, if it's in the correct position, it should be '✓'.

I think there's a mistake in the initial setup or in our understanding.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 1's N is '-' because the word has an N, but not at position 4, and in guess 3, the '-' for position 5 means there is an N at position 4. This implies that between guess 1 and guess 3, the word changed? But that's not possible.

I think we have to accept that the word has N at position 4, and the feedback for guess 1 was a mistake, or we misread it.

But the user provided: ""Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)""

So N(-) means not at position 4.

But in guess 3, we have evidence that position 4 must be N.

Unless the second N is at a position we haven't guessed yet, but there are only 5 positions.

Perhaps position 1 is not K? But it's marked as ✓ in guess 3.

I think we must proceed with the information we have.

So let's assume the word has two N's: at position 2 and position 4.

Then the word is: _ N O N _ 

But position 1 is K, from guess 3's feedback: K(✓), so position 1 is K.

So the word is: K N O N _

And the fifth letter is unknown.

From guess 1, we had N at position 4 marked as '-', which would be a contradiction, but perhaps we can ignore that for now or consider that the feedback might have been reported incorrectly.

Maybe the '-' for N in guess 1 was because the word has N at position 2, and we guessed it at position 4, so it's present but wrong position. In guess 3, we have N at position 4 (if we assume it's N) and it should be correct, but in guess 3, we have W at position 4, not N. In guess 3, position 4 is W, which is marked as absent, so it's not N.

In guess 3, position 4 is W, marked as absent, so the word does not have W, and position 4 is not W. If position 4 is N, then in guess 3, we should have guessed N at position 4, but we didn't; we guessed W. So we don't have direct evidence for position 4.

But the feedback for position 5 N is '-', which requires a second N somewhere, and position 4 is the only possibility.

So despite the contradiction with guess 1, we must conclude that position 4 is N.

Therefore, the word is: K N O N ?

Now, for the fifth letter, it must be a letter not in the excluded list: excluded are C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W.

Also, it must be a letter that can form a valid English word.

Possible words: ""KNOX N"" -> ""KNOXN"" not a word.

""KNON?"" - not a word.

"" known"" is the guess, but we need the secret word.

Common words: ""KNOWN"" itself, but we guessed it and it's not fully correct.

The secret word might be ""KNOWn"" but with a different last letter.

But we have ""K N O N ?""

Possible letters for the fifth position: any letter except C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W.

Also, it must be a valid word.

Let's list possible words:
- ""KNOBS"": but B is allowed? B is not excluded, but S is excluded? S is in the excluded list from guess 2: S(x). So S is out.
- ""KNOPS"": P is allowed, but S is out.
- ""KNOLL"": L is allowed, and it's a word.
- ""KNOLL"" -> K N O L L? But we need K N O N ? so the fourth letter is N, not L.

The word is K N O N ? so the fourth letter is N, fifth letter is ?.

So ""K N O N L"" -> ""KNONL"" not a word.
""K N O N B"" -> not a word.
""K N O N D"" -> ""KNOND"" not a word.
""K N O N G"" -> ""KNONG"" not a word.
""K N O N H"" -> not a word.
""K N O N I"" -> ""KNONI"" not a word.
""K N O N K"" -> ""KNONK"" not a word.
""K N O N M"" -> ""KNONM"" not a word.
""K N O N P"" -> ""KNONP"" not a word.
""K N O N Y"" -> ""KNONY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""ANNEX"" but A is out.

Another possibility: ""MINCE"" but M is allowed, but A is out and the pattern is wrong.

Perhaps the word is ""KNIFE"" but F is allowed, but the pattern is K N O? not K N I.

We have to have O at position 3.

So the only common word I can think of is ""KNOLL"", but that is K N O L L, not K N O N L.

""  ""KNOLL"" has only one N.

What about ""CANON"" but C and A are out.

""MANOR"" M and R out.

""INION"" I and N, but not K.

We have K at position 1.

Perhaps ""KNOWN"" is the word, but then the feedback for position 5 should be correct, but it's not; it's '-', so it's not N at 5.

So the secret word is not ""KNOWN"".

Another word: ""KNOUT"" but U and T are out.

""KNOWE"" E is out.

Perhaps ""KNAUR"" R and U out.

I think there are no common words with ""KNON"" at the beginning.

Unless it's ""GNOME"" but G at 1, not K.

So maybe our deduction is wrong.

Perhaps the second N is not at position 4.

Let's consider that the word has the second N at position 1, but position 1 is K, so it can't be.

Or at position 3, but position 3 is O.

So position 5 must be the second N? But the feedback says it's not at position 5.

I think we have to make a guess that tests position 4 and 5.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3's fifth letter '-' means that there is an N in the word (which we know) but not at position 5, and it is not indicating a second N. But that doesn't make sense because the N at position 2 is already accounted for.

In standard Wordle, if a letter appears once in the word and you guess it in two positions, the correct position gets ✓ and the other gets x.

So for the feedback to show '-' for the second occurrence, there must be a second N in the word.

Given that, and the only possible position is 4, we must assume the word is ""KNO?N"" but with the fourth letter missing.

But ""KNO?N"" with the fourth letter being a letter that is not excluded.

But the fourth letter is the one we are saying is N? No, we are saying the fourth letter is the second N.

So the word is ""K N O N ?""

And the fifth letter must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Words like:
- ""KNOLL"" is not.
- ""KNOSP"" is K N O S P, but S is out.
- ""KNOX  "" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""BONUS"" but B at 1, not K.

I think ""KNOWN"" is the only common word with K N O, but it has W and N at the end.

Perhaps the secret word is ""KNOW  "" but 4 letters.

I think we need to choose a new guess that fits the pattern and tests the fourth and fifth positions.

We know:
- Position 1: K
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ? (must be N if our deduction is correct, but let's verify)
- Position 5: ? 

But we have feedback that there is a second N, so position 4 or 5 must be N, but position 5 is not N (from the '-'), so position 4 must be N.

So we have "" K N O N ? ""

For the fifth letter, it must be a letter not in: C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

Now, what 5-letter words start with ""KNON""? I can't think of any.

Perhaps ""ANCON"" but A is out.

""ENVOY"" E out.

""INBOX"" I at 1, not K.

Perhaps it's not ""KNON"" but something else.

Another idea: perhaps the second N is at position 1, but it's K, so not.

I think we have to abandon this and make a guess that includes common letters for position 4 and 5.

Let's list what we know:
- The word has at least two N's: one at position 2, and one at another position which is not 5 (from guess 3's feedback), and not 1 or 3 (because they are K and O), so must be 4.
- The word has K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, and likely N at 4.
- The fifth letter is unknown.

So for the fifth letter, we can guess a word like ""KNOWN"" but we already did, or ""KNOLL"" but that has only one N.

Perhaps the word is ""KANON"" but A is out.

Or ""KENDO"" but E is out.

I think the only possibility is that the fifth letter is 'H' for ""KNOSH"" but S is out, and ""KNOSH"" is not K N O N H.

""KNISH"" has I and S.

Perhaps ""KNURL"" has U and R.

I think there is no such word.

Therefore, our deduction must be wrong.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3's N at position 5 is '-' because the word has an N at position 4, and we didn't guess it, but the N at position 5 is not in the word, but the system is not marking it as absent because of a bug? But we have to assume it's correct.

Perhaps the secret word is ""KNOLL"", and in guess 3 ""KNOWN"", the feedback should have been:
- K(✓) for position 1
- N(✓) for position 2
- O(✓) for position 3
- W(x) for position 4
- N(x) for position 5 (because only one N)

But the feedback given is N(-) for position 5, which is different.

So unless the word has two L's in ""KNOLL"", but that doesn't help.

Another possibility: the secret word is ""KNOLL"", and we guessed ""KNOWN"", then the N at position 5 should be 'x', not '-'.

So the only way for the feedback to be '-' for position 5 is if there is a second N in the word.

Therefore, the word must have two N's.

And the only position for the second N is 4.

So despite the contradiction with guess 1, we must assume the word is ""K N O N ?"".

For the fifth letter, let's try to find words that have ""KNON"" and then a letter.

Perhaps it's "" canon"" but C and A out.

Or ""demon"" not.

I recall that ""KNOW  "" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps "" signa"" not.

I think we have to guess a word that has K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, and then two new letters for 4 and 5, including one of them being N.

For example, ""KNOLL"" has L and L, but only one N.

""KNOLL"" has N at position 2, but not at 4.

So not.

""ANNEX"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""UNION"" but U and not K.

I think we should guess a word that tests the fourth position with N and the fifth position with a common letter.

For example, ""KNOLL"" would be good, but it doesn't have N at 4.

Or ""KNELT"" has E and L, but E is out.

""KNEAD"" E and A out.

""KAPPA"" not.

Perhaps "" until we have to make a guess.

Let's make a guess that has K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, and then for position 4 and 5, use common letters not excluded.

For example, ""KNOLL"" : K, N, O, L, L.

This tests L for positions 4 and 5.

If the word is ""KNOLL"", then we get it.

If not, we get feedback on L.

But we think there is a second N, so ""KNOLL"" might not have it.

But let's see the feedback for guess 1: if the word is ""KNOLL"", then in guess 1 ""crane"", the N at position 4 should be '-' because the word has N at position 2, not at 4. And in guess 3 ""KNOWN"", the N at position 5 should be 'x' because there's only one N. But in the feedback, it was '-', so it can't be ""KNOLL"".

Similarly, ""KNOLL"" has only one N.

So we need a word with two N's and K at 1, O at 3.

Words like ""KNOWN"" has two N's, but we already guessed it.

""ANKle"" not.

""CON  "" not.

""INKLE"" not K.

""OINKY"" not.

""PINKO"" not.

""SONLY"" S out.

""TONKA"" T out.

""WINKY"" W out.

I think the only common word is ""KNOWN"", but it's not the secret word because the feedback for position 5 was not correct.

Perhaps ""NINON"" is a word (a fabric), but it has N at 1, not K.

""MINOR"" not.

I think we have to try ""KNOLL"" to test.

Or perhaps ""KNELL"" but E is out.

""KNELL"" has E, which is excluded.

Another word: ""KNURL"" has U and R, excluded.

""KNISH"" has I and S, S excluded.

Perhaps ""KYLIX"" not.

I think we should guess ""knoll"" and see.

So for the fourth guess, let's guess ""knoll"".

But let's see the format.

Perhaps the secret word is ""DOING"" but not.

I recall that ""KNOX "" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""KNOPS"" but S out.

I think we have to make a guess.

Let's guess ""knoll"" to test the fourth and fifth positions.

So <guess>knoll</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

But let's see if it fits the constraints.

""knoll"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, L at 4, L at 5.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W. L is not excluded.

So it's allowed.

If the word is ""KNOLL"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on L.

But we think the word has N at position 4, so if we guess ""knoll"", then position 4 L will be absent if it's N, and position 5 L will be absent or present.

But it's worth a try.

So I'll go with ""knoll"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`  
  Meaning:  
  - ❌ `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ `N` is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""snout""**  
  Feedback: `S(x) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)`  
  Meaning:  
  - ❌ `S`, `U`, `T` are **not** in the word.  
  - ✓ `N` is **correct and in position 2**.  
  - ✓ `O` is **correct and in position 3**.  

- **Guess 3: ""known""**  
  Feedback: `K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)`  
  Meaning",knoll,"We have the feedback from the third guess: ""known"" -> K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)

Breaking down the feedback:
- K(✓): K is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N(✓): N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). We already knew this from guess 2.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). We already knew this from guess 2.
- W(x): W is not in the word at all.
- N(-): The N at position 5 is in the word but not in that position. Since we already know there is an N at position 2, this means there is another N in the word? But wait, the feedback for the fifth letter is marked as '-', meaning it is present but in the wrong position. However, we already have an N at position 2. This suggests that the word has at least two N's? But the fifth position is wrong for N, so the second N must be in one of the remaining positions (4 or 5, but 5 is wrong, so it must be in position 4? Or in position 1? But position 1 is K, which is correct, so not N. Position 2 is N, position 3 is O, so the only other positions are 4 and 5. But position 5 is marked as N present but wrong position? That would imply that the word has an N at position 4? But we have a W at position 4 in this guess, which is marked as absent (W(x)), so position 4 is not W and not N? 

Wait, let's clarify: the feedback for the fifth letter is N(-). This means:
- The letter N is present in the word, but not at position 5.
- Since we already have an N at position 2 (which is correct), this implies there is at least one more N in the word? Or could it be that the N at position 2 is the only N, and the feedback for the fifth letter is indicating that the N is present (which we know) but not at position 5? But that would be redundant because we already know the N is at position 2. 

However, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. The rules are:
- If a letter is in the correct position, it gets a ✓.
- For letters that are in the word but in the wrong position, they get a '-'.
- If a letter is not in the word, it gets an 'x'.

But if a letter appears more than once, the feedback only accounts for the occurrences that are either correct or present. For example, if the word has one N and you guess two N's, one of them might be marked as present and the other as absent if the word only has one. But in this case, we have:

In ""known"": 
- Position 2: N is correct (✓) — this accounts for one N.
- Position 5: N is marked as present but wrong position (-). This would typically mean that there is a second N in the word? Because if there were only one N, and it's already been used in position 2 (correct), then the N at position 5 would be marked as absent (x). But here it's marked as present (-), so that suggests there is a second N in the word, and it's not at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has at least two N's: one at position 2 and one elsewhere (but not at position 5). The only positions left are 1, 3, 4. But position 1 is K (which is correct, so not N) and position 3 is O (correct, not N). So the only possibility is that the second N is at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word must have N at position 4? But wait, in our guess, position 4 was W, which is marked as absent. So if position 4 is N, then in the guess ""known"", the fourth letter is W, which is wrong, but the fifth letter is N, which is present but in the wrong position. However, if the word has N at position 4, then the N at position 5 in the guess should be marked as absent because the word only has two N's (one at 2 and one at 4) and we've already ""used"" the two N's? 

But the feedback for position 5 is N(-), meaning it is present but in the wrong position. If the word has an N at position 4, then the N at position 5 in the guess is not matching, but it is present elsewhere? But we have two N's in the guess: one at position 2 (correct) and one at position 5. The word has two N's: at position 2 and 4. Then the feedback should be:
- Position 2: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not at 5, but there is another N at 4? But the feedback for position 5 would be that N is present but in the wrong position? However, the word has two N's, and we have two N's in the guess. The one at position 2 is accounted for, and the one at position 5: since the word has an N at 4 (which is not position 5), it should be marked as present but wrong position. So that matches.

But what about position 4? We have W at position 4, and the word has N at position 4? Then W is not in the word? So W(x) is correct.

So the secret word must be: K N O N _ 

Because:
- Position 1: K (from the ✓ in guess 3)
- Position 2: N (confirmed)
- Position 3: O (confirmed)
- Position 4: must be N? Because we have evidence of a second N and the only position left is 4? But we have position 5 left as well.

The word has two N's: one at 2 and one at 4? Then what about position 5? It could be any letter except the excluded ones.

But the feedback for the fifth letter N in ""known"" is marked as present but wrong position. If the word has N at position 4, then the N at position 5 is indeed in the wrong position (it should be at 4). So that fits.

But what if the word has three N's? Then the N at position 5 could be present but in the wrong position? But that would require the word to have an N at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? So if the word had an N at position 5, then the guess at position 5 would be correct? But it's marked as wrong position, so the word does not have an N at position 5. Therefore, the second N must be at position 4.

So the secret word is: K N O N ?

Now, we need to find the fifth letter. The fifth letter cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, S, U, T, W (because W is now excluded from the feedback of guess 3: W(x)).

Also, from guess 1, we know that N is at position 4? No, in guess 1 ""crane"", we had N at position 4 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. Now we know that the N is at position 2 and 4? So in guess 1, the N was at position 4 in the guess, but the word has N at position 2 and 4? Then the feedback for guess 1 should have shown two '-' for N? But in guess 1, we had only one N, at position 4, and it was marked as '-', which is consistent because the word has an N at position 2 (which we didn't guess) and at position 4? But we only guessed one N, so it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in guess 1, we didn't guess the N at position 2, so the feedback for the N at position 4 would be '-' because there is an N in the word (at position 2) but not at 4? But now we know the word has an N at position 4? That would be a contradiction.

Let me reexamine:

In guess 1: ""crane"" -> N at position 4 was marked as '-', meaning the letter N is in the word but not at position 4.

But if the word has an N at position 4, then the feedback for the N at position 4 in ""crane"" should have been a ✓? But it was marked as '-', which means that the word does not have an N at position 4. Therefore, the word cannot have an N at position 4.

This is a contradiction with our previous deduction.

So what's going on?

We must reconsider the feedback from guess 3.

In guess 3: ""known"" -> K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)

We have two N's in the guess: one at position 2 (correct) and one at position 5 (marked as present but wrong position).

The word has at least two N's? Or does it have only one N?

If the word has only one N (at position 2), then the N at position 5 in the guess should be marked as absent (x) because there is no other N. But it is marked as present (-), which implies that there is another N in the word.

But then, where is the second N? It cannot be at position 1, 3, or 5 because:
- Position 1 is K (correct, so not N)
- Position 3 is O (correct, so not N)
- Position 5 is marked as not N (because the feedback says it's present but not at 5, so it must be elsewhere).

The only position left is position 4. But if the word has an N at position 4, then in guess 1 (""crane""), the N at position 4 should have been marked as correct (✓) or at least present? But in guess 1, the N at position 4 was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). This would be inconsistent because if the word has an N at position 4, then when we guess N at position 4, it should be correct.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the word does not have an N at position 4. So where is the second N?

Perhaps the word has an N at position 1? But position 1 is K, which is correct, so it can't be N. Similarly, position 3 is O, correct.

So the only possibility is that the word has an N at position 5? But the feedback for position 5 in guess 3 is N(-), which means it is present but not at position 5. That would be a contradiction.

This is confusing. Let me think differently.

Alternative interpretation: the feedback for the second N in ""known"" (position 5) is marked as '-' because the word has only one N, but the feedback system is telling us that the N is present (which we know) but not at position 5? But that doesn't make sense because we already have a ✓ for the N at position 2. In Wordle, if a letter appears only once in the word, and you guess it in two positions, one correct and one incorrect, the incorrect one is marked as absent (x). 

For example, if the word is ""KNOLL"" (but we don't have that), and you guess ""KNOWN"", then:
- Position 2: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not in the word (because the word has only one N, at position 2), so it should be marked as x.

But in our feedback, it's marked as '-', which means present but wrong position. Therefore, the word must have a second N.

But then, where is it? The only positions are 1,3,4,5. But 1 and 3 are taken by K and O, which are correct, so they can't be N. Position 5 is marked as not N (because the '-' says it's present but not at 5). So position 4 must be N? But then we have a conflict with guess 1.

Unless the word has three N's? Then position 4 could be N and position 5 could be something else. But then in guess 1, when we had N at position 4, it should have been marked as correct if the word has N at position 4? But it was marked as '-', meaning not at position 4.

So the only way to resolve this is to realize that in guess 1, the N was marked as '-' because the word has an N, but not at position 4. And in guess 3, the N at position 5 is marked as '-' because there is another N in the word (besides the one at position 2) that is not at position 5. But the only position left is position 1 or 3, but they are fixed as K and O. So this is impossible.

Therefore, we must consider that the feedback for guess 3 might be indicating that the second N is in the word but not at position 5, and it must be at position 4, and then the feedback for guess 1 must be reexamined.

But in guess 1, we have ""crane"" with N at position 4. If the word has an N at position 4, then the feedback should have been a ✓ for that position. But it was not; it was '-'. So the word does not have an N at position 4.

This is a paradox.

Another possibility: the feedback for guess 3 might be misinterpreted. Let's read it again: ""K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)""

The fifth letter is N, and it is marked as '-', which means the letter N is in the word but not at position 5. But we already have an N at position 2. So there must be a second N in the word. But where? The only positions are 1,3,4,5. 1 and 3 are fixed as K and O, so they can't be N. 5 is not N (because of the '-'), so it must be at 4. But then why in guess 1 was the N at position 4 marked as '-' and not '✓'?

Unless the word does not have an N at position 4, but has an N at position 1 or 3? But they are fixed.

Perhaps the secret word has the letter N at position 2 and also at position 1 or 3, but we know position 1 is K and position 3 is O, so it can't be.

Unless the feedback for position 1 in guess 3 is wrong? But it's marked as ✓ for K, so position 1 is K.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback or in our reasoning.

Let me list what we know for sure:
- The word has at least one N, at position 2.
- The word has an O at position 3.
- The word does not have: C, R, A, E, S, U, T, W.
- From guess 3, the fifth letter N is present but not at position 5, so there is a second N in the word.
- The second N must be at position 1, 3, or 4. But position 1 is K (not N), position 3 is O (not N), so position 4 must be N.
- But then in guess 1, when we guessed N at position 4, it should have been marked as correct (✓) if the word has N at position 4. But it was marked as present but wrong position ('-'), which means the word does not have N at position 4.

This is the contradiction.

The only way out is if the word has three N's: at position 2, 4, and say 5? But then in guess 1, the N at position 4 should be correct, but it was marked as '-', so not correct. And in guess 3, the N at position 5 should be correct if the word has N at 5, but it's marked as '-', so not at 5. So positions 4 and 5 are not N, but we have a second N somewhere else? But there is no other position.

Unless the secret word has letters that are not in the first five? No, it's 5 letters.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 1's N being '-' is because the N is at position 2, but we didn't guess it at position 2 in guess 1. In guess 1, we guessed N at position 4, and the word has N at position 2, so it's present but not at 4, hence '-', which is correct. In guess 3, we have N at position 2 (correct) and N at position 5. The word has only one N? Then the N at position 5 should be 'x'. But it's '-', so there must be a second N.

But where? The only possibility is position 4 or 5. Position 5 is marked as not N (because '-'), so position 4 must be N. But then in guess 1, when we guessed N at position 4, it should be correct if the word has N at position 4. But it was not; it was '-', which means not at position 4.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word has an N at position 1 or 3, but we know position 1 is K and position 3 is O.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3 is: N at position 2 is ✓, and N at position 5 is '-', but the word has only one N, so the second N should be 'x'. But it's not, it's '-', so it must be that the word has a second N.

But then, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 1's N being '-' is because the word has N at position 2, not at 4, and in guess 3, the '-' for position 5 means there is a second N at position 4. But then the word has N at position 4, so guess 1's N at position 4 should have been correct.

This suggests that the feedback for guess 1 might have been misinterpreted.

Let's double-check the feedback for guess 1: ""crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)""

It says N(-), which means the N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

But if the word has N at position 4, then this feedback would be incorrect.

Therefore, the word cannot have N at position 4.

So we are back to square one.

Perhaps the secret word has the letter N at position 5? But in guess 3, the N at position 5 is marked as '-', which means it is in the word but not at position 5. So it can't be at position 5.

I think there's a possibility that the feedback for guess 3 is indicating that the N at position 5 is the same N as at position 2, and because the word has only one N, it should be marked as absent for the second occurrence. But the feedback says '-', which is not absent.

Unless the rules are different for duplicate letters, but in standard Wordle, if you guess a letter more times than it appears, the extras are marked as absent.

For example, if the word is ""KNOLL"", and you guess ""KNOWN"", then:
- K at 1: absent (x) if the word starts with K? But in our case, K is at 1 and correct.
Assume the word is ""KNOLL"":
- ""KNOWN"": K at 1: correct (✓)
- N at 2: correct (✓)
- O at 3: correct (✓)
- W at 4: absent (x) because the word has 'L' at 4
- N at 5: absent (x) because the word has 'L' at 5 and only one N.

But in our feedback, it's N(-) for position 5, which is not x.

So the word must have at least two N's.

Given that, and the only possible position for the second N is position 4, we must conclude that the feedback for guess 1 was in error or that the word does have N at position 4, and the feedback for guess 1 was '-' because perhaps the word has two N's, and the N at position 4 in guess 1 was not the only N, but it was in the correct position? No, if it's in the correct position, it should be '✓'.

I think there's a mistake in the initial setup or in our understanding.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 1's N is '-' because the word has an N, but not at position 4, and in guess 3, the '-' for position 5 means there is an N at position 4. This implies that between guess 1 and guess 3, the word changed? But that's not possible.

I think we have to accept that the word has N at position 4, and the feedback for guess 1 was a mistake, or we misread it.

But the user provided: ""Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)""

So N(-) means not at position 4.

But in guess 3, we have evidence that position 4 must be N.

Unless the second N is at a position we haven't guessed yet, but there are only 5 positions.

Perhaps position 1 is not K? But it's marked as ✓ in guess 3.

I think we must proceed with the information we have.

So let's assume the word has two N's: at position 2 and position 4.

Then the word is: _ N O N _ 

But position 1 is K, from guess 3's feedback: K(✓), so position 1 is K.

So the word is: K N O N _

And the fifth letter is unknown.

From guess 1, we had N at position 4 marked as '-', which would be a contradiction, but perhaps we can ignore that for now or consider that the feedback might have been reported incorrectly.

Maybe the '-' for N in guess 1 was because the word has N at position 2, and we guessed it at position 4, so it's present but wrong position. In guess 3, we have N at position 4 (if we assume it's N) and it should be correct, but in guess 3, we have W at position 4, not N. In guess 3, position 4 is W, which is marked as absent, so it's not N.

In guess 3, position 4 is W, marked as absent, so the word does not have W, and position 4 is not W. If position 4 is N, then in guess 3, we should have guessed N at position 4, but we didn't; we guessed W. So we don't have direct evidence for position 4.

But the feedback for position 5 N is '-', which requires a second N somewhere, and position 4 is the only possibility.

So despite the contradiction with guess 1, we must conclude that position 4 is N.

Therefore, the word is: K N O N ?

Now, for the fifth letter, it must be a letter not in the excluded list: excluded are C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W.

Also, it must be a letter that can form a valid English word.

Possible words: ""KNOX N"" -> ""KNOXN"" not a word.

""KNON?"" - not a word.

"" known"" is the guess, but we need the secret word.

Common words: ""KNOWN"" itself, but we guessed it and it's not fully correct.

The secret word might be ""KNOWn"" but with a different last letter.

But we have ""K N O N ?""

Possible letters for the fifth position: any letter except C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W.

Also, it must be a valid word.

Let's list possible words:
- ""KNOBS"": but B is allowed? B is not excluded, but S is excluded? S is in the excluded list from guess 2: S(x). So S is out.
- ""KNOPS"": P is allowed, but S is out.
- ""KNOLL"": L is allowed, and it's a word.
- ""KNOLL"" -> K N O L L? But we need K N O N ? so the fourth letter is N, not L.

The word is K N O N ? so the fourth letter is N, fifth letter is ?.

So ""K N O N L"" -> ""KNONL"" not a word.
""K N O N B"" -> not a word.
""K N O N D"" -> ""KNOND"" not a word.
""K N O N G"" -> ""KNONG"" not a word.
""K N O N H"" -> not a word.
""K N O N I"" -> ""KNONI"" not a word.
""K N O N K"" -> ""KNONK"" not a word.
""K N O N M"" -> ""KNONM"" not a word.
""K N O N P"" -> ""KNONP"" not a word.
""K N O N Y"" -> ""KNONY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""ANNEX"" but A is out.

Another possibility: ""MINCE"" but M is allowed, but A is out and the pattern is wrong.

Perhaps the word is ""KNIFE"" but F is allowed, but the pattern is K N O? not K N I.

We have to have O at position 3.

So the only common word I can think of is ""KNOLL"", but that is K N O L L, not K N O N L.

""  ""KNOLL"" has only one N.

What about ""CANON"" but C and A are out.

""MANOR"" M and R out.

""INION"" I and N, but not K.

We have K at position 1.

Perhaps ""KNOWN"" is the word, but then the feedback for position 5 should be correct, but it's not; it's '-', so it's not N at 5.

So the secret word is not ""KNOWN"".

Another word: ""KNOUT"" but U and T are out.

""KNOWE"" E is out.

Perhaps ""KNAUR"" R and U out.

I think there are no common words with ""KNON"" at the beginning.

Unless it's ""GNOME"" but G at 1, not K.

So maybe our deduction is wrong.

Perhaps the second N is not at position 4.

Let's consider that the word has the second N at position 1, but position 1 is K, so it can't be.

Or at position 3, but position 3 is O.

So position 5 must be the second N? But the feedback says it's not at position 5.

I think we have to make a guess that tests position 4 and 5.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3's fifth letter '-' means that there is an N in the word (which we know) but not at position 5, and it is not indicating a second N. But that doesn't make sense because the N at position 2 is already accounted for.

In standard Wordle, if a letter appears once in the word and you guess it in two positions, the correct position gets ✓ and the other gets x.

So for the feedback to show '-' for the second occurrence, there must be a second N in the word.

Given that, and the only possible position is 4, we must assume the word is ""KNO?N"" but with the fourth letter missing.

But ""KNO?N"" with the fourth letter being a letter that is not excluded.

But the fourth letter is the one we are saying is N? No, we are saying the fourth letter is the second N.

So the word is ""K N O N ?""

And the fifth letter must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Words like:
- ""KNOLL"" is not.
- ""KNOSP"" is K N O S P, but S is out.
- ""KNOX  "" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""BONUS"" but B at 1, not K.

I think ""KNOWN"" is the only common word with K N O, but it has W and N at the end.

Perhaps the secret word is ""KNOW  "" but 4 letters.

I think we need to choose a new guess that fits the pattern and tests the fourth and fifth positions.

We know:
- Position 1: K
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ? (must be N if our deduction is correct, but let's verify)
- Position 5: ? 

But we have feedback that there is a second N, so position 4 or 5 must be N, but position 5 is not N (from the '-'), so position 4 must be N.

So we have "" K N O N ? ""

For the fifth letter, it must be a letter not in: C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

Now, what 5-letter words start with ""KNON""? I can't think of any.

Perhaps ""ANCON"" but A is out.

""ENVOY"" E out.

""INBOX"" I at 1, not K.

Perhaps it's not ""KNON"" but something else.

Another idea: perhaps the second N is at position 1, but it's K, so not.

I think we have to abandon this and make a guess that includes common letters for position 4 and 5.

Let's list what we know:
- The word has at least two N's: one at position 2, and one at another position which is not 5 (from guess 3's feedback), and not 1 or 3 (because they are K and O), so must be 4.
- The word has K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, and likely N at 4.
- The fifth letter is unknown.

So for the fifth letter, we can guess a word like ""KNOWN"" but we already did, or ""KNOLL"" but that has only one N.

Perhaps the word is ""KANON"" but A is out.

Or ""KENDO"" but E is out.

I think the only possibility is that the fifth letter is 'H' for ""KNOSH"" but S is out, and ""KNOSH"" is not K N O N H.

""KNISH"" has I and S.

Perhaps ""KNURL"" has U and R.

I think there is no such word.

Therefore, our deduction must be wrong.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3's N at position 5 is '-' because the word has an N at position 4, and we didn't guess it, but the N at position 5 is not in the word, but the system is not marking it as absent because of a bug? But we have to assume it's correct.

Perhaps the secret word is ""KNOLL"", and in guess 3 ""KNOWN"", the feedback should have been:
- K(✓) for position 1
- N(✓) for position 2
- O(✓) for position 3
- W(x) for position 4
- N(x) for position 5 (because only one N)

But the feedback given is N(-) for position 5, which is different.

So unless the word has two L's in ""KNOLL"", but that doesn't help.

Another possibility: the secret word is ""KNOLL"", and we guessed ""KNOWN"", then the N at position 5 should be 'x', not '-'.

So the only way for the feedback to be '-' for position 5 is if there is a second N in the word.

Therefore, the word must have two N's.

And the only position for the second N is 4.

So despite the contradiction with guess 1, we must assume the word is ""K N O N ?"".

For the fifth letter, let's try to find words that have ""KNON"" and then a letter.

Perhaps it's "" canon"" but C and A out.

Or ""demon"" not.

I recall that ""KNOW  "" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps "" signa"" not.

I think we have to guess a word that has K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, and then two new letters for 4 and 5, including one of them being N.

For example, ""KNOLL"" has L and L, but only one N.

""KNOLL"" has N at position 2, but not at 4.

So not.

""ANNEX"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""UNION"" but U and not K.

I think we should guess a word that tests the fourth position with N and the fifth position with a common letter.

For example, ""KNOLL"" would be good, but it doesn't have N at 4.

Or ""KNELT"" has E and L, but E is out.

""KNEAD"" E and A out.

""KAPPA"" not.

Perhaps "" until we have to make a guess.

Let's make a guess that has K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, and then for position 4 and 5, use common letters not excluded.

For example, ""KNOLL"" : K, N, O, L, L.

This tests L for positions 4 and 5.

If the word is ""KNOLL"", then we get it.

If not, we get feedback on L.

But we think there is a second N, so ""KNOLL"" might not have it.

But let's see the feedback for guess 1: if the word is ""KNOLL"", then in guess 1 ""crane"", the N at position 4 should be '-' because the word has N at position 2, not at 4. And in guess 3 ""KNOWN"", the N at position 5 should be 'x' because there's only one N. But in the feedback, it was '-', so it can't be ""KNOLL"".

Similarly, ""KNOLL"" has only one N.

So we need a word with two N's and K at 1, O at 3.

Words like ""KNOWN"" has two N's, but we already guessed it.

""ANKle"" not.

""CON  "" not.

""INKLE"" not K.

""OINKY"" not.

""PINKO"" not.

""SONLY"" S out.

""TONKA"" T out.

""WINKY"" W out.

I think the only common word is ""KNOWN"", but it's not the secret word because the feedback for position 5 was not correct.

Perhaps ""NINON"" is a word (a fabric), but it has N at 1, not K.

""MINOR"" not.

I think we have to try ""KNOLL"" to test.

Or perhaps ""KNELL"" but E is out.

""KNELL"" has E, which is excluded.

Another word: ""KNURL"" has U and R, excluded.

""KNISH"" has I and S, S excluded.

Perhaps ""KYLIX"" not.

I think we should guess ""knoll"" and see.

So for the fourth guess, let's guess ""knoll"".

But let's see the format.

Perhaps the secret word is ""DOING"" but not.

I recall that ""KNOX "" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""KNOPS"" but S out.

I think we have to make a guess.

Let's guess ""knoll"" to test the fourth and fifth positions.

So <guess>knoll</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

But let's see if it fits the constraints.

""knoll"": K at 1, N at 2, O at 3, L at 4, L at 5.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,S,U,T,W. L is not excluded.

So it's allowed.

If the word is ""KNOLL"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on L.

But we think the word has N at position 4, so if we guess ""knoll"", then position 4 L will be absent if it's N, and position 5 L will be absent or present.

But it's worth a try.

So I'll go with ""knoll"".",Guess 4: knoll -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
