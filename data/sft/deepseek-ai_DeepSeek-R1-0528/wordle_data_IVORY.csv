Alright, let's tackle this Wordle-like game. I'm supposed to guess a 5-letter English word in 6 tries, using feedback after each guess. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I need a starting word that'll give me useful clues.

My goal is to cover as many common letters and positions as possible efficiently. Typically, vowels are important, and consonants like S, T, R, N are frequent in English. So, I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters. The classic ""CRANE"" comes to mind—it's got C, R, A, N, E. 'A' and 'E' are vowels, 'R' and 'N' are common consonants, and 'C' is somewhat frequent too. That should provide a good spread of vowels and consonants.

Thinking further... ""STARE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common starter words, but ""CRANE"" feels solid. It avoids rare letters and balances vowels (A,E) with consonants. Plus, it positions vowels where they often appear—like A in position 2 or E at the end might be patterns.

I could overthink this, but ""CRANE"" has served many players well. Let's stick with that.
</think>
For my first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the feedback information. Letters like vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (R, N, C) are statistically more likely to appear. ""CRANE"" fits this well—it uses three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), covering diverse positions.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - Only the letter 'R' is present in the secret word but in the wrong position. 
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is the second letter and it's marked as wrong position).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can use this information to form our next guess.

 Constraints for next guess:
 - Must include the letter 'R' (but not in the second position).
 - Must not include the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Includes 'R' (in a position that is not the second one, so we can try it in first, third, fourth, or fifth).
 - Includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Since we know that the word has an 'R' and we don't know its position, we might try to put 'R' in a different position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have A, E, so it might have other vowels? But vowels are important. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We should try to include one or two of these.

 Let's consider the word: ""ROTIS"" or ""ROUST"" but note that we cannot use E or A, so we have to avoid them.

 However, we must also avoid the letters that were absent: C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - We can try words with R in the first position? But note that in the feedback, R was in the second position and was wrong. That doesn't prevent R from being in the first position? Actually, it might be. Let me think: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 But we don't know. So we can try to put R in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried, and also test other common letters.

 Let me list some words that meet the criteria (no C, A, N, E and include R):

 - ""PRIOR"" -> but has two R's? and we don't know if there are two R's. Also, we might want to test more new letters.
 - ""ROOMY"" -> but we don't know if Y is allowed? Actually, Y is a letter and can be used. But let's avoid for now because it's less common.
 - ""ROILS"" -> R at the beginning, then O, I, L, S. This uses common letters and tests O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Actually, we can put R anywhere except the second? But wait, the feedback only said that the R in the second position is wrong. It might be that the word has R in the second position? No, because the feedback says it is in the word but in the wrong position. So if it were in the second position and correct, it would have been marked as correct. Therefore, the R is not in the second position. So we must avoid putting R in the second position in our next guess? Actually, we can put it again in the second position? But that would be redundant and we already know it's not there. So we should try R in a different position.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should put R in a position that is not the second.

 Let me try to form a word with R in the first position? Then we can test if R is in the first position.

 Alternatively, we can put R in the third, fourth, or fifth.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize information. So we should test R in a new position and also test other common letters.

 How about: ""SPRIT"" -> but note that we have to avoid A, E, and also we haven't used S, P, R, I, T. However, ""SPRIT"" is not a common word? Actually, it might not be valid. Let me think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S. This word has R in the second position? But we know that R is not in the second position in the secret word. So we should avoid putting R in the second position because we already know it's not there. Therefore, we should not put R in the second position again.

 So let's avoid the second position for R.

 How about putting R in the first position? Then we can test if R is the first letter.

 Word: ""ROUST"" -> R, O, U, S, T. This uses O, U, S, T which are common. And R is in the first position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O, U, S, T. This would test those.

 Another word: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This has R in the first position.

 However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (meaning to move turbulently).

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTY"" but that has Y and we might avoid Y for now.

 Another common word: ""ROBOT"" -> but we cannot use B? Actually, we can, but we haven't tested B. However, we are avoiding A, E, and also we have to avoid C, N. But note: we don't know if B is in the word? We are free to use any letter except C, A, N, E.

 But ""ROBOT"" has two O's? and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, it has B and T.

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. So using a word with more common letters is better.

 Let me think of words that have R and also include other common consonants and vowels (I, O, U) and avoid the second position for R.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), S (position 4), T (position 5)

 But note: we are putting R in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R is not in the first either, so it must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can put R in the third position? For example: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P. But then we are putting R in the third position. And we avoid the second position? Actually, in ""STRIP"", R is in the third position. Also, we test S, T, I, P.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. So ""STRIP"" is acceptable.

 However, we also want to test vowels. The secret word might have I or O? We haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are absent). So we should test a vowel? 

 Since we have two vowels left that are common: I and O (and U). 

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R (position 1), O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""STRIP"" -> tests S, T, R (position 3), I, P.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" tests two vowels (O and U) and ""STRIP"" tests one vowel (I). 

 Since we have only one R and we know the word has one R (we don't know if it has more, but the feedback only showed one R in the first guess and it was present, but it could have more? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So if the word has two R's, we might not know. But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So at least one R is there.

 Given that, I think testing two vowels (O and U) in one go might be efficient. So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has I? Then we wouldn't test I. Alternatively, we can test a word that has both I and O? 

 How about: ""ROBIN"" -> but we cannot use N (because it was absent in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 How about: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This tests R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5). This tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants (L, S). And we avoid the second position for R? Actually, we are putting R in the first position, which is new.

 So ""ROILS"" might be better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S) and R in a new position.

 Let me decide: 
 - ""ROUST"": tests O, U, S, T and R in first.
 - ""ROILS"": tests O, I, L, S and R in first.

 Both are good. I'll choose ""ROILS"" because it tests I and O, and L and S are also common.

 So my next guess: ""ROILS""

 But note: we are putting O in the second position. We don't have any information about the second position yet. It could be correct? Or not. We'll see.

 Let me write the guess: ROILS

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not in the second position. Now we are putting R in the first position. If the secret word has R in the first, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus and we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing O, I, L, S.

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Therefore, I choose ""roils"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but **not in position 2**.

For the next guess:
- Must include R (in a position other than 2) and avoid C, A, N, E.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like S, L, O, I) and position R in a new slot (position 1).
- ""ROILS"" fits: R in position 1 (tests new R placement), O and I (untested vowels), L and S (common consonants).

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Therefore, I choose ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but **not in position 2**.

For the next guess:
- Must include R (in a position other than 2) and avoid C, A, N, E.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like S, L, O, I) and position R in a new slot (position 1).
- ""ROILS"" fits: R in position 1 (tests new R placement), O and I (untested vowels), L and S (common consonants).",Guess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(-) L(x) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's tackle this Wordle-like game. I'm supposed to guess a 5-letter English word in 6 tries, using feedback after each guess. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I need a starting word that'll give me useful clues.

My goal is to cover as many common letters and positions as possible efficiently. Typically, vowels are important, and consonants like S, T, R, N are frequent in English. So, I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters. The classic ""CRANE"" comes to mind—it's got C, R, A, N, E. 'A' and 'E' are vowels, 'R' and 'N' are common consonants, and 'C' is somewhat frequent too. That should provide a good spread of vowels and consonants.

Thinking further... ""STARE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common starter words, but ""CRANE"" feels solid. It avoids rare letters and balances vowels (A,E) with consonants. Plus, it positions vowels where they often appear—like A in position 2 or E at the end might be patterns.

I could overthink this, but ""CRANE"" has served many players well. Let's stick with that.For my first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the feedback information. Letters like vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (R, N, C) are statistically more likely to appear. ""CRANE"" fits this well—it uses three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), covering diverse positions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - Only the letter 'R' is present in the secret word but in the wrong position. 
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is the second letter and it's marked as wrong position).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can use this information to form our next guess.

 Constraints for next guess:
 - Must include the letter 'R' (but not in the second position).
 - Must not include the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Includes 'R' (in a position that is not the second one, so we can try it in first, third, fourth, or fifth).
 - Includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Since we know that the word has an 'R' and we don't know its position, we might try to put 'R' in a different position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have A, E, so it might have other vowels? But vowels are important. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We should try to include one or two of these.

 Let's consider the word: ""ROTIS"" or ""ROUST"" but note that we cannot use E or A, so we have to avoid them.

 However, we must also avoid the letters that were absent: C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - We can try words with R in the first position? But note that in the feedback, R was in the second position and was wrong. That doesn't prevent R from being in the first position? Actually, it might be. Let me think: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 But we don't know. So we can try to put R in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried, and also test other common letters.

 Let me list some words that meet the criteria (no C, A, N, E and include R):

 - ""PRIOR"" -> but has two R's? and we don't know if there are two R's. Also, we might want to test more new letters.
 - ""ROOMY"" -> but we don't know if Y is allowed? Actually, Y is a letter and can be used. But let's avoid for now because it's less common.
 - ""ROILS"" -> R at the beginning, then O, I, L, S. This uses common letters and tests O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Actually, we can put R anywhere except the second? But wait, the feedback only said that the R in the second position is wrong. It might be that the word has R in the second position? No, because the feedback says it is in the word but in the wrong position. So if it were in the second position and correct, it would have been marked as correct. Therefore, the R is not in the second position. So we must avoid putting R in the second position in our next guess? Actually, we can put it again in the second position? But that would be redundant and we already know it's not there. So we should try R in a different position.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should put R in a position that is not the second.

 Let me try to form a word with R in the first position? Then we can test if R is in the first position.

 Alternatively, we can put R in the third, fourth, or fifth.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize information. So we should test R in a new position and also test other common letters.

 How about: ""SPRIT"" -> but note that we have to avoid A, E, and also we haven't used S, P, R, I, T. However, ""SPRIT"" is not a common word? Actually, it might not be valid. Let me think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S. This word has R in the second position? But we know that R is not in the second position in the secret word. So we should avoid putting R in the second position because we already know it's not there. Therefore, we should not put R in the second position again.

 So let's avoid the second position for R.

 How about putting R in the first position? Then we can test if R is the first letter.

 Word: ""ROUST"" -> R, O, U, S, T. This uses O, U, S, T which are common. And R is in the first position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O, U, S, T. This would test those.

 Another word: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This has R in the first position.

 However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (meaning to move turbulently).

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTY"" but that has Y and we might avoid Y for now.

 Another common word: ""ROBOT"" -> but we cannot use B? Actually, we can, but we haven't tested B. However, we are avoiding A, E, and also we have to avoid C, N. But note: we don't know if B is in the word? We are free to use any letter except C, A, N, E.

 But ""ROBOT"" has two O's? and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, it has B and T.

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. So using a word with more common letters is better.

 Let me think of words that have R and also include other common consonants and vowels (I, O, U) and avoid the second position for R.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), S (position 4), T (position 5)

 But note: we are putting R in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R is not in the first either, so it must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can put R in the third position? For example: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P. But then we are putting R in the third position. And we avoid the second position? Actually, in ""STRIP"", R is in the third position. Also, we test S, T, I, P.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. So ""STRIP"" is acceptable.

 However, we also want to test vowels. The secret word might have I or O? We haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are absent). So we should test a vowel? 

 Since we have two vowels left that are common: I and O (and U). 

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R (position 1), O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""STRIP"" -> tests S, T, R (position 3), I, P.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" tests two vowels (O and U) and ""STRIP"" tests one vowel (I). 

 Since we have only one R and we know the word has one R (we don't know if it has more, but the feedback only showed one R in the first guess and it was present, but it could have more? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So if the word has two R's, we might not know. But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So at least one R is there.

 Given that, I think testing two vowels (O and U) in one go might be efficient. So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has I? Then we wouldn't test I. Alternatively, we can test a word that has both I and O? 

 How about: ""ROBIN"" -> but we cannot use N (because it was absent in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 How about: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This tests R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5). This tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants (L, S). And we avoid the second position for R? Actually, we are putting R in the first position, which is new.

 So ""ROILS"" might be better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S) and R in a new position.

 Let me decide: 
 - ""ROUST"": tests O, U, S, T and R in first.
 - ""ROILS"": tests O, I, L, S and R in first.

 Both are good. I'll choose ""ROILS"" because it tests I and O, and L and S are also common.

 So my next guess: ""ROILS""

 But note: we are putting O in the second position. We don't have any information about the second position yet. It could be correct? Or not. We'll see.

 Let me write the guess: ROILS

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not in the second position. Now we are putting R in the first position. If the secret word has R in the first, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus and we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing O, I, L, S.

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Therefore, I choose ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but **not in position 2**.

For the next guess:
- Must include R (in a position other than 2) and avoid C, A, N, E.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like S, L, O, I) and position R in a new slot (position 1).
- ""ROILS"" fits: R in position 1 (tests new R placement), O and I (untested vowels), L and S (common consonants).

We have the following feedback:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since ""crane"" has R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-), O(-), I(-), L(x), S(x)
Interpretation:
- R is marked as minus again. Since in ""roils"", R is in position 1, this means R is in the secret word but not in position 1. Also, we knew from before it's not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- O is marked as minus, meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 2 (""roils"" has O in position 2).
- I is marked as minus, meaning I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since ""roils"" has I in position 3).
- L and S are absent (x), so L and S are not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains: R, O, I (each at least once)
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, L, S
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2, so it is somewhere else: position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 might be possible? However, we haven't tested O in position 1 yet.
- I cannot be in position 3, so it is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, L, S (with R, O, I present and others absent).

Now, available letters: apart from the absent ones (C,A,N,E,L,S), we can use any other. But we must use R, O, I in positions that avoid the forbidden ones and also test new letters.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R, O, I
- Excludes: C,A,N,E,L,S
- Places R in position 3,4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2)
- Places O not in position 2 (but it can be in 1,3,4,5)
- Places I not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4,5)

We also want to test new letters to fill in the gaps. Common letters left: T, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let's think of words that fit these constraints.

First, note that the secret word has R, O, I. And we have three positions for R to be: 3,4,5.

Possible structures:

- If R is in position 3: then the word might be like ? ? R ? ?
  Then O and I must be in positions: O can be in 1,4,5; I in 1,2,4,5. Also, we need two more letters.

- If R is in position 4: then ? ? ? R ?
- If R in position 5: ? ? ? ? R

We can try to think of common words that have R, O, I.

Word example: ""ORBIT"" — but has B, T, and let's see the letters: O,R,B,I,T. But note: we haven't excluded B or T, so it's possible. Also, check absent: C,A,N,E,L,S — none of these are in ORBIT. So acceptable.

But let's check positions for ORBIT: 
O in position 1, R in position 2? Wait, we know R cannot be in position 2! So if we guess ""ORBIT"", we would put R in position 2 which is forbidden (we know it's not there). So we cannot put R in position 2.

That means if we consider ""ORBIT"", it forces R into position 2, which we know is incorrect. So not good.

Another word: ""PRIOR"" — but has two R's? And we haven't tested double letters? But note, the feedback doesn't confirm if there are multiple R's, but it's possible. However, ""PRIOR"" has P,R,I,O,R — R in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for R, so we cannot put R in position 2.

Therefore, ""PRIOR"" is bad because it places R in position 2.

What about ""MOURN""? But we cannot use N — N is excluded from feedback 1.

Word: ""FRUIT"" — but we haven't excluded F, but F is not in our absent list. However, check letters: F,R,U,I,T. But we have O? The secret word has O, according to the feedback. So ""FRUIT"" doesn't have O, so it cannot be the secret word because O must be in it. So we cannot guess a word without O.

Similarly, we must include R, O, I.

So we need a word that contains R, O, I and the other two letters must be from the available set (not in excluded: C,A,N,E,L,S).

Common possibilities: 
- Words ending with R? Like ""R____"" but R cannot be at the beginning (position 1) because we know it's not there (from feedback on ""roils"").

So R must be in middle or end.

One idea: words starting with O? For example: O __ __ __ __ 
But O would be in position 1, which we haven't tested.

Then, R has to be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,4,5 but I cannot be in position 3? Actually, position 1 is taken by O? Then I can be in 2,4,5.

So a pattern: O ? ? ? R? Or O ? ? R? etc.

Example: ""O_____"" words: How about ""OUTRI"" — invalid. Or ""OURIE"" but E is excluded. Not good.

Another possibility: words with O in position 1, then I somewhere, and R in 3,4, or 5.

Word: ""OPTIC"" — C excluded, no. ""OPIUM"" — M is possible, but U? Let's list.

Since I is a vowel, have we thought of words like ""MOIR""? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words: R,O,I in any order, avoiding positions where we know they can't be.

Available vowels left? We have O,I, and maybe U? Or Y? But Y is less common.

Common words: 
- ""VIRGO"" — but V? And G? Letters: V,I,R,G,O. Then positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.
Check positions against feedback:
  R is in position 3 — allowed (since R must be in 3,4,5).
  O is in position 5 — allowed (since O cannot be only in position 2, and 5 is fine).
  I is in position 2 — allowed (since I cannot be in position 3, and 2 is fine).
Also, excluded letters: not C,A,N,E,L,S — V, I, R, G, O — all okay.

But is ""VIRGO"" a common word? It means a person's sign, so yes.

We haven't tested V or G? That's true, so it would give new information.

But are there other words? For example: ""BROIL"" — but L is excluded. ""GROIN"" — N excluded, and L? No, ""GROIN"" has N? And we know N is absent.

How about ""TORBI"" — not a word? ""DOING"" — no O? Wait, O is required.

Another option: ""GORRI"" — not a word? ""HORRI"" no.

""PORGY"" — but Y? And we haven't tested P or G. But Y is possible.

But let me see: ""POUR"" with 4 letters? No.

Perhaps ""TROIK"" — no, not English. 

Back to ""VIRGO"": it seems valid.

But R is in position 3 — good. O is in position 5 — which we haven't tested. And I in position 2 — also a new position.

We can also consider ""ORDU""? Not 5 letters? ""ORDURE"" is 6.

Another word: ""DIRTY"" — but no O. Must have O.

""DOGRI"" — again, not common.

""ORBIT"" won't work because R in position 2.

What about ""BROOD"" — has O twice? But we don't know. But problem: R in position 2? Forbidden.

Similarly, ""CROIX"" — C excluded.

So ""VIRGO"" seems reasonable.

But let me check if there is better: a word that tests more common letters? For example, ""GROUP"" — but no I? Must have I.

Another: ""POINT"" — no R? Must have R.

So we need R,O,I all together.

Option: ""MOIRA"" — but A is excluded? From feedback 1, A is absent. So not.

""MIRO"" — 4 letters.

""VIRGO"" might be acceptable.

But to include more common letters? T instead of V? But V is less common, but that doesn't hurt.

Another word: avoid V? How about ""PIROG"" — p-i-r-o-g? That's a type of food? But not common.

Alternatively, ""THORI"" — thori? Not common.

Maybe ""RHOI""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""VIRGO"" is a valid option.

But wait, we have R in position 3, O in position 5. We haven't tested position 4 yet? But we'll get feedback.

Another possibility: include T? Which is common.

Word: ""TORID"" — meaning dry and hot? Letters: T, O, R, I, D.
Positions: 
If we make it? T in 1, O in 2, R in 3, I in 4, D in 5?
But wait: O cannot be in position 2? Because in feedback for ""roils"", O was in position 2 and marked minus? So O cannot be in position 2? Therefore, if we guess a word with O in position 2, we know it's wrong.

So if we use ""TORID"", O is in position 2? Not allowed.

How about rearrange? We need O not in position 2, and R not in 1 or 2.

So: ""TRODI"" — not a word.

""ROTID"" — not common.

""INDOR"" — but N excluded.

So difficult.

Perhaps ""DOCRI"" — no.

Or ""DOGRI"" — not English.

Another idea: ""ORIX""? Not enough.

Perhaps ""QUORI"" — but Q and U? U is possible.

""QUOIR""? Not a word.

I think ""VIRGO"" is one option.

Another word: ""HORI"" not 5 letters.

""RHINO"" — N excluded.

So, perhaps ""VIRGO"" is acceptable.

But note: in ""VIRGO"", the letter pattern is V-I-R-G-O. Positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.

We haven't tested V or G? So it will give information.

We might also consider words with U? For example: ""OUVRI"" — not English.

""OURIE"" — E excluded.

So I'll go with ""VIRGO"" as my next guess.

But let's confirm feedback constraints:
- R must not be in position 1 or 2: in ""VIRGO"", R is in position 3 — okay.
- O must not be in position 2: in ""VIRGO"", O is in position 5 — okay.
- I must not be in position 3: in ""VIRGO"", I is in position 2 — okay? Position 2 is allowed for I because we only know it can't be in position 3.

Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""VIRGO""

But hold on: is ""VIRGO"" a five-letter word? Yes.

Alternatively, another word: ""BIRO"" — but 4 letters? Biro is five? B-I-R-O? Wait, that's four? Or ""BIROS"" to plural? But 5: B-I-R-O-S. But S is excluded? We know S is absent? In guess 2: S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""BIROS"" has S — invalid because S is excluded.

Similarly, no.

So I'll go with ""VIRGO"".

Another idea: ""THIRD"" — but no O.

""PIROU"" — not common.

So ""VIRGO"" it is.

From the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✗), R(-), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗) → R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2: roils** → R(-), O(-), I(-), L(✗), S(✗) → R is not in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5); O is in the word but not in position 2; I is in the word but not in position 3; L and S are absent.

Key deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, O, I (exactly once each, though duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S → eliminated from consideration.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (not 1 or 2).
  - O cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (but can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Need to form a valid 5-letter English word including R, O, I, using new common letters (e.g., T, U, G, B, P, D, M, F).

For the next guess:
- Choose a word that places R in a permissible position (3,4,5), O not in position 2, and I not in position 3.
- Test new high-frequency letters like V, G, T, or D to gather more info.
- ""VIRGO"" (meaning a zodiac sign) fits:
  - Positions: V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), O(5).
  - R in position 3 → allowed (as per R constraints).
  - O in position 5 → allowed (not position 2).
  - I in position 2 → allowed (not position 3).
  - Avoids excluded letters (C,A,N,E,L,S not used).
  - Introduces new letters V and G for testing.
- Alternative words considered: ""TORID"" (invalid—O would be in position 2), ""ORBIT"" (invalid—R would be in position 2), ""BIROS"" (invalid—S is excluded). ""VIRGO"" is optimal for maximizing feedback on positions and letter presence.

<guess>virgo</guess>",virgo,"We have the following feedback:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since ""crane"" has R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-), O(-), I(-), L(x), S(x)
Interpretation:
- R is marked as minus again. Since in ""roils"", R is in position 1, this means R is in the secret word but not in position 1. Also, we knew from before it's not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- O is marked as minus, meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 2 (""roils"" has O in position 2).
- I is marked as minus, meaning I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since ""roils"" has I in position 3).
- L and S are absent (x), so L and S are not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains: R, O, I (each at least once)
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, L, S
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2, so it is somewhere else: position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 might be possible? However, we haven't tested O in position 1 yet.
- I cannot be in position 3, so it is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, L, S (with R, O, I present and others absent).

Now, available letters: apart from the absent ones (C,A,N,E,L,S), we can use any other. But we must use R, O, I in positions that avoid the forbidden ones and also test new letters.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R, O, I
- Excludes: C,A,N,E,L,S
- Places R in position 3,4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2)
- Places O not in position 2 (but it can be in 1,3,4,5)
- Places I not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4,5)

We also want to test new letters to fill in the gaps. Common letters left: T, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let's think of words that fit these constraints.

First, note that the secret word has R, O, I. And we have three positions for R to be: 3,4,5.

Possible structures:

- If R is in position 3: then the word might be like ? ? R ? ?
  Then O and I must be in positions: O can be in 1,4,5; I in 1,2,4,5. Also, we need two more letters.

- If R is in position 4: then ? ? ? R ?
- If R in position 5: ? ? ? ? R

We can try to think of common words that have R, O, I.

Word example: ""ORBIT"" — but has B, T, and let's see the letters: O,R,B,I,T. But note: we haven't excluded B or T, so it's possible. Also, check absent: C,A,N,E,L,S — none of these are in ORBIT. So acceptable.

But let's check positions for ORBIT: 
O in position 1, R in position 2? Wait, we know R cannot be in position 2! So if we guess ""ORBIT"", we would put R in position 2 which is forbidden (we know it's not there). So we cannot put R in position 2.

That means if we consider ""ORBIT"", it forces R into position 2, which we know is incorrect. So not good.

Another word: ""PRIOR"" — but has two R's? And we haven't tested double letters? But note, the feedback doesn't confirm if there are multiple R's, but it's possible. However, ""PRIOR"" has P,R,I,O,R — R in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for R, so we cannot put R in position 2.

Therefore, ""PRIOR"" is bad because it places R in position 2.

What about ""MOURN""? But we cannot use N — N is excluded from feedback 1.

Word: ""FRUIT"" — but we haven't excluded F, but F is not in our absent list. However, check letters: F,R,U,I,T. But we have O? The secret word has O, according to the feedback. So ""FRUIT"" doesn't have O, so it cannot be the secret word because O must be in it. So we cannot guess a word without O.

Similarly, we must include R, O, I.

So we need a word that contains R, O, I and the other two letters must be from the available set (not in excluded: C,A,N,E,L,S).

Common possibilities: 
- Words ending with R? Like ""R____"" but R cannot be at the beginning (position 1) because we know it's not there (from feedback on ""roils"").

So R must be in middle or end.

Then, R has to be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,4,5 but I cannot be in position 3? Actually, position 1 is taken by O? Then I can be in 2,4,5.

So a pattern: O ? ? ? R? Or O ? ? R? etc.

Example: ""O_____"" words: How about ""OUTRI"" — invalid. Or ""OURIE"" but E is excluded. Not good.

Another possibility: words with O in position 1, then I somewhere, and R in 3,4, or 5.

Word: ""OPTIC"" — C excluded, no. ""OPIUM"" — M is possible, but U? Let's list.

Since I is a vowel, have we thought of words like ""MOIR""? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words: R,O,I in any order, avoiding positions where we know they can't be.

  O is in position 5 — allowed (since O cannot be only in position 2, and 5 is fine).
  I is in position 2 — allowed (since I cannot be in position 3, and 2 is fine).
Also, excluded letters: not C,A,N,E,L,S — V, I, R, G, O — all okay.

But is ""VIRGO"" a common word? It means a person's sign, so yes.

We haven't tested V or G? That's true, so it would give new information.

But are there other words? For example: ""BROIL"" — but L is excluded. ""GROIN"" — N excluded, and L? No, ""GROIN"" has N? And we know N is absent.

""PORGY"" — but Y? And we haven't tested P or G. But Y is possible.

But let me see: ""POUR"" with 4 letters? No.

Perhaps ""TROIK"" — no, not English. 

Back to ""VIRGO"": it seems valid.

But R is in position 3 — good. O is in position 5 — which we haven't tested. And I in position 2 — also a new position.

We can also consider ""ORDU""? Not 5 letters? ""ORDURE"" is 6.

""ORBIT"" won't work because R in position 2.

""QUOIR""? Not a word.

I think ""VIRGO"" is one option.

Another word: ""HORI"" not 5 letters.

""RHINO"" — N excluded.

So, perhaps ""VIRGO"" is acceptable.

But note: in ""VIRGO"", the letter pattern is V-I-R-G-O. Positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.

We haven't tested V or G? So it will give information.

We might also consider words with U? For example: ""OUVRI"" — not English.

""OURIE"" — E excluded.

So I'll go with ""VIRGO"" as my next guess.

But let's confirm feedback constraints:
- R must not be in position 1 or 2: in ""VIRGO"", R is in position 3 — okay.
- O must not be in position 2: in ""VIRGO"", O is in position 5 — okay.
- I must not be in position 3: in ""VIRGO"", I is in position 2 — okay? Position 2 is allowed for I because we only know it can't be in position 3.

Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""VIRGO""

But hold on: is ""VIRGO"" a five-letter word? Yes.

Alternatively, another word: ""BIRO"" — but 4 letters? Biro is five? B-I-R-O? Wait, that's four? Or ""BIROS"" to plural? But 5: B-I-R-O-S. But S is excluded? We know S is absent? In guess 2: S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""BIROS"" has S — invalid because S is excluded.

Similarly, no.

So I'll go with ""VIRGO"".

Another idea: ""THIRD"" — but no O.

""PIROU"" — not common.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's tackle this Wordle-like game. I'm supposed to guess a 5-letter English word in 6 tries, using feedback after each guess. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I need a starting word that'll give me useful clues.

My goal is to cover as many common letters and positions as possible efficiently. Typically, vowels are important, and consonants like S, T, R, N are frequent in English. So, I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters. The classic ""CRANE"" comes to mind—it's got C, R, A, N, E. 'A' and 'E' are vowels, 'R' and 'N' are common consonants, and 'C' is somewhat frequent too. That should provide a good spread of vowels and consonants.

Thinking further... ""STARE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common starter words, but ""CRANE"" feels solid. It avoids rare letters and balances vowels (A,E) with consonants. Plus, it positions vowels where they often appear—like A in position 2 or E at the end might be patterns.

I could overthink this, but ""CRANE"" has served many players well. Let's stick with that.For my first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the feedback information. Letters like vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (R, N, C) are statistically more likely to appear. ""CRANE"" fits this well—it uses three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), covering diverse positions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - Only the letter 'R' is present in the secret word but in the wrong position. 
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is the second letter and it's marked as wrong position).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word, we can use this information to form our next guess.

 Constraints for next guess:
 - Must include the letter 'R' (but not in the second position).
 - Must not include the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Includes 'R' (in a position that is not the second one, so we can try it in first, third, fourth, or fifth).
 - Includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Since we know that the word has an 'R' and we don't know its position, we might try to put 'R' in a different position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have A, E, so it might have other vowels? But vowels are important. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We should try to include one or two of these.

 Let's consider the word: ""ROTIS"" or ""ROUST"" but note that we cannot use E or A, so we have to avoid them.

 However, we must also avoid the letters that were absent: C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - We can try words with R in the first position? But note that in the feedback, R was in the second position and was wrong. That doesn't prevent R from being in the first position? Actually, it might be. Let me think: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 But we don't know. So we can try to put R in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried, and also test other common letters.

 Let me list some words that meet the criteria (no C, A, N, E and include R):

 - ""PRIOR"" -> but has two R's? and we don't know if there are two R's. Also, we might want to test more new letters.
 - ""ROOMY"" -> but we don't know if Y is allowed? Actually, Y is a letter and can be used. But let's avoid for now because it's less common.
 - ""ROILS"" -> R at the beginning, then O, I, L, S. This uses common letters and tests O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Actually, we can put R anywhere except the second? But wait, the feedback only said that the R in the second position is wrong. It might be that the word has R in the second position? No, because the feedback says it is in the word but in the wrong position. So if it were in the second position and correct, it would have been marked as correct. Therefore, the R is not in the second position. So we must avoid putting R in the second position in our next guess? Actually, we can put it again in the second position? But that would be redundant and we already know it's not there. So we should try R in a different position.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should put R in a position that is not the second.

 Let me try to form a word with R in the first position? Then we can test if R is in the first position.

 Alternatively, we can put R in the third, fourth, or fifth.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize information. So we should test R in a new position and also test other common letters.

 How about: ""SPRIT"" -> but note that we have to avoid A, E, and also we haven't used S, P, R, I, T. However, ""SPRIT"" is not a common word? Actually, it might not be valid. Let me think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S. This word has R in the second position? But we know that R is not in the second position in the secret word. So we should avoid putting R in the second position because we already know it's not there. Therefore, we should not put R in the second position again.

 So let's avoid the second position for R.

 How about putting R in the first position? Then we can test if R is the first letter.

 Word: ""ROUST"" -> R, O, U, S, T. This uses O, U, S, T which are common. And R is in the first position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O, U, S, T. This would test those.

 Another word: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This has R in the first position.

 However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (meaning to move turbulently).

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTY"" but that has Y and we might avoid Y for now.

 Another common word: ""ROBOT"" -> but we cannot use B? Actually, we can, but we haven't tested B. However, we are avoiding A, E, and also we have to avoid C, N. But note: we don't know if B is in the word? We are free to use any letter except C, A, N, E.

 But ""ROBOT"" has two O's? and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, it has B and T.

 However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. So using a word with more common letters is better.

 Let me think of words that have R and also include other common consonants and vowels (I, O, U) and avoid the second position for R.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), S (position 4), T (position 5)

 But note: we are putting R in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R is not in the first either, so it must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can put R in the third position? For example: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P. But then we are putting R in the third position. And we avoid the second position? Actually, in ""STRIP"", R is in the third position. Also, we test S, T, I, P.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. So ""STRIP"" is acceptable.

 However, we also want to test vowels. The secret word might have I or O? We haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are absent). So we should test a vowel? 

 Since we have two vowels left that are common: I and O (and U). 

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R (position 1), O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""STRIP"" -> tests S, T, R (position 3), I, P.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" tests two vowels (O and U) and ""STRIP"" tests one vowel (I). 

 Since we have only one R and we know the word has one R (we don't know if it has more, but the feedback only showed one R in the first guess and it was present, but it could have more? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So if the word has two R's, we might not know. But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So at least one R is there.

 Given that, I think testing two vowels (O and U) in one go might be efficient. So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has I? Then we wouldn't test I. Alternatively, we can test a word that has both I and O? 

 How about: ""ROBIN"" -> but we cannot use N (because it was absent in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 How about: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This tests R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5). This tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants (L, S). And we avoid the second position for R? Actually, we are putting R in the first position, which is new.

 So ""ROILS"" might be better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S) and R in a new position.

 Let me decide: 
 - ""ROUST"": tests O, U, S, T and R in first.
 - ""ROILS"": tests O, I, L, S and R in first.

 Both are good. I'll choose ""ROILS"" because it tests I and O, and L and S are also common.

 So my next guess: ""ROILS""

 But note: we are putting O in the second position. We don't have any information about the second position yet. It could be correct? Or not. We'll see.

 Let me write the guess: ROILS

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not in the second position. Now we are putting R in the first position. If the secret word has R in the first, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus and we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing O, I, L, S.

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Therefore, I choose ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but **not in position 2**.

For the next guess:
- Must include R (in a position other than 2) and avoid C, A, N, E.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like S, L, O, I) and position R in a new slot (position 1).
- ""ROILS"" fits: R in position 1 (tests new R placement), O and I (untested vowels), L and S (common consonants).

<guess>roils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(-) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since ""crane"" has R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-), O(-), I(-), L(x), S(x)
Interpretation:
- R is marked as minus again. Since in ""roils"", R is in position 1, this means R is in the secret word but not in position 1. Also, we knew from before it's not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- O is marked as minus, meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 2 (""roils"" has O in position 2).
- I is marked as minus, meaning I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since ""roils"" has I in position 3).
- L and S are absent (x), so L and S are not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains: R, O, I (each at least once)
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, L, S
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2, so it is somewhere else: position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 might be possible? However, we haven't tested O in position 1 yet.
- I cannot be in position 3, so it is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, L, S (with R, O, I present and others absent).

Now, available letters: apart from the absent ones (C,A,N,E,L,S), we can use any other. But we must use R, O, I in positions that avoid the forbidden ones and also test new letters.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R, O, I
- Excludes: C,A,N,E,L,S
- Places R in position 3,4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2)
- Places O not in position 2 (but it can be in 1,3,4,5)
- Places I not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4,5)

We also want to test new letters to fill in the gaps. Common letters left: T, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let's think of words that fit these constraints.

First, note that the secret word has R, O, I. And we have three positions for R to be: 3,4,5.

Possible structures:

- If R is in position 3: then the word might be like ? ? R ? ?
  Then O and I must be in positions: O can be in 1,4,5; I in 1,2,4,5. Also, we need two more letters.

- If R is in position 4: then ? ? ? R ?
- If R in position 5: ? ? ? ? R

We can try to think of common words that have R, O, I.

Word example: ""ORBIT"" — but has B, T, and let's see the letters: O,R,B,I,T. But note: we haven't excluded B or T, so it's possible. Also, check absent: C,A,N,E,L,S — none of these are in ORBIT. So acceptable.

But let's check positions for ORBIT: 
O in position 1, R in position 2? Wait, we know R cannot be in position 2! So if we guess ""ORBIT"", we would put R in position 2 which is forbidden (we know it's not there). So we cannot put R in position 2.

That means if we consider ""ORBIT"", it forces R into position 2, which we know is incorrect. So not good.

Another word: ""PRIOR"" — but has two R's? And we haven't tested double letters? But note, the feedback doesn't confirm if there are multiple R's, but it's possible. However, ""PRIOR"" has P,R,I,O,R — R in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for R, so we cannot put R in position 2.

Therefore, ""PRIOR"" is bad because it places R in position 2.

What about ""MOURN""? But we cannot use N — N is excluded from feedback 1.

Word: ""FRUIT"" — but we haven't excluded F, but F is not in our absent list. However, check letters: F,R,U,I,T. But we have O? The secret word has O, according to the feedback. So ""FRUIT"" doesn't have O, so it cannot be the secret word because O must be in it. So we cannot guess a word without O.

Similarly, we must include R, O, I.

So we need a word that contains R, O, I and the other two letters must be from the available set (not in excluded: C,A,N,E,L,S).

Common possibilities: 
- Words ending with R? Like ""R____"" but R cannot be at the beginning (position 1) because we know it's not there (from feedback on ""roils"").

So R must be in middle or end.

One idea: words starting with O? For example: O __ __ __ __ 
But O would be in position 1, which we haven't tested.

Then, R has to be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,4,5 but I cannot be in position 3? Actually, position 1 is taken by O? Then I can be in 2,4,5.

So a pattern: O ? ? ? R? Or O ? ? R? etc.

Example: ""O_____"" words: How about ""OUTRI"" — invalid. Or ""OURIE"" but E is excluded. Not good.

Another possibility: words with O in position 1, then I somewhere, and R in 3,4, or 5.

Word: ""OPTIC"" — C excluded, no. ""OPIUM"" — M is possible, but U? Let's list.

Since I is a vowel, have we thought of words like ""MOIR""? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words: R,O,I in any order, avoiding positions where we know they can't be.

Available vowels left? We have O,I, and maybe U? Or Y? But Y is less common.

Common words: 
- ""VIRGO"" — but V? And G? Letters: V,I,R,G,O. Then positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.
Check positions against feedback:
  R is in position 3 — allowed (since R must be in 3,4,5).
  O is in position 5 — allowed (since O cannot be only in position 2, and 5 is fine).
  I is in position 2 — allowed (since I cannot be in position 3, and 2 is fine).
Also, excluded letters: not C,A,N,E,L,S — V, I, R, G, O — all okay.

But is ""VIRGO"" a common word? It means a person's sign, so yes.

We haven't tested V or G? That's true, so it would give new information.

But are there other words? For example: ""BROIL"" — but L is excluded. ""GROIN"" — N excluded, and L? No, ""GROIN"" has N? And we know N is absent.

How about ""TORBI"" — not a word? ""DOING"" — no O? Wait, O is required.

Another option: ""GORRI"" — not a word? ""HORRI"" no.

""PORGY"" — but Y? And we haven't tested P or G. But Y is possible.

But let me see: ""POUR"" with 4 letters? No.

Perhaps ""TROIK"" — no, not English. 

Back to ""VIRGO"": it seems valid.

But R is in position 3 — good. O is in position 5 — which we haven't tested. And I in position 2 — also a new position.

We can also consider ""ORDU""? Not 5 letters? ""ORDURE"" is 6.

Another word: ""DIRTY"" — but no O. Must have O.

""DOGRI"" — again, not common.

""ORBIT"" won't work because R in position 2.

What about ""BROOD"" — has O twice? But we don't know. But problem: R in position 2? Forbidden.

Similarly, ""CROIX"" — C excluded.

So ""VIRGO"" seems reasonable.

But let me check if there is better: a word that tests more common letters? For example, ""GROUP"" — but no I? Must have I.

Another: ""POINT"" — no R? Must have R.

So we need R,O,I all together.

Option: ""MOIRA"" — but A is excluded? From feedback 1, A is absent. So not.

""MIRO"" — 4 letters.

""VIRGO"" might be acceptable.

But to include more common letters? T instead of V? But V is less common, but that doesn't hurt.

Another word: avoid V? How about ""PIROG"" — p-i-r-o-g? That's a type of food? But not common.

Alternatively, ""THORI"" — thori? Not common.

Maybe ""RHOI""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""VIRGO"" is a valid option.

But wait, we have R in position 3, O in position 5. We haven't tested position 4 yet? But we'll get feedback.

Another possibility: include T? Which is common.

Word: ""TORID"" — meaning dry and hot? Letters: T, O, R, I, D.
Positions: 
If we make it? T in 1, O in 2, R in 3, I in 4, D in 5?
But wait: O cannot be in position 2? Because in feedback for ""roils"", O was in position 2 and marked minus? So O cannot be in position 2? Therefore, if we guess a word with O in position 2, we know it's wrong.

So if we use ""TORID"", O is in position 2? Not allowed.

How about rearrange? We need O not in position 2, and R not in 1 or 2.

So: ""TRODI"" — not a word.

""ROTID"" — not common.

""INDOR"" — but N excluded.

So difficult.

Perhaps ""DOCRI"" — no.

Or ""DOGRI"" — not English.

Another idea: ""ORIX""? Not enough.

Perhaps ""QUORI"" — but Q and U? U is possible.

""QUOIR""? Not a word.

I think ""VIRGO"" is one option.

Another word: ""HORI"" not 5 letters.

""RHINO"" — N excluded.

So, perhaps ""VIRGO"" is acceptable.

But note: in ""VIRGO"", the letter pattern is V-I-R-G-O. Positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.

We haven't tested V or G? So it will give information.

We might also consider words with U? For example: ""OUVRI"" — not English.

""OURIE"" — E excluded.

So I'll go with ""VIRGO"" as my next guess.

But let's confirm feedback constraints:
- R must not be in position 1 or 2: in ""VIRGO"", R is in position 3 — okay.
- O must not be in position 2: in ""VIRGO"", O is in position 5 — okay.
- I must not be in position 3: in ""VIRGO"", I is in position 2 — okay? Position 2 is allowed for I because we only know it can't be in position 3.

Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""VIRGO""

But hold on: is ""VIRGO"" a five-letter word? Yes.

Alternatively, another word: ""BIRO"" — but 4 letters? Biro is five? B-I-R-O? Wait, that's four? Or ""BIROS"" to plural? But 5: B-I-R-O-S. But S is excluded? We know S is absent? In guess 2: S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""BIROS"" has S — invalid because S is excluded.

Similarly, no.

So I'll go with ""VIRGO"".

Another idea: ""THIRD"" — but no O.

""PIROU"" — not common.

So ""VIRGO"" it is.From the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✗), R(-), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗) → R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2: roils** → R(-), O(-), I(-), L(✗), S(✗) → R is not in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5); O is in the word but not in position 2; I is in the word but not in position 3; L and S are absent.

Key deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, O, I (exactly once each, though duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S → eliminated from consideration.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (not 1 or 2).
  - O cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (but can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Need to form a valid 5-letter English word including R, O, I, using new common letters (e.g., T, U, G, B, P, D, M, F).

For the next guess:
- Choose a word that places R in a permissible position (3,4,5), O not in position 2, and I not in position 3.
- Test new high-frequency letters like V, G, T, or D to gather more info.
- ""VIRGO"" (meaning a zodiac sign) fits:
  - Positions: V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), O(5).
  - R in position 3 → allowed (as per R constraints).
  - O in position 5 → allowed (not position 2).
  - I in position 2 → allowed (not position 3).
  - Avoids excluded letters (C,A,N,E,L,S not used).
  - Introduces new letters V and G for testing.
- Alternative words considered: ""TORID"" (invalid—O would be in position 2), ""ORBIT"" (invalid—R would be in position 2), ""BIROS"" (invalid—S is excluded). ""VIRGO"" is optimal for maximizing feedback on positions and letter presence.

I\'m supposed to guess a 5-letter English word in 6 tries, using feedback after each guess. Since it\'s the first guess, I have no prior information, so I need a starting word that\'ll give me useful clues.\n\nMy goal is to cover as many common letters and positions as possible efficiently. Typically, vowels are important, and consonants like S, T, R, N are frequent in English. So, I\'ll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters. The classic ""CRANE"" comes to mind—it\'s got C, R, A, N, E. \'A\' and \'E\' are vowels, \'R\' and \'N\' are common consonants, and \'C\' is somewhat frequent too. That should provide a good spread of vowels and consonants.\n\nThinking further... ""STARE"" or ""ROATE"" are also common starter words, but ""CRANE"" feels solid.

Therefore, we should not put R in the second position again.\n\n So let\'s avoid the second position for R.\n\n How about putting R in the first position? Then we can test if R is the first letter.\n\n Word: ""ROUST"" -> R, O, U, S, T. This uses O, U, S, T which are common. And R is in the first position.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has O, U, S, T. This would test those.\n\n Another word: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This has R in the first position.\n\n However, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (meaning to move turbulently).\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTY"" but that has Y and we might avoid Y for now.\n\n Another common word: ""ROBOT"" -> but we cannot use B? Actually, we can, but we haven\'t tested B. However, we are avoiding A, E, and also we have to avoid C, N. But note: we don\'t know if B is in the word? We are free to use any letter except C, A, N, E.\n\n But ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s? and we don\'t know if O is in the word. Also, it has B and T.\n\n However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. So using a word with more common letters is better.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and also include other common consonants and vowels (I, O, U) and avoid the second position for R.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: \n   R (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), S (position 4), T (position 5)\n\n But note: we are putting R in the first position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but if it is, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R is not in the first either, so it must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can put R in the third position? For example: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P. But then we are putting R in the third position. And we avoid the second position? Actually, in ""STRIP"", R is in the third position. Also, we test S, T, I, P.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. So ""STRIP"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we also want to test vowels. The secret word might have I or O? We haven\'t tested any vowels except A and E (which are absent). So we should test a vowel? \n\n Since we have two vowels left that are common: I and O (and U). \n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R (position 1), O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""STRIP"" -> tests S, T, R (position 3), I, P.\n\n Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" tests two vowels (O and U) and ""STRIP"" tests one vowel (I). \n\n Since we have only one R and we know the word has one R (we don\'t know if it has more, but the feedback only showed one R in the first guess and it was present, but it could have more? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences. So if the word has two R\'s, we might not know. But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present. So at least one R is there.\n\n Given that, I think testing two vowels (O and U) in one go might be efficient. So I\'ll go with ""ROUST"".\n\n But wait, what if the secret word has I? Then we wouldn\'t test I. Alternatively, we can test a word that has both I and O? \n\n How about: ""ROBIN"" -> but we cannot use N (because it was absent in the first guess). So we cannot use N.\n\n How about: ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S. This tests R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 3), L (position 4), S (position 5). This tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants (L, S). And we avoid the second position for R? Actually, we are putting R in the first position, which is new.\n\n So ""ROILS"" might be better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S) and R in a new position.\n\n Let me decide: \n - ""ROUST"": tests O, U, S, T and R in first.\n - ""ROILS"": tests O, I, L, S and R in first.\n\n Both are good. I\'ll choose ""ROILS"" because it tests I and O, and L and S are also common.\n\n So my next guess: ""ROILS""\n\n But note: we are putting O in the second position. We don\'t have any information about the second position yet. It could be correct? Or not. We\'ll see.\n\n Let me write the guess: ROILS\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not in the second position. Now we are putting R in the first position. If the secret word has R in the first, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus and we know R must be in positions 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we are testing O, I, L, S.\n\n This seems a good use of a guess.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""roils"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.\n- R is **present** but **not in position 2**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R (in a position other than 2) and avoid C, A, N, E.\n- To maximize information, test new common letters (like S, L, O, I) and position R in a new slot (position 1).\n- ""ROILS"" fits: R in position 1 (tests new R placement), O and I (untested vowels), L and S (common consonants).\n\n<guess>roils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(-) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since ""crane"" has R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position).\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nFrom Guess 2: ""roils"" -> R(-), O(-), I(-), L(x), S(x)\nInterpretation:\n- R is marked as minus again. Since in ""roils"", R is in position 1, this means R is in the secret word but not in position 1. Also, we knew from before it\'s not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- O is marked as minus, meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 2 (""roils"" has O in position 2).\n- I is marked as minus, meaning I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since ""roils"" has I in position 3).\n- L and S are absent (x), so L and S are not in the secret word.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains: R, O, I (each at least once)\n- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, L, S\n- R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.\n- O cannot be in position 2, so it is somewhere else: position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 might be possible? However, we haven\'t tested O in position 1 yet.\n- I cannot be in position 3, so it is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, L, S (with R, O, I present and others absent).\n\nNow, available letters: apart from the absent ones (C,A,N,E,L,S), we can use any other. But we must use R, O, I in positions that avoid the forbidden ones and also test new letters.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes R, O, I\n- Excludes: C,A,N,E,L,S\n- Places R in position 3,4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2)\n- Places O not in position 2 (but it can be in 1,3,4,5)\n- Places I not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4,5)\n\nWe also want to test new letters to fill in the gaps. Common letters left: T, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit these constraints.\n\nFirst, note that the secret word has R, O, I. And we have three positions for R to be: 3,4,5.\n\nPossible structures:\n\n- If R is in position 3: then the word might be like ? ? R ? ?\n  Then O and I must be in positions: O can be in 1,4,5; I in 1,2,4,5. Also, we need two more letters.\n\n- If R is in position 4: then ? ? ? R ?\n- If R in position 5: ? ? ? ? R\n\nWe can try to think of common words that have R, O, I.\n\nWord example: ""ORBIT"" — but has B, T, and let\'s see the letters: O,R,B,I,T. But note: we haven\'t excluded B or T, so it\'s possible. Also, check absent: C,A,N,E,L,S — none of these are in ORBIT. So acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check positions for ORBIT: \nO in position 1, R in position 2? Wait, we know R cannot be in position 2! So if we guess ""ORBIT"", we would put R in position 2 which is forbidden (we know it\'s not there). So we cannot put R in position 2.\n\nThat means if we consider ""ORBIT"", it forces R into position 2, which we know is incorrect. So not good.\n\nAnother word: ""PRIOR"" — but has two R\'s? And we haven\'t tested double letters? But note, the feedback doesn\'t confirm if there are multiple R\'s, but it\'s possible. However, ""PRIOR"" has P,R,I,O,R — R in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for R, so we cannot put R in position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""PRIOR"" is bad because it places R in position 2.\n\nWhat about ""MOURN""? But we cannot use N — N is excluded from feedback 1.\n\nWord: ""FRUIT"" — but we haven\'t excluded F, but F is not in our absent list. However, check letters: F,R,U,I,T. But we have O? The secret word has O, according to the feedback. So ""FRUIT"" doesn\'t have O, so it cannot be the secret word because O must be in it. So we cannot guess a word without O.\n\nSimilarly, we must include R, O, I.\n\nSo we need a word that contains R, O, I and the other two letters must be from the available set (not in excluded: C,A,N,E,L,S).\n\nCommon possibilities: \n- Words ending with R? Like ""R____"" but R cannot be at the beginning (position 1) because we know it\'s not there (from feedback on ""roils"").\n\nSo R must be in middle or end.\n\nOne idea: words starting with O? For example: O __ __ __ __ \nBut O would be in position 1, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nThen, R has to be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,4,5 but I cannot be in position 3? Actually, position 1 is taken by O? Then I can be in 2,4,5.\n\nSo a pattern: O ? ? ? R? Or O ? ? R? etc.\n\nExample: ""O_____"" words: How about ""OUTRI"" — invalid. Or ""OURIE"" but E is excluded. Not good.\n\nAnother possibility: words with O in position 1, then I somewhere, and R in 3,4, or 5.\n\nWord: ""OPTIC"" — C excluded, no. ""OPIUM"" — M is possible, but U? Let\'s list.\n\nSince I is a vowel, have we thought of words like ""MOIR""? Not 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s search for words: R,O,I in any order, avoiding positions where we know they can\'t be.\n\nAvailable vowels left? We have O,I, and maybe U? Or Y? But Y is less common.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""VIRGO"" — but V? And G? Letters: V,I,R,G,O. Then positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.\nCheck positions against feedback:\n  R is in position 3 — allowed (since R must be in 3,4,5).\n  O is in position 5 — allowed (since O cannot be only in position 2, and 5 is fine).\n  I is in position 2 — allowed (since I cannot be in position 3, and 2 is fine).\nAlso, excluded letters: not C,A,N,E,L,S — V, I, R, G, O — all okay.\n\nBut is ""VIRGO"" a common word? It means a person\'s sign, so yes.\n\nWe haven\'t tested V or G? That\'s true, so it would give new information.\n\nBut are there other words? For example: ""BROIL"" — but L is excluded. ""GROIN"" — N excluded, and L? No, ""GROIN"" has N? And we know N is absent.\n\nHow about ""TORBI"" — not a word? ""DOING"" — no O? Wait, O is required.\n\nAnother option: ""GORRI"" — not a word? ""HORRI"" no.\n\n""PORGY"" — but Y? And we haven\'t tested P or G. But Y is possible.\n\nBut let me see: ""POUR"" with 4 letters? No.\n\nPerhaps ""TROIK"" — no, not English. \n\nBack to ""VIRGO"": it seems valid.\n\nBut R is in position 3 — good. O is in position 5 — which we haven\'t tested. And I in position 2 — also a new position.\n\nWe can also consider ""ORDU""? Not 5 letters? ""ORDURE"" is 6.\n\nAnother word: ""DIRTY"" — but no O. Must have O.\n\n""DOGRI"" — again, not common.\n\n""ORBIT"" won\'t work because R in position 2.\n\nWhat about ""BROOD"" — has O twice? But we don\'t know. But problem: R in position 2? Forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""CROIX"" — C excluded.\n\nSo ""VIRGO"" seems reasonable.\n\nBut let me check if there is better: a word that tests more common letters? For example, ""GROUP"" — but no I? Must have I.\n\nAnother: ""POINT"" — no R? Must have R.\n\nSo we need R,O,I all together.\n\nOption: ""MOIRA"" — but A is excluded? From feedback 1, A is absent. So not.\n\n""MIRO"" — 4 letters.\n\n""VIRGO"" might be acceptable.\n\nBut to include more common letters? T instead of V? But V is less common, but that doesn\'t hurt.\n\nAnother word: avoid V? How about ""PIROG"" — p-i-r-o-g? That\'s a type of food? But not common.\n\nAlternatively, ""THORI"" — thori? Not common.\n\nMaybe ""RHOI""? Not 5 letters.\n\nI think ""VIRGO"" is a valid option.\n\nBut wait, we have R in position 3, O in position 5. We haven\'t tested position 4 yet? But we\'ll get feedback.\n\nAnother possibility: include T? Which is common.\n\nWord: ""TORID"" — meaning dry and hot? Letters: T, O, R, I, D.\nPositions: \nIf we make it? T in 1, O in 2, R in 3, I in 4, D in 5?\nBut wait: O cannot be in position 2? Because in feedback for ""roils"", O was in position 2 and marked minus? So O cannot be in position 2? Therefore, if we guess a word with O in position 2, we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo if we use ""TORID"", O is in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nHow about rearrange? We need O not in position 2, and R not in 1 or 2.\n\nSo: ""TRODI"" — not a word.\n\n""ROTID"" — not common.\n\n""INDOR"" — but N excluded.\n\nSo difficult.\n\nPerhaps ""DOCRI"" — no.\n\nOr ""DOGRI"" — not English.\n\nAnother idea: ""ORIX""? Not enough.\n\nPerhaps ""QUORI"" — but Q and U? U is possible.\n\n""QUOIR""? Not a word.\n\nI think ""VIRGO"" is one option.\n\nAnother word: ""HORI"" not 5 letters.\n\n""RHINO"" — N excluded.\n\nSo, perhaps ""VIRGO"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: in ""VIRGO"", the letter pattern is V-I-R-G-O. Positions: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, G in 4, O in 5.\n\nWe haven\'t tested V or G? So it will give information.\n\nWe might also consider words with U? For example: ""OUVRI"" — not English.\n\n""OURIE"" — E excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""VIRGO"" as my next guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm feedback constraints:\n- R must not be in position 1 or 2: in ""VIRGO"", R is in position 3 — okay.\n- O must not be in position 2: in ""VIRGO"", O is in position 5 — okay.\n- I must not be in position 3: in ""VIRGO"", I is in position 2 — okay? Position 2 is allowed for I because we only know it can\'t be in position 3.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, guess: ""VIRGO""\n\nBut hold on: is ""VIRGO"" a five-letter word? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""BIRO"" — but 4 letters? Biro is five? B-I-R-O? Wait, that\'s four? Or ""BIROS"" to plural? But 5: B-I-R-O-S. But S is excluded? We know S is absent? In guess 2: S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""BIROS"" has S — invalid because S is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""VIRGO"".\n\nAnother idea: ""THIRD"" — but no O.\n\n""PIROU"" — not common.\n\nSo ""VIRGO"" it is.From the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✗), R(-), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗) → R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2: roils** → R(-), O(-), I(-), L(✗), S(✗) → R is not in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5); O is in the word but not in position 2; I is in the word but not in position 3; L and S are absent.\n\nKey deductions:\n- **Secret word contains**: R, O, I (exactly once each, though duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S → eliminated from consideration.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (not 1 or 2).\n  - O cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n  - I cannot be in position 3 (but can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Need to form a valid 5-letter English word including R, O, I, using new common letters (e.g., T, U, G, B, P, D, M, F).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Choose a word that places R in a permissible position (3,4,5), O not in position 2, and I not in position 3.\n- Test new high-frequency letters like V, G, T, or D to gather more info.\n- ""VIRGO"" (meaning a zodiac sign) fits:\n  - Positions: V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), O(5).\n  - R in position 3 → allowed (as per R constraints).\n  - O in position 5 → allowed (not position 2).\n  - I in position 2 → allowed (not position 3).\n  - Avoids excluded letters (C,A,N,E,L,S not used).\n  - Introduces new letters V and G for testing.\n- Alternative words considered: ""TORID"" (invalid—O would be in position 2), ""ORBIT"" (invalid—R would be in position 2), ""BIROS"" (invalid—S is excluded). ""VIRGO"" is optimal for maximizing feedback on positions and letter presence.\n\n<guess>virgo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roils -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: virgo -> FEEDBACK: V(-) I(-) R(-) G(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C(✗): C absent
- R(-): R present but wrong position (not position 2)
- A(✗): A absent
- N(✗): N absent
- E(✗): E absent

Guess 2: roils
- R(-): R present but not in position 1 (since this is a different position than guess 1, we know R is not in 1 or 2)
- O(-): O present but not in position 2
- I(-): I present but not in position 3
- L(✗): L absent
- S(✗): S absent

Guess 3: virgo
- V(-): V is present but not in position 1
- I(-): I is present but not in position 2 (new info: since in roils I was in position 3 and marked -, and here in position 2 also -, so I cannot be in position 2 or 3)
- R(-): R present but not in position 3 (since in virgo, R is in position 3)
- G(✗): G absent
- O(-): O present but not in position 5

Now, let's compile all the information.

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, L, S, G (from the ✗ symbols)

Present letters:
- R: from guess 1 and 2, we know it's present but not positions 1, 2 (from guess 1: not 2; guess 2: not 1; guess 3: not 3)
- O: present - not position 2 (from guess 2) and not position 5 (from guess 3)
- I: present - not position 3 (from guess 2) and not position 2 (from guess 3)
- V: present - not position 1 (from guess 3)

We also must consider that the word has at least these letters: V, I, R, O.

Since we have 5 positions, and four letters (V, I, R, O) are present, and all have position constraints, and one more letter to be included. Since G is absent, we need to choose another letter not among the absent ones.

Possible positions:

- R: not in 1,2,3 → must be in 4 or 5.
- O: not in 2 or 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- I: not in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- V: not in 1 → must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Also, since we have at least four distinct letters present, and the fifth letter must be a new one, not among the absent ones. So we need to include a letter like: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But preferably common ones.

Now, we must form a word that includes V, I, R, O and one more letter, and satisfies the position constraints.

Let's denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R in {4,5}
- O in {1,3,4}
- I in {1,4,5}
- V in {2,3,4,5}

Also, note: each position must be filled uniquely unless a letter repeats? But we don't know about repeats, but since in previous guesses, the minus might cover duplicates? Actually, the feedback for virgo shows for each letter, so if there were duplicates, it might show minus for one and something else? But we don't see that. However, we cannot rule out duplicates, but since we have four letters and one new, and five positions, possibly no duplicates.

Let us assume no duplicates for simplicity. So each letter V, I, R, O, and a new letter each appear once.

Now, trying to assign positions:

First, R: position 4 or 5.

Case 1: R in position 4.
Then, O can be in 1,3 (since 4 taken by R).
I can be in 1,5 (since 4 taken by R).
V can be in 2,3,5.

But O and I both might want position 1? So if O in 1, then I cannot be in 1, so must be in 5. Then V in 2 or 3? But O cannot be in 2? Wait, O can be in 1,3,4 but 4 is taken? So O in 1 or 3.

Similarly, if O in 1, then I must be in 5 (since position 4 taken by R). Then V can be in 2,3? But position 3 is free? Positions: 1 taken by O, 4 by R, 5 by I → position 2 and 3 free. V can be in 2 or 3? So the remaining position and new letter? Position 3 left? Or one more position? Positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:R, 5:I. So we need to place V and the new letter? But V must be placed? Position 2 and 3 are free.

We have to place V in position 2 or 3? Then the other position (say 3 or 2) goes to the new letter? Or position 3 has V? Let's see: positions: 1:O, 4:R, 5:I. Position 2 and 3 to be filled with V and new letter? But V can be in 2 or 3? Position 3 is available? Yes.

For example: word O ? ? R I, with position 2 and 3 to be F and V? But the word must include V? So one of position 2 or 3 is V.

Similarly, if O is in position 3? Then R in 4, then O in 3? Then I can be in 1 or 5? Then V in 2 or 5? Etc.

This is getting messy. Let's consider words!

We need a word with letters including V,I,R,O and one more, avoiding C,A,N,E,L,S,G.

Common words: Perhaps ""VIRUS"" → but S excluded? S is absent. ""VIRAL"" → L absent? L absent. Not good.

Word: ""VOICE"" → E excluded? E absent, and C absent? C,A,N,E,L,S,G absent → C and E absent, so not. 

""AVOID"" → A excluded? A absent, so not.

""OVIDU"" → not English? 

""DRIVO"" → not word.

""PROVE"" → E excluded? And P? P possible? But E absent.

Another: ""OVERT"" → O,V,E,R,T → but E is absent? Not possible.

""VOTER"" → O,V,T,E,R → E absent? No.

Avoid E? What about ""VOTOR""? Not common.

""CHOIR"" → C absent? And H? Possible? But C absent? No.

Perhaps ""VIRAL"" but L absent.

Since V must be in the word, and we haven't used many words with V, it's tricky.

Word: ""RIVET"" → R,I,V,E,T → E absent? No.

""DRIVE"" → E absent.

""THRIV"" → not 5 letters.

Word: ""ROVES"" → S absent? No.

Perhaps include U: ""VIRTU"" → meaning an antique object? Let me check. V,I,R,T,U → 5 letters? Virtu is a word? Yes, meaning a love or knowledge of fine arts. And letters: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, T in 4, U in 5? But position constraints: R cannot be in position 3? From guess 3: in virgo R was in 3 and marked minus, so R cannot be in 3? So in ""VIRTU"", R in 3 → not allowed.

So cannot have R in 3.

How about ""VOTER"" with O in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2? Wait, in guess 3: O was in position 5 and marked minus? So no constraint on position 2 for O? Wait, from guess 2: roils had O in position 2 and marked minus, so O cannot be in position 2? Guess 2: O(-) because it was in position 2. Then guess 3: O in position 5 and marked minus? Correct.

So O cannot be in position 2 or 5? Therefore, in a word, O must not be in 2 or 5.

Similarly, for R, cannot be in 1,2,3.

I cannot be in 2 or 3.

V cannot be in 1.

For ""VIRTU"": R in position 3 → forbidden.

Back to placing R only in 4 or 5.

Option: R in position 5.

Then, O can be in 1,3,4 (since not 2 or 5).
I can be in 1,4 (since not 2,3 and not 5? Position 5 taken by R, so I in 1 or 4).
V in 2,3,4.

Case: O in position 1. Then positions: 1:O. Then I can be in 4? Because not 1 (taken), or position 4. Then V in 2 or 3? Then position 3 or 2 to be filled with the new letter? And position where V isn't? Position 1: O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:I, 5:R. V can be in position 2 or 3? So for example, ""O"" + ? + ? + ""I"" + ""R"". If V is in position 2, then position 3 must be the new letter; if V in position 3, then position 2 must be the new letter? Words: ""OVHIR""? Not a word. ""OCHIR""? C absent? Not. ""ODVIR""? Not. ""OFVIR""? Or ""OMVIR"" no.

What about ""OUIJA""? But J and A not? A absent.

Perhaps ""OUVIR"" not English.

Difficult.

O in position 3? Then R in 5. O in 3. Then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:O, 4:?, 5:R. Now, I can be in 1 or 4? V can be in 2 or 4? But if I is in 1, then V can be in 2 or 4? Or if I in 4, then V in 2?

For I in position 1: word I ? O ? R. V can be in 2 or 4? If V in position 2: I V O ? R → IVO?R? What new letter? ""IVOOR"" not word. ""IVOGR"" but G absent. ""IVOYR"" no.

If V in position 4: then I + ? + O + V + R. Position 2 must be new letter? ""I"" + ? + ""O"" + ""V"" + ""R"" → like ""I DOVR"" not word? ""IFOVR"" no.

Perhaps common letter T? ""MOTOR"" but O in position 2? Not allowed.

""TOWER"" has E? Not.

Perhaps with U? ""OURVR"" not.

Alternatively, O in position 4? R in 5. O in 4. Then positions: 1:?,2:?,3:?,4:O,5:R. I can be in 1 or 4 or 5? But position 4 and 5 taken? So I in position 1? Then positions:1:I,2:?,3:?,4:O,5:R. V can be in 2 or 3? So word: I V ? O R? Or I ? V O R? But also position 3 must be filled? With V in 2 or 3.

If V in 2: I V ? O R → what for position 3? ""IVTOR"" but T possible? ""IVHOR"" no. ""IVPOR"" etc. ""IVFOR""? Not word.

If V in 3: I ? V O R → position 2 new letter? ""IDVOR"" not English.

Other letters: How about ""DIVOR"" from divorce? But long? Divor is not 5. Divorce is 7.

""VODOR"" no.

Another idea: perhaps the new letter is T? Word ""VOTOR"" not common.

But we have a missed word: ""VORTEX"" too long? 6 letters.

""VORT"" not 5.

Perhaps ""VIRUS"" is out due to S.

But S is absent.

Maybe ""RIVAL"" but L absent.

Another possibility: that there are duplicate letters? For example, two O's? Or two I's?

For instance, if O appears twice? In feedback, for ""virgo"", O was in position 5 and marked minus? So at least one O is present but not in position 5. If there is another O, it could be elsewhere? Similarly for other letters.

But we don't have evidence. Let's see if we can find a word with duplicates.

For example, ""ROOMY"" has two O's? But Y? And R cannot be in 1? And O in position 2 forbidden? In ""ROOMY"", if we have R in 1 (forbidden? oh R cannot be in position 1), O in 2 (forbidden), etc. Not possible.

""BOOKI"" no.

Another common word: ""VOICE"" not, E absent.

Perhaps ""VIPER"" has E? Not.

""VIGOR"" but R not in position 5? And O not in position 4? In ""VIGOR"": V in 1, I in 2, G in 3, O in 4, R in 5. But:
- V in 1: from guess 3, V cannot be in position 1? But wait, in guess 3, ""virgo"" had V in position 1 and marked minus? So V cannot be in position 1? Therefore, in ""VIGOR"", V in 1 is not allowed. Also, G is absent? From feedback: G(x) so absent.

Not possible.

Back to R in position 4, Case 1: R in 4.

Then O in 1 or 3?, I in 1 or 5? But conflict if O and I both want position 1.

So subcases:

- O in position 1, and I in position 5: then word O_ _ R I? Positions 2 and 3 for V and new letter. V can be in position 2 or 3? But I and O are at 1 and 5. So the middle is positions 2 and 3: which can be filled with V and a new letter, say T or U.

For example, position 2: V, position 3: new letter: ""O V X R I""? What X? But common letter? ""O V A R I"" but A absent? Not. ""O V B R I"" → ""OVBRI"" not a word. ""O V D R I"" not. ""O V E R I"" but E absent.

Or position 2 new letter, position 3 V: ""O T V R I"" → ""OTVRI"" not known.

No common word.

- O in position 1, and I in position 4: but position 4 is taken by R? Cannot? Positions: R in 4, so I cannot be in 4 if R is there.

Earlier if O in 1, I can be in 5? Because position 4 taken by R.

No alternative.

Another possibility: O in position 3, then R in 4, I in 1 or 5? 

If O in 3: positions 1,2,3:O,4:R,5:?

Then I in 1 or 5? But position 3 is O, so I cannot be in 3? But it can be in 1 or 5.

If I in 1: then I O _ R ? → position 2 and 5 available? And V can be in 2 or 5? Position 4 is R? Word ""I O ? R ?"" with position 2 and 5 for V and new letter.

But position 5 is available? Also position 2.

V can be in position 2.

Then position 5 must be new letter: ""I O V R X"" → what? ""IOVRX"" no.

If V in position 5: then ""I O X R V"" → with position 2 new letter? ""IDORV"" not word.

If I in position 5? Then with O in 3, R in 4: positions 1,2,3:O,4:R,5:I? Wait, positions: 1 and 2 free? And V can be in 1,2,4? Position 4 is taken by R? Position 5 by I? So positions 1 and 2 available.

V can be in position 1 or 2? But V cannot be in position 1? From feedback, V must not be in position 1? Yes, in guess 3, V in 1 was minus. So V cannot be in 1.

So V must be in position 2? Then position 1 new letter? Word: ? V O R I? For example, ""D V O R I"" not word? ""H V O R I"" no. ""AVORI"" A absent? "" FVORI"" no. ""Favorite"" too long.

""UVORI"" not English.

Perhaps ""MAORI"" but M,A,O,R,I? A absent? And so on.

No.

With U? ""U V O R I"" not.

Perhaps I is not in position 1? In this case, with O in 3, R in 4, I in 5, then only position 1 and 2 for V and new letter? V can be in 2? Position 1 new letter.

But no common words.

Last case: R in position 5, and O in position 4.

R in 5, O in 4? Then positions: 1,2,3 available; 4:O,5:R.

I can be in 1? Because position 4 and 5 taken, and I cannot be in 2 or 3? So must be in 1? Position 1 available.

Then I in position 1: I _ _ O R? Positions 2 and 3 for V and new letter.

V can be in 2 or 3? Word ""I V ? O R"" or ""I ? V O R"".

If V in 2: ""I V X O R"" -> what X in position 3? Not common.

If V in 3: ""I X V O R"" -> position 2 new letter.

For example, ""I T V O R"" -> ""ITVOR"" not known.

""DIVOR"" but then V in 2, and D in 1? No, position 1 is I.

Position 2 could be T: ""ITVOR"" not English.

Perhaps ""IVORY"" -> but Y? And it would be I in 1, V in 2, O in 3? But in this subcase, O should be in position 4? ""IVORY"" positions: I-1, V-2, O-3, R-4, Y-5. But earlier, R must be in 5? Here R in 4? Contradiction.

If we want R in 5, then O in 4, and for ""IVORY"", R is in 4, not 5.

Not.

So perhaps we need to think about the word ""OVERT"" but E not possible.

Another word: ""VERB"" not.

Perhaps the new letter is D? ""VIRID"" -> not common. Or ""Rapid"" no.

Maybe ""DRIVE"" not E.

Perhaps ""PROVE"" not.

Let's list all common words with V,I,R,O in them, avoiding forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- Viper - E present, not
- Viral - L absent
- Virtu - which is valid? And with R in position 3 forbadeearlier? But in virtu, it's not 5 letters or different?

""Virtu"" is 5 letters: V-I-R-T-U. Positions:1V,2I,3R,4T,5U. But R in position 3 is forbidden? From feedback guess 3, R in position 3 was marked minus, so R cannot be in 3.

 So not.

Another: ""GROVE"" E and G? G absent.

""WOVEN"" E and N? E, N absent.

""COVER"" C and E? No.

""REVFO"" no.

""VOMIT"" -> V,O,M,I,T. But where is R? R required? Missing R.

Not.

""VOTER"" -> V,O,T,E,R -> E absent.

 Perhaps ""VOWER"" E and W? But E.

No.

""VIZIR"" or ""VIZ R"" not.

Perhaps ""VAPOR"" -> V,A,P,O,R. But A absent? From guess 1, A is absent.

Not.

""VAPOR"" has A.

""VIGOR"" G absent.

""VOCAL"" C absent.

""IVORY"" -> I,V,O,R,Y. Letters: I, V, O, R, Y. And positions: I-1, V-2, O-3, R-4, Y-5.

Now, check constraints for ""IVORY"":
- R not in position 1,2,3: in this, R is in position 4. Permissible.
- O not in position 2 or 5: in this, O is in position 3? But position 3 not forbidden? Only cannot be in 2 or 5? So position 3 ok.
- I not in position 2 or 3: in this, I is in position 1? Permissible.
- V not in position 1: in this, V is in position 2. Position 2 not forbidden? V can be in 2,3,4,5? So position 2 is ok.

 Letters: avoids absent letters: not C,A,N,E,L,S,G? Y is not absent, so ok.

""IVORY"" is a word? Yes, it means objects made of ivory or a color.

So it should be valid.

Also, it includes R at position 4, O at position 3, I at position 1, V at position 2, Y at position 5.

And feedback satisfies all constraints.

So this seems a good guess.

Before, I was stuck on the order, but ""IVORY"" fits the position constraints.

R in position 4? From guess 3, R was in position 3 and marked minus, but here in position 4, so that should be fine.

Similarly, O in position 3? Not forbidden.

V in position 2 permissibly.

I in position 1? No problem.

So guess ""IVORY"".

I think that's the best choice.Summary of feedback constraints:
- Guess 1: R present, not position 2; C, A, N, E absent.
- Guess 2: R, O, I present; L, S absent; R not position 1; O not position 2; I not position 3.
- Guess 3: V, I, R, O present; G absent; V not position 1; I not position 2; R not position 3; O not position 5.

Deductions:
- **Present letters**: R, O, I, V (all must appear in the secret word).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S, G.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Not in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  - O: Not in positions 2 or 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4.
  - I: Not in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
  - V: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.

To satisfy:
- ""IVORY"" is a valid English word (five letters, avoiding excluded letters).
- Positions: I(1), V(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5).
- Constraints:
  - R in position 4 (allowed).
  - O in position 3 (not forbidden).
  - I in position 1 (not forbidden).
  - V in position 2 (not forbidden).
- All present letters included.
- Tests new common letters (like Y).

<guess>ivory</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane (C✗ R- A✗ N✗ E✗)**:
   - R is present but not in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are absent.

2. **Guess 2: roils (R- O- I- L✗ S✗)**:
   - R is present but not in position 1 (combined with Guess 1, R not in 1 or 2).
   - O is present but not in position 2.
   - I is present but not in position 3.
   - L and S are absent.

3. **Guess 3: virgo (V- I- R- G✗ O-)**:
   - V is present but not in position 1.
   - I is present but not in position 2 (combined with Guess 2, I not in 2 or 3).
   - R is present but not in position 3 (combined with Guess 1–2, R not in 1, 2, or 3).
   - O is present but not in position 5 (combined with Guess 2, O not in 2 or 5).
   - G is absent.

### Deductions:
- **Present letters**: R, O, I, V (must appear).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S, G (excluded).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
  - I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - V must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word is a 5-letter English word containing R, O, I, V and one new letter (not absent).

### Strategy for next guess:
- Find a word that includes R, O, I, V and one new common letter (e.g., B, D, F, H, T, Y).
- Place letters to satisfy position constraints:
  - R: position 4 or 5.
  - O: position 1, 3, or 4, but not 2 or 5.
  - I: position 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3.
  - V: any position except 1.
- Test new letters efficiently. ""IVORY"" fits well:
  - Positions: I (1), V (2), O (3), R (4), Y (5).
  - Satisfies all constraints:
    - R in position 4 (allowed).
    - O in position 3 (not 2 or 5).
    - I in position 1 (not 2 or 3).
    - V in position 2 (not 1).
  - Uses Y (common letter, not tested, avoids excluded letters).

<guess>ivory</guess>",ivory,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C(✗): C absent
- R(-): R present but wrong position (not position 2)
- A(✗): A absent
- N(✗): N absent
- E(✗): E absent

Guess 2: roils
- R(-): R present but not in position 1 (since this is a different position than guess 1, we know R is not in 1 or 2)
- O(-): O present but not in position 2
- I(-): I present but not in position 3
- L(✗): L absent
- S(✗): S absent

Guess 3: virgo
- V(-): V is present but not in position 1
- I(-): I is present but not in position 2 (new info: since in roils I was in position 3 and marked -, and here in position 2 also -, so I cannot be in position 2 or 3)
- R(-): R present but not in position 3 (since in virgo, R is in position 3)
- G(✗): G absent
- O(-): O present but not in position 5

Now, let's compile all the information.

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, L, S, G (from the ✗ symbols)

Present letters:
- R: from guess 1 and 2, we know it's present but not positions 1, 2 (from guess 1: not 2; guess 2: not 1; guess 3: not 3)
- O: present - not position 2 (from guess 2) and not position 5 (from guess 3)
- I: present - not position 3 (from guess 2) and not position 2 (from guess 3)
- V: present - not position 1 (from guess 3)

We also must consider that the word has at least these letters: V, I, R, O.

Since we have 5 positions, and four letters (V, I, R, O) are present, and all have position constraints, and one more letter to be included. Since G is absent, we need to choose another letter not among the absent ones.

Possible positions:

- R: not in 1,2,3 → must be in 4 or 5.
- O: not in 2 or 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- I: not in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- V: not in 1 → must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Also, since we have at least four distinct letters present, and the fifth letter must be a new one, not among the absent ones. So we need to include a letter like: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But preferably common ones.

Now, we must form a word that includes V, I, R, O and one more letter, and satisfies the position constraints.

Let's denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R in {4,5}
- O in {1,3,4}
- I in {1,4,5}
- V in {2,3,4,5}

Also, note: each position must be filled uniquely unless a letter repeats? But we don't know about repeats, but since in previous guesses, the minus might cover duplicates? Actually, the feedback for virgo shows for each letter, so if there were duplicates, it might show minus for one and something else? But we don't see that. However, we cannot rule out duplicates, but since we have four letters and one new, and five positions, possibly no duplicates.

Let us assume no duplicates for simplicity. So each letter V, I, R, O, and a new letter each appear once.

Now, trying to assign positions:

First, R: position 4 or 5.

Case 1: R in position 4.
Then, O can be in 1,3 (since 4 taken by R).
I can be in 1,5 (since 4 taken by R).
V can be in 2,3,5.

But O and I both might want position 1? So if O in 1, then I cannot be in 1, so must be in 5. Then V in 2 or 3? But O cannot be in 2? Wait, O can be in 1,3,4 but 4 is taken? So O in 1 or 3.

Similarly, if O in 1, then I must be in 5 (since position 4 taken by R). Then V can be in 2,3? But position 3 is free? Positions: 1 taken by O, 4 by R, 5 by I → position 2 and 3 free. V can be in 2 or 3? So the remaining position and new letter? Position 3 left? Or one more position? Positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:R, 5:I. So we need to place V and the new letter? But V must be placed? Position 2 and 3 are free.

We have to place V in position 2 or 3? Then the other position (say 3 or 2) goes to the new letter? Or position 3 has V? Let's see: positions: 1:O, 4:R, 5:I. Position 2 and 3 to be filled with V and new letter? But V can be in 2 or 3? Position 3 is available? Yes.

For example: word O ? ? R I, with position 2 and 3 to be F and V? But the word must include V? So one of position 2 or 3 is V.

Similarly, if O is in position 3? Then R in 4, then O in 3? Then I can be in 1 or 5? Then V in 2 or 5? Etc.

This is getting messy. Let's consider words!

We need a word with letters including V,I,R,O and one more, avoiding C,A,N,E,L,S,G.

Common words: Perhaps ""VIRUS"" → but S excluded? S is absent. ""VIRAL"" → L absent? L absent. Not good.

Word: ""VOICE"" → E excluded? E absent, and C absent? C,A,N,E,L,S,G absent → C and E absent, so not. 

""AVOID"" → A excluded? A absent, so not.

""OVIDU"" → not English? 

""DRIVO"" → not word.

""PROVE"" → E excluded? And P? P possible? But E absent.

Another: ""OVERT"" → O,V,E,R,T → but E is absent? Not possible.

""VOTER"" → O,V,T,E,R → E absent? No.

Avoid E? What about ""VOTOR""? Not common.

""CHOIR"" → C absent? And H? Possible? But C absent? No.

Perhaps ""VIRAL"" but L absent.

Since V must be in the word, and we haven't used many words with V, it's tricky.

Word: ""RIVET"" → R,I,V,E,T → E absent? No.

""DRIVE"" → E absent.

""THRIV"" → not 5 letters.

Word: ""ROVES"" → S absent? No.

Perhaps include U: ""VIRTU"" → meaning an antique object? Let me check. V,I,R,T,U → 5 letters? Virtu is a word? Yes, meaning a love or knowledge of fine arts. And letters: V in 1, I in 2, R in 3, T in 4, U in 5? But position constraints: R cannot be in position 3? From guess 3: in virgo R was in 3 and marked minus, so R cannot be in 3? So in ""VIRTU"", R in 3 → not allowed.

So cannot have R in 3.

How about ""VOTER"" with O in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2? Wait, in guess 3: O was in position 5 and marked minus? So no constraint on position 2 for O? Wait, from guess 2: roils had O in position 2 and marked minus, so O cannot be in position 2? Guess 2: O(-) because it was in position 2. Then guess 3: O in position 5 and marked minus? Correct.

So O cannot be in position 2 or 5? Therefore, in a word, O must not be in 2 or 5.

Similarly, for R, cannot be in 1,2,3.

I cannot be in 2 or 3.

V cannot be in 1.

For ""VIRTU"": R in position 3 → forbidden.

Back to placing R only in 4 or 5.

Option: R in position 5.

Then, O can be in 1,3,4 (since not 2 or 5).
I can be in 1,4 (since not 2,3 and not 5? Position 5 taken by R, so I in 1 or 4).
V in 2,3,4.

Case: O in position 1. Then positions: 1:O. Then I can be in 4? Because not 1 (taken), or position 4. Then V in 2 or 3? Then position 3 or 2 to be filled with the new letter? And position where V isn't? Position 1: O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:I, 5:R. V can be in position 2 or 3? So for example, ""O"" + ? + ? + ""I"" + ""R"". If V is in position 2, then position 3 must be the new letter; if V in position 3, then position 2 must be the new letter? Words: ""OVHIR""? Not a word. ""OCHIR""? C absent? Not. ""ODVIR""? Not. ""OFVIR""? Or ""OMVIR"" no.

What about ""OUIJA""? But J and A not? A absent.

Perhaps ""OUVIR"" not English.

Difficult.

O in position 3? Then R in 5. O in 3. Then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:O, 4:?, 5:R. Now, I can be in 1 or 4? V can be in 2 or 4? But if I is in 1, then V can be in 2 or 4? Or if I in 4, then V in 2?

For I in position 1: word I ? O ? R. V can be in 2 or 4? If V in position 2: I V O ? R → IVO?R? What new letter? ""IVOOR"" not word. ""IVOGR"" but G absent. ""IVOYR"" no.

If V in position 4: then I + ? + O + V + R. Position 2 must be new letter? ""I"" + ? + ""O"" + ""V"" + ""R"" → like ""I DOVR"" not word? ""IFOVR"" no.

Perhaps common letter T? ""MOTOR"" but O in position 2? Not allowed.

""TOWER"" has E? Not.

Perhaps with U? ""OURVR"" not.

Alternatively, O in position 4? R in 5. O in 4. Then positions: 1:?,2:?,3:?,4:O,5:R. I can be in 1 or 4 or 5? But position 4 and 5 taken? So I in position 1? Then positions:1:I,2:?,3:?,4:O,5:R. V can be in 2 or 3? So word: I V ? O R? Or I ? V O R? But also position 3 must be filled? With V in 2 or 3.

If V in 2: I V ? O R → what for position 3? ""IVTOR"" but T possible? ""IVHOR"" no. ""IVPOR"" etc. ""IVFOR""? Not word.

If V in 3: I ? V O R → position 2 new letter? ""IDVOR"" not English.

Other letters: How about ""DIVOR"" from divorce? But long? Divor is not 5. Divorce is 7.

""VODOR"" no.

Another idea: perhaps the new letter is T? Word ""VOTOR"" not common.

But we have a missed word: ""VORTEX"" too long? 6 letters.

""VORT"" not 5.

Perhaps ""VIRUS"" is out due to S.

But S is absent.

Maybe ""RIVAL"" but L absent.

Another possibility: that there are duplicate letters? For example, two O's? Or two I's?

For instance, if O appears twice? In feedback, for ""virgo"", O was in position 5 and marked minus? So at least one O is present but not in position 5. If there is another O, it could be elsewhere? Similarly for other letters.

But we don't have evidence. Let's see if we can find a word with duplicates.

For example, ""ROOMY"" has two O's? But Y? And R cannot be in 1? And O in position 2 forbidden? In ""ROOMY"", if we have R in 1 (forbidden? oh R cannot be in position 1), O in 2 (forbidden), etc. Not possible.

""BOOKI"" no.

Another common word: ""VOICE"" not, E absent.

Perhaps ""VIPER"" has E? Not.

""VIGOR"" but R not in position 5? And O not in position 4? In ""VIGOR"": V in 1, I in 2, G in 3, O in 4, R in 5. But:
- V in 1: from guess 3, V cannot be in position 1? But wait, in guess 3, ""virgo"" had V in position 1 and marked minus? So V cannot be in position 1? Therefore, in ""VIGOR"", V in 1 is not allowed. Also, G is absent? From feedback: G(x) so absent.

Not possible.

Back to R in position 4, Case 1: R in 4.

Then O in 1 or 3?, I in 1 or 5? But conflict if O and I both want position 1.

So subcases:

- O in position 1, and I in position 5: then word O_ _ R I? Positions 2 and 3 for V and new letter. V can be in position 2 or 3? But I and O are at 1 and 5. So the middle is positions 2 and 3: which can be filled with V and a new letter, say T or U.

For example, position 2: V, position 3: new letter: ""O V X R I""? What X? But common letter? ""O V A R I"" but A absent? Not. ""O V B R I"" → ""OVBRI"" not a word. ""O V D R I"" not. ""O V E R I"" but E absent.

Or position 2 new letter, position 3 V: ""O T V R I"" → ""OTVRI"" not known.

No common word.

- O in position 1, and I in position 4: but position 4 is taken by R? Cannot? Positions: R in 4, so I cannot be in 4 if R is there.

Earlier if O in 1, I can be in 5? Because position 4 taken by R.

No alternative.

Another possibility: O in position 3, then R in 4, I in 1 or 5? 

If O in 3: positions 1,2,3:O,4:R,5:?

Then I in 1 or 5? But position 3 is O, so I cannot be in 3? But it can be in 1 or 5.

If I in 1: then I O _ R ? → position 2 and 5 available? And V can be in 2 or 5? Position 4 is R? Word ""I O ? R ?"" with position 2 and 5 for V and new letter.

But position 5 is available? Also position 2.

V can be in position 2.

Then position 5 must be new letter: ""I O V R X"" → what? ""IOVRX"" no.

If V in position 5: then ""I O X R V"" → with position 2 new letter? ""IDORV"" not word.

If I in position 5? Then with O in 3, R in 4: positions 1,2,3:O,4:R,5:I? Wait, positions: 1 and 2 free? And V can be in 1,2,4? Position 4 is taken by R? Position 5 by I? So positions 1 and 2 available.

V can be in position 1 or 2? But V cannot be in position 1? From feedback, V must not be in position 1? Yes, in guess 3, V in 1 was minus. So V cannot be in 1.

So V must be in position 2? Then position 1 new letter? Word: ? V O R I? For example, ""D V O R I"" not word? ""H V O R I"" no. ""AVORI"" A absent? "" FVORI"" no. ""Favorite"" too long.

""UVORI"" not English.

Perhaps ""MAORI"" but M,A,O,R,I? A absent? And so on.

No.

With U? ""U V O R I"" not.

Perhaps I is not in position 1? In this case, with O in 3, R in 4, I in 5, then only position 1 and 2 for V and new letter? V can be in 2? Position 1 new letter.

But no common words.

Last case: R in position 5, and O in position 4.

R in 5, O in 4? Then positions: 1,2,3 available; 4:O,5:R.

I can be in 1? Because position 4 and 5 taken, and I cannot be in 2 or 3? So must be in 1? Position 1 available.

Then I in position 1: I _ _ O R? Positions 2 and 3 for V and new letter.

V can be in 2 or 3? Word ""I V ? O R"" or ""I ? V O R"".

If V in 2: ""I V X O R"" -> what X in position 3? Not common.

If V in 3: ""I X V O R"" -> position 2 new letter.

For example, ""I T V O R"" -> ""ITVOR"" not known.

""DIVOR"" but then V in 2, and D in 1? No, position 1 is I.

Position 2 could be T: ""ITVOR"" not English.

Perhaps ""IVORY"" -> but Y? And it would be I in 1, V in 2, O in 3? But in this subcase, O should be in position 4? ""IVORY"" positions: I-1, V-2, O-3, R-4, Y-5. But earlier, R must be in 5? Here R in 4? Contradiction.

If we want R in 5, then O in 4, and for ""IVORY"", R is in 4, not 5.

Not.

So perhaps we need to think about the word ""OVERT"" but E not possible.

Another word: ""VERB"" not.

Perhaps the new letter is D? ""VIRID"" -> not common. Or ""Rapid"" no.

Maybe ""DRIVE"" not E.

Perhaps ""PROVE"" not.

Let's list all common words with V,I,R,O in them, avoiding forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- Viper - E present, not
- Viral - L absent
- Virtu - which is valid? And with R in position 3 forbadeearlier? But in virtu, it's not 5 letters or different?

""Virtu"" is 5 letters: V-I-R-T-U. Positions:1V,2I,3R,4T,5U. But R in position 3 is forbidden? From feedback guess 3, R in position 3 was marked minus, so R cannot be in 3.

 So not.

Another: ""GROVE"" E and G? G absent.

""WOVEN"" E and N? E, N absent.

""COVER"" C and E? No.

""REVFO"" no.

""VOMIT"" -> V,O,M,I,T. But where is R? R required? Missing R.

Not.

""VOTER"" -> V,O,T,E,R -> E absent.

 Perhaps ""VOWER"" E and W? But E.

No.

""VIZIR"" or ""VIZ R"" not.

Perhaps ""VAPOR"" -> V,A,P,O,R. But A absent? From guess 1, A is absent.

Not.

""VAPOR"" has A.

""VIGOR"" G absent.

""VOCAL"" C absent.

""IVORY"" -> I,V,O,R,Y. Letters: I, V, O, R, Y. And positions: I-1, V-2, O-3, R-4, Y-5.

Now, check constraints for ""IVORY"":
- R not in position 1,2,3: in this, R is in position 4. Permissible.
- O not in position 2 or 5: in this, O is in position 3? But position 3 not forbidden? Only cannot be in 2 or 5? So position 3 ok.
- I not in position 2 or 3: in this, I is in position 1? Permissible.
- V not in position 1: in this, V is in position 2. Position 2 not forbidden? V can be in 2,3,4,5? So position 2 is ok.

 Letters: avoids absent letters: not C,A,N,E,L,S,G? Y is not absent, so ok.

""IVORY"" is a word? Yes, it means objects made of ivory or a color.

So it should be valid.

Also, it includes R at position 4, O at position 3, I at position 1, V at position 2, Y at position 5.

And feedback satisfies all constraints.

So this seems a good guess.

Before, I was stuck on the order, but ""IVORY"" fits the position constraints.

R in position 4? From guess 3, R was in position 3 and marked minus, but here in position 4, so that should be fine.

Similarly, O in position 3? Not forbidden.

V in position 2 permissibly.

I in position 1? No problem.

So guess ""IVORY"".

I think that's the best choice.Summary of feedback constraints:
- Guess 1: R present, not position 2; C, A, N, E absent.
- Guess 2: R, O, I present; L, S absent; R not position 1; O not position 2; I not position 3.
- Guess 3: V, I, R, O present; G absent; V not position 1; I not position 2; R not position 3; O not position 5.

Deductions:
- **Present letters**: R, O, I, V (all must appear in the secret word).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S, G.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Not in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  - O: Not in positions 2 or 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4.
  - I: Not in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
  - V: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.

To satisfy:
- ""IVORY"" is a valid English word (five letters, avoiding excluded letters).
- Positions: I(1), V(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5).
- Constraints:
  - R in position 4 (allowed).
  - O in position 3 (not forbidden).
  - I in position 1 (not forbidden).
  - V in position 2 (not forbidden).
- All present letters included.
- Tests new common letters (like Y).

<guess>ivory</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane (C✗ R- A✗ N✗ E✗)**:
   - R is present but not in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are absent.

2. **Guess 2: roils (R- O- I- L✗ S✗)**:
   - R is present but not in position 1 (combined with Guess 1, R not in 1 or 2).
   - O is present but not in position 2.
   - I is present but not in position 3.
   - L and S are absent.

3. **Guess 3: virgo (V- I- R- G✗ O-)**:
   - V is present but not in position 1.
   - I is present but not in position 2 (combined with Guess 2, I not in 2 or 3).
   - R is present but not in position 3 (combined with Guess 1–2, R not in 1, 2, or 3).
   - O is present but not in position 5 (combined with Guess 2, O not in 2 or 5).
   - G is absent.

### Deductions:
- **Present letters**: R, O, I, V (must appear).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, L, S, G (excluded).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
  - I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - V must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word is a 5-letter English word containing R, O, I, V and one new letter (not absent).

### Strategy for next guess:
- Find a word that includes R, O, I, V and one new common letter (e.g., B, D, F, H, T, Y).
- Place letters to satisfy position constraints:
  - R: position 4 or 5.
  - O: position 1, 3, or 4, but not 2 or 5.
  - I: position 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3.
  - V: any position except 1.
- Test new letters efficiently. ""IVORY"" fits well:
  - Positions: I (1), V (2), O (3), R (4), Y (5).
  - Satisfies all constraints:
    - R in position 4 (allowed).
    - O in position 3 (not 2 or 5).
    - I in position 1 (not 2 or 3).
    - V in position 2 (not 1).
  - Uses Y (common letter, not tested, avoids excluded letters).",Guess 4: ivory -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) V(✓) O(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
