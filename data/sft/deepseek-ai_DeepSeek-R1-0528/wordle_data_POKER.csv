We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 Another is ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the profit from something, though less common) but let's stick with more common words.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters and has been a popular starting word in Wordle.

 Let me explain: 
   S, L, T are common consonants; A, E are vowels.

 However, note that we can also use ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Since it's the first guess, it's somewhat arbitrary. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" might be better because S and E are also common. But let's try ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". So we must choose a valid word.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, wait: the example used BRISK, BRAVE, etc. so we don't know the secret word yet.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

For the first guess, I chose a common starting word that includes frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that R and E are present in the word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.
   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.
   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.
2. Avoid C, A, and N.

Additionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.

We have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints for next guess:
- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don't know what it is.
- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don't have to avoid a letter if it's not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.
- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have three letters we haven't tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

One common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.

Consider including S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:

We need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.

So R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn't restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that's acceptable as long as it's not position 2.

Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5.

Now, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don't know about others.

Idea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.

Some words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:

Examples: 
- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

So, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

Another example: ""RESET"" - has two E's? But we don't know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.

But note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn't tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.

But also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don't have information about that.

Similarly for R.

To avoid complications, let's stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.

Better: let's choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Possible word: ""STORE""
- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.

""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.

""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that's bad.

""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it's not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.

So let's list positions for R and E:
R: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5
E: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4

We also want to test new letters.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let's see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.

""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.
- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). 
- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. 
- Avoids C, A, N.

Is PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.

We get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.

But wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.

We can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.

""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.

""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.

""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.

""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.

""STIRE"" is not valid. 

""PIERT""? Not common.

""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.

""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.

""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.

""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn't have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it's better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? 

However, in Wordle, you don't have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that's not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.

So words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words:

- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E's. But we don't care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that's allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don't know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that's new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that's fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E's and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.

However, position 2: we put E. We don't know if that's valid? We don't have any information about position 2.

But we also have R at position 1: which we haven't tried.

But ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.

But let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.

""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.

""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.

""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.

Other words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.

Let me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That's allowed.

Example: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.

But note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it's allowed.

Also, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.

But we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.

Better: let's include S and T.

""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.

Is ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.

Positions: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)
Position3: R (not position2, so good)
Position4: I
Position5: F

This seems efficient.

We might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.

""STIRE"" invalid.

""BOIRE"" not common.

Another option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.

We can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.

""RIPED"": not a common word.

""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but I think we should.

But if we don't include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won't get information on R's position.

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.

Alternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. 
- E at position2? which we haven't tried. 
- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.

In ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.

So both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.

But let me compare:

""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That's a new position.

In ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.

So both are good.

But ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.

Similarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.

But S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.

But anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.

Let me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.

""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.

So, okay.

I think ""PERIL"" is also good.

But to decide: let's see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.

We know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.

We might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.

But I don't think it matters much.

Alternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

So I'll go with ""SERIF"".

Wait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don't know.

Similarly for R at3.

But we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.

""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.

So, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.

Therefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.
- Avoid using C, A, and N.
- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).
- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

A strong choice is ""SERIF"":
- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.
- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).
- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.
- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.

This guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.

<guess>SERIF</guess>",SERIF,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that R and E are present in the word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.
   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.
   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.
2. Avoid C, A, and N.

Additionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.

We have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints for next guess:
- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don't know what it is.
- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don't have to avoid a letter if it's not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.
- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have three letters we haven't tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

One common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.

Consider including S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:

We need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.

So R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn't restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that's acceptable as long as it's not position 2.

Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5.

Now, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don't know about others.

Idea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.

Some words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:

Examples: 
- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

So, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

Another example: ""RESET"" - has two E's? But we don't know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.

But note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn't tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.

But also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don't have information about that.

Similarly for R.

To avoid complications, let's stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.

Better: let's choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Possible word: ""STORE""
- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.

""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.

""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that's bad.

""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it's not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.

So let's list positions for R and E:
R: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5
E: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4

We also want to test new letters.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let's see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.

""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.
- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). 
- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. 
- Avoids C, A, N.

Is PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.

We get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.

But wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.

We can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.

""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.

""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.

""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.

""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.

""STIRE"" is not valid. 

""PIERT""? Not common.

""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.

""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.

""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.

""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn't have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it's better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? 

However, in Wordle, you don't have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that's not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.

So words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words:

- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E's. But we don't care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that's allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don't know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that's new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that's fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E's and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.

However, position 2: we put E. We don't know if that's valid? We don't have any information about position 2.

But we also have R at position 1: which we haven't tried.

But ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.

But let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.

""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.

""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.

""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.

Other words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.

Let me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That's allowed.

Example: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.

But note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it's allowed.

Also, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.

But we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.

Better: let's include S and T.

""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.

Is ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.

Positions: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)
Position3: R (not position2, so good)
Position4: I
Position5: F

This seems efficient.

We might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.

""STIRE"" invalid.

""BOIRE"" not common.

Another option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.

We can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.

""RIPED"": not a common word.

""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but I think we should.

But if we don't include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won't get information on R's position.

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.

Alternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. 
- E at position2? which we haven't tried. 
- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.

In ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.

So both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.

But let me compare:

""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That's a new position.

In ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.

So both are good.

But ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.

Similarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.

But S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.

But anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.

Let me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.

""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.

So, okay.

I think ""PERIL"" is also good.

But to decide: let's see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.

We know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.

We might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.

But I don't think it matters much.

Alternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

So I'll go with ""SERIF"".

Wait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don't know.

Similarly for R at3.

But we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.

""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.

So, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.

Therefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.
- Avoid using C, A, and N.
- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).
- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

A strong choice is ""SERIF"":
- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.
- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).
- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.
- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.

This guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.",Guess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,POKER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 Another is ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the profit from something, though less common) but let's stick with more common words.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters and has been a popular starting word in Wordle.

 Let me explain: 
   S, L, T are common consonants; A, E are vowels.

 However, note that we can also use ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Since it's the first guess, it's somewhat arbitrary. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" might be better because S and E are also common. But let's try ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". So we must choose a valid word.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, wait: the example used BRISK, BRAVE, etc. so we don't know the secret word yet.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.For the first guess, I chose a common starting word that includes frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that R and E are present in the word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.
   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.
   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.
2. Avoid C, A, and N.

Additionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.

We have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints for next guess:
- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don't know what it is.
- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don't have to avoid a letter if it's not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.
- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have three letters we haven't tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

One common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.

Consider including S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:

We need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.

So R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn't restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that's acceptable as long as it's not position 2.

Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5.

Now, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don't know about others.

Idea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.

Some words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:

Examples: 
- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

So, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

Another example: ""RESET"" - has two E's? But we don't know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.

But note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn't tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.

But also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don't have information about that.

Similarly for R.

To avoid complications, let's stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.

Better: let's choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Possible word: ""STORE""
- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.

""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.

""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that's bad.

""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it's not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.

So let's list positions for R and E:
R: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5
E: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4

We also want to test new letters.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let's see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.

""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.
- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). 
- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. 
- Avoids C, A, N.

Is PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.

We get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.

But wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.

We can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.

""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.

""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.

""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.

""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.

""STIRE"" is not valid. 

""PIERT""? Not common.

""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.

""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.

""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.

""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn't have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it's better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? 

However, in Wordle, you don't have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that's not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.

So words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words:

- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E's. But we don't care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that's allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don't know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that's new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that's fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E's and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.

However, position 2: we put E. We don't know if that's valid? We don't have any information about position 2.

But we also have R at position 1: which we haven't tried.

But ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.

But let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.

""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.

""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.

""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.

Other words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.

Let me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That's allowed.

Example: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.

But note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it's allowed.

Also, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.

But we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.

Better: let's include S and T.

""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.

Is ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.

Positions: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)
Position3: R (not position2, so good)
Position4: I
Position5: F

This seems efficient.

We might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.

""STIRE"" invalid.

""BOIRE"" not common.

Another option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.

We can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.

""RIPED"": not a common word.

""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but I think we should.

But if we don't include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won't get information on R's position.

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.

Alternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. 
- E at position2? which we haven't tried. 
- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.

In ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.

So both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.

But let me compare:

""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That's a new position.

In ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.

So both are good.

But ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.

Similarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.

But S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.

But anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.

Let me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.

""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.

So, okay.

I think ""PERIL"" is also good.

But to decide: let's see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.

We know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.

We might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.

But I don't think it matters much.

Alternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

So I'll go with ""SERIF"".

Wait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don't know.

Similarly for R at3.

But we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.

""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.

So, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.

Therefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.
- Avoid using C, A, and N.
- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).
- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

A strong choice is ""SERIF"":
- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.
- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).
- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.
- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.

This guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.

Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.\n\nWe have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints for next guess:\n- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don\'t know what it is.\n- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don\'t have to avoid a letter if it\'s not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.\n- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have three letters we haven\'t tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\nOne common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.\n\nConsider including S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.\n\nSo R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn\'t restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that\'s acceptable as long as it\'s not position 2.\n\nSimilarly, E must be in a position other than 5.\n\nNow, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don\'t know about others.\n\nIdea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.\n\nSome words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:\n\nExamples: \n- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.\n\nTherefore, avoid E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\nSo, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nAnother example: ""RESET"" - has two E\'s? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn\'t tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.\n\nBut also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don\'t have information about that.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nTo avoid complications, let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.\n\nBetter: let\'s choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""STORE""\n- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.\n\n""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.\n\n""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that\'s bad.\n\n""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it\'s not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.\n\nSo let\'s list positions for R and E:\nR: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5\nE: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let\'s see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.\n\n""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.\n- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). \n- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. \n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\nIs PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.\n\nWe get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.\n\nBut wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.\n\nWe can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.\n\n""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2).

Not a valid English word.\n\n""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.\n\n""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.\n\n""STIRE"" is not valid. \n\n""PIERT""?

Bad.\n\n""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn\'t have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it\'s better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? \n\nHowever, in Wordle, you don\'t have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that\'s not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.\n\nTherefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.\n\nSo words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E\'s. But we don\'t care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that\'s allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don\'t know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that\'s new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that\'s fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E\'s and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.\n\nHowever, position 2: we put E. We don\'t know if that\'s valid? We don\'t have any information about position 2.\n\nBut we also have R at position 1: which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.\n\nBut let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.\n\n""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.\n\n""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.\n\n""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.\n\n""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.\n\nOther words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.\n\nLet me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That\'s allowed.\n\nExample: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it\'s allowed.\n\nAlso, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.\n\nBetter: let\'s include S and T.\n\n""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.\n\nAnother word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.\n\nIs ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.\n\nPositions: \nPosition1: S (new)\nPosition2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)\nPosition3: R (not position2, so good)\nPosition4: I\nPosition5: F\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nWe might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.\n\n""STIRE"" invalid.\n\n""BOIRE"" not common.\n\nAnother option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.\n\nWe can try ""RISEN"": has S and N?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- F: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don't know their correct positions.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.
3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.

Now, for the next guess, we want to:
- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven't tried for each.
- For R: we haven't tried positions 1, 4, 5.
- For E: we haven't tried positions 1, 3, 4.

But note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.

Possible combinations for R and E positions:
- R in 1, E in 3
- R in 1, E in 4
- R in 4, E in 1
- R in 4, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 1
- R in 5, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We'll consider the positions:

Option: R in position 1, E in position 3.
Then the word would be: R _ E _ _
We need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.

For example: R O E L T? But that's not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.

Common words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.

But we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.

Example: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.

""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.

""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.

""ROTED"" not a word.

""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.

This is difficult.

Option: R in position 1, E in position 4.
Word: R _ _ E _
Examples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try.

But we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.

""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R's? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It's messy.

Another word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R's.

""RODEO"" no E.

""RACED"" has A and C, absent.

""RIPED"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" no E.

""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.

""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R's.

But we can try a word without duplicate R? 

""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.

""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that's a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That's what we want. And R at1.

So ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? 

Alternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that's a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.

But in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That's one of the options.

Similarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.

""UREMI"" not a word.

""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.

""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.

""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That's another option: R in 5 and E in 4.

But in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that's a valid word.

Similarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E's? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don't know if the secret word has two E's? But we can try.

But let's list possible words we can use:

Option 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)
Option 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can't find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.

Option 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ 
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E's? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.

""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.

""BEVER"" not a word.

""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _

Examples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. 

""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.

""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.

But in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.

""ARMER"" has A.

I'm having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.

Option: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E's? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. So it's possible.

""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.

""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That's one of the options.

""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.

Letters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".

Similarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? 

""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

""AXLER"" not a word.

""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.

""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.

""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

We need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R

""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.

""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That's an option.

But ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.

But it's a valid word.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.

""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.

In ""THERE"", position5 is E? That's not allowed? So we cannot use that.

Similarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.

""BEVER"" not a word.

So, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:

1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.
2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? But it's possible.
3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.

But in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven't tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.

But in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that's okay.

But to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don't have duplicates.

""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.

""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.

""EMBER"" has duplicate E.

So let's avoid duplicates for now? 

Now, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? 

Common letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. 

B is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.

But both are reasonable.

We can also consider other words.

Another option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let's try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.

""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.

""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.

Not E at3.

I think it's hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.

So let's go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".

But we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn't find a common word.

Similarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.

So, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.

But let's check the positions for R and E we are testing:

In ""ROBED"":
- R at position 1: we haven't tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.
- E at position4: we haven't tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Also, we test O, B, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven't tried R at5? And E at4 is new.

But in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.

I think both are fine. Let's pick ""ROBED"".

But note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don't know.

Another word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That's also a word? Yes. And P is common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.

Similarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.

But ""ROPED"" is valid.

So we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.

I think ""ROBED"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.

Is there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?

For example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.

""ROTED"" not valid.

""RUTED"" not common.

""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That's a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it's okay.

But ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.

I think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.

But to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.

""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.

So I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ROBED"".

But let's confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven't tried these positions? Yes.

So next guess: ""ROBED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include R and E to test new positions:
  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).
  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).
- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ROBED**:
  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).
  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.
- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.

<guess>ROBED</guess>",ROBED,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- F: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don't know their correct positions.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.
3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.

Now, for the next guess, we want to:
- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven't tried for each.
- For R: we haven't tried positions 1, 4, 5.
- For E: we haven't tried positions 1, 3, 4.

But note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.

Possible combinations for R and E positions:
- R in 1, E in 3
- R in 1, E in 4
- R in 4, E in 1
- R in 4, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 1
- R in 5, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We'll consider the positions:

Option: R in position 1, E in position 3.
Then the word would be: R _ E _ _
We need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.

For example: R O E L T? But that's not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.

Common words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.

But we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.

Example: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.

""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.

""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.

""ROTED"" not a word.

""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.

This is difficult.

Option: R in position 1, E in position 4.
Word: R _ _ E _
Examples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try.

But we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.

""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R's? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It's messy.

Another word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R's.

""RODEO"" no E.

""RACED"" has A and C, absent.

""RIPED"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" no E.

""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.

""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R's.

But we can try a word without duplicate R? 

""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.

""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that's a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That's what we want. And R at1.

So ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? 

Alternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that's a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.

But in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That's one of the options.

Similarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.

""UREMI"" not a word.

""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.

""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.

""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That's another option: R in 5 and E in 4.

But in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that's a valid word.

Similarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E's? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don't know if the secret word has two E's? But we can try.

But let's list possible words we can use:

Option 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)
Option 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can't find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.

Option 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ 
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E's? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.

""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.

""BEVER"" not a word.

""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _

Examples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. 

""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.

""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.

But in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.

""ARMER"" has A.

I'm having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.

Option: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E's? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. So it's possible.

""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.

""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That's one of the options.

""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.

Letters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".

Similarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? 

""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

""AXLER"" not a word.

""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.

""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.

""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

We need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R

""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.

""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That's an option.

But ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.

But it's a valid word.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.

""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.

In ""THERE"", position5 is E? That's not allowed? So we cannot use that.

Similarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.

""BEVER"" not a word.

So, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:

1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.
2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? But it's possible.
3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.

But in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven't tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.

But in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that's okay.

But to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don't have duplicates.

""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.

""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.

""EMBER"" has duplicate E.

So let's avoid duplicates for now? 

Now, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? 

Common letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. 

B is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.

But both are reasonable.

We can also consider other words.

Another option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let's try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.

""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.

""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.

Not E at3.

I think it's hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.

So let's go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".

But we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn't find a common word.

Similarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.

So, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.

But let's check the positions for R and E we are testing:

In ""ROBED"":
- R at position 1: we haven't tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.
- E at position4: we haven't tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Also, we test O, B, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven't tried R at5? And E at4 is new.

But in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.

I think both are fine. Let's pick ""ROBED"".

But note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don't know.

Another word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That's also a word? Yes. And P is common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.

Similarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.

But ""ROPED"" is valid.

So we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.

I think ""ROBED"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.

Is there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?

For example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.

""ROTED"" not valid.

""RUTED"" not common.

""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That's a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it's okay.

But ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.

I think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.

But to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.

""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.

So I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ROBED"".

But let's confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven't tried these positions? Yes.

So next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include R and E to test new positions:
  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).
  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).
- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ROBED**:
  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).
  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.
- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.",Guess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 Another is ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the profit from something, though less common) but let's stick with more common words.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters and has been a popular starting word in Wordle.

 Let me explain: 
   S, L, T are common consonants; A, E are vowels.

 However, note that we can also use ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Since it's the first guess, it's somewhat arbitrary. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" might be better because S and E are also common. But let's try ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". So we must choose a valid word.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, wait: the example used BRISK, BRAVE, etc. so we don't know the secret word yet.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.For the first guess, I chose a common starting word that includes frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that R and E are present in the word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.
   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.
   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.
2. Avoid C, A, and N.

Additionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.

We have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints for next guess:
- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don't know what it is.
- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don't have to avoid a letter if it's not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.
- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have three letters we haven't tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

One common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.

Consider including S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:

We need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.

So R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn't restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that's acceptable as long as it's not position 2.

Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5.

Now, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don't know about others.

Idea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.

Some words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:

Examples: 
- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

So, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

Another example: ""RESET"" - has two E's? But we don't know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.

But note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn't tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.

But also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don't have information about that.

Similarly for R.

To avoid complications, let's stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.

Better: let's choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Possible word: ""STORE""
- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.

""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.

""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that's bad.

""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it's not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.

So let's list positions for R and E:
R: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5
E: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4

We also want to test new letters.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let's see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.

""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.
- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). 
- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. 
- Avoids C, A, N.

Is PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.

We get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.

But wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.

We can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.

""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.

""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.

""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.

""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.

""STIRE"" is not valid. 

""PIERT""? Not common.

""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.

""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.

""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.

""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn't have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it's better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? 

However, in Wordle, you don't have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that's not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.

So words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words:

- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E's. But we don't care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that's allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don't know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that's new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that's fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E's and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.

However, position 2: we put E. We don't know if that's valid? We don't have any information about position 2.

But we also have R at position 1: which we haven't tried.

But ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.

But let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.

""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.

""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.

""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.

Other words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.

Let me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That's allowed.

Example: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.

But note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it's allowed.

Also, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.

But we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.

Better: let's include S and T.

""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.

Is ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.

Positions: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)
Position3: R (not position2, so good)
Position4: I
Position5: F

This seems efficient.

We might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.

""STIRE"" invalid.

""BOIRE"" not common.

Another option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.

We can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.

""RIPED"": not a common word.

""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but I think we should.

But if we don't include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won't get information on R's position.

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.

Alternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. 
- E at position2? which we haven't tried. 
- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.

In ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.

So both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.

But let me compare:

""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That's a new position.

In ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.

So both are good.

But ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.

Similarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.

But S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.

But anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.

Let me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.

""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.

So, okay.

I think ""PERIL"" is also good.

But to decide: let's see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.

We know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.

We might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.

But I don't think it matters much.

Alternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

So I'll go with ""SERIF"".

Wait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don't know.

Similarly for R at3.

But we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.

""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.

So, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.

Therefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.
- Avoid using C, A, and N.
- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).
- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

A strong choice is ""SERIF"":
- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.
- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).
- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.
- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.

This guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.

<guess>SERIF</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- F: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don't know their correct positions.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.
3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.

Now, for the next guess, we want to:
- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven't tried for each.
- For R: we haven't tried positions 1, 4, 5.
- For E: we haven't tried positions 1, 3, 4.

But note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.

Possible combinations for R and E positions:
- R in 1, E in 3
- R in 1, E in 4
- R in 4, E in 1
- R in 4, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 1
- R in 5, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We'll consider the positions:

Option: R in position 1, E in position 3.
Then the word would be: R _ E _ _
We need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.

For example: R O E L T? But that's not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.

Common words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.

But we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.

Example: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.

""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.

""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.

""ROTED"" not a word.

""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.

This is difficult.

Option: R in position 1, E in position 4.
Word: R _ _ E _
Examples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try.

But we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.

""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R's? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It's messy.

Another word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R's.

""RODEO"" no E.

""RACED"" has A and C, absent.

""RIPED"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" no E.

""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.

""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R's.

But we can try a word without duplicate R? 

""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.

""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that's a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That's what we want. And R at1.

So ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? 

Alternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that's a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.

But in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That's one of the options.

Similarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.

""UREMI"" not a word.

""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.

""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.

""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That's another option: R in 5 and E in 4.

But in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that's a valid word.

Similarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E's? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don't know if the secret word has two E's? But we can try.

But let's list possible words we can use:

Option 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)
Option 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can't find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.

Option 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ 
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E's? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.

""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.

""BEVER"" not a word.

""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _

Examples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. 

""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.

""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.

But in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.

""ARMER"" has A.

I'm having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.

Option: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E's? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. So it's possible.

""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.

""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That's one of the options.

""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.

Letters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".

Similarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? 

""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

""AXLER"" not a word.

""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.

""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.

""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

We need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R

""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.

""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That's an option.

But ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.

But it's a valid word.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.

""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.

In ""THERE"", position5 is E? That's not allowed? So we cannot use that.

Similarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.

""BEVER"" not a word.

So, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:

1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.
2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? But it's possible.
3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.

But in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven't tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.

But in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that's okay.

But to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don't have duplicates.

""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.

""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.

""EMBER"" has duplicate E.

So let's avoid duplicates for now? 

Now, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? 

Common letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. 

B is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.

But both are reasonable.

We can also consider other words.

Another option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let's try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.

""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.

""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.

Not E at3.

I think it's hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.

So let's go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".

But we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn't find a common word.

Similarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.

So, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.

But let's check the positions for R and E we are testing:

In ""ROBED"":
- R at position 1: we haven't tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.
- E at position4: we haven't tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Also, we test O, B, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven't tried R at5? And E at4 is new.

But in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.

I think both are fine. Let's pick ""ROBED"".

But note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don't know.

Another word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That's also a word? Yes. And P is common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.

Similarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.

But ""ROPED"" is valid.

So we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.

I think ""ROBED"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.

Is there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?

For example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.

""ROTED"" not valid.

""RUTED"" not common.

""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That's a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it's okay.

But ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.

I think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.

But to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.

""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.

So I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ROBED"".

But let's confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven't tried these positions? Yes.

So next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include R and E to test new positions:
  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).
  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).
- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ROBED**:
  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).
  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.
- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.

Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.\n\nWe have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints for next guess:\n- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don\'t know what it is.\n- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don\'t have to avoid a letter if it\'s not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.\n- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have three letters we haven\'t tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\nOne common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.\n\nConsider including S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.\n\nSo R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn\'t restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that\'s acceptable as long as it\'s not position 2.\n\nSimilarly, E must be in a position other than 5.\n\nNow, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don\'t know about others.\n\nIdea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.\n\nSome words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:\n\nExamples: \n- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.\n\nTherefore, avoid E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\nSo, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nAnother example: ""RESET"" - has two E\'s? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn\'t tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.\n\nBut also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don\'t have information about that.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nTo avoid complications, let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.\n\nBetter: let\'s choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""STORE""\n- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.\n\n""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.\n\n""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that\'s bad.\n\n""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it\'s not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.\n\nSo let\'s list positions for R and E:\nR: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5\nE: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let\'s see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.\n\n""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.\n- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). \n- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. \n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\nIs PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.\n\nWe get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.\n\nBut wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.\n\nWe can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.\n\n""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.\n\n""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.\n\n""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.\n\n""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.\n\n""STIRE"" is not valid. \n\n""PIERT""? Not common.\n\n""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.\n\n""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.\n\n""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn\'t have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it\'s better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? \n\nHowever, in Wordle, you don\'t have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that\'s not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.\n\nTherefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.\n\nSo words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E\'s. But we don\'t care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that\'s allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don\'t know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that\'s new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that\'s fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E\'s and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.\n\nHowever, position 2: we put E. We don\'t know if that\'s valid? We don\'t have any information about position 2.\n\nBut we also have R at position 1: which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.\n\nBut let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.\n\n""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.\n\n""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.\n\n""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.\n\n""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.\n\nOther words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.\n\nLet me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That\'s allowed.\n\nExample: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it\'s allowed.\n\nAlso, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.\n\nBetter: let\'s include S and T.\n\n""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.\n\nAnother word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.\n\nIs ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.\n\nPositions: \nPosition1: S (new)\nPosition2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)\nPosition3: R (not position2, so good)\nPosition4: I\nPosition5: F\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nWe might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.\n\n""STIRE"" invalid.\n\n""BOIRE"" not common.\n\nAnother option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.\n\nWe can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.\n\n""RIPED"": not a common word.\n\n""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.\n\n""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don\'t have to, but I think we should.\n\nBut if we don\'t include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won\'t get information on R\'s position.\n\nTherefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. \n- E at position2? which we haven\'t tried. \n- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.\n\nIn ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.\n\nSo both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.\n\n""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That\'s a new position.\n\nIn ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.\n\nSo both are good.\n\nBut ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.\n\nSimilarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.\n\nBut S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.\n\nBut anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.\n\nLet me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.\n\n""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.\n\nSo, okay.\n\nI think ""PERIL"" is also good.\n\nBut to decide: let\'s see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.\n\nWe know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.\n\nWe might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.\n\nBut I don\'t think it matters much.\n\nAlternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SERIF"".\n\nWait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for R at3.\n\nBut we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.\n\n""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.\n\nSo, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as \'x\').\n- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.\n- Avoid using C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).\n- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.\n\nA strong choice is ""SERIF"":\n- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.\n- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).\n- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).\n- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.\n- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.\n\n<guess>SERIF</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: SERIF\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- F: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don\'t know their correct positions.\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.\n3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.\n\nAlso, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to:\n- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven\'t tried for each.\n- For R: we haven\'t tried positions 1, 4, 5.\n- For E: we haven\'t tried positions 1, 3, 4.\n\nBut note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.\n\nPossible combinations for R and E positions:\n- R in 1, E in 3\n- R in 1, E in 4\n- R in 4, E in 1\n- R in 4, E in 3\n- R in 5, E in 1\n- R in 5, E in 3\n- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.\n\nWe\'ll consider the positions:\n\nOption: R in position 1, E in position 3.\nThen the word would be: R _ E _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.\n\nFor example: R O E L T? But that\'s not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.\n\nExample: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.\n\n""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.\n\n""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.\n\n""ROTED"" not a word.\n\n""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nOption: R in position 1, E in position 4.\nWord: R _ _ E _\nExamples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.\n\n""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R\'s? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It\'s messy.\n\nAnother word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R\'s.\n\n""RODEO"" no E.\n\n""RACED"" has A and C, absent.\n\n""RIPED"" invalid.\n\n""RUMOR"" no E.\n\n""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.\n\n""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R\'s.\n\nBut we can try a word without duplicate R? \n\n""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.\n\n""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that\'s a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That\'s what we want. And R at1.\n\nSo ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? \n\nAlternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that\'s a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.\n\nBut in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That\'s one of the options.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.\n\n""UREMI"" not a word.\n\n""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.\n\n""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.\n\n""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That\'s another option: R in 5 and E in 4.\n\nBut in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E\'s? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words we can use:\n\nOption 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)\nOption 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can\'t find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.\n\nOption 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ \nWords: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E\'s? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.\n\n""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.\n\n""BEVER"" not a word.\n\n""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _\n\nExamples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. \n\n""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.\n\n""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.\n\nBut in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.\n\n""ARMER"" has A.\n\nI\'m having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.\n\nOption: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E\'s? And we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are two. So it\'s possible.\n\n""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.\n\n""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That\'s one of the options.\n\n""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.\n\nLetters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".\n\nSimilarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R\nWords: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? \n\n""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.\n\n""AXLER"" not a word.\n\n""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.\n\n""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.\n\n""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.\n\nWe need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R\n\n""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.\n\n""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That\'s an option.\n\nBut ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might prefer more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.\n\n""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.\n\nIn ""THERE"", position5 is E? That\'s not allowed? So we cannot use that.\n\nSimilarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.\n\n""BEVER"" not a word.\n\nSo, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:\n\n1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.\n2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But it\'s possible.\n3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.\n\nBut in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven\'t tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.\n\nSimilarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.\n\nBut in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don\'t have duplicates.\n\n""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.\n\n""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.\n\n""EMBER"" has duplicate E.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now? \n\nNow, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. \n\nB is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let\'s try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.\n\n""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.\n\n""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.\n\nNot E at3.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".\n\nBut we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn\'t find a common word.\n\nSimilarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.\n\nSo, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions for R and E we are testing:\n\nIn ""ROBED"":\n- R at position 1: we haven\'t tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.\n- E at position4: we haven\'t tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.\n\nAlso, we test O, B, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven\'t tried R at5? And E at4 is new.\n\nBut in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.\n\nI think both are fine. Let\'s pick ""ROBED"".\n\nBut note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That\'s also a word? Yes. And P is common.\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.\n\nBut ""ROPED"" is valid.\n\nSo we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.\n\nI think ""ROBED"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.\n\nIs there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?\n\nFor example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.\n\n""ROTED"" not valid.\n\n""RUTED"" not common.\n\n""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That\'s a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.\n\nI think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.\n\nBut to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.\n\n""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.\n\nSo I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""ROBED"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven\'t tried these positions? Yes.\n\nSo next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).\n- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Include R and E to test new positions:\n  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).\n  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).\n- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.\n- **Chosen word: ROBED**:\n  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).\n  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).\n  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.\n- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>ROBED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)\nGuess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>

- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 2
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 3
- I: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct position) → O is in the word and in position 2
- B: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in the word and in position 4
- D: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correctly placed letters**:
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED: O is ✓)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED: E is ✓)

   So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

2. **Present letters (but wrong position)**:
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 3? 
     - From CRANE: R not in position 2
     - From SERIF: R not in position 3
     - From ROBED: R not in position 1
     - Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, and positions 1 and 3 are the only ones left? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 4 are fixed as O and E, so R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we have ruled out position 1 and 3? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ROBED (R at1 got -)
        - Position 3: ruled out by SERIF (R at3 got -)
        - Therefore, R must be in position 5.

   But wait, position 5: we haven't tried R at position 5? And it's the only position left? So R must be in position 5.

   However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and the only position left is 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed, and positions 1 and 3 are not available for R (based on feedback). So yes, R must be in position 5.

   Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

   So now we have: _ O _ E R

3. **Absent letters**:
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D are not in the word.

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D.

4. **E is in position 4 (fixed) and we know it's present, so that's confirmed.**

Now, we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.

The secret word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We know the word has exactly these letters: letter1, O, letter3, E, R.

And we know that letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining common letters: We have used: R, O, E, and absent: C,A,N,S,I,F,B,D.

So available letters: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, G, etc.

We have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 3.

We also know that from the first guess, we had E in position 5 (wrong) and now we have E in position 4 (correct). Similarly, R was in wrong positions before, but now we have it in position 5.

For the next guess, we can try to fill in the blanks with common letters.

We must form a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ O _ E R

Possible words:

- We can try to test common letters for position 1 and 3.

For example:
- Position 1: T, then position 3: L -> ""TOLER""? Is that a word? T O L E R -> ""TOLER"" is not a common word? But ""TOLER"" might be accepted? Actually, it's not standard. Let's think of common words.

Common words ending with ""ER"": like ""TIGER"" but I is absent. ""POWER"" has P, O, W, E, R -> so if we put W in position 3? Then ""POWER"" is a word? But we have O in position 2 and E in 4, R in 5? So ""POWER"" would be: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5. That matches the pattern.

Similarly, ""LOWER"": L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""COVER"" has C? Absent.

""MOWER"": M at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

All these have W at position 3.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

We can also have other letters in position 3? For example, ""HOMER"": H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5? That's a word? Yes, meaning a home run or a person.

""BOXER"" has B? Absent.

""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

We can also have position 1 with a vowel? But we have O and E already? The word has two vowels? O and E? So position 1 and 3 are likely consonants? But not necessarily.

For example, ""HOVER"": H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5.

But V is less common.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters? But we have many letters to test? Actually, we only have two positions left? But we don't know the letters? So we can choose a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.

But note: we have only two guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it.

We can also consider that we have the pattern: _ O _ E R

We know the word must be in this form.

We can try ""POWER"" as a guess? But we don't know if P and W are in the word? But if we guess ""POWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and W.

Similarly, we can try ""TOWER"" or ""HOMER"".

But let's see the feedback from previous guesses: we have no information about T, L, M, P, U, etc.

We should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.

But since we have two positions, we can also try to guess a word that tests one of the positions and a common letter.

But we have to fill both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a letter we haven't tested in position 1 and 3.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we can list possible words.

Possible words of the form _ O _ E R:

Common ones:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- POWER: P, O, W, E, R
- MOWER: M, O, W, E, R
- HOMER: H, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: but B absent -> invalid
- JOKER: J, O, K, E, R
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R
- CODER: C absent -> invalid
- LOWER: L, O, W, E, R
- ROVER: R at1? But we have R at5? And we know R is only once? But we don't know. But in ""ROVER"", R is at1 and at5? But we have O at2 and E at4? So ""ROVER"" would be R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5. But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might show one as - and the other as something? But in ROBED, we only have one R? So we don't know.

But in ""ROVER"", if we guess it, we would have R at1 and R at5? But we already know R is in the word? And we are trying to put R at1? But we know from ROBED that R at1 is wrong? So we cannot put R at1? Because we tried and it was - (wrong position). So we must avoid R at1? Similarly, we cannot put R at position 1? So ""ROVER"" is invalid because it has R at1 which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we cannot have R at position 1 or 3? Only position 5 is allowed for R? So in the pattern, position 1 and 3 must be non-R? And we know R is at5? So the word has exactly one R? Or at least one? But we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates? So we assume one R? But we can't be sure? But to be safe, we avoid putting R in positions 1 and 3? Because we know they are wrong? So we only put R at5? So in the word, position 1 and 3 are not R.

Therefore, we can list possible words without the absent letters and without R in 1 or 3? But R is fixed at5? So we don't put R in 1 or 3? So we are good.

Now, back to possible words: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, LOWER, HOVER, etc.

We also have ""GONER"": G, O, N, E, R? But N is absent? So invalid.

""TONER"": T, O, N, E, R? N absent.

""POSER"": P, O, S, E, R? S absent.

So invalid.

Valid: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, LOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, HOVER, COVER (but C absent? no, C is absent), so COVER invalid.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R? V is not absent? So valid.

But V is less common.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M, O, V, E, R.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can try ""TOWER"" because T and W are common? But W is not the most common? T is common.

But we have to decide.

We have two positions: 1 and 3. We can try to test a word that has a common letter in position 1 and a less common in 3? But we don't know.

Since we have limited guesses, we can try a word that might be the solution.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ROBED, we have O and E correct? And R was present but wrong position? So we know the word has O at2, E at4, R at5? And we need letter1 and letter3.

We can also consider that from the first guess, we had R in the word? And now we know it's at5.

For the next guess, we can try ""TOWER"": if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T and W.

Similarly, we can try ""POWER"".

But let's think about the letter in position 3: in many words, it's W, K, V, M, etc.

We can try ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3? Then we test H and M.

But H and M are also common.

To maximize information, we might choose a word with letters that are more common? But we have to pick one.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, CRANE, we had E at5? But now we know E is at4? So that's consistent.

In SERIF, we had E at2? But now we know E is at4? So that's why it was wrong.

Similarly, R was at2 and at3? But now we know it's at5.

For position 1 and 3, we have no information.

I think ""TOWER"" is a good guess because T is a very common starting letter? And W is common in this pattern.

Similarly, ""POWER"" is also common.

But let's choose ""TOWER"".

We can also consider that we have not tested T and W? So if we guess ""TOWER"", and it's wrong, we know about T and W.

But we have only two positions? So if we get feedback that T is correct? Then we know position1 is T? And W is in the word? Or not? Then we can guess the next.

Similarly, if T is not in the word, then we know position1 is not T? And W might be in position3 or not.

But we have to be careful.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But ""TOWER"" has T and W? Both new.

I think it's fine.

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have tested? But we haven't tested any of the available letters? So we have to test.

Another common word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.

""POSER"" has S? Absent.

So I think ""TOWER"" is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: ""TOWER""

But let's write it: T O W E R

Positions: 1-T, 2-O, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R

We know O and E are fixed? So we are testing T at1 and W at3.

If the secret word is ""TOWER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on T and W.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it in 4.

But let's do it.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x) → Absent
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - A (x) → Absent
  - N (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:
  - S (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)
  - I (x) → Absent
  - F (x) → Absent

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is O)
  - B (x) → Absent
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is E)
  - D (x) → Absent

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:
   - Position 2: **O** (from ROBED ✓)
   - Position 4: **E** (from ROBED ✓)
   - The secret word pattern: `_ O _ E _`

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions)**:
   - **R**: 
     - Not in position 1 (ROBED: -), 2 (CRANE: -), or 3 (SERIF: -).
     - Only possible position left is **5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
     - Thus, **R must be in position 5**, making the pattern: `_ O _ E R`

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D (from all feedback).

4. **Remaining Unknowns**:
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.
   - Available letters (not absent or used): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, W (e.g., words like ""TOWER"", ""POWER"", ""HOMER"").

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word is now `_ O _ E R`.
- We need to test letters for positions 1 and 3.
- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits the pattern and tests high-frequency letters (e.g., T, W, P, M) to maximize information or solve.
- **Chosen word: ""TOWER""**:
  - T (position 1): Tests a common starting letter.
  - W (position 3): Tests a common letter in the middle.
  - O, E, R: Confirmed positions (O at 2, E at 4, R at 5).
- If ""TOWER"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on T and W will reveal their status (e.g., if T is absent/present, or W is absent/present), narrowing down the solution.

<guess>TOWER</guess>",TOWER,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 2
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 5

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 2
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 3
- I: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct position) → O is in the word and in position 2
- B: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in the word and in position 4
- D: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correctly placed letters**:
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED: O is ✓)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED: E is ✓)

   So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

2. **Present letters (but wrong position)**:
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 3? 
     - From CRANE: R not in position 2
     - From SERIF: R not in position 3
     - From ROBED: R not in position 1
     - Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, and positions 1 and 3 are the only ones left? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 4 are fixed as O and E, so R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we have ruled out position 1 and 3? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ROBED (R at1 got -)
        - Position 3: ruled out by SERIF (R at3 got -)
        - Therefore, R must be in position 5.

   But wait, position 5: we haven't tried R at position 5? And it's the only position left? So R must be in position 5.

   However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and the only position left is 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed, and positions 1 and 3 are not available for R (based on feedback). So yes, R must be in position 5.

   Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

   So now we have: _ O _ E R

3. **Absent letters**:
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D are not in the word.

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D.

4. **E is in position 4 (fixed) and we know it's present, so that's confirmed.**

Now, we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.

The secret word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We know the word has exactly these letters: letter1, O, letter3, E, R.

And we know that letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining common letters: We have used: R, O, E, and absent: C,A,N,S,I,F,B,D.

So available letters: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, G, etc.

We have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 3.

We also know that from the first guess, we had E in position 5 (wrong) and now we have E in position 4 (correct). Similarly, R was in wrong positions before, but now we have it in position 5.

For the next guess, we can try to fill in the blanks with common letters.

We must form a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ O _ E R

Possible words:

- We can try to test common letters for position 1 and 3.

For example:
- Position 1: T, then position 3: L -> ""TOLER""? Is that a word? T O L E R -> ""TOLER"" is not a common word? But ""TOLER"" might be accepted? Actually, it's not standard. Let's think of common words.

Common words ending with ""ER"": like ""TIGER"" but I is absent. ""POWER"" has P, O, W, E, R -> so if we put W in position 3? Then ""POWER"" is a word? But we have O in position 2 and E in 4, R in 5? So ""POWER"" would be: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5. That matches the pattern.

Similarly, ""LOWER"": L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""COVER"" has C? Absent.

""MOWER"": M at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

All these have W at position 3.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

We can also have other letters in position 3? For example, ""HOMER"": H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5? That's a word? Yes, meaning a home run or a person.

""BOXER"" has B? Absent.

""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

We can also have position 1 with a vowel? But we have O and E already? The word has two vowels? O and E? So position 1 and 3 are likely consonants? But not necessarily.

For example, ""HOVER"": H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5.

But V is less common.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters? But we have many letters to test? Actually, we only have two positions left? But we don't know the letters? So we can choose a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.

But note: we have only two guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it.

We can also consider that we have the pattern: _ O _ E R

We know the word must be in this form.

We can try ""POWER"" as a guess? But we don't know if P and W are in the word? But if we guess ""POWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and W.

Similarly, we can try ""TOWER"" or ""HOMER"".

But let's see the feedback from previous guesses: we have no information about T, L, M, P, U, etc.

We should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.

But since we have two positions, we can also try to guess a word that tests one of the positions and a common letter.

But we have to fill both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a letter we haven't tested in position 1 and 3.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we can list possible words.

Possible words of the form _ O _ E R:

Common ones:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- POWER: P, O, W, E, R
- MOWER: M, O, W, E, R
- HOMER: H, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: but B absent -> invalid
- JOKER: J, O, K, E, R
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R
- CODER: C absent -> invalid
- LOWER: L, O, W, E, R
- ROVER: R at1? But we have R at5? And we know R is only once? But we don't know. But in ""ROVER"", R is at1 and at5? But we have O at2 and E at4? So ""ROVER"" would be R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5. But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might show one as - and the other as something? But in ROBED, we only have one R? So we don't know.

But in ""ROVER"", if we guess it, we would have R at1 and R at5? But we already know R is in the word? And we are trying to put R at1? But we know from ROBED that R at1 is wrong? So we cannot put R at1? Because we tried and it was - (wrong position). So we must avoid R at1? Similarly, we cannot put R at position 1? So ""ROVER"" is invalid because it has R at1 which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we cannot have R at position 1 or 3? Only position 5 is allowed for R? So in the pattern, position 1 and 3 must be non-R? And we know R is at5? So the word has exactly one R? Or at least one? But we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates? So we assume one R? But we can't be sure? But to be safe, we avoid putting R in positions 1 and 3? Because we know they are wrong? So we only put R at5? So in the word, position 1 and 3 are not R.

Therefore, we can list possible words without the absent letters and without R in 1 or 3? But R is fixed at5? So we don't put R in 1 or 3? So we are good.

Now, back to possible words: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, LOWER, HOVER, etc.

We also have ""GONER"": G, O, N, E, R? But N is absent? So invalid.

""TONER"": T, O, N, E, R? N absent.

""POSER"": P, O, S, E, R? S absent.

So invalid.

Valid: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, LOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, HOVER, COVER (but C absent? no, C is absent), so COVER invalid.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R? V is not absent? So valid.

But V is less common.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M, O, V, E, R.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can try ""TOWER"" because T and W are common? But W is not the most common? T is common.

But we have to decide.

We have two positions: 1 and 3. We can try to test a word that has a common letter in position 1 and a less common in 3? But we don't know.

Since we have limited guesses, we can try a word that might be the solution.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ROBED, we have O and E correct? And R was present but wrong position? So we know the word has O at2, E at4, R at5? And we need letter1 and letter3.

We can also consider that from the first guess, we had R in the word? And now we know it's at5.

For the next guess, we can try ""TOWER"": if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T and W.

Similarly, we can try ""POWER"".

But let's think about the letter in position 3: in many words, it's W, K, V, M, etc.

We can try ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3? Then we test H and M.

But H and M are also common.

To maximize information, we might choose a word with letters that are more common? But we have to pick one.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, CRANE, we had E at5? But now we know E is at4? So that's consistent.

In SERIF, we had E at2? But now we know E is at4? So that's why it was wrong.

Similarly, R was at2 and at3? But now we know it's at5.

For position 1 and 3, we have no information.

I think ""TOWER"" is a good guess because T is a very common starting letter? And W is common in this pattern.

Similarly, ""POWER"" is also common.

But let's choose ""TOWER"".

We can also consider that we have not tested T and W? So if we guess ""TOWER"", and it's wrong, we know about T and W.

But we have only two positions? So if we get feedback that T is correct? Then we know position1 is T? And W is in the word? Or not? Then we can guess the next.

Similarly, if T is not in the word, then we know position1 is not T? And W might be in position3 or not.

But we have to be careful.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But ""TOWER"" has T and W? Both new.

I think it's fine.

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have tested? But we haven't tested any of the available letters? So we have to test.

Another common word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.

""POSER"" has S? Absent.

So I think ""TOWER"" is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: ""TOWER""

But let's write it: T O W E R

Positions: 1-T, 2-O, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R

We know O and E are fixed? So we are testing T at1 and W at3.

If the secret word is ""TOWER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on T and W.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it in 4.

But let's do it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x) → Absent
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - A (x) → Absent
  - N (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:
  - S (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)
  - I (x) → Absent
  - F (x) → Absent

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is O)
  - B (x) → Absent
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is E)
  - D (x) → Absent

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:
   - Position 2: **O** (from ROBED ✓)
   - Position 4: **E** (from ROBED ✓)
   - The secret word pattern: `_ O _ E _`

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions)**:
   - **R**: 
     - Not in position 1 (ROBED: -), 2 (CRANE: -), or 3 (SERIF: -).
     - Only possible position left is **5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
     - Thus, **R must be in position 5**, making the pattern: `_ O _ E R`

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D (from all feedback).

4. **Remaining Unknowns**:
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.
   - Available letters (not absent or used): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, W (e.g., words like ""TOWER"", ""POWER"", ""HOMER"").

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word is now `_ O _ E R`.
- We need to test letters for positions 1 and 3.
- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits the pattern and tests high-frequency letters (e.g., T, W, P, M) to maximize information or solve.
- **Chosen word: ""TOWER""**:
  - T (position 1): Tests a common starting letter.
  - W (position 3): Tests a common letter in the middle.
  - O, E, R: Confirmed positions (O at 2, E at 4, R at 5).
- If ""TOWER"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on T and W will reveal their status (e.g., if T is absent/present, or W is absent/present), narrowing down the solution.",Guess 4: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 Another is ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the profit from something, though less common) but let's stick with more common words.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters and has been a popular starting word in Wordle.

 Let me explain: 
   S, L, T are common consonants; A, E are vowels.

 However, note that we can also use ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Since it's the first guess, it's somewhat arbitrary. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" might be better because S and E are also common. But let's try ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". So we must choose a valid word.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, wait: the example used BRISK, BRAVE, etc. so we don't know the secret word yet.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.For the first guess, I chose a common starting word that includes frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that R and E are present in the word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.
   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.
   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.
2. Avoid C, A, and N.

Additionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.

We have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints for next guess:
- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don't know what it is.
- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don't have to avoid a letter if it's not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.
- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have three letters we haven't tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

One common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.

Consider including S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:

We need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.

So R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn't restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that's acceptable as long as it's not position 2.

Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5.

Now, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don't know about others.

Idea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.

Some words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:

Examples: 
- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

So, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

Another example: ""RESET"" - has two E's? But we don't know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.

But note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn't tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.

But also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don't have information about that.

Similarly for R.

To avoid complications, let's stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.

Better: let's choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Possible word: ""STORE""
- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.

""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.

""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that's bad.

""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it's not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.

So let's list positions for R and E:
R: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5
E: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4

We also want to test new letters.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let's see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.

""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.
- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). 
- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. 
- Avoids C, A, N.

Is PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.

We get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.

But wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.

We can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.

""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.

""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.

""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.

""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.

""STIRE"" is not valid. 

""PIERT""? Not common.

""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.

""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.

""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.

""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn't have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it's better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? 

However, in Wordle, you don't have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that's not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.

So words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words:

- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E's. But we don't care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that's allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don't know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that's new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that's fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E's and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.

However, position 2: we put E. We don't know if that's valid? We don't have any information about position 2.

But we also have R at position 1: which we haven't tried.

But ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.

But let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.

""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.

""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.

""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.

Other words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.

Let me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That's allowed.

Example: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.

But note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it's allowed.

Also, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.

But we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.

Better: let's include S and T.

""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.

Is ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.

Positions: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)
Position3: R (not position2, so good)
Position4: I
Position5: F

This seems efficient.

We might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.

""STIRE"" invalid.

""BOIRE"" not common.

Another option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.

We can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.

""RIPED"": not a common word.

""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but I think we should.

But if we don't include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won't get information on R's position.

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.

Alternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. 
- E at position2? which we haven't tried. 
- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.

In ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.

So both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.

But let me compare:

""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That's a new position.

In ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.

So both are good.

But ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.

Similarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.

But S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.

But anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.

Let me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.

""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.

So, okay.

I think ""PERIL"" is also good.

But to decide: let's see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.

We know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.

We might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.

But I don't think it matters much.

Alternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

So I'll go with ""SERIF"".

Wait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don't know.

Similarly for R at3.

But we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.

""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.

So, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.

Therefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.
- Avoid using C, A, and N.
- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).
- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

A strong choice is ""SERIF"":
- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.
- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).
- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.
- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.

This guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.

<guess>SERIF</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- F: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don't know their correct positions.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.
3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.

Now, for the next guess, we want to:
- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven't tried for each.
- For R: we haven't tried positions 1, 4, 5.
- For E: we haven't tried positions 1, 3, 4.

But note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.

Possible combinations for R and E positions:
- R in 1, E in 3
- R in 1, E in 4
- R in 4, E in 1
- R in 4, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 1
- R in 5, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We'll consider the positions:

Option: R in position 1, E in position 3.
Then the word would be: R _ E _ _
We need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.

For example: R O E L T? But that's not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.

Common words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.

But we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.

Example: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.

""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.

""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.

""ROTED"" not a word.

""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.

This is difficult.

Option: R in position 1, E in position 4.
Word: R _ _ E _
Examples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try.

But we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.

""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R's? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It's messy.

Another word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R's.

""RODEO"" no E.

""RACED"" has A and C, absent.

""RIPED"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" no E.

""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.

""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R's.

But we can try a word without duplicate R? 

""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.

""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that's a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That's what we want. And R at1.

So ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? 

Alternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that's a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.

But in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That's one of the options.

Similarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.

""UREMI"" not a word.

""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.

""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.

""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That's another option: R in 5 and E in 4.

But in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that's a valid word.

Similarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E's? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don't know if the secret word has two E's? But we can try.

But let's list possible words we can use:

Option 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)
Option 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can't find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.

Option 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ 
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E's? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.

""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.

""BEVER"" not a word.

""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _

Examples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. 

""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.

""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.

But in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.

""ARMER"" has A.

I'm having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.

Option: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E's? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. So it's possible.

""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.

""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That's one of the options.

""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.

Letters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".

Similarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? 

""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

""AXLER"" not a word.

""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.

""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.

""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

We need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R

""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.

""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That's an option.

But ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.

But it's a valid word.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.

""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.

In ""THERE"", position5 is E? That's not allowed? So we cannot use that.

Similarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.

""BEVER"" not a word.

So, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:

1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.
2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? But it's possible.
3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.

But in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven't tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.

But in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that's okay.

But to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don't have duplicates.

""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.

""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.

""EMBER"" has duplicate E.

So let's avoid duplicates for now? 

Now, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? 

Common letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. 

B is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.

But both are reasonable.

We can also consider other words.

Another option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let's try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.

""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.

""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.

Not E at3.

I think it's hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.

So let's go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".

But we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn't find a common word.

Similarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.

So, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.

But let's check the positions for R and E we are testing:

In ""ROBED"":
- R at position 1: we haven't tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.
- E at position4: we haven't tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Also, we test O, B, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven't tried R at5? And E at4 is new.

But in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.

I think both are fine. Let's pick ""ROBED"".

But note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don't know.

Another word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That's also a word? Yes. And P is common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.

Similarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.

But ""ROPED"" is valid.

So we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.

I think ""ROBED"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.

Is there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?

For example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.

""ROTED"" not valid.

""RUTED"" not common.

""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That's a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it's okay.

But ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.

I think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.

But to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.

""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.

So I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ROBED"".

But let's confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven't tried these positions? Yes.

So next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include R and E to test new positions:
  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).
  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).
- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ROBED**:
  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).
  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.
- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.

<guess>ROBED</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)
Guess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 2
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 5

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 2
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 3
- I: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct position) → O is in the word and in position 2
- B: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in the word and in position 4
- D: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correctly placed letters**:
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED: O is ✓)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED: E is ✓)

   So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

2. **Present letters (but wrong position)**:
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 3? 
     - From CRANE: R not in position 2
     - From SERIF: R not in position 3
     - From ROBED: R not in position 1
     - Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, and positions 1 and 3 are the only ones left? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 4 are fixed as O and E, so R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we have ruled out position 1 and 3? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ROBED (R at1 got -)
        - Position 3: ruled out by SERIF (R at3 got -)
        - Therefore, R must be in position 5.

   But wait, position 5: we haven't tried R at position 5? And it's the only position left? So R must be in position 5.

   However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and the only position left is 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed, and positions 1 and 3 are not available for R (based on feedback). So yes, R must be in position 5.

   Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

   So now we have: _ O _ E R

3. **Absent letters**:
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D are not in the word.

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D.

4. **E is in position 4 (fixed) and we know it's present, so that's confirmed.**

Now, we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.

The secret word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We know the word has exactly these letters: letter1, O, letter3, E, R.

And we know that letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining common letters: We have used: R, O, E, and absent: C,A,N,S,I,F,B,D.

So available letters: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, G, etc.

We have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 3.

We also know that from the first guess, we had E in position 5 (wrong) and now we have E in position 4 (correct). Similarly, R was in wrong positions before, but now we have it in position 5.

For the next guess, we can try to fill in the blanks with common letters.

We must form a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ O _ E R

Possible words:

- We can try to test common letters for position 1 and 3.

For example:
- Position 1: T, then position 3: L -> ""TOLER""? Is that a word? T O L E R -> ""TOLER"" is not a common word? But ""TOLER"" might be accepted? Actually, it's not standard. Let's think of common words.

Common words ending with ""ER"": like ""TIGER"" but I is absent. ""POWER"" has P, O, W, E, R -> so if we put W in position 3? Then ""POWER"" is a word? But we have O in position 2 and E in 4, R in 5? So ""POWER"" would be: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5. That matches the pattern.

Similarly, ""LOWER"": L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""COVER"" has C? Absent.

""MOWER"": M at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

All these have W at position 3.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

We can also have other letters in position 3? For example, ""HOMER"": H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5? That's a word? Yes, meaning a home run or a person.

""BOXER"" has B? Absent.

""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

We can also have position 1 with a vowel? But we have O and E already? The word has two vowels? O and E? So position 1 and 3 are likely consonants? But not necessarily.

For example, ""HOVER"": H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5.

But V is less common.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters? But we have many letters to test? Actually, we only have two positions left? But we don't know the letters? So we can choose a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.

But note: we have only two guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it.

We can also consider that we have the pattern: _ O _ E R

We know the word must be in this form.

We can try ""POWER"" as a guess? But we don't know if P and W are in the word? But if we guess ""POWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and W.

Similarly, we can try ""TOWER"" or ""HOMER"".

But let's see the feedback from previous guesses: we have no information about T, L, M, P, U, etc.

We should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.

But since we have two positions, we can also try to guess a word that tests one of the positions and a common letter.

But we have to fill both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a letter we haven't tested in position 1 and 3.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we can list possible words.

Possible words of the form _ O _ E R:

Common ones:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- POWER: P, O, W, E, R
- MOWER: M, O, W, E, R
- HOMER: H, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: but B absent -> invalid
- JOKER: J, O, K, E, R
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R
- CODER: C absent -> invalid
- LOWER: L, O, W, E, R
- ROVER: R at1? But we have R at5? And we know R is only once? But we don't know. But in ""ROVER"", R is at1 and at5? But we have O at2 and E at4? So ""ROVER"" would be R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5. But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might show one as - and the other as something? But in ROBED, we only have one R? So we don't know.

But in ""ROVER"", if we guess it, we would have R at1 and R at5? But we already know R is in the word? And we are trying to put R at1? But we know from ROBED that R at1 is wrong? So we cannot put R at1? Because we tried and it was - (wrong position). So we must avoid R at1? Similarly, we cannot put R at position 1? So ""ROVER"" is invalid because it has R at1 which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we cannot have R at position 1 or 3? Only position 5 is allowed for R? So in the pattern, position 1 and 3 must be non-R? And we know R is at5? So the word has exactly one R? Or at least one? But we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates? So we assume one R? But we can't be sure? But to be safe, we avoid putting R in positions 1 and 3? Because we know they are wrong? So we only put R at5? So in the word, position 1 and 3 are not R.

Therefore, we can list possible words without the absent letters and without R in 1 or 3? But R is fixed at5? So we don't put R in 1 or 3? So we are good.

Now, back to possible words: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, LOWER, HOVER, etc.

We also have ""GONER"": G, O, N, E, R? But N is absent? So invalid.

""TONER"": T, O, N, E, R? N absent.

""POSER"": P, O, S, E, R? S absent.

So invalid.

Valid: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, LOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, HOVER, COVER (but C absent? no, C is absent), so COVER invalid.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R? V is not absent? So valid.

But V is less common.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M, O, V, E, R.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can try ""TOWER"" because T and W are common? But W is not the most common? T is common.

But we have to decide.

We have two positions: 1 and 3. We can try to test a word that has a common letter in position 1 and a less common in 3? But we don't know.

Since we have limited guesses, we can try a word that might be the solution.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ROBED, we have O and E correct? And R was present but wrong position? So we know the word has O at2, E at4, R at5? And we need letter1 and letter3.

We can also consider that from the first guess, we had R in the word? And now we know it's at5.

For the next guess, we can try ""TOWER"": if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T and W.

Similarly, we can try ""POWER"".

But let's think about the letter in position 3: in many words, it's W, K, V, M, etc.

We can try ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3? Then we test H and M.

But H and M are also common.

To maximize information, we might choose a word with letters that are more common? But we have to pick one.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, CRANE, we had E at5? But now we know E is at4? So that's consistent.

In SERIF, we had E at2? But now we know E is at4? So that's why it was wrong.

Similarly, R was at2 and at3? But now we know it's at5.

For position 1 and 3, we have no information.

I think ""TOWER"" is a good guess because T is a very common starting letter? And W is common in this pattern.

Similarly, ""POWER"" is also common.

But let's choose ""TOWER"".

We can also consider that we have not tested T and W? So if we guess ""TOWER"", and it's wrong, we know about T and W.

But we have only two positions? So if we get feedback that T is correct? Then we know position1 is T? And W is in the word? Or not? Then we can guess the next.

Similarly, if T is not in the word, then we know position1 is not T? And W might be in position3 or not.

But we have to be careful.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But ""TOWER"" has T and W? Both new.

I think it's fine.

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have tested? But we haven't tested any of the available letters? So we have to test.

Another common word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.

""POSER"" has S? Absent.

So I think ""TOWER"" is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: ""TOWER""

But let's write it: T O W E R

Positions: 1-T, 2-O, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R

We know O and E are fixed? So we are testing T at1 and W at3.

If the secret word is ""TOWER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on T and W.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it in 4.

But let's do it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x) → Absent
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - A (x) → Absent
  - N (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:
  - S (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)
  - I (x) → Absent
  - F (x) → Absent

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is O)
  - B (x) → Absent
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is E)
  - D (x) → Absent

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:
   - Position 2: **O** (from ROBED ✓)
   - Position 4: **E** (from ROBED ✓)
   - The secret word pattern: `_ O _ E _`

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions)**:
   - **R**: 
     - Not in position 1 (ROBED: -), 2 (CRANE: -), or 3 (SERIF: -).
     - Only possible position left is **5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
     - Thus, **R must be in position 5**, making the pattern: `_ O _ E R`

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D (from all feedback).

4. **Remaining Unknowns**:
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.
   - Available letters (not absent or used): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, W (e.g., words like ""TOWER"", ""POWER"", ""HOMER"").

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word is now `_ O _ E R`.
- We need to test letters for positions 1 and 3.
- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits the pattern and tests high-frequency letters (e.g., T, W, P, M) to maximize information or solve.
- **Chosen word: ""TOWER""**:
  - T (position 1): Tests a common starting letter.
  - W (position 3): Tests a common letter in the middle.
  - O, E, R: Confirmed positions (O at 2, E at 4, R at 5).
- If ""TOWER"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on T and W will reveal their status (e.g., if T is absent/present, or W is absent/present), narrowing down the solution.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.\n Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U\n Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.\n\n One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E.\n Another is ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the profit from something, though less common) but let\'s stick with more common words.\n\n After consideration, I\'ll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters and has been a popular starting word in Wordle.\n\n Let me explain: \n   S, L, T are common consonants; A, E are vowels.\n\n However, note that we can also use ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.\n\n Since it\'s the first guess, it\'s somewhat arbitrary. I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" might be better because S and E are also common. But let\'s try ""CRANE"".\n\n But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". So we must choose a valid word.\n\n I\'ll choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\n However, wait: the example used BRISK, BRAVE, etc. so we don\'t know the secret word yet.\n\n Let\'s go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.For the first guess, I chose a common starting word that includes frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").\n- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").\n- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.\n\nWe also know that R and E are present in the word.\n\nOur next guess should:\n1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.\n   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.\n   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.\n2. Avoid C, A, and N.\n\nAdditionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.\n\nWe have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints for next guess:\n- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don\'t know what it is.\n- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don\'t have to avoid a letter if it\'s not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.\n- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have three letters we haven\'t tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\nOne common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.\n\nConsider including S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.\n\nSo R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn\'t restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that\'s acceptable as long as it\'s not position 2.\n\nSimilarly, E must be in a position other than 5.\n\nNow, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don\'t know about others.\n\nIdea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.\n\nSome words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:\n\nExamples: \n- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.\n\nTherefore, avoid E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\nSo, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nAnother example: ""RESET"" - has two E\'s? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn\'t tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.\n\nBut also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don\'t have information about that.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nTo avoid complications, let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.\n\nBetter: let\'s choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""STORE""\n- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.\n\n""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.\n\n""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that\'s bad.\n\n""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it\'s not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.\n\nSo let\'s list positions for R and E:\nR: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5\nE: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let\'s see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.\n\n""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.\n- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). \n- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. \n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\nIs PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.\n\nWe get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.\n\nBut wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.\n\nWe can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.\n\n""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.\n\n""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.\n\n""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.\n\n""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.\n\n""STIRE"" is not valid. \n\n""PIERT""? Not common.\n\n""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.\n\n""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.\n\n""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn\'t have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it\'s better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? \n\nHowever, in Wordle, you don\'t have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that\'s not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.\n\nTherefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.\n\nSo words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E\'s. But we don\'t care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that\'s allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don\'t know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that\'s new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that\'s fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E\'s and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.\n\nHowever, position 2: we put E. We don\'t know if that\'s valid? We don\'t have any information about position 2.\n\nBut we also have R at position 1: which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.\n\nBut let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.\n\n""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.\n\n""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.\n\n""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.\n\n""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.\n\nOther words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.\n\nLet me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That\'s allowed.\n\nExample: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it\'s allowed.\n\nAlso, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.\n\nBetter: let\'s include S and T.\n\n""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.\n\nAnother word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.\n\nIs ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.\n\nPositions: \nPosition1: S (new)\nPosition2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)\nPosition3: R (not position2, so good)\nPosition4: I\nPosition5: F\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nWe might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.\n\n""STIRE"" invalid.\n\n""BOIRE"" not common.\n\nAnother option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.\n\nWe can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.\n\n""RIPED"": not a common word.\n\n""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.\n\n""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don\'t have to, but I think we should.\n\nBut if we don\'t include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won\'t get information on R\'s position.\n\nTherefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. \n- E at position2? which we haven\'t tried. \n- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.\n\nIn ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.\n\nSo both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.\n\n""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That\'s a new position.\n\nIn ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.\n\nSo both are good.\n\nBut ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.\n\nSimilarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.\n\nBut S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.\n\nBut anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.\n\nLet me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.\n\n""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.\n\nSo, okay.\n\nI think ""PERIL"" is also good.\n\nBut to decide: let\'s see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.\n\nWe know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.\n\nWe might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.\n\nBut I don\'t think it matters much.\n\nAlternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SERIF"".\n\nWait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for R at3.\n\nBut we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.\n\n""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.\n\nSo, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as \'x\').\n- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.\n- Avoid using C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).\n- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.\n\nA strong choice is ""SERIF"":\n- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.\n- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).\n- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).\n- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.\n- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.\n\n<guess>SERIF</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: SERIF\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- F: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don\'t know their correct positions.\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.\n3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.\n\nAlso, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to:\n- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven\'t tried for each.\n- For R: we haven\'t tried positions 1, 4, 5.\n- For E: we haven\'t tried positions 1, 3, 4.\n\nBut note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.\n\nPossible combinations for R and E positions:\n- R in 1, E in 3\n- R in 1, E in 4\n- R in 4, E in 1\n- R in 4, E in 3\n- R in 5, E in 1\n- R in 5, E in 3\n- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.\n\nWe\'ll consider the positions:\n\nOption: R in position 1, E in position 3.\nThen the word would be: R _ E _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.\n\nFor example: R O E L T? But that\'s not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.\n\nExample: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.\n\n""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.\n\n""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.\n\n""ROTED"" not a word.\n\n""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nOption: R in position 1, E in position 4.\nWord: R _ _ E _\nExamples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.\n\n""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R\'s? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It\'s messy.\n\nAnother word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R\'s.\n\n""RODEO"" no E.\n\n""RACED"" has A and C, absent.\n\n""RIPED"" invalid.\n\n""RUMOR"" no E.\n\n""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.\n\n""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R\'s.\n\nBut we can try a word without duplicate R? \n\n""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.\n\n""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that\'s a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That\'s what we want. And R at1.\n\nSo ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? \n\nAlternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that\'s a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.\n\nBut in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That\'s one of the options.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.\n\n""UREMI"" not a word.\n\n""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.\n\n""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.\n\n""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That\'s another option: R in 5 and E in 4.\n\nBut in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E\'s? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words we can use:\n\nOption 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)\nOption 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can\'t find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.\n\nOption 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ \nWords: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E\'s? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.\n\n""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.\n\n""BEVER"" not a word.\n\n""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _\n\nExamples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. \n\n""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.\n\n""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.\n\nBut in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.\n\n""ARMER"" has A.\n\nI\'m having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.\n\nOption: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E\'s? And we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are two. So it\'s possible.\n\n""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.\n\n""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That\'s one of the options.\n\n""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.\n\nLetters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".\n\nSimilarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R\nWords: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? \n\n""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.\n\n""AXLER"" not a word.\n\n""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.\n\n""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.\n\n""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.\n\nWe need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R\n\n""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.\n\n""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That\'s an option.\n\nBut ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might prefer more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.\n\n""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.\n\nIn ""THERE"", position5 is E? That\'s not allowed? So we cannot use that.\n\nSimilarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.\n\n""BEVER"" not a word.\n\nSo, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:\n\n1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.\n2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But it\'s possible.\n3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.\n\nBut in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven\'t tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.\n\nSimilarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.\n\nBut in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don\'t have duplicates.\n\n""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.\n\n""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.\n\n""EMBER"" has duplicate E.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now? \n\nNow, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. \n\nB is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let\'s try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.\n\n""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.\n\n""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.\n\nNot E at3.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".\n\nBut we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn\'t find a common word.\n\nSimilarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.\n\nSo, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions for R and E we are testing:\n\nIn ""ROBED"":\n- R at position 1: we haven\'t tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.\n- E at position4: we haven\'t tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.\n\nAlso, we test O, B, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven\'t tried R at5? And E at4 is new.\n\nBut in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.\n\nI think both are fine. Let\'s pick ""ROBED"".\n\nBut note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That\'s also a word? Yes. And P is common.\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.\n\nBut ""ROPED"" is valid.\n\nSo we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.\n\nI think ""ROBED"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.\n\nIs there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?\n\nFor example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.\n\n""ROTED"" not valid.\n\n""RUTED"" not common.\n\n""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That\'s a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.\n\nI think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.\n\nBut to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.\n\n""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.\n\nSo I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""ROBED"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven\'t tried these positions? Yes.\n\nSo next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).\n- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Include R and E to test new positions:\n  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).\n  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).\n- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.\n- **Chosen word: ROBED**:\n  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).\n  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).\n  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.\n- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>ROBED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)\nGuess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 2\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 5\n\nGuess 2: SERIF\n- S: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 2\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 3\n- I: x (not in word)\n- F: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ROBED\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 1\n- O: ✓ (correct position) → O is in the word and in position 2\n- B: x (not in word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in the word and in position 4\n- D: x (not in word)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. **Correctly placed letters**:\n   - Position 2: O (from ROBED: O is ✓)\n   - Position 4: E (from ROBED: E is ✓)\n\n   So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E _\n\n2. **Present letters (but wrong position)**:\n   - R is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 3? \n     - From CRANE: R not in position 2\n     - From SERIF: R not in position 3\n     - From ROBED: R not in position 1\n     - Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, and positions 1 and 3 are the only ones left? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 4 are fixed as O and E, so R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we have ruled out position 1 and 3? \n        - Position 1: ruled out by ROBED (R at1 got -)\n        - Position 3: ruled out by SERIF (R at3 got -)\n        - Therefore, R must be in position 5.\n\n   But wait, position 5: we haven\'t tried R at position 5? And it\'s the only position left? So R must be in position 5.\n\n   However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and the only position left is 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed, and positions 1 and 3 are not available for R (based on feedback). So yes, R must be in position 5.\n\n   Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.\n\n   So now we have: _ O _ E R\n\n3. **Absent letters**:\n   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D are not in the word.\n\n   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D.\n\n4. **E is in position 4 (fixed) and we know it\'s present, so that\'s confirmed.**\n\nNow, we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\nThe secret word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R\n\nWe know the word has exactly these letters: letter1, O, letter3, E, R.\n\nAnd we know that letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.\n\nRemaining common letters: We have used: R, O, E, and absent: C,A,N,S,I,F,B,D.\n\nSo available letters: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, G, etc.\n\nWe have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 3.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we had E in position 5 (wrong) and now we have E in position 4 (correct). Similarly, R was in wrong positions before, but now we have it in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, we can try to fill in the blanks with common letters.\n\nWe must form a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ O _ E R\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We can try to test common letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: T, then position 3: L -> ""TOLER""? Is that a word? T O L E R -> ""TOLER"" is not a common word? But ""TOLER"" might be accepted? Actually, it\'s not standard. Let\'s think of common words.\n\nCommon words ending with ""ER"": like ""TIGER"" but I is absent. ""POWER"" has P, O, W, E, R -> so if we put W in position 3? Then ""POWER"" is a word? But we have O in position 2 and E in 4, R in 5? So ""POWER"" would be: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5. That matches the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""LOWER"": L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""COVER"" has C? Absent.\n\n""MOWER"": M at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nAll these have W at position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W is in the word? We haven\'t tested W.\n\nWe can also have other letters in position 3? For example, ""HOMER"": H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5? That\'s a word? Yes, meaning a home run or a person.\n\n""BOXER"" has B? Absent.\n\n""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nWe can also have position 1 with a vowel? But we have O and E already? The word has two vowels? O and E? So position 1 and 3 are likely consonants? But not necessarily.\n\nFor example, ""HOVER"": H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests new letters? But we have many letters to test? Actually, we only have two positions left? But we don\'t know the letters? So we can choose a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nBut note: we have only two guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it.\n\nWe can also consider that we have the pattern: _ O _ E R\n\nWe know the word must be in this form.\n\nWe can try ""POWER"" as a guess? But we don\'t know if P and W are in the word? But if we guess ""POWER"", and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and W.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""TOWER"" or ""HOMER"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from previous guesses: we have no information about T, L, M, P, U, etc.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.\n\nBut since we have two positions, we can also try to guess a word that tests one of the positions and a common letter.\n\nBut we have to fill both.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a letter we haven\'t tested in position 1 and 3.\n\nBut note: we have many absent letters, so we can list possible words.\n\nPossible words of the form _ O _ E R:\n\nCommon ones:\n- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R\n- POWER: P, O, W, E, R\n- MOWER: M, O, W, E, R\n- HOMER: H, O, M, E, R\n- BOXER: but B absent -> invalid\n- JOKER: J, O, K, E, R\n- POKER: P, O, K, E, R\n- CODER: C absent -> invalid\n- LOWER: L, O, W, E, R\n- ROVER: R at1? But we have R at5? And we know R is only once? But we don\'t know. But in ""ROVER"", R is at1 and at5? But we have O at2 and E at4? So ""ROVER"" would be R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5. But we have two R\'s? And we know R is in the word? But we don\'t know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R\'s, the feedback might show one as - and the other as something? But in ROBED, we only have one R? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""ROVER"", if we guess it, we would have R at1 and R at5? But we already know R is in the word? And we are trying to put R at1? But we know from ROBED that R at1 is wrong? So we cannot put R at1? Because we tried and it was - (wrong position). So we must avoid R at1? Similarly, we cannot put R at position 1? So ""ROVER"" is invalid because it has R at1 which we know is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have R at position 1 or 3? Only position 5 is allowed for R? So in the pattern, position 1 and 3 must be non-R? And we know R is at5? So the word has exactly one R? Or at least one? But we don\'t know about duplicates? But we haven\'t seen evidence of duplicates? So we assume one R? But we can\'t be sure? But to be safe, we avoid putting R in positions 1 and 3? Because we know they are wrong? So we only put R at5? So in the word, position 1 and 3 are not R.\n\nTherefore, we can list possible words without the absent letters and without R in 1 or 3? But R is fixed at5? So we don\'t put R in 1 or 3? So we are good.\n\nNow, back to possible words: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, LOWER, HOVER, etc.\n\nWe also have ""GONER"": G, O, N, E, R? But N is absent? So invalid.\n\n""TONER"": T, O, N, E, R? N absent.\n\n""POSER"": P, O, S, E, R? S absent.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nValid: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, LOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, HOVER, COVER (but C absent? no, C is absent), so COVER invalid.\n\n""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R? V is not absent? So valid.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOVER"": M, O, V, E, R.\n\nNow, we need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe can try ""TOWER"" because T and W are common? But W is not the most common? T is common.\n\nBut we have to decide.\n\nWe have two positions: 1 and 3. We can try to test a word that has a common letter in position 1 and a less common in 3? But we don\'t know.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can try a word that might be the solution.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: in ROBED, we have O and E correct? And R was present but wrong position? So we know the word has O at2, E at4, R at5? And we need letter1 and letter3.\n\nWe can also consider that from the first guess, we had R in the word? And now we know it\'s at5.\n\nFor the next guess, we can try ""TOWER"": if it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T and W.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""POWER"".\n\nBut let\'s think about the letter in position 3: in many words, it\'s W, K, V, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3? Then we test H and M.\n\nBut H and M are also common.\n\nTo maximize information, we might choose a word with letters that are more common? But we have to pick one.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the first guess, CRANE, we had E at5? But now we know E is at4? So that\'s consistent.\n\nIn SERIF, we had E at2? But now we know E is at4? So that\'s why it was wrong.\n\nSimilarly, R was at2 and at3? But now we know it\'s at5.\n\nFor position 1 and 3, we have no information.\n\nI think ""TOWER"" is a good guess because T is a very common starting letter? And W is common in this pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""TOWER"".\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tested T and W? So if we guess ""TOWER"", and it\'s wrong, we know about T and W.\n\nBut we have only two positions? So if we get feedback that T is correct? Then we know position1 is T? And W is in the word? Or not? Then we can guess the next.\n\nSimilarly, if T is not in the word, then we know position1 is not T? And W might be in position3 or not.\n\nBut we have to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But ""TOWER"" has T and W? Both new.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have tested? But we haven\'t tested any of the available letters? So we have to test.\n\nAnother common word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.\n\n""POSER"" has S? Absent.\n\nSo I think ""TOWER"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""TOWER""\n\nBut let\'s write it: T O W E R\n\nPositions: 1-T, 2-O, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R\n\nWe know O and E are fixed? So we are testing T at1 and W at3.\n\nIf the secret word is ""TOWER"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on T and W.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- I: x (absent)
- F: x (absent)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (present, wrong position) → not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- B: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- D: x (absent)

Guess 4: TOWER
- T: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- W: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED and TOWER)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED and TOWER)
   - Position 5: R (from TOWER, since R is now correct at position 5)

   So the secret word is: _ O _ E R

2. **Absent letters:**
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W.

3. **Present letters (but we already have all positions except position 1 and 3):**
   - We know the word has O, E, R in positions 2,4,5, and we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.

   But note: from Guess 1, we had R and E present, which are now placed. Similarly, from Guess 2, E and R present, now placed.

   We have no other present letters indicated? So the secret word has exactly three of the letters we've guessed? But we have positions 1 and 3 to fill, so there must be two more letters.

   Since we have no other present letters in the feedback (all other letters in the guesses were either absent or placed), the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the letters not yet tested? Or from the ones that were not absent? But we have tested many letters.

   The absent letters are: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W.

   So the available letters are: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

   But we need common English letters? So likely: G, H, L, M, P, U, V, Y.

4. **Position 1 and 3:**
   - We need to form a word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

   And we know the word must be a valid English word.

   Possible common words that fit this pattern and use the available letters:

   - HOMER: H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5 → but M is available? And H is available? Yes, not absent.
   - However, in HOMER, we have H and M.

   Other options:
   - LOVER: L at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → L and V available.
   - MOVER: M at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → M and V.
   - HOVER: H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → H and V.
   - JOKER: J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → J and K? But J and K are less common? But valid.
   - POKER: P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → P and K.
   - But note: K is available? Yes.

   However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

   Also, note that in the pattern, position 3 must be a letter that can form a word.

   Since we have limited guesses, we can try ""HOMER"" because it uses common letters? Or ""LOVER""?

   But let's see: we have not tested H, L, M, P, V, etc.

   We can choose one that tests two new common letters.

   Common letters left: L, M, P, U, V, G, etc.

   We can try ""HOMER"": if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on H and M.

   Similarly, ""LOVER"" tests L and V.

   But note: in the feedback for TOWER, we have T and W absent? So we know they are not in the word.

   Now, we have two positions to fill? So we need to guess a word that fits the pattern.

   Since we have only two positions, and we have to find two letters, we can list possible words:

   Possible words of the form ?O?ER:

   - HOMER
   - LOVER
   - MOVER
   - HOVER
   - JOKER
   - POKER
   - COVER → but C absent
   - MOWER → W absent
   - POWER → W absent
   - TOWER → T and W absent
   - BOXER → B absent
   - FOYER → F absent? F is absent? Yes, from SERIF.

   So valid: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, and also ""GONER"" but N absent? N is absent? Yes, from CRANE. ""GONER"" has N? G O N E R → N is absent, so invalid.

   ""POSER"": P O S E R → S absent? Yes, from SERIF. Invalid.

   ""ROVER"": R at1? But we know R is at5? And we cannot have R at1? Because in ROBED, R at1 was wrong? So R cannot be at1? So ""ROVER"" would have R at1 and R at5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might have shown the R at5 as correct? But in ROBED, we didn't have R at5? We had R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5? So D at5? So we don't know about R at5? But now we know R is at5? So if we had ""ROVER"", it would have R at1 and R at5? But we know R at1 is wrong? So we cannot have R at1? Therefore, ""ROVER"" is invalid? Because it would require R at1 which we know is not correct? So we avoid.

   Similarly, ""R"" cannot be at position 1? So we don't consider words with R at1.

   So back to the list: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER.

   Also, ""BOXER"" invalid, ""JOKER"" and ""POKER"" are valid? But J and K are less common? But possible.

   Another one: ""COMET"" doesn't fit pattern? Must end with ER.

   ""DOPER"" has D? Absent.

   ""MOPER"" has M O P E R? But that's M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5? So ""MOPER"" is a word? Yes, meaning one who mopes. And M and P are available.

   Similarly, ""HOPED"" has D? Absent.

   ""COPED"" has C and D? Absent.

   So ""MOPER"" is valid: M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5.

   Similarly, ""HOPES"" has S? Absent.

   So possible words: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, MOPER.

   Now, we need to choose one to guess.

   We can try ""HOMER"" because it's a common word? Or ""LOVER""?

   But to maximize information? Since we have two positions, if we guess and it's wrong, we get feedback on the two letters? Then we can deduce.

   But we have only two guesses left? We have used 4, so we have 2 more? But we want to solve in 5.

   So let's choose a word that uses common letters? H, L, M, P, V.

   We can try ""HOMER"": H at1 and M at3.

   If we guess ""HOMER"" and it's wrong, then:
   - If H is absent, then position1 is not H? And M is absent? Then we know position1 must be L, P, V, etc.? And position3 must be V, P, etc.

   Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"", we test L and V.

   But we don't know which is more likely.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? For example, M appears in HOMER, MOVER, MOPER? So if we test M, it might help.

   Similarly, P appears in POKER and MOPER.

   But we have to choose a word.

   I think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.

   But let's see the feedback from TOWER: we have T and W absent? So we know.

   Another idea: we have not tested the letter U? But in ""HOVER"", we have U? No, ""HOVER"" has H, O, V, E, R? No U.

   ""JOULE"" doesn't fit.

   So I think we go with ""HOMER"".

   Therefore, next guess: ""HOMER""

   But note: in ""HOMER"", we have H at position1 and M at position3? And we know O, E, R are correct? So we are testing H and M.

   If the secret word is ""HOMER"", we win.

   If not, we get feedback on H and M.

   But we have only one guess after that? So we need to be careful? But we have two positions? So if we get feedback that H is absent and M is absent? Then we know position1 is not H, position3 is not M? Then we can try another word? Like ""LOVER"" or ""POKER"".

   But we have to hope that it's one of the common ones.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests a different set? But I think it's fine.

   So I'll go with ""HOMER"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x) → Absent  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  
  - A (x) → Absent  
  - N (x) → Absent  
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)  

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:  
  - S (x) → Absent  
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)  
  - I (x) → Absent  
  - F (x) → Absent  

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)  
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  
  - B (x) → Absent  
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  
  - D (x) → Absent  

- **Guess 4 (TOWER)**:  
  - T (x) → Absent  
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  
  - W (x) → Absent  
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  
  - R (✓) → Correct position (position 5 is **R**)  

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 4: **E**  
   - Position 5: **R**  
   - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.  
   - Available letters (not absent): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
   - Common English words fitting `_ O _ E R` include:  
     - **HOMER** (H at 1, M at 3)  
     - **LOVER** (L at 1, V at 3)  
     - **MOVER** (M at 1, V at 3)  
     - **HOVER** (H at 1, V at 3)  
     - **POKER** (P at 1, K at 3)  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters (e.g., H, M, L, V) to solve or narrow down positions 1 and 3.  
- **Chosen word: ""HOMER""**:  
  - Tests **H** (position 1) and **M** (position 3), both common letters.  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will identify which letter is valid and its position (e.g., if H is absent, position 1 must be L/P/U; if M is absent, position 3 must be V/K/P).  

<guess>HOMER</guess>",HOMER,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE

   - Position 5: R (from TOWER, since R is now correct at position 5)

   So the secret word is: _ O _ E R

2. **Absent letters:**

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W.

   - POKER: P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → P and K.
   - But note: K is available? Yes.

   - MOWER → W absent
   - POWER → W absent
   - TOWER → T and W absent
   - BOXER → B absent
   - FOYER → F absent? F is absent? Yes, from SERIF.

   So valid: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, and also ""GONER"" but N absent? N is absent? Yes, from CRANE. ""GONER"" has N? G O N E R → N is absent, so invalid.

   ""POSER"": P O S E R → S absent? Yes, from SERIF. Invalid.

   ""ROVER"": R at1? But we know R is at5? And we cannot have R at1? Because in ROBED, R at1 was wrong? So R cannot be at1? So ""ROVER"" would have R at1 and R at5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might have shown the R at5 as correct? But in ROBED, we didn't have R at5? We had R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5? So D at5? So we don't know about R at5? But now we know R is at5? So if we had ""ROVER"", it would have R at1 and R at5? But we know R at1 is wrong? So we cannot have R at1? Therefore, ""ROVER"" is invalid? Because it would require R at1 which we know is not correct? So we avoid.

   Similarly, ""R"" cannot be at position 1? So we don't consider words with R at1.

   So back to the list: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER.

   Also, ""BOXER"" invalid, ""JOKER"" and ""POKER"" are valid? But J and K are less common? But possible.

   Another one: ""COMET"" doesn't fit pattern? Must end with ER.

   ""DOPER"" has D? Absent.

   ""MOPER"" has M O P E R? But that's M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5? So ""MOPER"" is a word? Yes, meaning one who mopes. And M and P are available.

   Similarly, ""HOPED"" has D? Absent.

   ""COPED"" has C and D? Absent.

   So ""MOPER"" is valid: M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5.

   Similarly, ""HOPES"" has S? Absent.

   So possible words: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, MOPER.

   Now, we need to choose one to guess.

   We can try ""HOMER"" because it's a common word? Or ""LOVER""?

   But to maximize information? Since we have two positions, if we guess and it's wrong, we get feedback on the two letters? Then we can deduce.

   ""JOULE"" doesn't fit.

   But note: in ""HOMER"", we have H at position1 and M at position3? And we know O, E, R are correct? So we are testing H and M.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,POKER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 Another is ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the profit from something, though less common) but let's stick with more common words.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters and has been a popular starting word in Wordle.

 Let me explain: 
   S, L, T are common consonants; A, E are vowels.

 However, note that we can also use ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Since it's the first guess, it's somewhat arbitrary. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" might be better because S and E are also common. But let's try ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says ""5-letter English word"". So we must choose a valid word.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, wait: the example used BRISK, BRAVE, etc. so we don't know the secret word yet.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.For the first guess, I chose a common starting word that includes frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that R and E are present in the word.

Our next guess should:
1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.
   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.
   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.
2. Avoid C, A, and N.

Additionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.

We have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints for next guess:
- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don't know what it is.
- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don't have to avoid a letter if it's not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.
- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don't know.
- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have three letters we haven't tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

One common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.

Consider including S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:

We need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.

So R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn't restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that's acceptable as long as it's not position 2.

Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5.

Now, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don't know about others.

Idea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.

Some words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:

Examples: 
- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

So, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

Another example: ""RESET"" - has two E's? But we don't know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.

But note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn't tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.

But also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don't have information about that.

Similarly for R.

To avoid complications, let's stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.

Better: let's choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

Possible word: ""STORE""
- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.

""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.

""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that's bad.

""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it's not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.

So let's list positions for R and E:
R: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5
E: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4

We also want to test new letters.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let's see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.

""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.
- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). 
- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. 
- Avoids C, A, N.

Is PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.

We get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.

But wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.

We can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.

""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.

""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.

""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.

""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.

""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.

""STIRE"" is not valid. 

""PIERT""? Not common.

""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.

""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.

""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.

""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn't have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it's better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? 

However, in Wordle, you don't have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that's not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.

So words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words:

- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E's. But we don't care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that's allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don't know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that's new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that's fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E's and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.

However, position 2: we put E. We don't know if that's valid? We don't have any information about position 2.

But we also have R at position 1: which we haven't tried.

But ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.

But let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.

""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.

""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.

""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.

Other words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.

Let me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That's allowed.

Example: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.

But note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it's allowed.

Also, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.

But we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.

Better: let's include S and T.

""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.

Another word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.

Is ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.

Positions: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)
Position3: R (not position2, so good)
Position4: I
Position5: F

This seems efficient.

We might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.

""STIRE"" invalid.

""BOIRE"" not common.

Another option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.

We can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.

""RIPED"": not a common word.

""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but I think we should.

But if we don't include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won't get information on R's position.

Therefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.

Alternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. 
- E at position2? which we haven't tried. 
- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.

In ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.

So both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.

But let me compare:

""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.

""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That's a new position.

In ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.

So both are good.

But ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.

Similarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.

But S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.

But anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.

Let me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.

""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.

So, okay.

I think ""PERIL"" is also good.

But to decide: let's see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.

We know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.

Similarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.

We might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.

But I don't think it matters much.

Alternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.

So I'll go with ""SERIF"".

Wait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don't know.

Similarly for R at3.

But we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.

""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.

So, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.

Therefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.
- Avoid using C, A, and N.
- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).
- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

A strong choice is ""SERIF"":
- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.
- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).
- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.
- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.

This guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.

<guess>SERIF</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- F: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don't know their correct positions.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.
3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.

Now, for the next guess, we want to:
- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven't tried for each.
- For R: we haven't tried positions 1, 4, 5.
- For E: we haven't tried positions 1, 3, 4.

But note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.

Possible combinations for R and E positions:
- R in 1, E in 3
- R in 1, E in 4
- R in 4, E in 1
- R in 4, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 1
- R in 5, E in 3
- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We'll consider the positions:

Option: R in position 1, E in position 3.
Then the word would be: R _ E _ _
We need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.

For example: R O E L T? But that's not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.

Common words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.

But we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.

Example: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.

""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.

""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.

""ROTED"" not a word.

""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.

This is difficult.

Option: R in position 1, E in position 4.
Word: R _ _ E _
Examples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try.

But we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.

""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R's? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It's messy.

Another word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R's.

""RODEO"" no E.

""RACED"" has A and C, absent.

""RIPED"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" no E.

""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.

""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R's.

But we can try a word without duplicate R? 

""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.

""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that's a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That's what we want. And R at1.

So ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? 

Alternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that's a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.

But in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That's one of the options.

Similarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.

""UREMI"" not a word.

""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.

""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.

""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That's another option: R in 5 and E in 4.

But in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that's a valid word.

Similarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E's? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don't know if the secret word has two E's? But we can try.

But let's list possible words we can use:

Option 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)
Option 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can't find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.

Option 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ 
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E's? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.

""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.

""BEVER"" not a word.

""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _

Examples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. 

""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.

""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.

But in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.

""ARMER"" has A.

I'm having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.

Option: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E's? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. So it's possible.

""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.

""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That's one of the options.

""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.

Letters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".

Similarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R
Words: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? 

""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

""AXLER"" not a word.

""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.

""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.

""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.

We need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R

""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.

""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That's an option.

But ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.

But it's a valid word.

But we might prefer more common letters.

Another word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.

""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.

In ""THERE"", position5 is E? That's not allowed? So we cannot use that.

Similarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.

""BEVER"" not a word.

So, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:

1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.
2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? But it's possible.
3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.

But in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven't tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.

But in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that's okay.

But to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don't have duplicates.

""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.

""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.

""EMBER"" has duplicate E.

So let's avoid duplicates for now? 

Now, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? 

Common letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. 

B is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.

But both are reasonable.

We can also consider other words.

Another option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let's try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.

""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.

""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.

Not E at3.

I think it's hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.

So let's go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".

But we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn't find a common word.

Similarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.

So, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.

But let's check the positions for R and E we are testing:

In ""ROBED"":
- R at position 1: we haven't tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.
- E at position4: we haven't tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.

Also, we test O, B, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven't tried R at5? And E at4 is new.

But in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.

I think both are fine. Let's pick ""ROBED"".

But note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don't know.

Another word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That's also a word? Yes. And P is common.

But we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.

Similarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.

But ""ROPED"" is valid.

So we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.

I think ""ROBED"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.

Is there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?

For example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.

""ROTED"" not valid.

""RUTED"" not common.

""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That's a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it's okay.

But ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.

I think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.

But to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.

""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.

So I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ROBED"".

But let's confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven't tried these positions? Yes.

So next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Include R and E to test new positions:
  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).
  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).
- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ROBED**:
  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).
  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.
- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.

<guess>ROBED</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)
Guess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 2
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 5

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 2
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 3
- I: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct position) → O is in the word and in position 2
- B: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in the word and in position 4
- D: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correctly placed letters**:
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED: O is ✓)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED: E is ✓)

   So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

2. **Present letters (but wrong position)**:
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 3? 
     - From CRANE: R not in position 2
     - From SERIF: R not in position 3
     - From ROBED: R not in position 1
     - Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, and positions 1 and 3 are the only ones left? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 4 are fixed as O and E, so R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we have ruled out position 1 and 3? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ROBED (R at1 got -)
        - Position 3: ruled out by SERIF (R at3 got -)
        - Therefore, R must be in position 5.

   But wait, position 5: we haven't tried R at position 5? And it's the only position left? So R must be in position 5.

   However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and the only position left is 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed, and positions 1 and 3 are not available for R (based on feedback). So yes, R must be in position 5.

   Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

   So now we have: _ O _ E R

3. **Absent letters**:
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D are not in the word.

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D.

4. **E is in position 4 (fixed) and we know it's present, so that's confirmed.**

Now, we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.

The secret word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We know the word has exactly these letters: letter1, O, letter3, E, R.

And we know that letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining common letters: We have used: R, O, E, and absent: C,A,N,S,I,F,B,D.

So available letters: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, G, etc.

We have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 3.

We also know that from the first guess, we had E in position 5 (wrong) and now we have E in position 4 (correct). Similarly, R was in wrong positions before, but now we have it in position 5.

For the next guess, we can try to fill in the blanks with common letters.

We must form a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ O _ E R

Possible words:

- We can try to test common letters for position 1 and 3.

For example:
- Position 1: T, then position 3: L -> ""TOLER""? Is that a word? T O L E R -> ""TOLER"" is not a common word? But ""TOLER"" might be accepted? Actually, it's not standard. Let's think of common words.

Common words ending with ""ER"": like ""TIGER"" but I is absent. ""POWER"" has P, O, W, E, R -> so if we put W in position 3? Then ""POWER"" is a word? But we have O in position 2 and E in 4, R in 5? So ""POWER"" would be: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5. That matches the pattern.

Similarly, ""LOWER"": L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""COVER"" has C? Absent.

""MOWER"": M at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

All these have W at position 3.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

We can also have other letters in position 3? For example, ""HOMER"": H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5? That's a word? Yes, meaning a home run or a person.

""BOXER"" has B? Absent.

""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

We can also have position 1 with a vowel? But we have O and E already? The word has two vowels? O and E? So position 1 and 3 are likely consonants? But not necessarily.

For example, ""HOVER"": H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5.

But V is less common.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters? But we have many letters to test? Actually, we only have two positions left? But we don't know the letters? So we can choose a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.

But note: we have only two guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it.

We can also consider that we have the pattern: _ O _ E R

We know the word must be in this form.

We can try ""POWER"" as a guess? But we don't know if P and W are in the word? But if we guess ""POWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and W.

Similarly, we can try ""TOWER"" or ""HOMER"".

But let's see the feedback from previous guesses: we have no information about T, L, M, P, U, etc.

We should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.

But since we have two positions, we can also try to guess a word that tests one of the positions and a common letter.

But we have to fill both.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a letter we haven't tested in position 1 and 3.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we can list possible words.

Possible words of the form _ O _ E R:

Common ones:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- POWER: P, O, W, E, R
- MOWER: M, O, W, E, R
- HOMER: H, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: but B absent -> invalid
- JOKER: J, O, K, E, R
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R
- CODER: C absent -> invalid
- LOWER: L, O, W, E, R
- ROVER: R at1? But we have R at5? And we know R is only once? But we don't know. But in ""ROVER"", R is at1 and at5? But we have O at2 and E at4? So ""ROVER"" would be R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5. But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might show one as - and the other as something? But in ROBED, we only have one R? So we don't know.

But in ""ROVER"", if we guess it, we would have R at1 and R at5? But we already know R is in the word? And we are trying to put R at1? But we know from ROBED that R at1 is wrong? So we cannot put R at1? Because we tried and it was - (wrong position). So we must avoid R at1? Similarly, we cannot put R at position 1? So ""ROVER"" is invalid because it has R at1 which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we cannot have R at position 1 or 3? Only position 5 is allowed for R? So in the pattern, position 1 and 3 must be non-R? And we know R is at5? So the word has exactly one R? Or at least one? But we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates? So we assume one R? But we can't be sure? But to be safe, we avoid putting R in positions 1 and 3? Because we know they are wrong? So we only put R at5? So in the word, position 1 and 3 are not R.

Therefore, we can list possible words without the absent letters and without R in 1 or 3? But R is fixed at5? So we don't put R in 1 or 3? So we are good.

Now, back to possible words: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, LOWER, HOVER, etc.

We also have ""GONER"": G, O, N, E, R? But N is absent? So invalid.

""TONER"": T, O, N, E, R? N absent.

""POSER"": P, O, S, E, R? S absent.

So invalid.

Valid: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, LOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, HOVER, COVER (but C absent? no, C is absent), so COVER invalid.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R? V is not absent? So valid.

But V is less common.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M, O, V, E, R.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can try ""TOWER"" because T and W are common? But W is not the most common? T is common.

But we have to decide.

We have two positions: 1 and 3. We can try to test a word that has a common letter in position 1 and a less common in 3? But we don't know.

Since we have limited guesses, we can try a word that might be the solution.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ROBED, we have O and E correct? And R was present but wrong position? So we know the word has O at2, E at4, R at5? And we need letter1 and letter3.

We can also consider that from the first guess, we had R in the word? And now we know it's at5.

For the next guess, we can try ""TOWER"": if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T and W.

Similarly, we can try ""POWER"".

But let's think about the letter in position 3: in many words, it's W, K, V, M, etc.

We can try ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3? Then we test H and M.

But H and M are also common.

To maximize information, we might choose a word with letters that are more common? But we have to pick one.

Another idea: we know that in the first guess, CRANE, we had E at5? But now we know E is at4? So that's consistent.

In SERIF, we had E at2? But now we know E is at4? So that's why it was wrong.

Similarly, R was at2 and at3? But now we know it's at5.

For position 1 and 3, we have no information.

I think ""TOWER"" is a good guess because T is a very common starting letter? And W is common in this pattern.

Similarly, ""POWER"" is also common.

But let's choose ""TOWER"".

We can also consider that we have not tested T and W? So if we guess ""TOWER"", and it's wrong, we know about T and W.

But we have only two positions? So if we get feedback that T is correct? Then we know position1 is T? And W is in the word? Or not? Then we can guess the next.

Similarly, if T is not in the word, then we know position1 is not T? And W might be in position3 or not.

But we have to be careful.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But ""TOWER"" has T and W? Both new.

I think it's fine.

But let's see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have tested? But we haven't tested any of the available letters? So we have to test.

Another common word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.

""POSER"" has S? Absent.

So I think ""TOWER"" is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: ""TOWER""

But let's write it: T O W E R

Positions: 1-T, 2-O, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R

We know O and E are fixed? So we are testing T at1 and W at3.

If the secret word is ""TOWER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on T and W.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it in 4.

But let's do it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x) → Absent
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - A (x) → Absent
  - N (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:
  - S (x) → Absent
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)
  - I (x) → Absent
  - F (x) → Absent

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is O)
  - B (x) → Absent
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is E)
  - D (x) → Absent

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:
   - Position 2: **O** (from ROBED ✓)
   - Position 4: **E** (from ROBED ✓)
   - The secret word pattern: `_ O _ E _`

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions)**:
   - **R**: 
     - Not in position 1 (ROBED: -), 2 (CRANE: -), or 3 (SERIF: -).
     - Only possible position left is **5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
     - Thus, **R must be in position 5**, making the pattern: `_ O _ E R`

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D (from all feedback).

4. **Remaining Unknowns**:
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.
   - Available letters (not absent or used): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, W (e.g., words like ""TOWER"", ""POWER"", ""HOMER"").

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word is now `_ O _ E R`.
- We need to test letters for positions 1 and 3.
- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits the pattern and tests high-frequency letters (e.g., T, W, P, M) to maximize information or solve.
- **Chosen word: ""TOWER""**:
  - T (position 1): Tests a common starting letter.
  - W (position 3): Tests a common letter in the middle.
  - O, E, R: Confirmed positions (O at 2, E at 4, R at 5).
- If ""TOWER"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on T and W will reveal their status (e.g., if T is absent/present, or W is absent/present), narrowing down the solution.

Guess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- I: x (absent)
- F: x (absent)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (present, wrong position) → not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- B: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- D: x (absent)

Guess 4: TOWER
- T: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- W: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED and TOWER)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED and TOWER)
   - Position 5: R (from TOWER, since R is now correct at position 5)

   So the secret word is: _ O _ E R

2. **Absent letters:**
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W.

3. **Present letters (but we already have all positions except position 1 and 3):**
   - We know the word has O, E, R in positions 2,4,5, and we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.

   But note: from Guess 1, we had R and E present, which are now placed. Similarly, from Guess 2, E and R present, now placed.

   We have no other present letters indicated? So the secret word has exactly three of the letters we've guessed? But we have positions 1 and 3 to fill, so there must be two more letters.

   Since we have no other present letters in the feedback (all other letters in the guesses were either absent or placed), the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the letters not yet tested? Or from the ones that were not absent? But we have tested many letters.

   The absent letters are: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W.

   So the available letters are: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

   But we need common English letters? So likely: G, H, L, M, P, U, V, Y.

4. **Position 1 and 3:**
   - We need to form a word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

   And we know the word must be a valid English word.

   Possible common words that fit this pattern and use the available letters:

   - HOMER: H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5 → but M is available? And H is available? Yes, not absent.
   - However, in HOMER, we have H and M.

   Other options:
   - LOVER: L at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → L and V available.
   - MOVER: M at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → M and V.
   - HOVER: H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → H and V.
   - JOKER: J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → J and K? But J and K are less common? But valid.
   - POKER: P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → P and K.
   - But note: K is available? Yes.

   However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

   Also, note that in the pattern, position 3 must be a letter that can form a word.

   Since we have limited guesses, we can try ""HOMER"" because it uses common letters? Or ""LOVER""?

   But let's see: we have not tested H, L, M, P, V, etc.

   We can choose one that tests two new common letters.

   Common letters left: L, M, P, U, V, G, etc.

   We can try ""HOMER"": if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on H and M.

   Similarly, ""LOVER"" tests L and V.

   But note: in the feedback for TOWER, we have T and W absent? So we know they are not in the word.

   Now, we have two positions to fill? So we need to guess a word that fits the pattern.

   Since we have only two positions, and we have to find two letters, we can list possible words:

   Possible words of the form ?O?ER:

   - HOMER
   - LOVER
   - MOVER
   - HOVER
   - JOKER
   - POKER
   - COVER → but C absent
   - MOWER → W absent
   - POWER → W absent
   - TOWER → T and W absent
   - BOXER → B absent
   - FOYER → F absent? F is absent? Yes, from SERIF.

   So valid: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, and also ""GONER"" but N absent? N is absent? Yes, from CRANE. ""GONER"" has N? G O N E R → N is absent, so invalid.

   ""POSER"": P O S E R → S absent? Yes, from SERIF. Invalid.

   ""ROVER"": R at1? But we know R is at5? And we cannot have R at1? Because in ROBED, R at1 was wrong? So R cannot be at1? So ""ROVER"" would have R at1 and R at5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might have shown the R at5 as correct? But in ROBED, we didn't have R at5? We had R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5? So D at5? So we don't know about R at5? But now we know R is at5? So if we had ""ROVER"", it would have R at1 and R at5? But we know R at1 is wrong? So we cannot have R at1? Therefore, ""ROVER"" is invalid? Because it would require R at1 which we know is not correct? So we avoid.

   Similarly, ""R"" cannot be at position 1? So we don't consider words with R at1.

   So back to the list: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER.

   Also, ""BOXER"" invalid, ""JOKER"" and ""POKER"" are valid? But J and K are less common? But possible.

   Another one: ""COMET"" doesn't fit pattern? Must end with ER.

   ""DOPER"" has D? Absent.

   ""MOPER"" has M O P E R? But that's M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5? So ""MOPER"" is a word? Yes, meaning one who mopes. And M and P are available.

   Similarly, ""HOPED"" has D? Absent.

   ""COPED"" has C and D? Absent.

   So ""MOPER"" is valid: M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5.

   Similarly, ""HOPES"" has S? Absent.

   So possible words: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, MOPER.

   Now, we need to choose one to guess.

   We can try ""HOMER"" because it's a common word? Or ""LOVER""?

   But to maximize information? Since we have two positions, if we guess and it's wrong, we get feedback on the two letters? Then we can deduce.

   But we have only two guesses left? We have used 4, so we have 2 more? But we want to solve in 5.

   So let's choose a word that uses common letters? H, L, M, P, V.

   We can try ""HOMER"": H at1 and M at3.

   If we guess ""HOMER"" and it's wrong, then:
   - If H is absent, then position1 is not H? And M is absent? Then we know position1 must be L, P, V, etc.? And position3 must be V, P, etc.

   Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"", we test L and V.

   But we don't know which is more likely.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? For example, M appears in HOMER, MOVER, MOPER? So if we test M, it might help.

   Similarly, P appears in POKER and MOPER.

   But we have to choose a word.

   I think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.

   But let's see the feedback from TOWER: we have T and W absent? So we know.

   Another idea: we have not tested the letter U? But in ""HOVER"", we have U? No, ""HOVER"" has H, O, V, E, R? No U.

   ""JOULE"" doesn't fit.

   So I think we go with ""HOMER"".

   Therefore, next guess: ""HOMER""

   But note: in ""HOMER"", we have H at position1 and M at position3? And we know O, E, R are correct? So we are testing H and M.

   If the secret word is ""HOMER"", we win.

   If not, we get feedback on H and M.

   But we have only one guess after that? So we need to be careful? But we have two positions? So if we get feedback that H is absent and M is absent? Then we know position1 is not H, position3 is not M? Then we can try another word? Like ""LOVER"" or ""POKER"".

   But we have to hope that it's one of the common ones.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests a different set? But I think it's fine.

   So I'll go with ""HOMER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x) → Absent  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  
  - A (x) → Absent  
  - N (x) → Absent  
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)  

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:  
  - S (x) → Absent  
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)  
  - I (x) → Absent  
  - F (x) → Absent  

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)  
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  
  - B (x) → Absent  
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  
  - D (x) → Absent  

- **Guess 4 (TOWER)**:  
  - T (x) → Absent  
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  
  - W (x) → Absent  
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  
  - R (✓) → Correct position (position 5 is **R**)  

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 4: **E**  
   - Position 5: **R**  
   - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.  
   - Available letters (not absent): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
   - Common English words fitting `_ O _ E R` include:  
     - **HOMER** (H at 1, M at 3)  
     - **LOVER** (L at 1, V at 3)  
     - **MOVER** (M at 1, V at 3)  
     - **HOVER** (H at 1, V at 3)  
     - **POKER** (P at 1, K at 3)  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters (e.g., H, M, L, V) to solve or narrow down positions 1 and 3.  
- **Chosen word: ""HOMER""**:  
  - Tests **H** (position 1) and **M** (position 3), both common letters.  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will identify which letter is valid and its position (e.g., if H is absent, position 1 must be L/P/U; if M is absent, position 3 must be V/K/P).

""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N), helping to quickly identify correct letters and their positions.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since it was in position 2 of ""CRANE"").\n- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 of ""CRANE"").\n- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.\n\nWe also know that R and E are present in the word.\n\nOur next guess should:\n1. Include R and E, but not in the positions we already tried.\n   - Since R was in position 2 and that was wrong, R should not be placed in position 2 again. It could be in 1,3,4, or 5.\n   - Similarly, E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so E should not be in position 5. It could be in 1,2,3, or 4.\n2. Avoid C, A, and N.\n\nAdditionally, we want to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, P, etc.\n\nWe have 6 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints for next guess:\n- Position 1: Cannot be C (since C is not in word). We don\'t know what it is.\n- Position 2: We know R is not here (from feedback), but we don\'t have to avoid a letter if it\'s not disallowed. However, we know R must be in the word so it must go elsewhere.\n- Position 3: Cannot be A (since A is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 4: Cannot be N (since N is not in word). We don\'t know.\n- Position 5: Cannot be E? Well, E might be in other positions? Actually, feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again because it is wrong.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have three letters we haven\'t tested: we need to test other vowels and consonants. Since we have R and E, we can build around them.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\nOne common strategy is to try another word with many common letters.\n\nConsider including S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need R to be not in position 2, and E not in position 5.\n\nSo R can be in positions: 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait, position 5: E cannot be in position 5, so E must be in 1,2,3, or 4. But that doesn\'t restrict R. However, R could be in position 5? Actually, position 5 is open for R? But note: if R is in position 5, that\'s acceptable as long as it\'s not position 2.\n\nSimilarly, E must be in a position other than 5.\n\nNow, we know that vowel A is not in the word, so we are left with E (we know), and possibly I, O, U? We should try other vowels. Since E is already present, we have that vowel covered, but we don\'t know about others.\n\nIdea: choose a word with E and R and also including other common consonants and vowels.\n\nSome words that contain E and R and avoid A, C, N:\n\nExamples: \n- ""ROUSE"" : R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> But E cannot be at position 5 because in previous feedback E was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at 5. So E at 5 again? Actually, putting E at 5 again would be trying the same position which we know is wrong. That might be wasteful because we already know E is not at 5. So we should try E in a different position.\n\nTherefore, avoid E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\nSo, in ""ROUSE"", R is at position 1 (new position) but E is at position 5 (same as before) which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nAnother example: ""RESET"" - has two E\'s? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, feedback only tells about the letters present: if E appears twice in the word, and we guess E in the correct position, it will show ✓ for that one, and if the other is in wrong position, it will show ""-"" for that. But in our case, we only have one E and we know it is somewhere else.\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", E was present and we got ""-"" for it, but that doesn\'t tell us if there is more than one E. So we should consider that there might be only one E.\n\nBut also, in the secret word, E could be repeated? However, we don\'t have information about that.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nTo avoid complications, let\'s stick to words without duplicates for now? But we can try.\n\nBetter: let\'s choose a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3,4 and R in one of 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters. Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""STORE""\n- S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5 is bad (we know E is not at 5). So avoid that.\n\n""RODEO"" has two O? And no E.\n\n""TRIBE"": has B and T? But we are avoiding A? Actually, T-R-I-B-E: letters T,R,I,B,E. Contains E and R. Positions: R at position 2? But we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that position is wrong for R (from the first guess). So that\'s bad.\n\n""R"" position: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get another ""-"" for R in position 2? But that tells us nothing new because we already know it\'s not position 2. That would waste a slot. We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, we need R in position 1,3,4 or 5? But position 5 is available for R? And E must be in position 1,2,3 or 4.\n\nSo let\'s list positions for R and E:\nR: not in 2 -> can be in 1,3,4,5\nE: not in 5 -> can be in 1,2,3,4\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE"" - but D? Actually, D is common. And V. But let\'s see positions: D at1, R at2? Avoid: R at2 is bad -> not good.\n\n""PERIL"": P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5 -> This seems promising.\n- Positions: E at2 (valid) and R at3 (not in2, good). \n- Letters: P, E, R, I, L. \n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\nIs PERIL a valid word? Yes, meaning danger.\n\nWe get to test P, E, R, I, L. E and R we know are present, so we are testing P, I, L as well.\n\nBut wait, we know E and R are present, but we are not sure if PERIL is the word? We are just guessing to get more information.\n\nWe can also consider ""ORIEL"": O at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2 is disallowed.\n\n""LIVER"": L at1, I at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at4 (valid, not 5), R at5 (valid, not 2). Letters: L, I, V, E, R -> avoids C,A,N. But note V is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""BRIEF"": B at1, R at2? -> bad, R at2.\n\n""STIRE""? Not a valid English word.\n\n""ROGUE"": R at1, O, G, U, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad, avoid.\n\n""GRIPE"": G at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""PRIDE"": P at1, R at2? -> R at2: bad.\n\n""TRIPE"": T at1, R at2? -> bad.\n\n""STIRE"" is not valid. \n\n""PIERT""? Not common.\n\n""STARE"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n""STORE"" has O and R, but E at5: bad.\n\n""SPIRE"": S at1, P at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at position 5? Bad.\n\n""SPIEL"": S at1, P at2, I at3, E at4, L at5 -> so E at position 4? That is allowed. And R? This word doesn\'t have R. But we know R is in the word. So we must use R? Oh, we must include R because we know it is in the word? Actually, no: we are trying to guess the word, but we should include the known letters? Actually, we have 6 guesses and we can choose to not use R in this guess? That might waste an opportunity to locate R. But it\'s better to use the known letters to eliminate other letters? \n\nHowever, in Wordle, you don\'t have to use the known letters in every guess? Actually, that\'s not efficient because you want to find the positions of the known letters. So we should try to use R and E in our next guess to get more information about their positions.\n\nTherefore, we should include both R and E in the guess.\n\nSo words that have both R and E, avoid A, C, N, and have R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nLet me think of words:\n\n- R in 1: e.g., ""REVEL"": R at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, L at5. But E at position 5? Wait, position 5 is L? Positions: 1-R, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L. So E appears at 2 and 4. And L at5. Now, E: we know E is in the word, and we are putting E at2 and E at4. The secret word might have one or two E\'s. But we don\'t care: we can put E in multiple positions? Actually, that\'s allowed. But note: for position 5, we have L, which we don\'t know. So if E is at position 2 and/or 4, that\'s new information. But we still avoid E at position 5? Actually, we are not putting E at position 5 in this guess. So that\'s fine. But ""REVEL"" has two E\'s and letters R and E. It avoids A,C,N.\n\nHowever, position 2: we put E. We don\'t know if that\'s valid? We don\'t have any information about position 2.\n\nBut we also have R at position 1: which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut ""REVEL"" might be a good candidate.\n\nBut let me see if we have a word that tests more new letters.\n\n""DRIVE"" has R at2: bad.\n\n""PEARS"": has A -> not allowed.\n\n""TRIBE"": R at2: bad.\n\n""ROUTE"": R at1, O, U, T, E at5: E at5 bad.\n\nOther words: ""PRIED"": P at1, R at2: R at2 bad.\n\nLet me think: words starting with E? E can be at position 1? That\'s allowed.\n\nExample: ""ELDER"": E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5 -> positions: E at1 and E at4, R at5? So E at1: new position. R at5: not position 2. And we avoid A,C,N. Letters: E,L,D,E,R.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the secret word, so having two E might be confusing? But it\'s allowed.\n\nAlso, ""ELDER"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we are testing L and D? Not the most common letters.\n\nBetter: let\'s include S and T.\n\n""QUERY""? Q is uncommon, and positions: Q at1, U, E at3, R at4, Y at5 -> E at3 and R at4? That seems good. But Q and Y might not be optimal.\n\nAnother word: ""SERIF"": S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5 -> this avoids position 2 for R? Actually, R is at position 3, which is new. And E at2? Also new. And avoids A,C,N. Also, we test S, E, R, I, F.\n\nIs ""SERIF"" a valid word? Yes, in typography.\n\nPositions: \nPosition1: S (new)\nPosition2: E (can we put E here? we know E is not at5, but position2 is unknown and acceptable)\nPosition3: R (not position2, so good)\nPosition4: I\nPosition5: F\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nWe might also consider ""SPIRE"", but E at5: bad.\n\n""STIRE"" invalid.\n\n""BOIRE"" not common.\n\nAnother option: ""ROUSE"" but E at5: bad.\n\nWe can try ""RISEN"": has S and N? N is forbidden. Avoid.\n\n""RIPED"": not a common word.\n\n""LIBRE"": L at1, I at2, B at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.\n\n""EMPTY"": has T? E at1, M, P, T, Y -> no R? We must include R? Actually, we don\'t have to, but I think we should.\n\nBut if we don\'t include R, we waste the knowledge of R being present? We are just testing other letters? That might be inefficient because we won\'t get information on R\'s position.\n\nTherefore, I think ""SERIF"" is a great candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""PERIL"" which I thought earlier: P at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, L at5. \n- E at position2? which we haven\'t tried. \n- R at position3? which is allowed since we know R not at2.\n\nIn ""PERIL"", note position5 is L. We avoid E at5? Yes.\n\nSo both ""PERIL"" and ""SERIF"" are valid.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n""SERIF"": letters S, E, R, I, F -> S is very common. I is vowel. F is less common.\n\n""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L -> P, L are common? L is common? Actually, both are possible.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" told us that R is not at position2, so we can put R at3? In ""CRANE"", R was at position2. Now in ""SERIF"", R is at position3, which is new. Similarly, E was at position5 in ""CRANE"", now in ""SERIF"" E is at position2? That\'s a new position.\n\nIn ""PERIL"", E is at2 and R at3 also.\n\nSo both are good.\n\nBut ""SERIF"" includes S which is one of the most common letters? That might be useful.\n\nSimilarly, ""PERIL"" includes P and L? Also common.\n\nBut S is slightly more common than P? And F vs L: L is more common.\n\nBut anyway, let me pick ""SERIF"" because I like it.\n\nLet me see if we can test T as well? Another word: ""STERN"" - has N? Avoid N.\n\n""QUIRE"" - Q is uncommon.\n\nSo, okay.\n\nI think ""PERIL"" is also good.\n\nBut to decide: let\'s see what letters we are testing: In ""SERIF"": we test S at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, F at5.\n\nWe know E and R: so we are testing S, I, F.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PERIL"": test P, E, R, I, L -> P, I, L.\n\nWe might not know much about P vs S? But S is more common? Actually, in Wordle, S is very common.\n\nBut I don\'t think it matters much.\n\nAlternative: ""SHIRE"" - S at1, H at2, I at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5: bad.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SERIF"".\n\nWait: E at position2: if E is the correct letter at position2? We would get a ✓ for E? Or if not, a - or x? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for R at3.\n\nBut we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIKE""? T at1, R at2: R at2: bad, avoid.\n\n""BRIDE"": B at1, R at2: bad.\n\nSo, I think ""SERIF"" is fine.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""SERIF"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"", we know:\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked as \'x\').\n- R and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (R was in position 2, E was in position 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E, as they are confirmed present.\n- Avoid using C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be in position 2 again (since it was wrong there).\n- E cannot be in position 5 again (since it was wrong there).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.\n\nA strong choice is ""SERIF"":\n- S (position 1): Tests a new common consonant at an unknown position.\n- E (position 2): Tests E in a new position (not 5).\n- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position (not 2).\n- I (position 4): Tests a common vowel.\n- F (position 5): Tests a new consonant.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes the positions for R and E while testing three new letters, avoiding disallowed characters.\n\n<guess>SERIF</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: SERIF\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- F: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but we still don\'t know their correct positions.\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, I, F.\n3. We have tried R in positions 2 and 3, both were wrong. So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n4. We have tried E in positions 5 and 2, both were wrong. So E cannot be in position 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: position 1 can only have one letter. So R and E cannot both be in position 1. So we have to consider the possibilities.\n\nAlso, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two of them (R and E). We need to find the other three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, F. So we can use other common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, H, Y, etc.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to:\n- Include R and E again, but in positions we haven\'t tried for each.\n- For R: we haven\'t tried positions 1, 4, 5.\n- For E: we haven\'t tried positions 1, 3, 4.\n\nBut note: we cannot have both R and E in the same position, so we have to assign them to different positions.\n\nPossible combinations for R and E positions:\n- R in 1, E in 3\n- R in 1, E in 4\n- R in 4, E in 1\n- R in 4, E in 3\n- R in 5, E in 1\n- R in 5, E in 3\n- R in 5, E in 4? But position 4 for E is allowed, and R in 5 is allowed.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that satisfies these constraints.\n\nWe\'ll consider the positions:\n\nOption: R in position 1, E in position 3.\nThen the word would be: R _ E _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with new letters, avoiding C,A,N,S,I,F.\n\nFor example: R O E L T? But that\'s not a word. Or R U E L Y? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: ""RULER"" -> but L is in position 4 and E in 3? R U L E R? That has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, E is in position 4? But we are trying E in position 3? Wait, in ""RULER"": positions: 1-R, 2-U, 3-L, 4-E, 5-R. So E is at 4, not 3. And R is at 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying R at 1 and E at 3? So we need a word with R at 1 and E at 3.\n\nExample: ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3? Wait, E is at4? We need E at3.\n\n""RIPED"" not a word and has I which is absent.\n\n""RATED"": R at1, A at2? But A is absent.\n\n""ROTED"" not a word.\n\n""RIPEN"" has N and I, absent.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nOption: R in position 1, E in position 4.\nWord: R _ _ E _\nExamples: ""RULER"" has E at4? But also R at5? And we have R at1 and E at4. But ""RULER"" is a word? But we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut we also have to avoid S,I,F,A,C,N.\n\n""RULER"": letters R, U, L, E, R -> U and L are new. But we have two R\'s? The feedback might be: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R might show as absent? But we know R is present, so one of them might be correct? It\'s messy.\n\nAnother word: ""ROGER"": R at1, O at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? Again two R\'s.\n\n""RODEO"" no E.\n\n""RACED"" has A and C, absent.\n\n""RIPED"" invalid.\n\n""RUMOR"" no E.\n\n""RIDER"": R at1, I at2? I is absent.\n\n""ROVER"": R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Two R\'s.\n\nBut we can try a word without duplicate R? \n\n""ROUSE"" has S and E at5? But E at5 is not allowed in our pattern? We are putting E at4? ""ROUSE"" is R,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Not at4.\n\n""ROMEO"": R at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, O at5 -> that\'s a word? Yes. Letters: R, O, M, E, O. Avoids the absent letters? S,I,F,A,C,N are absent, but O and M are new. And E at4? That\'s what we want. And R at1.\n\nSo ""ROMEO"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s a proper noun, but sometimes allowed? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? But ""ROMEO"" is often accepted in word games? Let me confirm: in standard Wordle, it might not be, but the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so we should avoid proper nouns? \n\nAlternatively, ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> that\'s a word. And avoids absent letters? Absent: C,A,N,S,I,F. So O, B, E, D are all allowed? E is already known. So we test O, B, D.\n\nBut in this case, R is at1 and E at4? That\'s one of the options.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R in position 4 and E in position 1? For example: _ _ _ R E? Words: ""STORE"" has S and E at5? Not at1. ""SCARE"" has S and A. ""SHIRE"" has S and E at5? Not at1.\n\n""UREMI"" not a word.\n\n""OPERA"": O at1, P at2, E at3, R at4, A at5? But A is absent.\n\n""ULCER"" has C and U? C is absent.\n\n""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5? And E at4? That\'s another option: R in 5 and E in 4.\n\nBut in ""UMBER"", we have U, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So that\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R in 5 and E in 1: E _ _ _ R? Words: ""EVERY"" has E at1, V, E at3, R at4? Not at5. ""ENTRY"" has N. ""ELDER"" has E at1, L, D, E at4, R at5? But we have two E\'s? And R at5. So ""ELDER"" is a word? But we have E at1 and E at4? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words we can use:\n\nOption 1: R in 1, E in 4: e.g., ""ROBED"" (R O B E D)\nOption 2: R in 4, E in 1: I can\'t find a common word? ""EATER"" has A and E at1, but A absent. ""ENTER"" has N and E at1, T, E at4? Not R at4. ""EDGER"" has D, G, E, R? E at1, D at2, G at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5, not at4.\n\nOption 3: R in 4, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E R _ \nWords: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A and two E\'s? ""TUNER"" has U, N? N absent. ""LATER"" has A. ""POWER"" has O, W, E, R? P O W E R -> E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4? We need E at3 and R at4.\n\n""WATER"" has A. ""HATER"" has A. ""R"" is not in the middle.\n\n""BEVER"" not a word.\n\n""LEVER"": L at1, E at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? Not E at3 and R at4.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4: so _ _ E R _\n\nExamples: ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-R? But we need R at4? Here R is at5. \n\n""OFFER"": O at1, F at2, F at3, E at4, R at5? Again R at5.\n\n""ORDER"": O at1, R at2? But we cannot put R at2? Because we know R is not at2? Actually, we tried R at2 and it was wrong, so we must avoid position2 for R.\n\nBut in ""ORDER"", R is at2 and at5? So position2 R is not allowed? So we cannot use that.\n\n""ARMER"" has A.\n\nI\'m having trouble finding a word with E at3 and R at4.\n\nOption: R in 5, E in 1: e.g., ""ELDER"" (E L D E R) -> E at1, R at5? But we have two E\'s? And we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are two. So it\'s possible.\n\n""EERIE"" has E at1, E at2, R at3, I at4? I is absent.\n\n""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 and E at1? That\'s one of the options.\n\n""EMBER"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a small piece of burning coal.\n\nLetters: E, M, B, E, R. Avoids absent letters? C,A,N,S,I,F? Yes. So we can use ""EMBER"".\n\nSimilarly, R in 5, E in 3: e.g., _ _ E _ R\nWords: ""OPERA"" has A. ""AGREE"" has A. ""UPPER"" has U, P, P, E, R -> E at3? Positions: 1-U, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E? Not E at3? ""UPPER"" has E at4? \n\n""TAPER"" has A. ""LOWER"" has L, O, W, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.\n\n""AXLER"" not a word.\n\n""OCHER"" has O, C? C absent.\n\n""OCHER"" is O-C-H-E-R, so C is absent.\n\n""OTHER"" has O, T, H, E, R -> E at4? Not at3.\n\nWe need E at position 3: so _ _ E _ R\n\n""ADIEU"" has A and I and E at3? But not ending with R.\n\n""QUEER"" has Q and E at3? Q U E E R -> positions: 1-Q, 2-U, 3-E, 4-E, 5-R. So E at3 and R at5? But we are considering R in 5? And E in 3? That\'s an option.\n\nBut ""QUEER"" has Q which is uncommon? And we have U and E? But we avoid? The letters: Q, U, E, E, R. Q and U are not tested? But we can use? However, Q is not very common.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might prefer more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""THEIR"" has T, H, E, I, R -> I is absent? I is in the absent list? From guess2, I is x, so not in word.\n\n""THERE"" has T, H, E, R, E -> E at3 and R at4? But we are not trying R at4? We are trying R at5? In ""THERE"": positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-E, 4-R, 5-E. So R is at4? And E at3 and E at5? But we know E is not at5? So we cannot put E at5? Because we have tried E at5 and it was wrong? So we must avoid E at5.\n\nIn ""THERE"", position5 is E? That\'s not allowed? So we cannot use that.\n\nSimilarly, ""WHERE"" same issue.\n\n""BEVER"" not a word.\n\nSo, after reviewing, the best options seem to be:\n\n1. ""ROBED"": R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5 -> tests R at1 and E at4, and new letters O, B, D.\n2. ""EMBER"": E at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> tests E at1 and R at5, and new letters M, B. But note: two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But it\'s possible.\n3. ""UMBER"": U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5 -> same as EMBER but with U instead of E at1? ""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> so E at4 and R at5? And U at1? So tests U, M, B, E, R? But we know E and R are present? So we test U, M, B.\n\nBut in ""UMBER"", we are not testing E at a new position? We are testing E at4? Which we haven\'t tried? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.\n\nSimilarly, in ""ROBED"", E at4 is new.\n\nBut in ""EMBER"", we are testing E at1 and E at4? And R at5? So we get information on E at1 and E at4? But if the secret word has only one E, then one of them might be wrong? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might prefer a word with more new letters and without duplicates? So ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"" don\'t have duplicates.\n\n""ROBED"" has R, O, B, E, D -> all distinct.\n\n""UMBER"" has U, M, B, E, R -> distinct.\n\n""EMBER"" has duplicate E.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now? \n\nNow, between ""ROBED"" and ""UMBER"", which one tests more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: O, B, D vs U, M, B. \n\nB is common? O is common? U is less common? M is medium? D is common.\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\nWe can also consider other words.\n\nAnother option: R in 4, E in 3? We had trouble, but let\'s try: ""OAKER"" not a word. ""OAKER"" is not valid.\n\n""BOXER"" has O, X, E, R? B at1, O at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? But we need E at3 and R at4? Not matching.\n\n""POKER"" has P, O, K, E, R -> E at4, R at5.\n\nNot E at3.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a word with E at3 and R at4.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ROBED"" or ""UMBER"".\n\nBut we also have the option of R in 1 and E in 3? We couldn\'t find a common word.\n\nSimilarly, R in 5 and E in 3: ""QUEER"" is not ideal.\n\nSo, I think ""ROBED"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions for R and E we are testing:\n\nIn ""ROBED"":\n- R at position 1: we haven\'t tried R at1 before? We tried R at2 and at3? So position1 is new.\n- E at position4: we haven\'t tried E at4? We tried E at5 and at2? So position4 is new.\n\nAlso, we test O, B, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, ""UMBER"" tests U at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So R at5 is new? We haven\'t tried R at5? And E at4 is new.\n\nBut in ""ROBED"", we also test position1 for R and position4 for E.\n\nI think both are fine. Let\'s pick ""ROBED"".\n\nBut note: in ""ROBED"", position5 is D? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""ROPED"": R at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, D at5? That\'s also a word? Yes. And P is common.\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters? P is not absent? So ""ROPED"" is also possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROVED"", ""ROTED"" not valid.\n\nBut ""ROPED"" is valid.\n\nSo we can choose ""ROPED"" to test P instead of B? But B is also common.\n\nI think ""ROBED"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to include T? T is a very common letter.\n\nIs there a word with R at1, E at4, and T somewhere?\n\nFor example: ""RATED"" has A? Absent.\n\n""ROTED"" not valid.\n\n""RUTED"" not common.\n\n""ROWED"": R at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, D at5? That\'s a word? Yes, past tense of row. Letters: R, O, W, E, D. Avoids absent letters? Yes. And we test W? W is less common? But it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""ROWED"" has the same structure as ""ROBED"", but with W instead of B.\n\nI think ""ROBED"" is better because B is more common than W? Or similar.\n\nBut to have T: ""ROTED"" not valid.\n\n""WRITE"" has W, R, I, T, E? I is absent.\n\nSo I think ""ROBED"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""ROBED"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: we are putting R at1 and E at4? And we haven\'t tried these positions? Yes.\n\nSo next guess: ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, and N are absent (x). R and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), so R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**: S, I, and F are absent (x). E and R are present but in the wrong positions (-), so E is not in position 2, and R is not in position 3.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters**: R and E are in the word, but their positions are unknown.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F (cannot be used).\n- **Position constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, D, O, T, L, M, P, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Include R and E to test new positions:\n  - R: Try position 1 (untested) or 4/5 (avoiding position 2 and 3).\n  - E: Try position 4 (untested) or 1/3 (avoiding position 2 and 5).\n- Avoid positions that conflict (e.g., R and E cannot both be in position 1).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) to gather more information.\n- **Chosen word: ROBED**:\n  - R in position 1 (tests a new position for R).\n  - E in position 4 (tests a new position for E).\n  - New letters: O (position 2), B (position 3), D (position 5) — all common and untested.\n- This guess efficiently probes R and E positions while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>ROBED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SERIF -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) F(x)\nGuess 3: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 2\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 5\n\nGuess 2: SERIF\n- S: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E not in position 2\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 3\n- I: x (not in word)\n- F: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ROBED\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R not in position 1\n- O: ✓ (correct position) → O is in the word and in position 2\n- B: x (not in word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is in the word and in position 4\n- D: x (not in word)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. **Correctly placed letters**:\n   - Position 2: O (from ROBED: O is ✓)\n   - Position 4: E (from ROBED: E is ✓)\n\n   So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E _\n\n2. **Present letters (but wrong position)**:\n   - R is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 3? \n     - From CRANE: R not in position 2\n     - From SERIF: R not in position 3\n     - From ROBED: R not in position 1\n     - Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, and positions 1 and 3 are the only ones left? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 4 are fixed as O and E, so R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. But we have ruled out position 1 and 3? \n        - Position 1: ruled out by ROBED (R at1 got -)\n        - Position 3: ruled out by SERIF (R at3 got -)\n        - Therefore, R must be in position 5.\n\n   But wait, position 5: we haven\'t tried R at position 5? And it\'s the only position left? So R must be in position 5.\n\n   However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and the only position left is 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed, and positions 1 and 3 are not available for R (based on feedback). So yes, R must be in position 5.\n\n   Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.\n\n   So now we have: _ O _ E R\n\n3. **Absent letters**:\n   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D are not in the word.\n\n   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D.\n\n4. **E is in position 4 (fixed) and we know it\'s present, so that\'s confirmed.**\n\nNow, we need to find the letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\nThe secret word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R\n\nWe know the word has exactly these letters: letter1, O, letter3, E, R.\n\nAnd we know that letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.\n\nRemaining common letters: We have used: R, O, E, and absent: C,A,N,S,I,F,B,D.\n\nSo available letters: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, G, etc.\n\nWe have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 3.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we had E in position 5 (wrong) and now we have E in position 4 (correct). Similarly, R was in wrong positions before, but now we have it in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, we can try to fill in the blanks with common letters.\n\nWe must form a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ O _ E R\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We can try to test common letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: T, then position 3: L -> ""TOLER""? Is that a word? T O L E R -> ""TOLER"" is not a common word? But ""TOLER"" might be accepted? Actually, it\'s not standard. Let\'s think of common words.\n\nCommon words ending with ""ER"": like ""TIGER"" but I is absent. ""POWER"" has P, O, W, E, R -> so if we put W in position 3? Then ""POWER"" is a word? But we have O in position 2 and E in 4, R in 5? So ""POWER"" would be: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5. That matches the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""LOWER"": L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""COVER"" has C? Absent.\n\n""MOWER"": M at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nAll these have W at position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W is in the word? We haven\'t tested W.\n\nWe can also have other letters in position 3? For example, ""HOMER"": H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5? That\'s a word? Yes, meaning a home run or a person.\n\n""BOXER"" has B? Absent.\n\n""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nWe can also have position 1 with a vowel? But we have O and E already? The word has two vowels? O and E? So position 1 and 3 are likely consonants? But not necessarily.\n\nFor example, ""HOVER"": H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests new letters? But we have many letters to test? Actually, we only have two positions left? But we don\'t know the letters? So we can choose a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nBut note: we have only two guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it.\n\nWe can also consider that we have the pattern: _ O _ E R\n\nWe know the word must be in this form.\n\nWe can try ""POWER"" as a guess? But we don\'t know if P and W are in the word? But if we guess ""POWER"", and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on P and W.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""TOWER"" or ""HOMER"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from previous guesses: we have no information about T, L, M, P, U, etc.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.\n\nBut since we have two positions, we can also try to guess a word that tests one of the positions and a common letter.\n\nBut we have to fill both.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a letter we haven\'t tested in position 1 and 3.\n\nBut note: we have many absent letters, so we can list possible words.\n\nPossible words of the form _ O _ E R:\n\nCommon ones:\n- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R\n- POWER: P, O, W, E, R\n- MOWER: M, O, W, E, R\n- HOMER: H, O, M, E, R\n- BOXER: but B absent -> invalid\n- JOKER: J, O, K, E, R\n- POKER: P, O, K, E, R\n- CODER: C absent -> invalid\n- LOWER: L, O, W, E, R\n- ROVER: R at1? But we have R at5? And we know R is only once? But we don\'t know. But in ""ROVER"", R is at1 and at5? But we have O at2 and E at4? So ""ROVER"" would be R at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5. But we have two R\'s? And we know R is in the word? But we don\'t know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R\'s, the feedback might show one as - and the other as something? But in ROBED, we only have one R? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""ROVER"", if we guess it, we would have R at1 and R at5? But we already know R is in the word? And we are trying to put R at1? But we know from ROBED that R at1 is wrong? So we cannot put R at1? Because we tried and it was - (wrong position). So we must avoid R at1? Similarly, we cannot put R at position 1? So ""ROVER"" is invalid because it has R at1 which we know is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have R at position 1 or 3? Only position 5 is allowed for R? So in the pattern, position 1 and 3 must be non-R? And we know R is at5? So the word has exactly one R? Or at least one? But we don\'t know about duplicates? But we haven\'t seen evidence of duplicates? So we assume one R? But we can\'t be sure? But to be safe, we avoid putting R in positions 1 and 3? Because we know they are wrong? So we only put R at5? So in the word, position 1 and 3 are not R.\n\nTherefore, we can list possible words without the absent letters and without R in 1 or 3? But R is fixed at5? So we don\'t put R in 1 or 3? So we are good.\n\nNow, back to possible words: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, LOWER, HOVER, etc.\n\nWe also have ""GONER"": G, O, N, E, R? But N is absent? So invalid.\n\n""TONER"": T, O, N, E, R? N absent.\n\n""POSER"": P, O, S, E, R? S absent.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nValid: TOWER, POWER, MOWER, LOWER, HOMER, JOKER, POKER, HOVER, COVER (but C absent? no, C is absent), so COVER invalid.\n\n""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R? V is not absent? So valid.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOVER"": M, O, V, E, R.\n\nNow, we need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe can try ""TOWER"" because T and W are common? But W is not the most common? T is common.\n\nBut we have to decide.\n\nWe have two positions: 1 and 3. We can try to test a word that has a common letter in position 1 and a less common in 3? But we don\'t know.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can try a word that might be the solution.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: in ROBED, we have O and E correct? And R was present but wrong position? So we know the word has O at2, E at4, R at5? And we need letter1 and letter3.\n\nWe can also consider that from the first guess, we had R in the word? And now we know it\'s at5.\n\nFor the next guess, we can try ""TOWER"": if it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T and W.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""POWER"".\n\nBut let\'s think about the letter in position 3: in many words, it\'s W, K, V, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3? Then we test H and M.\n\nBut H and M are also common.\n\nTo maximize information, we might choose a word with letters that are more common? But we have to pick one.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the first guess, CRANE, we had E at5? But now we know E is at4? So that\'s consistent.\n\nIn SERIF, we had E at2? But now we know E is at4? So that\'s why it was wrong.\n\nSimilarly, R was at2 and at3? But now we know it\'s at5.\n\nFor position 1 and 3, we have no information.\n\nI think ""TOWER"" is a good guess because T is a very common starting letter? And W is common in this pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""TOWER"".\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tested T and W? So if we guess ""TOWER"", and it\'s wrong, we know about T and W.\n\nBut we have only two positions? So if we get feedback that T is correct? Then we know position1 is T? And W is in the word? Or not? Then we can guess the next.\n\nSimilarly, if T is not in the word, then we know position1 is not T? And W might be in position3 or not.\n\nBut we have to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But ""TOWER"" has T and W? Both new.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have tested? But we haven\'t tested any of the available letters? So we have to test.\n\nAnother common word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.\n\n""POSER"" has S? Absent.\n\nSo I think ""TOWER"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""TOWER""\n\nBut let\'s write it: T O W E R\n\nPositions: 1-T, 2-O, 3-W, 4-E, 5-R\n\nWe know O and E are fixed? So we are testing T at1 and W at3.\n\nIf the secret word is ""TOWER"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on T and W.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so we have 3 more? But we want to solve it in 4.\n\nBut let\'s do it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: \n  - C (x) → Absent\n  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)\n  - A (x) → Absent\n  - N (x) → Absent\n  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)\n\n- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:\n  - S (x) → Absent\n  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)\n  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)\n  - I (x) → Absent\n  - F (x) → Absent\n\n- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:\n  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)\n  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is O)\n  - B (x) → Absent\n  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is E)\n  - D (x) → Absent\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:\n   - Position 2: **O** (from ROBED ✓)\n   - Position 4: **E** (from ROBED ✓)\n   - The secret word pattern: `_ O _ E _`\n\n2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions)**:\n   - **R**: \n     - Not in position 1 (ROBED: -), 2 (CRANE: -), or 3 (SERIF: -).\n     - Only possible position left is **5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).\n     - Thus, **R must be in position 5**, making the pattern: `_ O _ E R`\n\n3. **Absent Letters**:\n   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D (from all feedback).\n\n4. **Remaining Unknowns**:\n   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.\n   - Available letters (not absent or used): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - Focus on common letters: T, L, M, P, U, W (e.g., words like ""TOWER"", ""POWER"", ""HOMER"").\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The secret word is now `_ O _ E R`.\n- We need to test letters for positions 1 and 3.\n- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits the pattern and tests high-frequency letters (e.g., T, W, P, M) to maximize information or solve.\n- **Chosen word: ""TOWER""**:\n  - T (position 1): Tests a common starting letter.\n  - W (position 3): Tests a common letter in the middle.\n  - O, E, R: Confirmed positions (O at 2, E at 4, R at 5).\n- If ""TOWER"" is correct, we win.

Similarly, from Guess 2, E and R present, now placed.\n\n   We have no other present letters indicated? So the secret word has exactly three of the letters we\'ve guessed? But we have positions 1 and 3 to fill, so there must be two more letters.\n\n   Since we have no other present letters in the feedback (all other letters in the guesses were either absent or placed), the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the letters not yet tested? Or from the ones that were not absent? But we have tested many letters.\n\n   The absent letters are: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W.\n\n   So the available letters are: G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\n   But we need common English letters? So likely: G, H, L, M, P, U, V, Y.\n\n4. **Position 1 and 3:**\n   - We need to form a word: [letter1] O [letter3] E R\n\n   And we know the word must be a valid English word.\n\n   Possible common words that fit this pattern and use the available letters:\n\n   - HOMER: H at1, O at2, M at3, E at4, R at5 → but M is available? And H is available? Yes, not absent.\n   - However, in HOMER, we have H and M.\n\n   Other options:\n   - LOVER: L at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → L and V available.\n   - MOVER: M at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → M and V.\n   - HOVER: H at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → H and V.\n   - JOKER: J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → J and K? But J and K are less common? But valid.\n   - POKER: P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → P and K.\n   - But note: K is available? Yes.\n\n   However, we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\n   Also, note that in the pattern, position 3 must be a letter that can form a word.\n\n   Since we have limited guesses, we can try ""HOMER"" because it uses common letters? Or ""LOVER""?\n\n   But let\'s see: we have not tested H, L, M, P, V, etc.\n\n   We can choose one that tests two new common letters.\n\n   Common letters left: L, M, P, U, V, G, etc.\n\n   We can try ""HOMER"": if it\'s correct, we win.

So we know they are not in the word.\n\n   Now, we have two positions to fill? So we need to guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\n   Since we have only two positions, and we have to find two letters, we can list possible words:\n\n   Possible words of the form ?O?ER:\n\n   - HOMER\n   - LOVER\n   - MOVER\n   - HOVER\n   - JOKER\n   - POKER\n   - COVER → but C absent\n   - MOWER → W absent\n   - POWER → W absent\n   - TOWER → T and W absent\n   - BOXER → B absent\n   - FOYER → F absent? F is absent? Yes, from SERIF.\n\n   So valid: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, and also ""GONER"" but N absent? N is absent? Yes, from CRANE. ""GONER"" has N? G O N E R → N is absent, so invalid.\n\n   ""POSER"": P O S E R → S absent? Yes, from SERIF. Invalid.\n\n   ""ROVER"": R at1? But we know R is at5? And we cannot have R at1? Because in ROBED, R at1 was wrong? So R cannot be at1? So ""ROVER"" would have R at1 and R at5? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R\'s, the feedback might have shown the R at5 as correct? But in ROBED, we didn\'t have R at5? We had R at1, O at2, B at3, E at4, D at5? So D at5? So we don\'t know about R at5? But now we know R is at5? So if we had ""ROVER"", it would have R at1 and R at5? But we know R at1 is wrong? So we cannot have R at1? Therefore, ""ROVER"" is invalid? Because it would require R at1 which we know is not correct? So we avoid.\n\n   Similarly, ""R"" cannot be at position 1? So we don\'t consider words with R at1.\n\n   So back to the list: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER.\n\n   Also, ""BOXER"" invalid, ""JOKER"" and ""POKER"" are valid? But J and K are less common? But possible.\n\n   Another one: ""COMET"" doesn\'t fit pattern? Must end with ER.\n\n   ""DOPER"" has D? Absent.\n\n   ""MOPER"" has M O P E R? But that\'s M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5? So ""MOPER"" is a word? Yes, meaning one who mopes. And M and P are available.\n\n   Similarly, ""HOPED"" has D? Absent.\n\n   ""COPED"" has C and D? Absent.\n\n   So ""MOPER"" is valid: M at1, O at2, P at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n   Similarly, ""HOPES"" has S? Absent.\n\n   So possible words: HOMER, LOVER, MOVER, HOVER, JOKER, POKER, MOPER.\n\n   Now, we need to choose one to guess.\n\n   We can try ""HOMER"" because it\'s a common word? Or ""LOVER""?\n\n   But to maximize information? Since we have two positions, if we guess and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on the two letters? Then we can deduce.\n\n   But we have only two guesses left? We have used 4, so we have 2 more? But we want to solve in 5.\n\n   So let\'s choose a word that uses common letters? H, L, M, P, V.\n\n   We can try ""HOMER"": H at1 and M at3.\n\n   If we guess ""HOMER"" and it\'s wrong, then:\n   - If H is absent, then position1 is not H? And M is absent? Then we know position1 must be L, P, V, etc.? And position3 must be V, P, etc.\n\n   Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"", we test L and V.\n\n   But we don\'t know which is more likely.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? For example, M appears in HOMER, MOVER, MOPER? So if we test M, it might help.\n\n   Similarly, P appears in POKER and MOPER.\n\n   But we have to choose a word.\n\n   I think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n   But let\'s see the feedback from TOWER: we have T and W absent? So we know.\n\n   Another idea: we have not tested the letter U? But in ""HOVER"", we have U? No, ""HOVER"" has H, O, V, E, R? No U.\n\n   ""JOULE"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n   So I think we go with ""HOMER"".\n\n   Therefore, next guess: ""HOMER""\n\n   But note: in ""HOMER"", we have H at position1 and M at position3? And we know O, E, R are correct? So we are testing H and M.\n\n   If the secret word is ""HOMER"", we win.\n\n   If not, we get feedback on H and M.\n\n   But we have only one guess after that? So we need to be careful? But we have two positions? So if we get feedback that H is absent and M is absent? Then we know position1 is not H, position3 is not M? Then we can try another word? Like ""LOVER"" or ""POKER"".\n\n   But we have to hope that it\'s one of the common ones.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests a different set? But I think it\'s fine.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""HOMER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: \n  - C (x) → Absent  \n  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  \n  - A (x) → Absent  \n  - N (x) → Absent  \n  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)  \n\n- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:  \n  - S (x) → Absent  \n  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  \n  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 3)  \n  - I (x) → Absent  \n  - F (x) → Absent  \n\n- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:  \n  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)  \n  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  \n  - B (x) → Absent  \n  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  \n  - D (x) → Absent  \n\n- **Guess 4 (TOWER)**:  \n  - T (x) → Absent  \n  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  \n  - W (x) → Absent  \n  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  \n  - R (✓) → Correct position (position 5 is **R**)  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  \n   - Position 2: **O**  \n   - Position 4: **E**  \n   - Position 5: **R**  \n   - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`  \n\n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W (cannot be in the word).  \n\n3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  \n   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.  \n   - Available letters (not absent): G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  \n   - Common English words fitting `_ O _ E R` include:  \n     - **HOMER** (H at 1, M at 3)  \n     - **LOVER** (L at 1, V at 3)  \n     - **MOVER** (M at 1, V at 3)  \n     - **HOVER** (H at 1, V at 3)  \n     - **POKER** (P at 1, K at 3)  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters (e.g., H, M, L, V) to solve or narrow down positions 1 and 3.  \n- **Chosen word: ""HOMER""**:  \n  - Tests **H** (position 1) and **M** (position 3), both common letters.  \n  - If correct, we solve the word.

We have feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- I: x (absent)
- F: x (absent)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (present, wrong position) → not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- B: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- D: x (absent)

Guess 4: TOWER
- T: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- W: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 5: HOMER
- H: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- M: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED, TOWER, HOMER)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED, TOWER, HOMER)
   - Position 5: R (from TOWER and HOMER)

   So the secret word is: _ O _ E R

2. **Absent letters:**
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W, H, M

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W, H, M.

3. **Remaining available letters:**
   - We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,F,O,B,D,T,W,H,M
   - Available: G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

   But we need common letters: G, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.

4. **The word structure:**
   - The secret word is of the form: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

   We need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

   Possible words:

   - LOVER: L at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → L and V are available? Yes.
   - Other options: 
        - ""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → K is available? Yes, but K is less common? But valid.
        - ""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → J and K? Also valid.
        - ""POWER"": but W is absent? Invalid.
        - ""HOVER"": H is absent? Invalid.
        - ""MOVER"": M is absent? Invalid.
        - ""GONER"": N absent? Invalid.
        - ""BOXER"": B absent? Invalid.

   So ""LOVER"" is a strong candidate because L and V are common? V is medium.

   Also, ""POKER"" is common.

   Another one: ""COVER"" has C? Absent.

   ""ROVER"" has R at1? But we know R is at5? And we cannot have R at1? Because in ROBED, R at1 was wrong? So ""ROVER"" would have R at1 and R at5? But we don't know about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might have shown the R at5 as correct? But in ROBED, we didn't have R at5? We had D at5? So we don't know? But to be safe, we avoid? Because we know R at1 is not correct? So we cannot use R at1? Therefore, ""ROVER"" is invalid? Because it would require R at1 which we know is not correct? So we avoid.

   Similarly, ""R"" cannot be at position 1? So we don't consider words with R at1.

   Another word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.

   ""POSER"": S absent? Invalid.

   ""MOPER"": M absent? Invalid.

   So the only common words left are ""LOVER"" and ""POKER"", and also ""JOKER"".

   We can also consider ""VOTER"": V at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5? But T is absent? From TOWER, T is absent? So invalid.

   ""PIPER"": P at1, I at3? I is absent? From SERIF, I is absent? So invalid.

   ""PALER"": A and L? A absent? Invalid.

   So we have:

   - LOVER: L and V
   - POKER: P and K
   - JOKER: J and K

   Also, ""BOXER"" invalid.

   Another one: ""HOVER"" is invalid because H absent.

   ""GIVEN"" doesn't fit pattern? Must end with ER.

   ""LOWER"": W absent? Invalid.

   So the only realistic options are ""LOVER"", ""POKER"", and ""JOKER"".

   Now, we need to choose one to guess.

   Since we have only one guess left? We have used 5 guesses? So we have one more? But we must get it right.

   We don't know which one? But we can choose the most common word? ""LOVER"" is more common than ""POKER"" and ""JOKER""? Or ""POKER"" is also common.

   But in terms of frequency, ""LOVER"" might be more common? But both are valid.

   Alternatively, we can see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more likely? But we have no information.

   We can also consider that in the available letters, L is more common than P? And V is less common? But we don't know.

   But note: we have not tested L, V, P, K, J, etc.

   We have to pick one.

   I think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter? And V is the only other option? But we have P and K as well.

   But let's list the possibilities:

   - If we guess ""LOVER"" and it's correct, we win.
   - If not, then we know that L and V are not in the word? Then the word must be ""POKER"" or ""JOKER""? But we have only one guess left? So if we guess ""LOVER"" and it's wrong, we know that position1 must be P or J? And position3 must be K? Because ""POKER"" and ""JOKER"" both have K at position3? So if ""LOVER"" is wrong, then the word must be either ""POKER"" or ""JOKER""? But we have only one guess left? So we cannot guess both? We would have to choose between P and J for position1? But we don't know which? So we might lose.

   Alternatively, we can guess ""POKER"" first? Then if it's wrong, we know it must be ""LOVER"" or ""JOKER""? But again, we have to choose.

   But we have only one guess? We have used 5 guesses, so we have one more? So we must get it right.

   Therefore, we need to guess a word that, if wrong, will give us enough information to deduce? But we have no more guesses? So we must guess the correct word.

   But we don't know which of the three it is? ""LOVER"", ""POKER"", ""JOKER""? Or are there more?

   Another word: ""COVER"" is invalid? C absent.

   ""MOVER"" invalid? M absent.

   ""HOVER"" invalid? H absent.

   ""VOTER"" invalid? T absent.

   ""PAPER"" has A and P? A absent? Invalid.

   ""LIVER"" has I? I absent? From SERIF? Invalid.

   ""LATER"" has A? Absent.

   So only three possibilities: ""LOVER"", ""POKER"", ""JOKER"".

   But ""JOKER"" is a proper noun? But in word games, it is often accepted? So we assume it's valid.

   Now, to decide, we can consider the frequency of the words? ""LOVER"" is more common than ""POKER"" and ""JOKER""? Or ""POKER"" is also common.

   But in the context, we have to pick one.

   Alternatively, we can see that in the first guess, we had E and R? And now we have them placed.

   We have no other information.

   I think ""LOVER"" is the most common word? So I'll go with that.

   But let's think: we have not tested L, V, P, K, J? So we don't know.

   But we have to choose.

   So I choose ""LOVER"".

   Therefore, next guess: ""LOVER""

   But note: if it's not ""LOVER"", we lose? But we have to try.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of the possibilities? But that would be wasteful? Because we have to guess one of the three? So we should guess one.

   So I'll go with ""LOVER"".### Final Deductions

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ E R`  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W, H, M  
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  
- **Possible valid words**:  
  - **LOVER** (L at 1, V at 3)  
  - **POKER** (P at 1, K at 3)

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - C (x) → Absent  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 2)  
  - A (x) → Absent  
  - N (x) → Absent  
  - E (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 5)  

- **Guess 2 (SERIF)**:

  - I (x) → Absent  
  - F (x) → Absent  

- **Guess 3 (ROBED)**:  
  - R (-) → Present, wrong position (not position 1)  
  - O (✓) → Correct position (position 2 is **O**)  
  - B (x) → Absent  
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  
  - D (x) → Absent

  - M (x) → Absent  
  - E (✓) → Correct position (position 4 is **E**)  
  - R (✓) → Correct position (position 5 is **R**)  

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 4: **E**  
   - Position 5: **R**  
   - Secret word pattern: `[?] O [?] E R`  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W, H, M (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled.  
   - Available letters (not absent): G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
   - Common English words fitting `[?] O [?] E R`:  
     - **LOVER** (L at 1, V at 3)  
     - **POKER** (P at 1, K at 3)  
     - **JOKER** (J at 1, K at 3)  

### Strategy for Final Guess:
- **Goal**: Guess the most probable word from the valid options.  
- **Chosen word: ""LOVER""**:  
  - ""LOVER"" is the most common word among the options (vs. ""POKER"" or ""JOKER"").  
  - Tests **L** (position 1) and **V** (position 3), which are high-frequency letters.  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.  

<guess>LOVER</guess>",LOVER,"We have feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)

Guess 2: SERIF
- S: x (absent)
- E: - (present, wrong position)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- I: x (absent)
- F: x (absent)

Guess 3: ROBED
- R: - (present, wrong position) → not in position 1
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- B: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- D: x (absent)

Guess 4: TOWER
- T: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- W: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 5: HOMER
- H: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- M: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 5)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from ROBED, TOWER, HOMER)
   - Position 4: E (from ROBED, TOWER, HOMER)
   - Position 5: R (from TOWER and HOMER)

   So the secret word is: _ O _ E R

2. **Absent letters:**
   - From all guesses: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W, H, M

   So absent letters: C, A, N, S, I, F, B, D, T, W, H, M.

3. **Remaining available letters:**
   - We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,F,O,B,D,T,W,H,M
   - Available: G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

   But we need common letters: G, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.

4. **The word structure:**
   - The secret word is of the form: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

   We need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

   Possible words:

   - LOVER: L at1, O at2, V at3, E at4, R at5 → L and V are available? Yes.
   - Other options: 
        - ""POKER"": P at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → K is available? Yes, but K is less common? But valid.
        - ""JOKER"": J at1, O at2, K at3, E at4, R at5 → J and K? Also valid.
        - ""POWER"": but W is absent? Invalid.
        - ""HOVER"": H is absent? Invalid.
        - ""MOVER"": M is absent? Invalid.
        - ""GONER"": N absent? Invalid.
        - ""BOXER"": B absent? Invalid.

   So ""LOVER"" is a strong candidate because L and V are common? V is medium.

   Also, ""POKER"" is common.

   Another one: ""COVER"" has C? Absent.

   ""ROVER"" has R at1? But we know R is at5? And we cannot have R at1? Because in ROBED, R at1 was wrong? So ""ROVER"" would have R at1 and R at5? But we don't know about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ROBED, we had R at1 and it was present but wrong position? So if the word had two R's, the feedback might have shown the R at5 as correct? But in ROBED, we didn't have R at5? We had D at5? So we don't know? But to be safe, we avoid? Because we know R at1 is not correct? So we cannot use R at1? Therefore, ""ROVER"" is invalid? Because it would require R at1 which we know is not correct? So we avoid.

   Similarly, ""R"" cannot be at position 1? So we don't consider words with R at1.

   Another word: ""LONER"" has N? Absent.

   ""POSER"": S absent? Invalid.

   ""MOPER"": M absent? Invalid.

   So the only common words left are ""LOVER"" and ""POKER"", and also ""JOKER"".

   We can also consider ""VOTER"": V at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5? But T is absent? From TOWER, T is absent? So invalid.

   ""PIPER"": P at1, I at3? I is absent? From SERIF, I is absent? So invalid.

   ""PALER"": A and L? A absent? Invalid.

   So we have:

   - LOVER: L and V
   - POKER: P and K
   - JOKER: J and K

   Also, ""BOXER"" invalid.

   Another one: ""HOVER"" is invalid because H absent.

   ""GIVEN"" doesn't fit pattern? Must end with ER.

   ""LOWER"": W absent? Invalid.

   So the only realistic options are ""LOVER"", ""POKER"", and ""JOKER"".

   Now, we need to choose one to guess.

   Since we have only one guess left? We have used 5 guesses? So we have one more? But we must get it right.

   We don't know which one? But we can choose the most common word? ""LOVER"" is more common than ""POKER"" and ""JOKER""? Or ""POKER"" is also common.

   But in terms of frequency, ""LOVER"" might be more common? But both are valid.

   Alternatively, we can see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be more likely? But we have no information.

   We can also consider that in the available letters, L is more common than P? And V is less common? But we don't know.

   But note: we have not tested L, V, P, K, J, etc.

   We have to pick one.

   I think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter? And V is the only other option? But we have P and K as well.

   But let's list the possibilities:

   - If we guess ""LOVER"" and it's correct, we win.
   - If not, then we know that L and V are not in the word? Then the word must be ""POKER"" or ""JOKER""? But we have only one guess left? So if we guess ""LOVER"" and it's wrong, we know that position1 must be P or J? And position3 must be K? Because ""POKER"" and ""JOKER"" both have K at position3? So if ""LOVER"" is wrong, then the word must be either ""POKER"" or ""JOKER""? But we have only one guess left? So we cannot guess both? We would have to choose between P and J for position1? But we don't know which? So we might lose.

   Alternatively, we can guess ""POKER"" first? Then if it's wrong, we know it must be ""LOVER"" or ""JOKER""? But again, we have to choose.

   But we have only one guess? We have used 5 guesses, so we have one more? So we must get it right.

   Therefore, we need to guess a word that, if wrong, will give us enough information to deduce? But we have no more guesses? So we must guess the correct word.

   But we don't know which of the three it is? ""LOVER"", ""POKER"", ""JOKER""? Or are there more?

   Another word: ""COVER"" is invalid? C absent.

   ""MOVER"" invalid? M absent.

   ""HOVER"" invalid? H absent.

   ""VOTER"" invalid? T absent.

   ""PAPER"" has A and P? A absent? Invalid.

   ""LIVER"" has I? I absent? From SERIF? Invalid.

   ""LATER"" has A? Absent.

   So only three possibilities: ""LOVER"", ""POKER"", ""JOKER"".

   But ""JOKER"" is a proper noun? But in word games, it is often accepted? So we assume it's valid.

   Now, to decide, we can consider the frequency of the words? ""LOVER"" is more common than ""POKER"" and ""JOKER""? Or ""POKER"" is also common.

   But in the context, we have to pick one.

   Alternatively, we can see that in the first guess, we had E and R? And now we have them placed.

   We have no other information.

   I think ""LOVER"" is the most common word? So I'll go with that.

   But let's think: we have not tested L, V, P, K, J? So we don't know.

   But we have to choose.

   So I choose ""LOVER"".

   Therefore, next guess: ""LOVER""

   But note: if it's not ""LOVER"", we lose? But we have to try.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of the possibilities? But that would be wasteful? Because we have to guess one of the three? So we should guess one.

   So I'll go with ""LOVER"".### Final Deductions
