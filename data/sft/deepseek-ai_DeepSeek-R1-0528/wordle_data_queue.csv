I'm making my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I need a strategic starting word that maximizes information. A good starter should:
- Contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters
- Cover frequent letters in English 5-letter words

I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are distinct

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (at the end, since E is the 5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since the word ends with E, we can think of words that have the pattern ...E.

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
   - Ends with E (to confirm the position, but we already know E is at the end, so we can use this to test other letters)
   - Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, D, U, etc.)

 We also note that the first four letters of ""crane"" were all absent, so we have eliminated 4 letters.

 Let's think of a word that ends with E and uses new letters.

 Some common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to include as many of the common consonants and vowels as possible.

 Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but less common)

 Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""SLATE"" - but note that A is already eliminated (from first guess: A(x)), so we cannot use A.
   ""POISE"" - uses O, I, S, and ends with E. But we must avoid A and N? Actually, we avoid A and N, but O, I, S are new.

 However, we must avoid A and N? Yes, because they are not in the word.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said A(x) and N(x), meaning they are not in the word. So we cannot use A or N.

 Let's try to form a word without A, N, C, R.

 Possible words: 
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)
   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E
   ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E
   ""TOISE"" is not a word? But ""TOUSE"" is not common. 
   ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E (but Q is less common and we might want to test more common letters first)

 Another idea: ""SLIME"" -> but we cannot use A? Actually, we can use any letter except C, R, A, N. But note: S, L, I, M are allowed.

 However, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list some common words ending in E without A, N, C, R:
   ""SLICE"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.
   ""SLIDE"" -> S, L, I, D, E -> all new letters? Yes, and D is a common letter.

 But note: we have E at the end, so we are using E again. That's okay because we know it's there.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E in the middle? But we know E is at the end, so we can only use E at the end.

 So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

 We have to choose 4 new letters (from the remaining alphabet without C, R, A, N).

 Let's choose a word that tests common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 I think ""SLIDE"" is a good candidate: 
   S, L, I, D, E

 But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

 Another option: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> also good.

 Or ""SHINE"" -> but H is less common? And we have to avoid N? Wait, N is eliminated. So ""SHINE"" has N -> not allowed.

 How about ""STOLE""? -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are common.

 But note: we have two vowels in ""STOLE"": O and E (at the end). We already know E is at the end, so we are testing O.

 Alternatively, ""SOUTH"" -> but it doesn't end with E? We must end with E.

 So let's stick to words ending in E.

 I think ""SLIDE"" and ""SPITE"" are both good. But let's see which one uses more common letters.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the word.

 Since we don't know which letters are present (except E at the end), we can choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated A, N, R, and we know E is at the end).

 So the next most common available: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, D, L.

 But we only have 4 positions (since the last is E).

 I think ""TOISE"" is not a word. But ""TOUCH"" doesn't end with E.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> tests S, T, O, L.

 Or ""SPILE"" (which is a word: a spile is a spout for tapping sap from a tree) -> S, P, I, L, E.

 But P is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.

 So I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word. But we are testing it.

 Another common word: ""SHIRE"" -> but R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words with R.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and ending with E:

   ""STOLE"" -> valid
   ""SPITE"" -> valid
   ""SLIME"" -> valid
   ""SLIDE"" -> valid
   ""POISE"" -> valid
   ""MOUSE"" -> valid
   ""HOUSE"" -> valid

 Among these, which one has the most common letters? 

 We want to test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

 ""STOLE"" has T and O and L and S.

 ""SPITE"" has T and I and S and P.

 ""SLIDE"" has L and I and D and S.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, L, S, which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing the positions. We have:

   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E (known)

 We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has two of the same common letter? But we don't know, and we want to test as many distinct letters as possible.

 Since we have 4 new letters, that's good.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So I will guess ""STOLE"".
</think>
<thoughts>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓)
- C, R, A, N are absent (x)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word ends with E (pattern: \_ \_ \_ \_ E).
2. The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.
3. The word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).
- Test the E position again (though confirmed) to focus on new letters.
- ""STOLE"" is a strong choice: 
  - Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L.
  - Tests positions 1-4 with high-frequency consonants/vowels.
  - Ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
  - Valid 5-letter word without eliminated letters.

 However, we must avoid A and N? Yes, because they are not in the word.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said A(x) and N(x), meaning they are not in the word. So we cannot use A or N.

 Let's try to form a word without A, N, C, R.

 Possible words: 
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)
   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E
   ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E
   ""TOISE"" is not a word? But ""TOUSE"" is not common. 
   ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E (but Q is less common and we might want to test more common letters first)

 Another idea: ""SLIME"" -> but we cannot use A? Actually, we can use any letter except C, R, A, N. But note: S, L, I, M are allowed.

 However, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list some common words ending in E without A, N, C, R:
   ""SLICE"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.
   ""SLIDE"" -> S, L, I, D, E -> all new letters? Yes, and D is a common letter.

 But note: we have E at the end, so we are using E again. That's okay because we know it's there.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E in the middle? But we know E is at the end, so we can only use E at the end.

 So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

 We have to choose 4 new letters (from the remaining alphabet without C, R, A, N).

 Let's choose a word that tests common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 I think ""SLIDE"" is a good candidate: 
   S, L, I, D, E

 But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

 Another option: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> also good.

 Or ""SHINE"" -> but H is less common? And we have to avoid N? Wait, N is eliminated. So ""SHINE"" has N -> not allowed.

 How about ""STOLE""? -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are common.

 But note: we have two vowels in ""STOLE"": O and E (at the end). We already know E is at the end, so we are testing O.

 Alternatively, ""SOUTH"" -> but it doesn't end with E? We must end with E.

 So let's stick to words ending in E.

 I think ""SLIDE"" and ""SPITE"" are both good. But let's see which one uses more common letters.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the word.

 Since we don't know which letters are present (except E at the end), we can choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated A, N, R, and we know E is at the end).

 So the next most common available: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, D, L.

 But we only have 4 positions (since the last is E).

 I think ""TOISE"" is not a word. But ""TOUCH"" doesn't end with E.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> tests S, T, O, L.

 Or ""SPILE"" (which is a word: a spile is a spout for tapping sap from a tree) -> S, P, I, L, E.

 But P is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.

 So I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word. But we are testing it.

 Another common word: ""SHIRE"" -> but R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words with R.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and ending with E:

   ""STOLE"" -> valid
   ""SPITE"" -> valid
   ""SLIME"" -> valid
   ""SLIDE"" -> valid
   ""POISE"" -> valid
   ""MOUSE"" -> valid
   ""HOUSE"" -> valid

 Among these, which one has the most common letters? 

 We want to test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

 ""STOLE"" has T and O and L and S.

 ""SPITE"" has T and I and S and P.

 ""SLIDE"" has L and I and D and S.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, L, S, which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing the positions. We have:

   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E (known)

 We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has two of the same common letter? But we don't know, and we want to test as many distinct letters as possible.

 Since we have 4 new letters, that's good.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So I will guess ""STOLE"".<thoughts>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓)
- C, R, A, N are absent (x)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word ends with E (pattern: \_ \_ \_ \_ E).
2. The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.
3. The word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).
- Test the E position again (though confirmed) to focus on new letters.
- ""STOLE"" is a strong choice: 
  - Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L.
  - Tests positions 1-4 with high-frequency consonants/vowels.
  - Ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
  - Valid 5-letter word without eliminated letters.

We have new feedback for the second guess ""stole"": S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)

Combining with previous feedback (from ""crane""):
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L
- Correct position: E is at position 5 (the last letter)

The secret word is: _ _ _ _ E

We now have 8 eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, using only these remaining letters.

Common vowels we have left: I, U (since E is already at the end, and we've eliminated A and O)

We should try to include vowels (like I or U) and common consonants from the remaining set.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.

Possible word structures: 
  - The first four letters must be from the remaining set, and the fifth is E.

Examples:
  ""BIBLE"" - but B repeats? But we don't know if repetitions are allowed? However, the feedback rules don't prevent repeated letters, so it's possible. But in this case, we don't have feedback about B yet.
  However, ""BIBLE"" would be a 5-letter word? Actually, BIBLE is 5 letters: B-I-B-L-E, but L is eliminated. So we can't use L.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

Try to think of words ending with E without C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

Consider:
  ""BIKE"" - too short. We need 5 letters.
  ""PIKE"" - same? No, PIKE is 4 letters.

5-letter words:
  ""QUIET"" - but Q-U-I-E-T? But ""QUIET"" ends with T, not E. And we need ...E.

What about ""PRIME""? But PRIME has P, R, I, M, E -> R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So not allowed.

""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E -> but U and I are vowels available. Letters G,U,I,D,E. 
But D is available. And E at the end. But also note: we have E as the last letter, so ""GUIDE"" would be: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, D4, E5.

But we have eliminated: none of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So G,U,I,D are available.

So ""GUIDE"" is a candidate.

Other words:
  ""HONEY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""MOVIE"" -> M-O-V-I-E, but O is eliminated? O is eliminated (from ""stole"" feedback: O(x)). So not allowed.
  ""JUICE"" -> J-U-I-C-E, but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated.

Let me check available vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y).

We can try ""GUIDE"", ""QUITE"", but note Q: 
  ""QUITE"": Q-U-I-T-E, but T is eliminated? From ""stole"": T(x), so T is eliminated. So we cannot use T.

Therefore, ""QUITE"" is invalid.

""BUY"": too short.

Other possibilities:
  ""DWINE"" is archaic and rare? Not common.
  ""EGGED"" has double G, but E is already at the end? We need ...E. EGGED: E-G-G-E-D -> doesn't end with E? Actually, it ends with D.

Better to stick with common words.

Another candidate: ""PUICE"" is not a word.

What about ""FUZZY""? Doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""BOWIE"" -> B-O-W-I-E, but O is eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

List: 
Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need a word of the form: [letter from available] [letter from available] [letter from available] [letter from available] E

We can use:
  ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D -> available? Yes.

  ""WHINE"": not allowed because H and W are available, but N is eliminated? N is eliminated from first guess.

  ""PHONE"": has O (eliminated) and N (eliminated).

  ""MIXED"": M,I,X,E,D -> but E is at position 4? Then D at 5. We want E at 5. So ends with D? Not E.

  ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

  ""WIPED"" is W-I-P-E-D -> pattern: _ _ _ _ E -> does not satisfy because the fifth letter must be E.

  ""GIVEN"": has N? Eliminated.

Another idea: ""BIDE"": too short? BIDE is 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""ABIDE"" has A (eliminated).

""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> but E is at the end? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5 -> ends with E? Yes. But we already know E is at 5? Yes, and we have E again at position 2? That's allowed. But note: we have eliminated letters: B,E,I,G? E is in the word, but we know it's at position 5. We don't know if it's elsewhere.

But ""BEIGE"": 
  Is it a valid word? Yes.
  Letters: B, E, I, G, E -> but note that E is used twice.

We have to avoid A, N, C, R, S, T, O, L.

B, E, I, G are available (since E is already confirmed in the word, but we don't know about duplicates).

However, the word must be a valid 5-letter word. ""BEIGE"" starts with B and ends with E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5.

But note: we have E at position 2? We don't know if that is correct or not. But we are allowed to have multiple E's? Yes.

But in feedback, if the E is at position 2 and it is present but not correct? Or if it's correct? We'll get feedback.

But we have eliminated letters: no. But let's see: ""BEIGE"" uses B, E, I, G. All available? Yes, because eliminated so far: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

So ""BEIGE"" is a candidate.

But we can also consider ""DEUCE"": but E is at the end? D-E-U-C-E -> but C is eliminated? Yes.

""BIKED"": not a word? Or BIKED: 5 letters? B-I-K-E-D -> ends with D.

""JUKED"": but J, U, K, E, D -> ends with D? Not E.

""GRIME"": G-R-I-M-E -> R is eliminated? Yes.

""MIXED"": M-I-X-E-D -> ends with D.

""MUMMY"": not E ending.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> L is eliminated? Yes. And doesn't end with E.

Therefore, the best common word I can think of is ""GUIDE"". 

But note: we have E at the end, so we can also try words that might have E elsewhere? But we don't know. However, since E is at the end, we are using the fifth position correctly.

Another candidate: ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> letters P,I,Q,U,E -> available? Yes. And ends with E? Yes.

""PIQUE"" is a valid word.

But Q is less common? But we have to use what we have.

We can also consider ""VIBEX"" - is that a word? Probably not.

""QUIFF""? Ends with F.

""BUMPY"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""BEGEM"" is archaic? Not common.

I think ""GUIDE"" and ""PIQUE"" are both valid.

Which one to choose? 

""GUIDE"": uses G,U,I,D -> common letters? U is a vowel, I is a vowel, G and D are common consonants.

""PIQUE"": uses P,I,Q,U -> Q is uncommon, so it might give less information? But we'll test Q.

But if we can test more common letters? Among available, D is more common than Q.

Ranking of common letters: 
  From the English frequency, the available letters by frequency:

  Among remaining: I (frequent), U, D, M, H, P, B, G, Y, etc. Q is very low.

So ""GUIDE"" uses:
  G: common, U: not as common, I: common, D: common.
  ""PIQUE"" uses: P: moderately common, I: common, Q: rare, U: moderately common.

We want to maximize hit probability? So ""GUIDE"" might be better because D and G are tested.

But note also: we are testing for positions 1-4.

Therefore, I think ""GUIDE"" is a better choice.

But what about ""BIDED""? B,I,D,E,D -> but E is at position 4? Then D at the end? So it ends with D, not E -> invalid pattern.

What about ""IMBUE""? I-M-B-U-E -> ends with E? The fifth letter is E? I-M-B-U-E: positions: I1, M2, B3, U4, E5 -> yes, ends with E.

""IMBUE"" is a valid word: letters I,M,B,U,E -> all available? Yes, and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

But it uses two vowels (I,U) and consonants M,B.

So we have more candidates: ""GUIDE"", ""PIQUE"", ""IMBUE"", ""BEIGE"".

Among these, let's rank by letter frequency and coverage.

We have only 6 guesses, and this is our third. We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Which letters can we cover? For example:

GUIDE: G,U,I,D
PIQUE: P,I,Q,U
IMBUE: I,M,B,U
BEIGE: B,E,I,G (but E is already known to be present at the end, but we test E at position 2)

In ""BEIGE"", we are testing E at position 2: if we get x for E at position 2, we know there's only one E (at the end)? Or it could be present but wrong position? But wait, the feedback for E at position 2 would be '-' if the word has another E? But the word might have two E's? We don't know.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so testing multiple E's is okay.

But why not: we can get more information from ""BEIGE""?

However, we are limited by tries.

I think ""GUIDE"" is a solid choice because it uses D and G, which are more common than Q or M? Actually, M is also common.

To break the tie:

We can also consider that in ""GUIDE"", the U is at position 2? We don't know if that's good.

But overall, I think ""GUIDE"" is a common word and will give us information.

So I'll go with ""GUIDE"".<thoughts>
The feedback reveals:
- ""crane"" eliminated C,R,A,N and confirmed E(✓) at position 5.
- ""stole"" eliminated S,T,O,L and reconfirmed E(✓) at position 5.

So the secret word ends in E and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending in E.
- Must use only letters not eliminated: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
- Aim to test common remaining letters: especially vowels (I,U) and frequent consonants (D,G,H,M,P).
- ""GUIDE"" is selected because:
  - Uses G,U,I,D,E (E confirmed at end).
  - Covers common consonants (G,D) and vowels (U,I).
  - Avoids eliminated letters.
  - Valid common English word.

- Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)<br>
- Guess 2: stole → S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)<br>

**Deductions:**
1. **E is confirmed** at position 5 (since ✓ in last position both times).
2. **Eliminated letters (8 total):** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (all marked ""x"").
3. **Remaining letters:** B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E  
   (4 unknown positions using only the remaining letters).

**Strategy for this guess:**
- Test **common vowels** from the remaining set (I, U) and **common consonants** (D, G, M, P).
- Prioritize words ending with E that avoid eliminated letters.
- Choose a word that maximizes coverage of high-frequency remaining letters.
- **""GUIDE""** is ideal:
  - Ends with E (position 5 confirmed) → provides feedback on positions 1-4.
  - Uses 4 new/untested letters: **G, U, I, D** (all high-frequency available letters).
  - Valid English word: avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

<guess>guide</guess>",guide,"We have new feedback for the second guess ""stole"": S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)

Combining with previous feedback (from ""crane""):
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L
- Correct position: E is at position 5 (the last letter)

The secret word is: _ _ _ _ E

We now have 8 eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, using only these remaining letters.

Common vowels we have left: I, U (since E is already at the end, and we've eliminated A and O)

We should try to include vowels (like I or U) and common consonants from the remaining set.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.

Possible word structures: 
  - The first four letters must be from the remaining set, and the fifth is E.

Examples:
  ""BIBLE"" - but B repeats? But we don't know if repetitions are allowed? However, the feedback rules don't prevent repeated letters, so it's possible. But in this case, we don't have feedback about B yet.
  However, ""BIBLE"" would be a 5-letter word? Actually, BIBLE is 5 letters: B-I-B-L-E, but L is eliminated. So we can't use L.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

Try to think of words ending with E without C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

Consider:
  ""BIKE"" - too short. We need 5 letters.
  ""PIKE"" - same? No, PIKE is 4 letters.

5-letter words:
  ""QUIET"" - but Q-U-I-E-T? But ""QUIET"" ends with T, not E. And we need ...E.

What about ""PRIME""? But PRIME has P, R, I, M, E -> R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So not allowed.

""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E -> but U and I are vowels available. Letters G,U,I,D,E. 
But D is available. And E at the end. But also note: we have E as the last letter, so ""GUIDE"" would be: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, D4, E5.

But we have eliminated: none of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So G,U,I,D are available.

So ""GUIDE"" is a candidate.

Other words:
  ""HONEY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""MOVIE"" -> M-O-V-I-E, but O is eliminated? O is eliminated (from ""stole"" feedback: O(x)). So not allowed.
  ""JUICE"" -> J-U-I-C-E, but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated.

Let me check available vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y).

We can try ""GUIDE"", ""QUITE"", but note Q: 
  ""QUITE"": Q-U-I-T-E, but T is eliminated? From ""stole"": T(x), so T is eliminated. So we cannot use T.

Therefore, ""QUITE"" is invalid.

""BUY"": too short.

Other possibilities:
  ""DWINE"" is archaic and rare? Not common.
  ""EGGED"" has double G, but E is already at the end? We need ...E. EGGED: E-G-G-E-D -> doesn't end with E? Actually, it ends with D.

Better to stick with common words.

Another candidate: ""PUICE"" is not a word.

What about ""FUZZY""? Doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""BOWIE"" -> B-O-W-I-E, but O is eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

List: 
Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need a word of the form: [letter from available] [letter from available] [letter from available] [letter from available] E

We can use:
  ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D -> available? Yes.

  ""WHINE"": not allowed because H and W are available, but N is eliminated? N is eliminated from first guess.

  ""PHONE"": has O (eliminated) and N (eliminated).

  ""MIXED"": M,I,X,E,D -> but E is at position 4? Then D at 5. We want E at 5. So ends with D? Not E.

  ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

  ""WIPED"" is W-I-P-E-D -> pattern: _ _ _ _ E -> does not satisfy because the fifth letter must be E.

  ""GIVEN"": has N? Eliminated.

Another idea: ""BIDE"": too short? BIDE is 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""ABIDE"" has A (eliminated).

""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> but E is at the end? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5 -> ends with E? Yes. But we already know E is at 5? Yes, and we have E again at position 2? That's allowed. But note: we have eliminated letters: B,E,I,G? E is in the word, but we know it's at position 5. We don't know if it's elsewhere.

But ""BEIGE"": 
  Is it a valid word? Yes.
  Letters: B, E, I, G, E -> but note that E is used twice.

We have to avoid A, N, C, R, S, T, O, L.

B, E, I, G are available (since E is already confirmed in the word, but we don't know about duplicates).

However, the word must be a valid 5-letter word. ""BEIGE"" starts with B and ends with E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5.

But note: we have E at position 2? We don't know if that is correct or not. But we are allowed to have multiple E's? Yes.

But in feedback, if the E is at position 2 and it is present but not correct? Or if it's correct? We'll get feedback.

But we have eliminated letters: no. But let's see: ""BEIGE"" uses B, E, I, G. All available? Yes, because eliminated so far: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

So ""BEIGE"" is a candidate.

But we can also consider ""DEUCE"": but E is at the end? D-E-U-C-E -> but C is eliminated? Yes.

""BIKED"": not a word? Or BIKED: 5 letters? B-I-K-E-D -> ends with D.

""JUKED"": but J, U, K, E, D -> ends with D? Not E.

""GRIME"": G-R-I-M-E -> R is eliminated? Yes.

""MIXED"": M-I-X-E-D -> ends with D.

""MUMMY"": not E ending.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> L is eliminated? Yes. And doesn't end with E.

Therefore, the best common word I can think of is ""GUIDE"". 

But note: we have E at the end, so we can also try words that might have E elsewhere? But we don't know. However, since E is at the end, we are using the fifth position correctly.

Another candidate: ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> letters P,I,Q,U,E -> available? Yes. And ends with E? Yes.

""PIQUE"" is a valid word.

But Q is less common? But we have to use what we have.

We can also consider ""VIBEX"" - is that a word? Probably not.

""QUIFF""? Ends with F.

""BUMPY"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""BEGEM"" is archaic? Not common.

I think ""GUIDE"" and ""PIQUE"" are both valid.

Which one to choose? 

""GUIDE"": uses G,U,I,D -> common letters? U is a vowel, I is a vowel, G and D are common consonants.

""PIQUE"": uses P,I,Q,U -> Q is uncommon, so it might give less information? But we'll test Q.

But if we can test more common letters? Among available, D is more common than Q.

Ranking of common letters: 
  From the English frequency, the available letters by frequency:

  Among remaining: I (frequent), U, D, M, H, P, B, G, Y, etc. Q is very low.

So ""GUIDE"" uses:
  G: common, U: not as common, I: common, D: common.
  ""PIQUE"" uses: P: moderately common, I: common, Q: rare, U: moderately common.

We want to maximize hit probability? So ""GUIDE"" might be better because D and G are tested.

But note also: we are testing for positions 1-4.

Therefore, I think ""GUIDE"" is a better choice.

But what about ""BIDED""? B,I,D,E,D -> but E is at position 4? Then D at the end? So it ends with D, not E -> invalid pattern.

What about ""IMBUE""? I-M-B-U-E -> ends with E? The fifth letter is E? I-M-B-U-E: positions: I1, M2, B3, U4, E5 -> yes, ends with E.

""IMBUE"" is a valid word: letters I,M,B,U,E -> all available? Yes, and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

But it uses two vowels (I,U) and consonants M,B.

So we have more candidates: ""GUIDE"", ""PIQUE"", ""IMBUE"", ""BEIGE"".

Among these, let's rank by letter frequency and coverage.

We have only 6 guesses, and this is our third. We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Which letters can we cover? For example:

GUIDE: G,U,I,D
PIQUE: P,I,Q,U
IMBUE: I,M,B,U
BEIGE: B,E,I,G (but E is already known to be present at the end, but we test E at position 2)

In ""BEIGE"", we are testing E at position 2: if we get x for E at position 2, we know there's only one E (at the end)? Or it could be present but wrong position? But wait, the feedback for E at position 2 would be '-' if the word has another E? But the word might have two E's? We don't know.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so testing multiple E's is okay.

But why not: we can get more information from ""BEIGE""?

However, we are limited by tries.

I think ""GUIDE"" is a solid choice because it uses D and G, which are more common than Q or M? Actually, M is also common.

To break the tie:

We can also consider that in ""GUIDE"", the U is at position 2? We don't know if that's good.

But overall, I think ""GUIDE"" is a common word and will give us information.

So I'll go with ""GUIDE"".<thoughts>
The feedback reveals:
- ""crane"" eliminated C,R,A,N and confirmed E(✓) at position 5.
- ""stole"" eliminated S,T,O,L and reconfirmed E(✓) at position 5.

So the secret word ends in E and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending in E.
- Must use only letters not eliminated: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
- Aim to test common remaining letters: especially vowels (I,U) and frequent consonants (D,G,H,M,P).
- ""GUIDE"" is selected because:
  - Uses G,U,I,D,E (E confirmed at end).
  - Covers common consonants (G,D) and vowels (U,I).
  - Avoids eliminated letters.
  - Valid common English word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".<thoughts>
I'm making my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I need a strategic starting word that maximizes information. A good starter should:
- Contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters
- Cover frequent letters in English 5-letter words

I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are distinct
- C, R, A, N, and E are all in the top 10 most frequent letters in English words
This will provide clear feedback about the presence/absence of these key letters and their positions.
</thoughts>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (at the end, since E is the 5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since the word ends with E, we can think of words that have the pattern ...E.

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
   - Ends with E (to confirm the position, but we already know E is at the end, so we can use this to test other letters)
   - Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, I, S, L, D, U, etc.)

 We also note that the first four letters of ""crane"" were all absent, so we have eliminated 4 letters.

 Let's think of a word that ends with E and uses new letters.

 Some common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to include as many of the common consonants and vowels as possible.

 Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but less common)

 Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""SLATE"" - but note that A is already eliminated (from first guess: A(x)), so we cannot use A.
   ""POISE"" - uses O, I, S, and ends with E. But we must avoid A and N? Actually, we avoid A and N, but O, I, S are new.

 However, we must avoid A and N? Yes, because they are not in the word.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said A(x) and N(x), meaning they are not in the word. So we cannot use A or N.

 Let's try to form a word without A, N, C, R.

 Possible words: 
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)
   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E
   ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E
   ""TOISE"" is not a word? But ""TOUSE"" is not common. 
   ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E (but Q is less common and we might want to test more common letters first)

 Another idea: ""SLIME"" -> but we cannot use A? Actually, we can use any letter except C, R, A, N. But note: S, L, I, M are allowed.

 However, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list some common words ending in E without A, N, C, R:
   ""SLICE"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.
   ""SLIDE"" -> S, L, I, D, E -> all new letters? Yes, and D is a common letter.

 But note: we have E at the end, so we are using E again. That's okay because we know it's there.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E in the middle? But we know E is at the end, so we can only use E at the end.

 So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

 We have to choose 4 new letters (from the remaining alphabet without C, R, A, N).

 Let's choose a word that tests common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 I think ""SLIDE"" is a good candidate: 
   S, L, I, D, E

 But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

 Another option: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> also good.

 Or ""SHINE"" -> but H is less common? And we have to avoid N? Wait, N is eliminated. So ""SHINE"" has N -> not allowed.

 How about ""STOLE""? -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are common.

 But note: we have two vowels in ""STOLE"": O and E (at the end). We already know E is at the end, so we are testing O.

 Alternatively, ""SOUTH"" -> but it doesn't end with E? We must end with E.

 So let's stick to words ending in E.

 I think ""SLIDE"" and ""SPITE"" are both good. But let's see which one uses more common letters.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the word.

 Since we don't know which letters are present (except E at the end), we can choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated A, N, R, and we know E is at the end).

 So the next most common available: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, D, L.

 But we only have 4 positions (since the last is E).

 I think ""TOISE"" is not a word. But ""TOUCH"" doesn't end with E.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> tests S, T, O, L.

 Or ""SPILE"" (which is a word: a spile is a spout for tapping sap from a tree) -> S, P, I, L, E.

 But P is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.

 So I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word. But we are testing it.

 Another common word: ""SHIRE"" -> but R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words with R.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and ending with E:

   ""STOLE"" -> valid
   ""SPITE"" -> valid
   ""SLIME"" -> valid
   ""SLIDE"" -> valid
   ""POISE"" -> valid
   ""MOUSE"" -> valid
   ""HOUSE"" -> valid

 Among these, which one has the most common letters? 

 We want to test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

 ""STOLE"" has T and O and L and S.

 ""SPITE"" has T and I and S and P.

 ""SLIDE"" has L and I and D and S.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, L, S, which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing the positions. We have:

   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E (known)

 We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has two of the same common letter? But we don't know, and we want to test as many distinct letters as possible.

 Since we have 4 new letters, that's good.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So I will guess ""STOLE"".<thoughts>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓)
- C, R, A, N are absent (x)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word ends with E (pattern: \_ \_ \_ \_ E).
2. The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.
3. The word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).
- Test the E position again (though confirmed) to focus on new letters.
- ""STOLE"" is a strong choice: 
  - Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L.
  - Tests positions 1-4 with high-frequency consonants/vowels.
  - Ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
  - Valid 5-letter word without eliminated letters.

Combining with previous feedback (from ""crane""):
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L
- Correct position: E is at position 5 (the last letter)

The secret word is: _ _ _ _ E

We now have 8 eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, using only these remaining letters.

Common vowels we have left: I, U (since E is already at the end, and we've eliminated A and O)

We should try to include vowels (like I or U) and common consonants from the remaining set.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.

Possible word structures: 
  - The first four letters must be from the remaining set, and the fifth is E.

Examples:
  ""BIBLE"" - but B repeats? But we don't know if repetitions are allowed? However, the feedback rules don't prevent repeated letters, so it's possible. But in this case, we don't have feedback about B yet.
  However, ""BIBLE"" would be a 5-letter word? Actually, BIBLE is 5 letters: B-I-B-L-E, but L is eliminated. So we can't use L.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

Try to think of words ending with E without C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

Consider:
  ""BIKE"" - too short. We need 5 letters.
  ""PIKE"" - same? No, PIKE is 4 letters.

5-letter words:
  ""QUIET"" - but Q-U-I-E-T? But ""QUIET"" ends with T, not E. And we need ...E.

What about ""PRIME""? But PRIME has P, R, I, M, E -> R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So not allowed.

""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E -> but U and I are vowels available. Letters G,U,I,D,E. 
But D is available. And E at the end. But also note: we have E as the last letter, so ""GUIDE"" would be: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, D4, E5.

But we have eliminated: none of these are in the eliminated list? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So G,U,I,D are available.

So ""GUIDE"" is a candidate.

Other words:
  ""HONEY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""MOVIE"" -> M-O-V-I-E, but O is eliminated? O is eliminated (from ""stole"" feedback: O(x)). So not allowed.
  ""JUICE"" -> J-U-I-C-E, but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated.

Let me check available vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y).

We can try ""GUIDE"", ""QUITE"", but note Q: 
  ""QUITE"": Q-U-I-T-E, but T is eliminated? From ""stole"": T(x), so T is eliminated. So we cannot use T.

Therefore, ""QUITE"" is invalid.

""BUY"": too short.

Other possibilities:
  ""DWINE"" is archaic and rare? Not common.
  ""EGGED"" has double G, but E is already at the end? We need ...E. EGGED: E-G-G-E-D -> doesn't end with E? Actually, it ends with D.

Better to stick with common words.

Another candidate: ""PUICE"" is not a word.

What about ""FUZZY""? Doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""BOWIE"" -> B-O-W-I-E, but O is eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

List: 
Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need a word of the form: [letter from available] [letter from available] [letter from available] [letter from available] E

We can use:
  ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D -> available? Yes.

  ""WHINE"": not allowed because H and W are available, but N is eliminated? N is eliminated from first guess.

  ""PHONE"": has O (eliminated) and N (eliminated).

  ""MIXED"": M,I,X,E,D -> but E is at position 4? Then D at 5. We want E at 5. So ends with D? Not E.

  ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

  ""WIPED"" is W-I-P-E-D -> pattern: _ _ _ _ E -> does not satisfy because the fifth letter must be E.

  ""GIVEN"": has N? Eliminated.

Another idea: ""BIDE"": too short? BIDE is 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""ABIDE"" has A (eliminated).

""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> but E is at the end? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5 -> ends with E? Yes. But we already know E is at 5? Yes, and we have E again at position 2? That's allowed. But note: we have eliminated letters: B,E,I,G? E is in the word, but we know it's at position 5. We don't know if it's elsewhere.

But ""BEIGE"": 
  Is it a valid word? Yes.
  Letters: B, E, I, G, E -> but note that E is used twice.

We have to avoid A, N, C, R, S, T, O, L.

B, E, I, G are available (since E is already confirmed in the word, but we don't know about duplicates).

However, the word must be a valid 5-letter word. ""BEIGE"" starts with B and ends with E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5.

But note: we have E at position 2? We don't know if that is correct or not. But we are allowed to have multiple E's? Yes.

But in feedback, if the E is at position 2 and it is present but not correct? Or if it's correct? We'll get feedback.

But we have eliminated letters: no. But let's see: ""BEIGE"" uses B, E, I, G. All available? Yes, because eliminated so far: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

So ""BEIGE"" is a candidate.

But we can also consider ""DEUCE"": but E is at the end? D-E-U-C-E -> but C is eliminated? Yes.

""BIKED"": not a word? Or BIKED: 5 letters? B-I-K-E-D -> ends with D.

""JUKED"": but J, U, K, E, D -> ends with D? Not E.

""GRIME"": G-R-I-M-E -> R is eliminated? Yes.

""MIXED"": M-I-X-E-D -> ends with D.

""MUMMY"": not E ending.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> L is eliminated? Yes. And doesn't end with E.

Therefore, the best common word I can think of is ""GUIDE"". 

But note: we have E at the end, so we can also try words that might have E elsewhere? But we don't know. However, since E is at the end, we are using the fifth position correctly.

Another candidate: ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> letters P,I,Q,U,E -> available? Yes. And ends with E? Yes.

""PIQUE"" is a valid word.

But Q is less common? But we have to use what we have.

We can also consider ""VIBEX"" - is that a word? Probably not.

""QUIFF""? Ends with F.

""BUMPY"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""BEGEM"" is archaic? Not common.

I think ""GUIDE"" and ""PIQUE"" are both valid.

Which one to choose? 

""GUIDE"": uses G,U,I,D -> common letters? U is a vowel, I is a vowel, G and D are common consonants.

""PIQUE"": uses P,I,Q,U -> Q is uncommon, so it might give less information? But we'll test Q.

But if we can test more common letters? Among available, D is more common than Q.

Ranking of common letters: 
  From the English frequency, the available letters by frequency:

  Among remaining: I (frequent), U, D, M, H, P, B, G, Y, etc. Q is very low.

So ""GUIDE"" uses:
  G: common, U: not as common, I: common, D: common.
  ""PIQUE"" uses: P: moderately common, I: common, Q: rare, U: moderately common.

We want to maximize hit probability? So ""GUIDE"" might be better because D and G are tested.

But note also: we are testing for positions 1-4.

Therefore, I think ""GUIDE"" is a better choice.

But what about ""BIDED""? B,I,D,E,D -> but E is at position 4? Then D at the end? So it ends with D, not E -> invalid pattern.

What about ""IMBUE""? I-M-B-U-E -> ends with E? The fifth letter is E? I-M-B-U-E: positions: I1, M2, B3, U4, E5 -> yes, ends with E.

""IMBUE"" is a valid word: letters I,M,B,U,E -> all available? Yes, and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

But it uses two vowels (I,U) and consonants M,B.

So we have more candidates: ""GUIDE"", ""PIQUE"", ""IMBUE"", ""BEIGE"".

Among these, let's rank by letter frequency and coverage.

We have only 6 guesses, and this is our third. We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Which letters can we cover? For example:

GUIDE: G,U,I,D
PIQUE: P,I,Q,U
IMBUE: I,M,B,U
BEIGE: B,E,I,G (but E is already known to be present at the end, but we test E at position 2)

In ""BEIGE"", we are testing E at position 2: if we get x for E at position 2, we know there's only one E (at the end)? Or it could be present but wrong position? But wait, the feedback for E at position 2 would be '-' if the word has another E? But the word might have two E's? We don't know.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so testing multiple E's is okay.

But why not: we can get more information from ""BEIGE""?

However, we are limited by tries.

I think ""GUIDE"" is a solid choice because it uses D and G, which are more common than Q or M? Actually, M is also common.

To break the tie:

We can also consider that in ""GUIDE"", the U is at position 2? We don't know if that's good.

But overall, I think ""GUIDE"" is a common word and will give us information.

So I'll go with ""GUIDE"".<thoughts>
The feedback reveals:
- ""crane"" eliminated C,R,A,N and confirmed E(✓) at position 5.
- ""stole"" eliminated S,T,O,L and reconfirmed E(✓) at position 5.

So the secret word ends in E and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending in E.
- Must use only letters not eliminated: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
- Aim to test common remaining letters: especially vowels (I,U) and frequent consonants (D,G,H,M,P).
- ""GUIDE"" is selected because:
  - Uses G,U,I,D,E (E confirmed at end).
  - Covers common consonants (G,D) and vowels (U,I).
  - Avoids eliminated letters.
  - Valid common English word.
</thoughts>

<guess>guide</guess>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:<br>
- Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)<br>
- Guess 2: stole → S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)<br>

**Deductions:**
1. **E is confirmed** at position 5 (since ✓ in last position both times).
2. **Eliminated letters (8 total):** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (all marked ""x"").
3. **Remaining letters:** B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E  
   (4 unknown positions using only the remaining letters).

**Strategy for this guess:**
- Test **common vowels** from the remaining set (I, U) and **common consonants** (D, G, M, P).
- Prioritize words ending with E that avoid eliminated letters.
- Choose a word that maximizes coverage of high-frequency remaining letters.
- **""GUIDE""** is ideal:
  - Ends with E (position 5 confirmed) → provides feedback on positions 1-4.
  - Uses 4 new/untested letters: **G, U, I, D** (all high-frequency available letters).
  - Valid English word: avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.

So we cannot use A or N.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word without A, N, C, R.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)\n   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E\n   ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E\n   ""TOISE"" is not a word? But ""TOUSE"" is not common. \n   ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E (but Q is less common and we might want to test more common letters first)\n\n Another idea: ""SLIME"" -> but we cannot use A? Actually, we can use any letter except C, R, A, N. But note: S, L, I, M are allowed.\n\n However, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s list some common words ending in E without A, N, C, R:\n   ""SLICE"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.\n   ""SLIDE"" -> S, L, I, D, E -> all new letters? Yes, and D is a common letter.\n\n But note: we have E at the end, so we are using E again. That\'s okay because we know it\'s there.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have E in the middle? But we know E is at the end, so we can only use E at the end.\n\n So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\n We have to choose 4 new letters (from the remaining alphabet without C, R, A, N).\n\n Let\'s choose a word that tests common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n I think ""SLIDE"" is a good candidate: \n   S, L, I, D, E\n\n But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.\n\n Another option: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> also good.\n\n Or ""SHINE"" -> but H is less common? And we have to avoid N? Wait, N is eliminated. So ""SHINE"" has N -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STOLE""? -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are common.\n\n But note: we have two vowels in ""STOLE"": O and E (at the end). We already know E is at the end, so we are testing O.\n\n Alternatively, ""SOUTH"" -> but it doesn\'t end with E? We must end with E.\n\n So let\'s stick to words ending in E.\n\n I think ""SLIDE"" and ""SPITE"" are both good. But let\'s see which one uses more common letters.\n\n We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the word.\n\n Since we don\'t know which letters are present (except E at the end), we can choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters.\n\n According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated A, N, R, and we know E is at the end).\n\n So the next most common available: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n We can try to cover T, O, I, S, D, L.\n\n But we only have 4 positions (since the last is E).\n\n I think ""TOISE"" is not a word. But ""TOUCH"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> tests S, T, O, L.\n\n Or ""SPILE"" (which is a word: a spile is a spout for tapping sap from a tree) -> S, P, I, L, E.\n\n But P is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.\n\n So I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that we have the letter O. We don\'t know if O is in the word. But we are testing it.\n\n Another common word: ""SHIRE"" -> but R is eliminated? Yes, R is eliminated. So we cannot use R.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words with R.\n\n Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and ending with E:\n\n   ""STOLE"" -> valid\n   ""SPITE"" -> valid\n   ""SLIME"" -> valid\n   ""SLIDE"" -> valid\n   ""POISE"" -> valid\n   ""MOUSE"" -> valid\n   ""HOUSE"" -> valid\n\n Among these, which one has the most common letters? \n\n We want to test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.\n\n ""STOLE"" has T and O and L and S.\n\n ""SPITE"" has T and I and S and P.\n\n ""SLIDE"" has L and I and D and S.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, L, S, which are very common.\n\n But note: we are also testing the positions. We have:\n\n   Position 1: S\n   Position 2: T\n   Position 3: O\n   Position 4: L\n   Position 5: E (known)\n\n We hope to get feedback on S, T, O, L.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has two of the same common letter? But we don\'t know, and we want to test as many distinct letters as possible.\n\n Since we have 4 new letters, that\'s good.\n\n Let\'s go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but we are not using duplicates in this guess.\n\n So I will guess ""STOLE"".<thoughts>\nThe feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:\n- E is correct and in position 5 (✓)\n- C, R, A, N are absent (x)\n\nKey deductions:\n1.

I-M-B-U-E: positions: I1, M2, B3, U4, E5 -> yes, ends with E.\n\n""IMBUE"" is a valid word: letters I,M,B,U,E -> all available? Yes, and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.\n\nBut it uses two vowels (I,U) and consonants M,B.\n\nSo we have more candidates: ""GUIDE"", ""PIQUE"", ""IMBUE"", ""BEIGE"".\n\nAmong these, let\'s rank by letter frequency and coverage.\n\nWe have only 6 guesses, and this is our third. We want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nWhich letters can we cover? For example:\n\nGUIDE: G,U,I,D\nPIQUE: P,I,Q,U\nIMBUE: I,M,B,U\nBEIGE: B,E,I,G (but E is already known to be present at the end, but we test E at position 2)\n\nIn ""BEIGE"", we are testing E at position 2: if we get x for E at position 2, we know there\'s only one E (at the end)? Or it could be present but wrong position? But wait, the feedback for E at position 2 would be \'-\' if the word has another E? But the word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we are trying to find the secret word, so testing multiple E\'s is okay.\n\nBut why not: we can get more information from ""BEIGE""?\n\nHowever, we are limited by tries.\n\nI think ""GUIDE"" is a solid choice because it uses D and G, which are more common than Q or M? Actually, M is also common.\n\nTo break the tie:\n\nWe can also consider that in ""GUIDE"", the U is at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s good.\n\nBut overall, I think ""GUIDE"" is a common word and will give us information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GUIDE"".<thoughts>\nThe feedback reveals:\n- ""crane"" eliminated C,R,A,N and confirmed E(✓) at position 5.\n- ""stole"" eliminated S,T,O,L and reconfirmed E(✓) at position 5.\n\nSo the secret word ends in E and avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter word ending in E.\n- Must use only letters not eliminated: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n- Aim to test common remaining letters: especially vowels (I,U) and frequent consonants (D,G,H,M,P).\n- ""GUIDE"" is selected because:\n  - Uses G,U,I,D,E (E confirmed at end).\n  - Covers common consonants (G,D) and vowels (U,I).\n  - Avoids eliminated letters.\n  - Valid common English word.\n</thoughts>\n\n<guess>guide</guess>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:<br>\n- Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)<br>\n- Guess 2: stole → S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)<br>\n\n**Deductions:**\n1. **E is confirmed** at position 5 (since ✓ in last position both times).\n2. **Eliminated letters (8 total):** C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (all marked ""x"").\n3. **Remaining letters:** B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n4. The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E  \n   (4 unknown positions using only the remaining letters).\n\n**Strategy for this guess:**\n- Test **common vowels** from the remaining set (I, U) and **common consonants** (D, G, M, P).\n- Prioritize words ending with E that avoid eliminated letters.\n- Choose a word that maximizes coverage of high-frequency remaining letters.\n- **""GUIDE""** is ideal:\n  - Ends with E (position 5 confirmed) → provides feedback on positions 1-4.\n  - Uses 4 new/untested letters: **G, U, I, D** (all high-frequency available letters).\n  - Valid English word: avoids C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L.\n\n<guess>guide</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: guide -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) I(x) D(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""guide"":
  G(x) U(✓) I(x) D(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- G(x): G is not in the word.
- U(✓): U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""guide"", U is the second letter).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- D(x): D is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the correct position (position 5, known from before).

Now, combining with previous feedback:
- Eliminated letters (total): C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, I, D. 
  (from ""crane"": C,R,A,N; from ""stole"": S,T,O,L; from ""guide"": G,I,D all x)
- Correct letters and their positions: 
  - U at position 2 (✓ in ""guide"")
  - E at position 5 (✓ in all three guesses)

Also, from the feedback, we know that U is at position 2, so the word pattern is now: _ U _ _ E

We also learned that I is not in the word? So we eliminate I? But was it eliminated? Yes: I(x) means not present.

So now the secret word: _ U _ _ E

Remaining available letters: Initially, we had: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
But after ""guide"", we eliminate: G, I, D. And we know U is used (but already at position 2).

So updated available letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: U is in the word at position 2, so it's already placed? We don't need to test U? But we can have duplicate U? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicates? We have only one U in ""guide"", at position 2, and it was marked ✓, meaning that letter U is present and correct. We cannot assume there are duplicates? Since we don't have evidence for duplicates.

But we are not prevented from guessing words with duplicate U? However, in this guess, we don't know if there are duplicates? So we should avoid? Actually, we don't know? But we are free to use U elsewhere? But if we use U at a different position, and the word does not have duplicate U, we might get misled? 

However, note: in feedback for ""guide"", only the U at position 2 was ✓. If there were another U elsewhere in the word, we wouldn't know because we didn't test that position? So we have to consider the possibility of duplicate U? But since we don't know, we can avoid using U elsewhere to focus on finding the other letters.

But we can also use U again? 

However, to minimize waste of letters? We want to test new letters.

Therefore, for the next guess, we know:
- Positions: 
  1: any letter from available (first letter is unknown)
  2: U (fixed)
  3: any letter from available (unknown)
  4: any letter from available (unknown)
  5: E

Available letters: The set without eliminated letters: 
  Eliminated: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,G,I,D
  So available: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we cannot use I? Yes, I is eliminated (marked x in ""guide""? Yes? In ""guide"", I was at position 3 and marked x? So I is not in the word? So we eliminate I.

Therefore, the third unknown letter (position 3) cannot be I? Similarly, we cannot use I anywhere.

Also, we know that U is at position 2, so for positions 1,3,4, we can use letters from available set: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. And note: we cannot use U again? Why? Because we don't have information about duplicate U? But we can use U? However, if we use U at another position and the word only has one U (at position 2), then we would get an 'x' for that? Which would tell us that there is only one U? So that's valuable information? But we have limited guesses? We are at guess 4? Or in the process.

We have 6 tries? We are making the fourth guess? Yes: first crane, second stole, third guide, now fourth.

We can try to include U again to check? But the word pattern is _ U _ _ E. So if we put U in position 1, we might get:
  - If duplicate U exists: U at position 1 might be ? (if present) but we already have U at position 2? Then position 1 U would be in the wrong place? Or correct? But if the word has U only at position 2, then U at position 1 would be wrong.

But since we are guessing a word to get feedback, we can do that? But we are focused on winning? So we should try to guess the word? Or get information? 

Given the pattern: _ U _ _ E, and available letters: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We need to form a word: [1] U [3] [4] E

We must choose letters 1,3,4 from the available set? Without G,I,D? And without other eliminated? Yes.

Also, the word must be valid.

Now, let's think of common words matching this pattern? With letters available.

For example: 
  ""QUITE"" - but this has T? T is eliminated? From ""stole"": T(x). Also Q: position 1? U at 2? But the pattern? ""QUITE"" has Q,U,I,T,E -> but I and T are eliminated? So not possible? And also, note: the pattern must have E at the end? Yes.

Similarly? We don't have many options? 

Alternative: ""PUFFED""? Too long? Only 5 letters? So? 

5-letter words: 
  ""HUMAN""? Has A? A is eliminated.

What about ""MULE""? 4 letters? 

5-letters: 
  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> L eliminated? And G? But G is eliminated? Also L? Not allowed.
  But G is eliminated? Yes from ""guide"": G(x)

""JUMBO"": ends with O? Not E? And O eliminated.

""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> D and G eliminated? Not allowed.

""QUAKE"": has A eliminated? A from first guess? A(x)

""BUYER"": ends with R? R is eliminated? But also E at position? B,U,Y,E,R -> ends with R? Not E.

We need words ending with E? So let's think:

  ""JUICE"" - has C eliminated? And I? But I also eliminated? Not allowed.

  ""PUMPY"" - doesn't end with E.

Another: ""HUMVE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""MUMBLE"" 6 letters.

5-letter words:

  ""PUREE"": P,U,R,E,E -> but R is eliminated? And also, pattern: P at1, U at2, R at3, E at4, E at5? But position 4 should be E? We have position 5 E? Then position 4? In this word, E is at position 4? So the pattern would be ...E? So the fifth letter is E: yes? But ""PUREE"": P,U,R,E,E -> that's positions: P1, U2, R3, E4, E5? So R3? But R is eliminated? Also, the fifth letter is E? Yes? But R is eliminated? So not allowed.

  ""QUOTE"": has T and O? Eliminated.

  ""VOUGE"": V,O,U,G,E -> O and G eliminated.

  ""QUEME""? Not English.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> wait? 5 letters: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q1, U2, E3, U4, E5? But E3? We already know E is at position 5? And we are supposed to have E only at position 5? But here E is at position 3? The pattern? Also, letters: Q,U,E,U,E? That uses U at position 2 and U at position 4? Also E at 3 and E at5.

But we have available letters: We are allowed to use U and E? Since E is known to be at position 5? But we don't know if E is elsewhere? We don't know? And U is known at position 2? But we don't know if U is elsewhere? 

For ""QUEUE"": 
  Pattern: Q U E U E? But secret word pattern: _ U _ _ E? So the third letter? We are about to test E? But the third letter is E? Then fourth letter U? Fifth E? 

But note? If we guess ""QUEUE"", it would be: 
  Position 1: Q → if not present? Then x.
  Position 2: U? We know U is correct? So ✓.
  Position 3: E? We don't know? It could be correct? Or wrong? But we already know E is at position 5? And if the word has E at position 3? Then that would be a duplicate E? Which is possible? 

But ""QUEUE"" is a valid word? Yes.

But let's see? We are going to get feedback for each letter? So:

  Position1: Q? If eliminated? Would be x? But Q isn't eliminated? It's available.
  Position2: U? Correct? ✓.
  Position3: E? But we don't know if E is at position 3? It might be? Then ✓, but if not? Then X? Or minus? 
  Position4: U? If duplicate U? Then ? 
  Position5: E? Correct? ✓.

But we don't know? And we are using E at position 3? And U at position 4? 

Perhaps we can avoid this complexity? And use a simpler word? 

We must use letters from B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z only? But note: E and U are in the word? But they are fixed? For positions? 

But for positions 1,3,4: we can use E or U? We are allowed? But we are risking? 

We need the word to be valid? And we need to test letters? Which letters are available? We have B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And the fixed U at2 and E at5.

So let's try to form a word with letters at1,3,4 from B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And the pattern _ U _ _ E.

For example: 
  ""MUFFE"" not a word? 
  ""HUFFY"" ends with Y? 
  ""PUFFY"" ends with Y?
  ""MUMMY"" ends with Y?
  ""FUZZY"" ends with Y?
  ""HUMPY"" ends with Y?
  ""BUMPY"" ends with Y?

All not E ending.

What about words like:
  ""BUYER"" → ends with R? And R is eliminated? 
  ""BUGGY"" → not E ending.
  ""MUGGY"" → not E ending.
  ""PUDGY"" → ends with Y? 
  ""FUDGY"" → ends with Y? 
  All not E ending.

Perhaps with Q and U? But U is at position 2? So position 1 must be consonant? For example? ""QU"" at start? But ""QU"" words? Like?

""QUOTE"" → O eliminated? And T? 
""QUIET"" → I eliminated? And T? 
""QUITE"" → I and T eliminated? 
""QUIRK"" → ends with K? Not E? 
""QUART"" → A eliminated? Ends with T? 
""QUARE"" → has A? Eliminated.

""QUIRE"" → Q,U,I,R,E → I and R eliminated? Not allowed.

Perhaps words that aren't QU? 

For position 1: any letter B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we have to form a word? 

Another possibility: ""WUXI"" is not 5 letters? 

What about ""VAMPE""? V-A-M-P-E? First off, A eliminated? A(x).

""WHACK""? Ends with K? Not E? 

Perhaps: ""WHOSE"" → O eliminated? And S? 

Another: ""PHONE"" → O eliminated? 

I think I'm missing words? Let's think more.

Consider ""KUDZU"": ends with U? Not E? And U at position 5? But the pattern requires E at position 5? So no.

Perhaps ""CYCLE"" → has C and L eliminated? 

We are stuck? We need words ending in E? 

We have available letters: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? So let's try to form a word? 

For example: 
  ""BUXOM"" → not E ending? 
  ""FUXID"" not English? 

Perhaps ""BEVVY"" → no E? 

Another idea: ""YUMMY"" → not E.

What about ""QUEUE""? As mentioned? But let's try? 

""QUEUE"": 
  Q1 → if not present? But Q might be present? We don't know.
  U2 → we know U is correct? So feedback ✓.
  E3 → we don't know? It might be ? 
  U4 → we don't know? 
  E5 → ✓.

But note? The secret word might not have E at position 3? And U at position 4? So we are wasting information? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing Q? And using duplicates? 

But we don't know? 

Perhaps another word: ""PYXIS"" ends with S? S eliminated? Also not E ending.

""ZIFF"" is 4 letters? 

I think we have to consider that there are very few words? 

What about ""WITHE"" → but W,I,T,H,E → I eliminated? And T? I(x) and T(x)? So not allowed? 

Alternatively: ""WINCE"" → W,I,N,C,E → I(x), N(x), C(x)? All eliminated? 

Not possible? 

Wait: let's think? ""HYPE"" → too short? 

Perhaps ""HYPE"" is 4 letters? 

""HYMNE"" → not common? ""HYMNE"" is variant of ""HYMN"", not 5 letters? 

But ""HYMNS"" ends with S? 

""BEVEL"" → B,E,V,E,L → E at position 5? We need position 5 E? But ""BEVEL"" ends with L? Not E? Pattern: B1, E2, V3, E4, L5 → L5? But L is eliminated? 

Another: ""WEAVE"" → W,E,A,V,E → A eliminated? A(x). And pattern: W1, E2, A3, V4, E5? And E at2 and E at5? But A is eliminated? 

Also, we have E at2? But we don't know if that's in the word? We only know E at5? 

But possible? 

But A eliminated? 

""WIMPS"" ends with S? S eliminated? 

Perhaps ""PIKE""? Not 5 letters? 

I think available words are very limited? 

What about ""QUEER""? Q,U,E,E,R → R eliminated? And the pattern? ...E? Secret pattern: _ U _ _ E? but ""QUEER"": Q1,U2,E3,E4,R5 → R5? Not E? Wait position? R5? But we need E at position 5? So incorrect pattern? Also R eliminated? 

How about ""QUEUE""? We must accept that? 

Another word: ""QUEME"" not English? 

""BUMPH"" → British informal? Ends with H? 

""WHELM"" → not E ending? 

And ""WELCH""? Ends with H? 

""VUGHY"" not word? 

I think we have to use ""QUEUE"" or perhaps ""BUXOM"" but not E? So hard! 

Wait no? What about ""MUCUS""? Ends with S? S eliminated? Not allowed? And U? But pattern? 

But what about ""EJECT""? But E at position 1? But we don't have any fixed for position 1? But ""EJECT"": E,J,E,C,T → C and T eliminated? 

Not possible? 

Another: ""BEVEL"" not ending in E? 

Perhaps ""BEZEL""? B,E,Z,E,L → ends with L? 

""COZEY"" not E? 

I think only option is ""QUEUE"" or similar? 

But let's try to find any that ends with E? 

We can also have words like ""FUZEE"" → F,U,Z,E,E? Pattern: F1, U2, Z3, E4, E5? But E at5? And the fourth is E? But secret word pattern: _ U _ _ E? So position 4 is for any letter? Then position 5 E? So it should be [1] U [3] [4] E? So in ""FUZEE"", the fifth letter is E? And the fourth letter is E? So [4] is E? Then we have two E's? 

Is ""FUZEE"" a word? Fusee? Actually: FUZEE is a variant of fuse? 5 letters? F-U-Z-E-E? 

And letters: F,U,Z,E,E? 

Available letters: F is available. U is no problem? Z available? E we know? 

But we are testing F at1, Z at3? 

And this is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""PIZZA"" doesn't end with E? 

So ""FUZEE"" or ""FUSEE""? But we can? 

But in feedback? We might get? 

But also, with the letter U: already fixed at position 2, so we don't worry? 

In ""FUZEE"", U is at position 2? Yes? So it fits the pattern? 

And E at position 4 and 5? 

Position 4? E? If the secret word does not have E at position 4? Then that E will be marked accordingly? 

And also, if the secret word has duplicate E? We'll find out? 

Similarly, we are testing F and Z? 

So we can try? 

But we could also try ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E? 

Now, comparing ""FUZEE"" and ""QUEUE""? 

""FUZEE"" uses F and Z? Z is less common? F is more common? 

""QUEUE"" uses Q? Which is rare? 

Both are valid? 

Another word: ""MUMBLE"" too long? 

Or ""PUPPY""? no E? 

I think ""FUZEE"" is an acceptable word? 

But let's see common words? 

Perhaps ""JUKE"" not 5 letters? 

""JU:KE""? 

Another idea: ""WUDUS"" not common? 

We are running out of options.

Let me check: ""BUBBY"" → no E? 

So I think we have to go with ""QUEUE"" or ""FUZEE"" or even ""QUEME""? 

But in the feedback of ""guide"", we had U at2 with ✓? So in our new guess, position2 U will be ✓? 

Now, another candidate: ""BEVUE"" → B,E,V,U,E? Pattern: B1,E2,V3,U4,E5? But we have U at position 2? Fixed? In the secret word? But here U at position 4? So pattern: _ U _ _ E? So this word would be: at position2 is E? Not U? So it doesn't match the pattern? 

Secret pattern: letter2 is U? So any guess must have U at position 2? Because we know? 

For ""BEVUE"": position2 is E? So this does not put U at position2? So it violates? We cannot? 

Thus, we must have U at position2? And E at position5? 

Therefore, words like ""BEVUE"" are not applicable? 

So only words that have U at second position and E at fifth? And position 1,3,4 in between letters from available set? 

So: position1: available letter? 
position2: U? 
position3: available letter?
position4: available letter?
position5: E?

Examples:
  ""BU? E"" ?

Such as:
  ""BYWAY"" → no E? 
  ""MYOPY"" → no? 

With E at5:

  ""F U ? ? E""

We need the third and fourth letters to spell something? 

""FUCUS"" → but ends with S? And has C? Eliminated? 

""FUDGE"" → D and G eliminated? 

""FUGAE"" → A eliminated? 

""FUMED"" → M and E at4? D at5? But position5 must be E? So D at5? Not E? 

""FUMER"" → R eliminated? 

""FUNKY"" → N eliminated? 

""FURLY"" → L and R eliminated? 

Not working? 

"" H U ? ? E""

 ""HUMAN"" → A eliminated?
 ""HUMES"" → S? Ends with S? Not E? 
 ""HUMOR"" → O and R eliminated? 
 ""HUNKY"" → N eliminated? 
 ""HUSKS"" → S,K,S,S? S ended? 

"" K U ? ? E""

 ""KUDZU"" → ends with U? 
 ""KUKRI"" → ends with I? And I eliminated? 
 ""KULAK"" → ends with K? 
 ""KUNIS"" → ends with S? 
 ""KURUS"" → ends with S? 
 ""KUSSO"" → ends with O? O eliminated? 

"" M U ? ? E""

 ""MUCIC"" → not English? 
 ""MUCID"" → C? Eliminated? 
 ""MUCOR"" → C and R? Eliminated? 
 ""MUCRO"" → ends with O? 
 ""MUDGE"" → G and D eliminated? 
 ""MULSE"" → L and S eliminated? 
 ""MUMPS"" → P? Ends with S? 
 ""MUMMY"" → ends with Y? 
 ""MUONS"" → ends with S? 
 ""MURED"" → R and D eliminated? 
 ""MUREX"" → ends with X? 
 ""MURRS"" → R and S? 
 ""MURTI"" → I? Eliminated? 
 ""MUSED"" → S and D? S eliminated? 
 Etc? Almost all have eliminated letters? 

"" P U ? ? E""

 ""PUBES"" → S? Ends with S? 
 ""PUBIS"" → ends with S? 
 ""PUCES"" → ends with S? 
 ""PUDGE"" → D and G eliminated? 
 ""PUGGY"" → G and Y? 
 Etc? 

"" Q U ? ? E"" → yes? ""QUEUE"" → Q1,U2,E3,U4,E5? 

Now: the fourth position is U? 

Also, ""QUATE"" → A and T eliminated? 

""QUBIT"" → not E ending? 

""QUIFF"" → ends with F? 

""QUIRT"" → R and T eliminated? 

""QUOTE"" → O and T eliminated? 

So only ""QUEUE"" seems available? 

"" V U ? ? E""

 ""VUGHS"" → ends with S? 
 ""VULGO"" → ends with O? 
 ""VULNS"" → L and S? 

"" W U ? ? E""

 ""WUXIA"" → ends with A? A eliminated?
 ""WUDUS"" → ends with S? 

"" Y U ? ? E"" → ""YULES"" → ends with S? 

So I think ""QUEUE"" is the only commonly known word that fits? 

Therefore, we guess ""QUEUE"". 

But note: ""QUEUE"" has E at position 3? Which we might be testing? 

Let's do it? 

But we are unsure? But we have to.

Perhaps ""FU? E"" with one of the letters being Y? 

""FURY""? Too short? 

""FY?""? 

""FYKES"" ends with S? 

I think ""QUEUE"" is the best? 

So let's go with that.<guess>queue</guess>

### Thought Process:
With the confirmed pattern `_ U _ _ E` and eliminated letters C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,G,I,D, the available letters are B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. 

#### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Positions**: 
   - U at position 2 (✓ from ""guide"").
   - E at position 5 (✓ consistently).
2. **Eliminated Letters (11 total)**: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,G,I,D.
3. **Available Letters**: B, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Pattern Constraint**: The secret word must be of the form `[position1] U [position3] [position4] E`.

#### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency available letters (e.g., Q, P, H) to cover probable consonants and vowels.
- **Word Selection**: Given the constraints, ""QUEUE"" is a valid 5-letter word:
  - Uses Q (position 1), U (position 2, confirmed), E (position 3, untested), U (position 4, untested), E (position 5, confirmed).
  - Covers new letters: Q (untested) and handles potential duplicate U/E scenarios.
  - Maximizes information: Position 3 uses E (to test if E occurs elsewhere), and Q tests a common consonant.
- **Why this word?**:
  - Few practical options exist due to stringent eliminated letters and the `_ U _ _ E` pattern.
  - ""QUEUE"" leverages the known U/E placements while probing position 1 (Q), position 3 (E), and position 4 (U) for missing clues.

#### Feedback Expectations:
- If Q is present (unlikely but untested), it may appear in the secret word.
- U at position 4 will clarify if duplicate U exists.
- E at position 3 tests for duplicate E occurrences.
- Feedback on positions 3-4 resolves ambiguity around repeated letters and narrows the solution.

Proceeding with ""QUEUE"" to force critical feedback for the next guess.

<guess>queue</guess>",queue,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""guide"":
  G(x) U(✓) I(x) D(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- G(x): G is not in the word.
- U(✓): U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""guide"", U is the second letter).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- D(x): D is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the correct position (position 5, known from before).

Now, combining with previous feedback:
- Eliminated letters (total): C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, G, I, D. 
  (from ""crane"": C,R,A,N; from ""stole"": S,T,O,L; from ""guide"": G,I,D all x)
- Correct letters and their positions: 
  - U at position 2 (✓ in ""guide"")
  - E at position 5 (✓ in all three guesses)

Also, from the feedback, we know that U is at position 2, so the word pattern is now: _ U _ _ E

We also learned that I is not in the word? So we eliminate I? But was it eliminated? Yes: I(x) means not present.

So now the secret word: _ U _ _ E

Remaining available letters: Initially, we had: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
But after ""guide"", we eliminate: G, I, D. And we know U is used (but already at position 2).

So updated available letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: U is in the word at position 2, so it's already placed? We don't need to test U? But we can have duplicate U? The feedback didn't say anything about duplicates? We have only one U in ""guide"", at position 2, and it was marked ✓, meaning that letter U is present and correct. We cannot assume there are duplicates? Since we don't have evidence for duplicates.

But we are not prevented from guessing words with duplicate U? However, in this guess, we don't know if there are duplicates? So we should avoid? Actually, we don't know? But we are free to use U elsewhere? But if we use U at a different position, and the word does not have duplicate U, we might get misled? 

However, note: in feedback for ""guide"", only the U at position 2 was ✓. If there were another U elsewhere in the word, we wouldn't know because we didn't test that position? So we have to consider the possibility of duplicate U? But since we don't know, we can avoid using U elsewhere to focus on finding the other letters.

But we can also use U again? 

However, to minimize waste of letters? We want to test new letters.

Therefore, for the next guess, we know:
- Positions: 
  1: any letter from available (first letter is unknown)
  2: U (fixed)
  3: any letter from available (unknown)
  4: any letter from available (unknown)
  5: E

Available letters: The set without eliminated letters: 
  Eliminated: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,G,I,D
  So available: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we cannot use I? Yes, I is eliminated (marked x in ""guide""? Yes? In ""guide"", I was at position 3 and marked x? So I is not in the word? So we eliminate I.

Therefore, the third unknown letter (position 3) cannot be I? Similarly, we cannot use I anywhere.

Also, we know that U is at position 2, so for positions 1,3,4, we can use letters from available set: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. And note: we cannot use U again? Why? Because we don't have information about duplicate U? But we can use U? However, if we use U at another position and the word only has one U (at position 2), then we would get an 'x' for that? Which would tell us that there is only one U? So that's valuable information? But we have limited guesses? We are at guess 4? Or in the process.

We have 6 tries? We are making the fourth guess? Yes: first crane, second stole, third guide, now fourth.

We can try to include U again to check? But the word pattern is _ U _ _ E. So if we put U in position 1, we might get:
  - If duplicate U exists: U at position 1 might be ? (if present) but we already have U at position 2? Then position 1 U would be in the wrong place? Or correct? But if the word has U only at position 2, then U at position 1 would be wrong.

But since we are guessing a word to get feedback, we can do that? But we are focused on winning? So we should try to guess the word? Or get information? 

Given the pattern: _ U _ _ E, and available letters: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We need to form a word: [1] U [3] [4] E

We must choose letters 1,3,4 from the available set? Without G,I,D? And without other eliminated? Yes.

Also, the word must be valid.

Now, let's think of common words matching this pattern? With letters available.

For example: 
  ""QUITE"" - but this has T? T is eliminated? From ""stole"": T(x). Also Q: position 1? U at 2? But the pattern? ""QUITE"" has Q,U,I,T,E -> but I and T are eliminated? So not possible? And also, note: the pattern must have E at the end? Yes.

Similarly? We don't have many options? 

Alternative: ""PUFFED""? Too long? Only 5 letters? So? 

5-letter words: 
  ""HUMAN""? Has A? A is eliminated.

What about ""MULE""? 4 letters? 

5-letters: 
  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> L eliminated? And G? But G is eliminated? Also L? Not allowed.
  But G is eliminated? Yes from ""guide"": G(x)

""JUMBO"": ends with O? Not E? And O eliminated.

""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> D and G eliminated? Not allowed.

""QUAKE"": has A eliminated? A from first guess? A(x)

""BUYER"": ends with R? R is eliminated? But also E at position? B,U,Y,E,R -> ends with R? Not E.

We need words ending with E? So let's think:

  ""JUICE"" - has C eliminated? And I? But I also eliminated? Not allowed.

  ""PUMPY"" - doesn't end with E.

Another: ""HUMVE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""MUMBLE"" 6 letters.

5-letter words:

  ""PUREE"": P,U,R,E,E -> but R is eliminated? And also, pattern: P at1, U at2, R at3, E at4, E at5? But position 4 should be E? We have position 5 E? Then position 4? In this word, E is at position 4? So the pattern would be ...E? So the fifth letter is E: yes? But ""PUREE"": P,U,R,E,E -> that's positions: P1, U2, R3, E4, E5? So R3? But R is eliminated? Also, the fifth letter is E? Yes? But R is eliminated? So not allowed.

  ""QUOTE"": has T and O? Eliminated.

  ""VOUGE"": V,O,U,G,E -> O and G eliminated.

  ""QUEME""? Not English.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> wait? 5 letters: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q1, U2, E3, U4, E5? But E3? We already know E is at position 5? And we are supposed to have E only at position 5? But here E is at position 3? The pattern? Also, letters: Q,U,E,U,E? That uses U at position 2 and U at position 4? Also E at 3 and E at5.

But we have available letters: We are allowed to use U and E? Since E is known to be at position 5? But we don't know if E is elsewhere? We don't know? And U is known at position 2? But we don't know if U is elsewhere? 

For ""QUEUE"": 
  Pattern: Q U E U E? But secret word pattern: _ U _ _ E? So the third letter? We are about to test E? But the third letter is E? Then fourth letter U? Fifth E? 

But note? If we guess ""QUEUE"", it would be: 
  Position 1: Q → if not present? Then x.
  Position 2: U? We know U is correct? So ✓.
  Position 3: E? We don't know? It could be correct? Or wrong? But we already know E is at position 5? And if the word has E at position 3? Then that would be a duplicate E? Which is possible? 

But ""QUEUE"" is a valid word? Yes.

But let's see? We are going to get feedback for each letter? So:

  Position1: Q? If eliminated? Would be x? But Q isn't eliminated? It's available.
  Position2: U? Correct? ✓.
  Position3: E? But we don't know if E is at position 3? It might be? Then ✓, but if not? Then X? Or minus? 
  Position4: U? If duplicate U? Then ? 
  Position5: E? Correct? ✓.

But we don't know? And we are using E at position 3? And U at position 4? 

Perhaps we can avoid this complexity? And use a simpler word? 

We must use letters from B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z only? But note: E and U are in the word? But they are fixed? For positions? 

But for positions 1,3,4: we can use E or U? We are allowed? But we are risking? 

We need the word to be valid? And we need to test letters? Which letters are available? We have B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And the fixed U at2 and E at5.

So let's try to form a word with letters at1,3,4 from B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And the pattern _ U _ _ E.

For example: 
  ""MUFFE"" not a word? 
  ""HUFFY"" ends with Y? 
  ""PUFFY"" ends with Y?
  ""MUMMY"" ends with Y?
  ""FUZZY"" ends with Y?
  ""HUMPY"" ends with Y?
  ""BUMPY"" ends with Y?

All not E ending.

What about words like:
  ""BUYER"" → ends with R? And R is eliminated? 
  ""BUGGY"" → not E ending.
  ""MUGGY"" → not E ending.
  ""PUDGY"" → ends with Y? 
  ""FUDGY"" → ends with Y? 
  All not E ending.

Perhaps with Q and U? But U is at position 2? So position 1 must be consonant? For example? ""QU"" at start? But ""QU"" words? Like?

""QUOTE"" → O eliminated? And T? 
""QUIET"" → I eliminated? And T? 
""QUITE"" → I and T eliminated? 
""QUIRK"" → ends with K? Not E? 
""QUART"" → A eliminated? Ends with T? 
""QUARE"" → has A? Eliminated.

""QUIRE"" → Q,U,I,R,E → I and R eliminated? Not allowed.

Perhaps words that aren't QU? 

For position 1: any letter B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we have to form a word? 

Another possibility: ""WUXI"" is not 5 letters? 

What about ""VAMPE""? V-A-M-P-E? First off, A eliminated? A(x).

""WHACK""? Ends with K? Not E? 

Perhaps: ""WHOSE"" → O eliminated? And S? 

Another: ""PHONE"" → O eliminated? 

I think I'm missing words? Let's think more.

Consider ""KUDZU"": ends with U? Not E? And U at position 5? But the pattern requires E at position 5? So no.

Perhaps ""CYCLE"" → has C and L eliminated? 

We are stuck? We need words ending in E? 

We have available letters: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? So let's try to form a word? 

For example: 
  ""BUXOM"" → not E ending? 
  ""FUXID"" not English? 

Perhaps ""BEVVY"" → no E? 

Another idea: ""YUMMY"" → not E.

What about ""QUEUE""? As mentioned? But let's try? 

""QUEUE"": 
  Q1 → if not present? But Q might be present? We don't know.
  U2 → we know U is correct? So feedback ✓.
  E3 → we don't know? It might be ? 
  U4 → we don't know? 
  E5 → ✓.

But note? The secret word might not have E at position 3? And U at position 4? So we are wasting information? Because we are not testing new letters? We are testing Q? And using duplicates? 

But we don't know? 

Perhaps another word: ""PYXIS"" ends with S? S eliminated? Also not E ending.

""ZIFF"" is 4 letters? 

I think we have to consider that there are very few words? 

What about ""WITHE"" → but W,I,T,H,E → I eliminated? And T? I(x) and T(x)? So not allowed? 

Alternatively: ""WINCE"" → W,I,N,C,E → I(x), N(x), C(x)? All eliminated? 

Not possible? 

Wait: let's think? ""HYPE"" → too short? 

Perhaps ""HYPE"" is 4 letters? 

""HYMNE"" → not common? ""HYMNE"" is variant of ""HYMN"", not 5 letters? 

But ""HYMNS"" ends with S? 

""BEVEL"" → B,E,V,E,L → E at position 5? We need position 5 E? But ""BEVEL"" ends with L? Not E? Pattern: B1, E2, V3, E4, L5 → L5? But L is eliminated? 

Another: ""WEAVE"" → W,E,A,V,E → A eliminated? A(x). And pattern: W1, E2, A3, V4, E5? And E at2 and E at5? But A is eliminated? 

Also, we have E at2? But we don't know if that's in the word? We only know E at5? 

But possible? 

But A eliminated? 

""WIMPS"" ends with S? S eliminated? 

Perhaps ""PIKE""? Not 5 letters? 

I think available words are very limited? 

What about ""QUEER""? Q,U,E,E,R → R eliminated? And the pattern? ...E? Secret pattern: _ U _ _ E? but ""QUEER"": Q1,U2,E3,E4,R5 → R5? Not E? Wait position? R5? But we need E at position 5? So incorrect pattern? Also R eliminated? 

How about ""QUEUE""? We must accept that? 

Another word: ""QUEME"" not English? 

""BUMPH"" → British informal? Ends with H? 

""WHELM"" → not E ending? 

And ""WELCH""? Ends with H? 

""VUGHY"" not word? 

I think we have to use ""QUEUE"" or perhaps ""BUXOM"" but not E? So hard! 

Wait no? What about ""MUCUS""? Ends with S? S eliminated? Not allowed? And U? But pattern? 

But what about ""EJECT""? But E at position 1? But we don't have any fixed for position 1? But ""EJECT"": E,J,E,C,T → C and T eliminated? 

Not possible? 

Another: ""BEVEL"" not ending in E? 

Perhaps ""BEZEL""? B,E,Z,E,L → ends with L? 

""COZEY"" not E? 

I think only option is ""QUEUE"" or similar? 

But let's try to find any that ends with E? 

We can also have words like ""FUZEE"" → F,U,Z,E,E? Pattern: F1, U2, Z3, E4, E5? But E at5? And the fourth is E? But secret word pattern: _ U _ _ E? So position 4 is for any letter? Then position 5 E? So it should be [1] U [3] [4] E? So in ""FUZEE"", the fifth letter is E? And the fourth letter is E? So [4] is E? Then we have two E's? 

Is ""FUZEE"" a word? Fusee? Actually: FUZEE is a variant of fuse? 5 letters? F-U-Z-E-E? 

And letters: F,U,Z,E,E? 

Available letters: F is available. U is no problem? Z available? E we know? 

But we are testing F at1, Z at3? 

And this is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""PIZZA"" doesn't end with E? 

So ""FUZEE"" or ""FUSEE""? But we can? 

But in feedback? We might get? 

But also, with the letter U: already fixed at position 2, so we don't worry? 

In ""FUZEE"", U is at position 2? Yes? So it fits the pattern? 

And E at position 4 and 5? 

Position 4? E? If the secret word does not have E at position 4? Then that E will be marked accordingly? 

And also, if the secret word has duplicate E? We'll find out? 

Similarly, we are testing F and Z? 

So we can try? 

But we could also try ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E? 

Now, comparing ""FUZEE"" and ""QUEUE""? 

""FUZEE"" uses F and Z? Z is less common? F is more common? 

""QUEUE"" uses Q? Which is rare? 

Both are valid? 

Another word: ""MUMBLE"" too long? 

Or ""PUPPY""? no E? 

I think ""FUZEE"" is an acceptable word? 

But let's see common words? 

Perhaps ""JUKE"" not 5 letters? 

""JU:KE""? 

Another idea: ""WUDUS"" not common? 

We are running out of options.

Let me check: ""BUBBY"" → no E? 

So I think we have to go with ""QUEUE"" or ""FUZEE"" or even ""QUEME""? 

But in the feedback of ""guide"", we had U at2 with ✓? So in our new guess, position2 U will be ✓? 

Now, another candidate: ""BEVUE"" → B,E,V,U,E? Pattern: B1,E2,V3,U4,E5? But we have U at position 2? Fixed? In the secret word? But here U at position 4? So pattern: _ U _ _ E? So this word would be: at position2 is E? Not U? So it doesn't match the pattern? 

Secret pattern: letter2 is U? So any guess must have U at position 2? Because we know? 

For ""BEVUE"": position2 is E? So this does not put U at position2? So it violates? We cannot? 

Thus, we must have U at position2? And E at position5? 

Therefore, words like ""BEVUE"" are not applicable? 

So only words that have U at second position and E at fifth? And position 1,3,4 in between letters from available set? 

So: position1: available letter? 
position2: U? 
position3: available letter?
position4: available letter?
position5: E?

Examples:
  ""BU? E"" ?

Such as:
  ""BYWAY"" → no E? 
  ""MYOPY"" → no? 

With E at5:

  ""F U ? ? E""

We need the third and fourth letters to spell something? 

""FUCUS"" → but ends with S? And has C? Eliminated? 

""FUDGE"" → D and G eliminated? 

""FUGAE"" → A eliminated? 

""FUMED"" → M and E at4? D at5? But position5 must be E? So D at5? Not E? 

""FUMER"" → R eliminated? 

""FUNKY"" → N eliminated? 

""FURLY"" → L and R eliminated? 

Not working? 

"" H U ? ? E""

 ""HUMAN"" → A eliminated?
 ""HUMES"" → S? Ends with S? Not E? 
 ""HUMOR"" → O and R eliminated? 
 ""HUNKY"" → N eliminated? 
 ""HUSKS"" → S,K,S,S? S ended? 

"" K U ? ? E""

 ""KUDZU"" → ends with U? 
 ""KUKRI"" → ends with I? And I eliminated? 
 ""KULAK"" → ends with K? 
 ""KUNIS"" → ends with S? 
 ""KURUS"" → ends with S? 
 ""KUSSO"" → ends with O? O eliminated? 

"" M U ? ? E""

 ""MUCIC"" → not English? 
 ""MUCID"" → C? Eliminated? 
 ""MUCOR"" → C and R? Eliminated? 
 ""MUCRO"" → ends with O? 
 ""MUDGE"" → G and D eliminated? 
 ""MULSE"" → L and S eliminated? 
 ""MUMPS"" → P? Ends with S? 
 ""MUMMY"" → ends with Y? 
 ""MUONS"" → ends with S? 
 ""MURED"" → R and D eliminated? 
 ""MUREX"" → ends with X? 
 ""MURRS"" → R and S? 
 ""MURTI"" → I? Eliminated? 
 ""MUSED"" → S and D? S eliminated? 
 Etc? Almost all have eliminated letters? 

"" P U ? ? E""

 ""PUBES"" → S? Ends with S? 
 ""PUBIS"" → ends with S? 
 ""PUCES"" → ends with S? 
 ""PUDGE"" → D and G eliminated? 
 ""PUGGY"" → G and Y? 
 Etc? 

"" Q U ? ? E"" → yes? ""QUEUE"" → Q1,U2,E3,U4,E5? 

Now: the fourth position is U? 

Also, ""QUATE"" → A and T eliminated? 

""QUBIT"" → not E ending? 

""QUIFF"" → ends with F? 

""QUIRT"" → R and T eliminated? 

""QUOTE"" → O and T eliminated? 

So only ""QUEUE"" seems available? 

"" V U ? ? E""

 ""VUGHS"" → ends with S? 
 ""VULGO"" → ends with O? 
 ""VULNS"" → L and S? 

"" W U ? ? E""

 ""WUXIA"" → ends with A? A eliminated?
 ""WUDUS"" → ends with S? 

"" Y U ? ? E"" → ""YULES"" → ends with S? 

So I think ""QUEUE"" is the only commonly known word that fits? 

Therefore, we guess ""QUEUE"". 

But note: ""QUEUE"" has E at position 3? Which we might be testing? 

Let's do it? 

But we are unsure? But we have to.

Perhaps ""FU? E"" with one of the letters being Y? 

""FURY""? Too short? 

""FY?""? 

""FYKES"" ends with S? 

I think ""QUEUE"" is the best? 

So let's go with that.<guess>queue</guess>### Thought Process:
With the confirmed pattern `_ U _ _ E` and eliminated letters C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,G,I,D, the available letters are B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. 

#### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Positions**: 
   - U at position 2 (✓ from ""guide"").
   - E at position 5 (✓ consistently).
2. **Eliminated Letters (11 total)**: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,G,I,D.
3. **Available Letters**: B, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Pattern Constraint**: The secret word must be of the form `[position1] U [position3] [position4] E`.

#### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency available letters (e.g., Q, P, H) to cover probable consonants and vowels.
- **Word Selection**: Given the constraints, ""QUEUE"" is a valid 5-letter word:
  - Uses Q (position 1), U (position 2, confirmed), E (position 3, untested), U (position 4, untested), E (position 5, confirmed).
  - Covers new letters: Q (untested) and handles potential duplicate U/E scenarios.
  - Maximizes information: Position 3 uses E (to test if E occurs elsewhere), and Q tests a common consonant.
- **Why this word?**:
  - Few practical options exist due to stringent eliminated letters and the `_ U _ _ E` pattern.
  - ""QUEUE"" leverages the known U/E placements while probing position 1 (Q), position 3 (E), and position 4 (U) for missing clues.

#### Feedback Expectations:
- If Q is present (unlikely but untested), it may appear in the secret word.
- U at position 4 will clarify if duplicate U exists.
- E at position 3 tests for duplicate E occurrences.
- Feedback on positions 3-4 resolves ambiguity around repeated letters and narrows the solution.

Proceeding with ""QUEUE"" to force critical feedback for the next guess.",Guess 4: queue -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) E(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
