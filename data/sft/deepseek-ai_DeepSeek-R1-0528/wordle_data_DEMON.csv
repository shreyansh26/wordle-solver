We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) -> E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.
 - The secret word does contain both N and E, but neither is in the position we guessed.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C at position 1 -> wrong
   R at position 2 -> wrong
   A at position 3 -> wrong
   N at position 4 -> exists but not at position 4
   E at position 5 -> exists but not at position 5

 Therefore, for the next guess:
 - We must avoid using C, R, A.
 - We must include N and E.
 - N cannot be at position 4 and E cannot be at position 5.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can try a word that has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively, and avoids the excluded letters.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and do not have C, R, A.

 Also, note: we have 5 letters to guess and we know two letters (N and E) are present.

 We need to consider common English words.

 Possible words: 
 We can try words that have E and N in different positions.

 For example, let's list some words that have E and N, and without C, R, A:
 - ""lines"": has L, I, N, E, S -> but note: we don't know if L, I, S are in the word?
 - ""spine"": S, P, I, N, E -> again, no C, R, A.

 However, we also need to consider that the feedback did not show any correct positions in the first guess.

 We can try to place N and E in positions they couldn't be in the first guess.

 Since in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, so in the next guess we can try N at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
 Similarly, E was at position 5 and was wrong, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: the secret word must have N and E, but in different positions.

 Let's try to choose a word that maximizes new information.

 Another idea: since we have only two known letters, we should include other common letters to test.

 Common letters not used: S, T, O, P, L, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the same positions for N and E.

 Let me choose a word that has:
 - E at a position other than 5
 - N at a position other than 4

 And that doesn't use C, R, A.

 Example: ""senti"" is not 5 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.

 Consider ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E -> but check: N is at position 4, which is the same position as in ""crane"". We know N was not at position 4 in the secret word? So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's wrong? However, we are not forced to avoid it, but it would be wasteful.

 We know that position 4 is incorrect for N, so trying N again at position 4 won't help. Similarly, E at position 5 is incorrect.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.

 What about ""stone""? 
   S in position 1
   T in position 2
   O in position 3
   N in position 4 -> we know it's wrong because the secret word has N but not at position 4? So if I use ""stone"", then if N is at position 4 again, we'd get a '-' for N? But that would tell us nothing new? Actually, we already know it's not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 again, we can only get either:
     - If it turns out to be '-' again -> then we have learned nothing? Actually, it would be the same as before. But note: we know the secret word does have N, but we don't know where. So putting N at position 4 again will just confirm it's still not position 4 (which we already know).

 Therefore, it's better to put N in a different position to test a new position.

 Similarly for E.

 So let's try a word that puts N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but note position 4 we avoid) and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we need to avoid: C, R, A.

 I think of words:

 Option 1: ""inept"" -> I, N, E, P, T -> 
   Positions: 
      N at position 2? 
      E at position 3?
   But wait: ""inept"" has N at position 2 and E at position 3.

 Option 2: ""spend"": S, P, E, N, D -> 
   E at position 3, N at position 4 -> but N at position 4 is the same as before? So we avoid that.

 Option 3: ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N at position 2, E at position 4 -> that avoids the positions? 
   We didn't try E at position 4 and N at position 2 in the first guess?

 But note: we know E is not at position 5 and N not at position 4. We have no restriction for E at position 4? 
   So ""onset"": 
      position 1: O
      position 2: N
      position 3: S
      position 4: E
      position 5: T

 This way, we are testing N at position 2 (which wasn't tested before) and E at position 4 (which wasn't tested before).

 Also, O, S, T are new letters.

 Another candidate: ""tines"" -> T, I, N, E, S -> 
   positions: N at 3 and E at 4? Then T at 1, I at 2, S at 5.

 This also avoids putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 Let me compare:

 ""onset"": O (new), N (at pos2), S (new), E (at pos4), T (new)
 ""tines"": T (new), I (new), N (at pos3), E (at pos4), S (new)

 Both are valid. But note: ""onset"" is a common word? Yes.

 However, we have no information about the presence of any new letter. So either is fine.

 Since we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter or position, and note that S and T are common.

 I'll go with ""onset"".

 So the next guess: ""onset""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must **exclude C, R, A**.
- Must **include N and E**, with N avoiding position 4 and E avoiding position 5.
- Choose a word that tests new letters (e.g., common consonants) and positions for N/E.

A strong candidate is **""onset""**:
- Places N at **position 2** (a new position, avoiding position 4).
- Places E at **position 4** (a new position, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids invalid letters (C/R/A) and repositions N/E effectively.

 This way, we are testing N at position 2 (which wasn't tested before) and E at position 4 (which wasn't tested before).

 Also, O, S, T are new letters.

 Another candidate: ""tines"" -> T, I, N, E, S -> 
   positions: N at 3 and E at 4? Then T at 1, I at 2, S at 5.

 This also avoids putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 Let me compare:

 ""onset"": O (new), N (at pos2), S (new), E (at pos4), T (new)
 ""tines"": T (new), I (new), N (at pos3), E (at pos4), S (new)

 Both are valid. But note: ""onset"" is a common word? Yes.

 However, we have no information about the presence of any new letter. So either is fine.

 Since we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter or position, and note that S and T are common.

 I'll go with ""onset"".

 So the next guess: ""onset""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must **exclude C, R, A**.
- Must **include N and E**, with N avoiding position 4 and E avoiding position 5.
- Choose a word that tests new letters (e.g., common consonants) and positions for N/E.

A strong candidate is **""onset""**:
- Places N at **position 2** (a new position, avoiding position 4).
- Places E at **position 4** (a new position, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids invalid letters (C/R/A) and repositions N/E effectively.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: onset -> O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2. (We already knew N is not at position 4 from the first guess, so now we know it's also not at 2 or 4.)
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4. (We knew E not at position 5; now also not at 4.)
- T is not in the word.

So let's recap what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T.

Letters IN the word and their known positions to avoid:
- N: not at position 2,4 (and 5? We haven't checked yet, but note: in ""crane"" it was at 4 and ""onset"" at 2, so avoid 2,4 for N. We don't know about 1,3,5 yet.)
- E: not at position 4,5 (and avoid position 3? We haven't checked position 3 for E yet.)
- O: in the word and not at position 1.

Also, from the first guess we had E(-) meaning E is present but not at position 5. And in the second guess E(-) meaning not at position 4. So E is present but we have avoided positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, O is present and we know it's not at position 1 (from guess 2). So O must be in positions 2,3,4,5? But wait: position 4 and 5 for E are already avoided? But E is not O? So O can be at any position except 1.

Also N: we know it's present. We have tried: 
- In ""crane"" at position 4 -> not there
- In ""onset"" at position 2 -> not there

So N must be at position 1, 3, or 5? Wait: positions are 1 to 5. Not at 2 or 4. So positions left for N: 1,3,5.

We know the word has 5 letters and contains: O, N, E. That's at least three letters. And we have eliminated C, R, A, S, T.

But we don't know the other two letters? We haven't found all five letters yet? There are two more letters to discover.

We need to think of words that have O, N, E, and two other letters that are not C, R, A, S, T.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have indications from the feedback:

For E: must be at position 1,2, or 3 (since not 4 or 5). Similarly, O must be at positions 2,3,4, or 5 (since not 1). And N must be at 1,3, or 5.

Now let's think of possible words:

We need a word that contains O, N, E, and two other letters from the remaining.

We know E cannot be at 4 or 5 -> so E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, O must be at 2,3, or 4 or 5? Wait: but E might be at 1,2,3 and O can overlap? They are different letters.

Let's try to form patterns:

Possible placements:

Suppose E is at position 1: Then O can be at 2,3,4,5? And N can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1 because E is there? Wait: E and N are different.

But note: if E is at position 1, then O can be at 2,3,4,5 and N at 3,5? But at position 3: only one letter can be there.

Similarly, we have to assign positions.

We can list possible words:

Consider words with E in position 1: 
Then the word starts with E.
Must have O and N in the remaining positions, avoiding positions for O, N? 
But O cannot be at position 1? Already taken by E? So that's fine? O can be at 2,3,4,5? 
N can be at 3,5? But avoid 2 and 4.

Example words starting with E: 
E _ _ _ _

Must contain O and N, and avoid C,R,A,S,T.

For example: 
""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but does it have N? No.
""ENVOY"" -> E, N, V, O, Y -> has N and O? E at 1, N at 2? But N at 2: we know N cannot be at position 2? From guess 2! So no ""envo"" has N at position 2 -> invalid.

Another: ""EIGHT"" -> no O or N? Not.

What about ""EOSIN""? That's not common? Or ""eosin"" is a word? Meaning a dye? It's 5 letters: E, O, S, I, N -> but S is marked as absent? So cannot have S. So invalid.

Another: ""EXCON""? X, not in? Not a common word? Also, might have T? No, T is absent.

What about ""E"" words? Maybe E at 1 is rare? So perhaps E is not at 1.

Then consider E at position 2: 
_ E _ _ _

Then O can be at 3,4,5? And N must be at 1,3,5? But E is at 2. So we cannot have O at 2? And N cannot at 2? So N can be at 1,3,5.

Similarly, O at 3,4,5.

Let's form: positions:
1: (can be N or a new letter, not O? O can't be at 1? But wait: the word so far: position 1 is free? 
But if N is at position 1: then the word is N E _ _ _
Then O at 3,4,5? 

Or if N is at 3: then _ E N _ _
Then O at 4 or 5? 

Similarly, if N is at 5: _ E _ _ N, then O at 3 or 4? 

We must avoid the letters C,R,A,S,T.

For instance, let's try: if the word is _ E _ O _
But O is at position 4? Then we have _ E _ O _

Must also have N. Where? Position 1: then N E _ O _
Or position 3: _ E N O _
Or position 5: _ E _ O N

Now, we need to fill with letters from the remaining set.

Also, E must be at position 2? So we have:

Patterns:
1: N E _ O _ 
2: _ E N O _
3: _ E _ O N

But position 5 for the last one: we have E at 2 and O at 4, N at 5.

Now, we must pick letters for the blanks.

Consider pattern 1: N E _ O _
Positions 3 and 5 to fill? But we have O at 4? So positions 3 and 5: we need two more letters.

Words for pattern 1: 
For example: N E W O N -> ""newon"" not a word? 
N E M O N -> ""nemon"" not. 
N E L O N -> ""nelon"" not. 
N E P O N -> ""nepon""? Not common.

How about: ""DEVON""? D E V O N -> D not forbidden? And V not forbidden? But N is at position 5. Pattern: N E ...? Wait no: pattern 1 is N E _ O _, so position 3 and 5: the last letter is at 5? But in ""devon"": positions are D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, N at5 -> but we are having N at1? No: pattern 1 has N at1? So ""devon"" has D at1? Not matching.

Pattern 1: position 1: N, position 2: E, position 4: O, and then position 3: ?, position 5: ?

We need a word: N E x O y

Words: 
""NEVRO"" not a word? 
""NEGRO"" -> but R is eliminated? R is absent? So no R.
""NEUMO"" not a word?
""NEATO"" -> but T and A? T absent, A absent.

None? 

Pattern 2: _ E N O _
Meaning position1: ?, position2: E, position3: N, position4: O, position5: ?

Example words: 
""l e n o s"" -> S absent? 
""d e n o t"" -> T absent? 
""p e n o s"" -> S absent? 
""b e n o m"" -> not common? 
""hem not? 

What about ""lemon""? L E M O N -> letters: L,E,M,O,N. Check: 
L: allowed? 
M: allowed? 
N: at position 5? We haven't tried position 5 for N? So allowed? 
But E is at position 2 -> okay, E at 2 is not tested? 
O at position 4? We tested O at position 4? In ""onset"", O was at position 1? No: in ""onset"" the positions were position1: O, position2: N, position3: S, position4: E, position5: T. So O was tried at position1, that was wrong. So O at position4? In this word ""lemon"", O is at position4? That hasn't been tested? So possible? 

But wait: in ""lemon"", letter N is at position5? Previously we only tried N at positions 2 and 4? Position5 is new? So N is at5: okay.

Also, E at2: not tried? Fine.

The word ""lemon"" avoids the forbidden letters: L, M, O, N, E. None are C,R,A,S,T? L is allowed, M is allowed.

But we had feedback that N is not at position 2? Now we are putting N at position5? Fine.

But wait: we also need to check if this word has been excluded? No.

But we don't know if L and M are present? They might be absent? But we hope.

We are going to guess? We might get feedback.

But let's see if there is another pattern.

Pattern 3: _ E _ O N
Meaning position2: E, position4: O, position5: N? Then position1 and position3: two letters.

Example: ?? E ?? O N?

Words: 
""p i e d o n"" not? 
""cake O N"" but c forbidden?
We can have: ""d e ? o n"" -> For instance: ""demon"": D E M O N -> 
D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? 
But we wanted pattern _ E _ O N? 
Demon: positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)? So this fits pattern? Or wait: pattern: _ E _ O N -> so five positions: 1: ?, 2:E, 3: ?, 4:O,5:N.

Yes, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5.

Another possibility: ""gekon""? G,E,K,O,N? Yes: G at1, E at2, K at3, O at4, N at5? But ""gekon"" is a lizard? Not common? But acceptable? Or ""lemon"" might be better.

But note: in ""lemon"", it fits pattern 2: position1: L,2:E,3:N,4:O,5:M? Wait: lemon is L at1,E at2,M at3? Wait I think I confused.

Actually: 
lemon: L-E-M-O-N -> so position: 
1: L, 2: E, 3: M, 4: O, 5: N.

Ah, so it's _ E _ O ? at the end? But no: position4 O, position5 N? So pattern: _ E _ O N? Actually pattern: positions 1,2,3,4,5: L,E,M,O,N -> so matches pattern: _ E ? O N? Yes, pattern: position2:E, position4:O, position5:N -> pattern for positions 2,4,5? And position1 and 3 free.

But the N in ""lemon"" is at5? And O at4? We haven't tested N at5 and O at4? So both are possible? 

Similarly, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? Same pattern.

Now, we must consider E at position 3? We haven't tried that?

Wait: E must be at1,2, or3? We haven't tried position3 for E.

So another possibility: E at position3.

Then: _ _ E _ _

And O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? But position3 is E? So O at2,4,5? And N at1,3,or5? But position3 is E? So N at1 or5.

Patterns:

If E at3:

Option A: N at position1? Then pattern: N _ E _ _

And O at position2,4, or5? 

So: 
N O E _ _ -> N O E ? ?
But O at2: not tried? But O cannot be at1? We only tried O at1? So O at2: possible? 

But O at2: in ""onset"" O was at position1? So position2 was N? Now we put O at2? That hasn't been tested? 

But words: NO E L? Not? N O E L L? ""Noell"" not? 

N O E S? S absent? 

N O E? difficult.

Option: O at4: N _ E O _
Then: position1: N, position2:?, position3:E, position4:O, position5:?

Words: 
""n u e o n"" not.
""n i e o n"" not? 
""n e e o n"" -> E repeated? But our guesses allow repeated letters? Probably allowed? But let's assume unique letters unless specified? The rules don't say, but Wordle usually allows repeats. However, in this case E is at position2 and3? But we don't know? 

But our feedback? We haven't been told about doubles? So we must consider? But typically, if there is a double, the feedback would show? For instance, if we guess a word with a double, and the secret has one, it would mark accordingly? Since we haven't encountered, maybe no doubles?

Let's assume no doubles? Because if there were, the feedback might have indicated? But it's not explicit? 

Without knowing, perhaps better to avoid doubles? Or allow.

But in our known letters: O, N, E: probably distinct.

Similarly, option: O at5: N _ E _ O -> pattern? N at1, O at5. E at3. Position2 and4 unknown.

Words: ""n e d e? o"" -> not an easy word.

So back to the E at2? We have two candidate patterns:

pattern: ? E ? O N and ? E ? O N? Wait, same? We have two candidates: words like ""lemon"" (L-E-M-O-N) and ""demon"" (D-E-M-O-N) and ""gekon"" (G-E-K-O-N) etc.

But we don't know the first letter? 

But both ""lemon"" and ""demon"" are common words.

Also, another word: ""piano"" -> P I A N O -> but A is absent? Forbidden? So no.

We are missing one more pattern? E at3? We skipped.

Another word: ""opine"" -> O P I N E -> O at1? But wait: O is not at position1? We know O cannot be at1? So ""opine"" is O at1? Invalid? Because we know O not at1.

But let's consider E at1? We couldn't find words? Perhaps I missed.

If E at1: 
E _ _ _ _ 
Then O and N? O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? And N at3 or5? Not at2 or4.

Words: 
E L _ O N? Like ""e l k o n"" not? 
E L O S N? S absent? 
E N _ O? But N at2? But we know N cannot be at2? So cannot.

E at position1 and N at position3: E _ N _ _
Then O at position4 or5? 

If O at4: E _ N O _
Then: positions 2 and 5: two letters needed? 

Words: E C O N S -> C,S eliminated -> not. 
E T O N S -> T,S eliminated.

E U N O M? Not a word? 

E N N O S? N repeated? S? Eliminated.

So not found.

If O at5: E _ N O _
No: E _ N O _ -> positions:1,2,3,4: E ? N O? Then 5 missing? 

E at1, O, and N: so E ? N O ? 
Fifth letter? 

Words: E M O for? Not? 

Not common.

Therefore, the candidates are words with E at position2 and O at4 and N at5? Like _ E _ O N? 

With the middle letter position3: one letter? 

So five positions: letter1, E(2), letter3, O(4), N(5)

The word: ? E ? O N

So the structure: 
position1: ?
position2: E
position3: ?
position4: O
position5: N

So words: 

- lemon: L E M O N -> M at3? But we have M? Not tested? 
- demon: D E M O N -> M at3? 
- begon? Not common? 
- reckon? R E C O N -> R and C eliminated? 
- felon: F E L O N -> L at3? 
- hemel? Not? 
- memon? Not? 

Viable words: lemon, demon, felon, etc? 

Also: ""vekon"" no? 

Now, the first letter? And the third letter? Must be from the allowed set? No C,R,A,S,T? 

So for lemon: L and M? Allowed? 
Demon: D and M? 
Felon: F and L? 

All letters allowed? 

How about ""melon""? M E L O N? That would be M at1, E at2, L at3, O at4, N at5? And it's a common word. 

But ""melon"": has M and L? 

But note: from feedback, we know O is present? And E, N? Yes? 

And avoiding C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 

So ""melon"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""lemon"" is M and L? 

But ""lemon"": L at1, M at3, O at4, N at5? 

We don't know which? 

But both ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are anagrams? 

Actually: 
- lemon: L-E-M-O-N
- melon: M-E-L-O-N

So same letters? But different positions? 

We need to distinguish? 

But note: we have no information about letters M or L? So both are possible? 

However, we also have ""demon"": D-E-M-O-N? 

But D is a letter? 

We might want to choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? Or we can choose one? 

But we have 6 tries? And we might get lucky? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume we know the other two letters? But since the pattern seems tight, we can guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? 

But let's see the position of O? In both cases O is at position4, which hasn't been tested? 

Similarly, N at5? 

We need to decide? 

Another word: ""temon"" not common? 

So common words: lemon, melon, demon.

But note: ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are both words? 

What about ""nekon"" not? 

We can guess ""demon"" to test D? Or ""melon"" to test M at first position? 

I think ""melon"" is a good guess because it's common.

But let's list all possibilities: 
We have E at position2? O at position4? N at position5? 

Thus, the word is of the form: x E y O N? 

With x at1? y at3? 

x and y must be letters from: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But ""melon"": x=M, y=L? 
""lemon"": x=L, y=M? 
""demon"": x=D, y=M? 
""felon"": x=F, y=L? 

All are possible? 

To maximize new information: perhaps we should guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? But if we guess ""melon"", then we'll get feedback on M and L? 

Since ""melon"" and ""lemon"" share many letters? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has other letters? 

Another possibility: E could be at position1? But we didn't find a word? 

What about ""evzon""? Not a word? 

We might also consider E at position3?

With _ _ E O N? So positions:1 and2? 

Pattern: a b E O N? 

Words: ""queon"" not? 
""bread"" not? 
""scene"" S absent? 
""cream"" C,R,A eliminated? 
""gleam"" G L E A M -> A eliminated? 
""dream"" A? 
""steon"" S? 

Not available? 

So the only patterns seem to be _ E ? O N? 

So we must make a guess? 

Let's choose ""melon""? 

So:

Guess: melon

We are guessing ""melon"": M E L O N.

Now, let's compare with what we know:

M: new letter? We don't know? 
E: at position2? We have not tested E at2? 
L: new? 
O: at position4? Not tested? 
N: at position5? Not tested? 

This should help? 

If the word is ""melon"", we win? If not, we get feedback? 

But note: from ""melon"": 
If M is at1: O might be present? 

But we know O is present? 

So <guess>melon</guess>?

But wait: another possibility: what if O is not at position4? 

For example, we haven't tested O at position3? 

But we assumed E at2? 

But our deduction: E must be at1,2, or3? We have tried E at position2? 

But O can be at position3? For example, if E is at position3: then the word could be ? ? E ? ? 

But with O at position3? But then position3 has both E and O? So either O is elsewhere? 

Actually, if E is at3, then O cannot be at3? So O at2,4,5? 

But we have words? 

For example: if E is at3, O at2? Then word: _ O E _ _

Must have N: at1 or5? 

If at5: _ O E _ N? 
Words: do? 

""H o e?? n"" -> no? 

Or O at4: _ ? E O _ 
Then N at1 or5? 

If N at position1: N ? E O _? 
Words: N X E O Y? 

Example: ""n o e o n"" -> not and double O? 

Or N U E O L -> ""nucle"" with u? Not? 

Or N E E O L -> E repeated? 

Not common? 

O at5: _ ? E ? O 
And N at1: N ? E ? O 
Or at5: but O at5? Then N must be at1? 

Word: N ? E ? O 

Example: N O E L O -> ""noelo"" not? 

Or ""nae o"" not? 

So it seems _ E ? O N is the most promising? 

Thus, perhaps ""melon"" is a good guess.

But to be safe, we could guess a word that contains common letters? 

But I think we go with ""melon"".

So guess: melon

But note: we also have ""demon"", which has D? 

If we guess ""melon"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like: 

If the secret word is ""demon"", and we guess ""melon"", then:

M: not? so x? 
E: at position2: correct? ✓? 
O: at position4: correct? 
N: at position5: correct? 
But if ""demon"" has M at3? Then L: not? 

Similarly, if secret is ""demon"", then feedback for ""melon"":

M: absent? So M(x)? 
E: at2? correct ✓? 
L: absent? L(x)? 
O: at4? ✓? 
N: at5? ✓?

But we know E,O,N present? So M and L absent? 

Then we'll know the third letter is M? And first letter is D? But then ""demon"" would be the only word remaining? 

Similarly, if secret is ""lemon"", then:

M: at position3? So E: position2 correct ✓, L: we guess L at3? But in ""melon"" L is at position3? Then feedback: 
M at1 absent? But position3 L? 
For L: in ""melon"", L is at position3? But secret ""lemon"" has L at position1? So L at position3? Since secret has L at1? So in secret: L is present? Therefore L in wrong position? So ? 
At feedback:

""melon"" vs ""lemon"":

Position1: M -> secret has L? So M absent? 
Position2: E -> E? Correct? ✓
Position3: L -> secret has M? So L absent? 
Position4: O -> O? Correct ✓? 
Position5: N -> N? Correct ✓? 

But wait: secret ""lemon"" has L at position1 and M at position3? 

Therefore when we guess ""melon"":

- M at1: not present? Because secret has L at1? And M? Secret has M at3? So M is present? But at wrong position? 

Ah, I see: we can't assume?

Let's clarify:

Secret word: lemon -> letters: L, E, M, O, N

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N

Feedback for each letter:

- M: Position1: secret position1 is L? So M is present? But not at position1 -> so since M is in secret (at position3), then we should get M at position1: wrong -> '-' ? Symbol ""-"" meaning in word but wrong position? 

But note: M appears in secret at position3? And in guess at position1? So feedback for M: ""in word but wrong position"", so ""-"".

Similarly, for E: position2: both have E? So ✓? 

For L: guess position3: L? But secret has L at position1? So L is present but wrong position? So ""-"".

For O: both position4? ✓? 

For N: both position5? ✓? 

So feedback: M(-) E(✓) L(-) O(✓) N(✓)

Similarly, if secret is ""demon"":

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N
Secret: demon -> D, E, M, O, N

Feedback:
- M: present at secret position3? Guess position1: wrong position -> ""-""? 
- E: position2 correct ✓? 
- L: absent? So x? 
- O: ✓? 
- N: ✓? 

So M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)

If secret is ""melon"" itself: we win.

But we also have ""felon"": F E L O N

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N
Secret: felon -> F, E, L, O, N
Feedback:
- M: absent? x? 
- E: ✓? 
- L: present? at position3? Both have L at3 -> ✓? 
- O: ✓? 
- N: ✓? 

So M(x) E(✓) L(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

Therefore, by guessing ""melon"", we can distinguish: 

- If we get all ✓ (except possibly M), but if M(✓) then we win? 

But anyway, we'll get valuable feedback? 

Because we have E, O, N correct? 

So I'll guess ""melon""? 

Yes. 

So guess: melon
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A are absent. N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- Guess 2 (""onset""): O is present (but not position 1), N is present (but not position 2), S and T are absent, E is present (but not position 4).

Key deductions:
- Secret word must include **O, N, E** (all present) and exclude **C, R, A, S, T** (absent).
- O, N, and E positions:
  - N cannot be at position 2 or 4 (from previous guesses), so it must be at **position 1, 3, or 5**.
  - E cannot be at position 4 or 5, so it must be at **position 1, 2, or 3**.
  - O cannot be at position 1, so it must be at **position 2, 3, 4, or 5**.

After testing feasible patterns, words fitting **E at position 2, O at position 4, and N at position 5** are promising candidates (e.g., _ E _ O N structure). Common examples include ""melon"", ""lemon"", ""demon"", and ""felon"". Among these, ""melon"" is selected because it:
- Uses common letters (M, L) not yet tested.
- Maximizes positional testing for E, O, N at new positions.
- Avoids risk of double letters (unlikely based on feedback).
- Could resolve multiple possibilities through feedback.

<guess>melon</guess>",melon,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: onset -> O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2. (We already knew N is not at position 4 from the first guess, so now we know it's also not at 2 or 4.)
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4. (We knew E not at position 5; now also not at 4.)
- T is not in the word.

So let's recap what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T.

Letters IN the word and their known positions to avoid:
- N: not at position 2,4 (and 5? We haven't checked yet, but note: in ""crane"" it was at 4 and ""onset"" at 2, so avoid 2,4 for N. We don't know about 1,3,5 yet.)
- E: not at position 4,5 (and avoid position 3? We haven't checked position 3 for E yet.)
- O: in the word and not at position 1.

Also, from the first guess we had E(-) meaning E is present but not at position 5. And in the second guess E(-) meaning not at position 4. So E is present but we have avoided positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, O is present and we know it's not at position 1 (from guess 2). So O must be in positions 2,3,4,5? But wait: position 4 and 5 for E are already avoided? But E is not O? So O can be at any position except 1.

Also N: we know it's present. We have tried: 
- In ""crane"" at position 4 -> not there
- In ""onset"" at position 2 -> not there

So N must be at position 1, 3, or 5? Wait: positions are 1 to 5. Not at 2 or 4. So positions left for N: 1,3,5.

We know the word has 5 letters and contains: O, N, E. That's at least three letters. And we have eliminated C, R, A, S, T.

But we don't know the other two letters? We haven't found all five letters yet? There are two more letters to discover.

We need to think of words that have O, N, E, and two other letters that are not C, R, A, S, T.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have indications from the feedback:

For E: must be at position 1,2, or 3 (since not 4 or 5). Similarly, O must be at positions 2,3,4, or 5 (since not 1). And N must be at 1,3, or 5.

Now let's think of possible words:

We need a word that contains O, N, E, and two other letters from the remaining.

We know E cannot be at 4 or 5 -> so E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, O must be at 2,3, or 4 or 5? Wait: but E might be at 1,2,3 and O can overlap? They are different letters.

Let's try to form patterns:

Possible placements:

Suppose E is at position 1: Then O can be at 2,3,4,5? And N can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1 because E is there? Wait: E and N are different.

But note: if E is at position 1, then O can be at 2,3,4,5 and N at 3,5? But at position 3: only one letter can be there.

Similarly, we have to assign positions.

We can list possible words:

Consider words with E in position 1: 
Then the word starts with E.
Must have O and N in the remaining positions, avoiding positions for O, N? 
But O cannot be at position 1? Already taken by E? So that's fine? O can be at 2,3,4,5? 
N can be at 3,5? But avoid 2 and 4.

Example words starting with E: 
E _ _ _ _

Must contain O and N, and avoid C,R,A,S,T.

For example: 
""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but does it have N? No.
""ENVOY"" -> E, N, V, O, Y -> has N and O? E at 1, N at 2? But N at 2: we know N cannot be at position 2? From guess 2! So no ""envo"" has N at position 2 -> invalid.

Another: ""EIGHT"" -> no O or N? Not.

What about ""EOSIN""? That's not common? Or ""eosin"" is a word? Meaning a dye? It's 5 letters: E, O, S, I, N -> but S is marked as absent? So cannot have S. So invalid.

Another: ""EXCON""? X, not in? Not a common word? Also, might have T? No, T is absent.

What about ""E"" words? Maybe E at 1 is rare? So perhaps E is not at 1.

Then consider E at position 2: 
_ E _ _ _

Then O can be at 3,4,5? And N must be at 1,3,5? But E is at 2. So we cannot have O at 2? And N cannot at 2? So N can be at 1,3,5.

Similarly, O at 3,4,5.

Let's form: positions:
1: (can be N or a new letter, not O? O can't be at 1? But wait: the word so far: position 1 is free? 
But if N is at position 1: then the word is N E _ _ _
Then O at 3,4,5? 

Or if N is at 3: then _ E N _ _
Then O at 4 or 5? 

Similarly, if N is at 5: _ E _ _ N, then O at 3 or 4? 

We must avoid the letters C,R,A,S,T.

For instance, let's try: if the word is _ E _ O _
But O is at position 4? Then we have _ E _ O _

Must also have N. Where? Position 1: then N E _ O _
Or position 3: _ E N O _
Or position 5: _ E _ O N

Now, we need to fill with letters from the remaining set.

Also, E must be at position 2? So we have:

Patterns:
1: N E _ O _ 
2: _ E N O _
3: _ E _ O N

But position 5 for the last one: we have E at 2 and O at 4, N at 5.

Now, we must pick letters for the blanks.

Consider pattern 1: N E _ O _
Positions 3 and 5 to fill? But we have O at 4? So positions 3 and 5: we need two more letters.

Words for pattern 1: 
For example: N E W O N -> ""newon"" not a word? 
N E M O N -> ""nemon"" not. 
N E L O N -> ""nelon"" not. 
N E P O N -> ""nepon""? Not common.

How about: ""DEVON""? D E V O N -> D not forbidden? And V not forbidden? But N is at position 5. Pattern: N E ...? Wait no: pattern 1 is N E _ O _, so position 3 and 5: the last letter is at 5? But in ""devon"": positions are D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, N at5 -> but we are having N at1? No: pattern 1 has N at1? So ""devon"" has D at1? Not matching.

Pattern 1: position 1: N, position 2: E, position 4: O, and then position 3: ?, position 5: ?

We need a word: N E x O y

Words: 
""NEVRO"" not a word? 
""NEGRO"" -> but R is eliminated? R is absent? So no R.
""NEUMO"" not a word?
""NEATO"" -> but T and A? T absent, A absent.

None? 

Pattern 2: _ E N O _
Meaning position1: ?, position2: E, position3: N, position4: O, position5: ?

Example words: 
""l e n o s"" -> S absent? 
""d e n o t"" -> T absent? 
""p e n o s"" -> S absent? 
""b e n o m"" -> not common? 
""hem not? 

What about ""lemon""? L E M O N -> letters: L,E,M,O,N. Check: 
L: allowed? 
M: allowed? 
N: at position 5? We haven't tried position 5 for N? So allowed? 
But E is at position 2 -> okay, E at 2 is not tested? 
O at position 4? We tested O at position 4? In ""onset"", O was at position 1? No: in ""onset"" the positions were position1: O, position2: N, position3: S, position4: E, position5: T. So O was tried at position1, that was wrong. So O at position4? In this word ""lemon"", O is at position4? That hasn't been tested? So possible? 

But wait: in ""lemon"", letter N is at position5? Previously we only tried N at positions 2 and 4? Position5 is new? So N is at5: okay.

Also, E at2: not tried? Fine.

The word ""lemon"" avoids the forbidden letters: L, M, O, N, E. None are C,R,A,S,T? L is allowed, M is allowed.

But we had feedback that N is not at position 2? Now we are putting N at position5? Fine.

But wait: we also need to check if this word has been excluded? No.

But we don't know if L and M are present? They might be absent? But we hope.

We are going to guess? We might get feedback.

But let's see if there is another pattern.

Pattern 3: _ E _ O N
Meaning position2: E, position4: O, position5: N? Then position1 and position3: two letters.

Example: ?? E ?? O N?

Words: 
""p i e d o n"" not? 
""cake O N"" but c forbidden?
We can have: ""d e ? o n"" -> For instance: ""demon"": D E M O N -> 
D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? 
But we wanted pattern _ E _ O N? 
Demon: positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)? So this fits pattern? Or wait: pattern: _ E _ O N -> so five positions: 1: ?, 2:E, 3: ?, 4:O,5:N.

Yes, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5.

Another possibility: ""gekon""? G,E,K,O,N? Yes: G at1, E at2, K at3, O at4, N at5? But ""gekon"" is a lizard? Not common? But acceptable? Or ""lemon"" might be better.

But note: in ""lemon"", it fits pattern 2: position1: L,2:E,3:N,4:O,5:M? Wait: lemon is L at1,E at2,M at3? Wait I think I confused.

Actually: 
lemon: L-E-M-O-N -> so position: 
1: L, 2: E, 3: M, 4: O, 5: N.

Ah, so it's _ E _ O ? at the end? But no: position4 O, position5 N? So pattern: _ E _ O N? Actually pattern: positions 1,2,3,4,5: L,E,M,O,N -> so matches pattern: _ E ? O N? Yes, pattern: position2:E, position4:O, position5:N -> pattern for positions 2,4,5? And position1 and 3 free.

But the N in ""lemon"" is at5? And O at4? We haven't tested N at5 and O at4? So both are possible? 

Similarly, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? Same pattern.

Now, we must consider E at position 3? We haven't tried that?

Wait: E must be at1,2, or3? We haven't tried position3 for E.

So another possibility: E at position3.

Then: _ _ E _ _

And O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? But position3 is E? So O at2,4,5? And N at1,3,or5? But position3 is E? So N at1 or5.

Patterns:

If E at3:

Option A: N at position1? Then pattern: N _ E _ _

And O at position2,4, or5? 

So: 
N O E _ _ -> N O E ? ?
But O at2: not tried? But O cannot be at1? We only tried O at1? So O at2: possible? 

But O at2: in ""onset"" O was at position1? So position2 was N? Now we put O at2? That hasn't been tested? 

But words: NO E L? Not? N O E L L? ""Noell"" not? 

N O E S? S absent? 

N O E? difficult.

Option: O at4: N _ E O _
Then: position1: N, position2:?, position3:E, position4:O, position5:?

Words: 
""n u e o n"" not.
""n i e o n"" not? 
""n e e o n"" -> E repeated? But our guesses allow repeated letters? Probably allowed? But let's assume unique letters unless specified? The rules don't say, but Wordle usually allows repeats. However, in this case E is at position2 and3? But we don't know? 

But our feedback? We haven't been told about doubles? So we must consider? But typically, if there is a double, the feedback would show? For instance, if we guess a word with a double, and the secret has one, it would mark accordingly? Since we haven't encountered, maybe no doubles?

Let's assume no doubles? Because if there were, the feedback might have indicated? But it's not explicit? 

Without knowing, perhaps better to avoid doubles? Or allow.

But in our known letters: O, N, E: probably distinct.

Similarly, option: O at5: N _ E _ O -> pattern? N at1, O at5. E at3. Position2 and4 unknown.

Words: ""n e d e? o"" -> not an easy word.

So back to the E at2? We have two candidate patterns:

pattern: ? E ? O N and ? E ? O N? Wait, same? We have two candidates: words like ""lemon"" (L-E-M-O-N) and ""demon"" (D-E-M-O-N) and ""gekon"" (G-E-K-O-N) etc.

But we don't know the first letter? 

But both ""lemon"" and ""demon"" are common words.

Also, another word: ""piano"" -> P I A N O -> but A is absent? Forbidden? So no.

We are missing one more pattern? E at3? We skipped.

Another word: ""opine"" -> O P I N E -> O at1? But wait: O is not at position1? We know O cannot be at1? So ""opine"" is O at1? Invalid? Because we know O not at1.

But let's consider E at1? We couldn't find words? Perhaps I missed.

If E at1: 
E _ _ _ _ 
Then O and N? O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? And N at3 or5? Not at2 or4.

Words: 
E L _ O N? Like ""e l k o n"" not? 
E L O S N? S absent? 
E N _ O? But N at2? But we know N cannot be at2? So cannot.

E at position1 and N at position3: E _ N _ _
Then O at position4 or5? 

If O at4: E _ N O _
Then: positions 2 and 5: two letters needed? 

Words: E C O N S -> C,S eliminated -> not. 
E T O N S -> T,S eliminated.

E U N O M? Not a word? 

E N N O S? N repeated? S? Eliminated.

So not found.

If O at5: E _ N O _
No: E _ N O _ -> positions:1,2,3,4: E ? N O? Then 5 missing? 

E at1, O, and N: so E ? N O ? 
Fifth letter? 

Words: E M O for? Not? 

Not common.

Therefore, the candidates are words with E at position2 and O at4 and N at5? Like _ E _ O N? 

With the middle letter position3: one letter? 

So five positions: letter1, E(2), letter3, O(4), N(5)

The word: ? E ? O N

So the structure: 
position1: ?
position2: E
position3: ?
position4: O
position5: N

So words: 

- lemon: L E M O N -> M at3? But we have M? Not tested? 
- demon: D E M O N -> M at3? 
- begon? Not common? 
- reckon? R E C O N -> R and C eliminated? 
- felon: F E L O N -> L at3? 
- hemel? Not? 
- memon? Not? 

Viable words: lemon, demon, felon, etc? 

Also: ""vekon"" no? 

Now, the first letter? And the third letter? Must be from the allowed set? No C,R,A,S,T? 

So for lemon: L and M? Allowed? 
Demon: D and M? 
Felon: F and L? 

All letters allowed? 

How about ""melon""? M E L O N? That would be M at1, E at2, L at3, O at4, N at5? And it's a common word. 

But ""melon"": has M and L? 

But note: from feedback, we know O is present? And E, N? Yes? 

And avoiding C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 

So ""melon"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""lemon"" is M and L? 

But ""lemon"": L at1, M at3, O at4, N at5? 

We don't know which? 

But both ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are anagrams? 

Actually: 
- lemon: L-E-M-O-N
- melon: M-E-L-O-N

So same letters? But different positions? 

We need to distinguish? 

But note: we have no information about letters M or L? So both are possible? 

However, we also have ""demon"": D-E-M-O-N? 

But D is a letter? 

We might want to choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? Or we can choose one? 

But we have 6 tries? And we might get lucky? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume we know the other two letters? But since the pattern seems tight, we can guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? 

But let's see the position of O? In both cases O is at position4, which hasn't been tested? 

Similarly, N at5? 

We need to decide? 

Another word: ""temon"" not common? 

So common words: lemon, melon, demon.

But note: ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are both words? 

What about ""nekon"" not? 

We can guess ""demon"" to test D? Or ""melon"" to test M at first position? 

I think ""melon"" is a good guess because it's common.

But let's list all possibilities: 
We have E at position2? O at position4? N at position5? 

Thus, the word is of the form: x E y O N? 

With x at1? y at3? 

x and y must be letters from: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But ""melon"": x=M, y=L? 
""lemon"": x=L, y=M? 
""demon"": x=D, y=M? 
""felon"": x=F, y=L? 

All are possible? 

To maximize new information: perhaps we should guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? But if we guess ""melon"", then we'll get feedback on M and L? 

Since ""melon"" and ""lemon"" share many letters? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has other letters? 

Another possibility: E could be at position1? But we didn't find a word? 

What about ""evzon""? Not a word? 

We might also consider E at position3?

With _ _ E O N? So positions:1 and2? 

Pattern: a b E O N? 

Words: ""queon"" not? 
""bread"" not? 
""scene"" S absent? 
""cream"" C,R,A eliminated? 
""gleam"" G L E A M -> A eliminated? 
""dream"" A? 
""steon"" S? 

Not available? 

So the only patterns seem to be _ E ? O N? 

So we must make a guess? 

Let's choose ""melon""? 

So:

Guess: melon

We are guessing ""melon"": M E L O N.

Now, let's compare with what we know:

M: new letter? We don't know? 
E: at position2? We have not tested E at2? 
L: new? 
O: at position4? Not tested? 
N: at position5? Not tested? 

This should help? 

If the word is ""melon"", we win? If not, we get feedback? 

But note: from ""melon"": 
If M is at1: O might be present? 

But we know O is present? 

So <guess>melon</guess>?

But wait: another possibility: what if O is not at position4? 

For example, we haven't tested O at position3? 

But we assumed E at2? 

But our deduction: E must be at1,2, or3? We have tried E at position2? 

But O can be at position3? For example, if E is at position3: then the word could be ? ? E ? ? 

But with O at position3? But then position3 has both E and O? So either O is elsewhere? 

Actually, if E is at3, then O cannot be at3? So O at2,4,5? 

But we have words? 

For example: if E is at3, O at2? Then word: _ O E _ _

Must have N: at1 or5? 

If at5: _ O E _ N? 
Words: do? 

""H o e?? n"" -> no? 

Or O at4: _ ? E O _ 
Then N at1 or5? 

If N at position1: N ? E O _? 
Words: N X E O Y? 

Example: ""n o e o n"" -> not and double O? 

Or N U E O L -> ""nucle"" with u? Not? 

Or N E E O L -> E repeated? 

Not common? 

O at5: _ ? E ? O 
And N at1: N ? E ? O 
Or at5: but O at5? Then N must be at1? 

Word: N ? E ? O 

Example: N O E L O -> ""noelo"" not? 

Or ""nae o"" not? 

So it seems _ E ? O N is the most promising? 

Thus, perhaps ""melon"" is a good guess.

But to be safe, we could guess a word that contains common letters? 

But I think we go with ""melon"".

So guess: melon

But note: we also have ""demon"", which has D? 

If we guess ""melon"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like: 

If the secret word is ""demon"", and we guess ""melon"", then:

M: not? so x? 
E: at position2: correct? ✓? 
O: at position4: correct? 
N: at position5: correct? 
But if ""demon"" has M at3? Then L: not? 

Similarly, if secret is ""demon"", then feedback for ""melon"":

M: absent? So M(x)? 
E: at2? correct ✓? 
L: absent? L(x)? 
O: at4? ✓? 
N: at5? ✓?

But we know E,O,N present? So M and L absent? 

Then we'll know the third letter is M? And first letter is D? But then ""demon"" would be the only word remaining? 

Similarly, if secret is ""lemon"", then:

M: at position3? So E: position2 correct ✓, L: we guess L at3? But in ""melon"" L is at position3? Then feedback: 
M at1 absent? But position3 L? 
For L: in ""melon"", L is at position3? But secret ""lemon"" has L at position1? So L at position3? Since secret has L at1? So in secret: L is present? Therefore L in wrong position? So ? 
At feedback:

""melon"" vs ""lemon"":

Position1: M -> secret has L? So M absent? 
Position2: E -> E? Correct? ✓
Position3: L -> secret has M? So L absent? 
Position4: O -> O? Correct ✓? 
Position5: N -> N? Correct ✓? 

But wait: secret ""lemon"" has L at position1 and M at position3? 

Therefore when we guess ""melon"":

- M at1: not present? Because secret has L at1? And M? Secret has M at3? So M is present? But at wrong position? 

Ah, I see: we can't assume?

Let's clarify:

Secret word: lemon -> letters: L, E, M, O, N

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N

Feedback for each letter:

- M: Position1: secret position1 is L? So M is present? But not at position1 -> so since M is in secret (at position3), then we should get M at position1: wrong -> '-' ? Symbol ""-"" meaning in word but wrong position? 

But note: M appears in secret at position3? And in guess at position1? So feedback for M: ""in word but wrong position"", so ""-"".

Similarly, for E: position2: both have E? So ✓? 

For L: guess position3: L? But secret has L at position1? So L is present but wrong position? So ""-"".

For O: both position4? ✓? 

For N: both position5? ✓? 

So feedback: M(-) E(✓) L(-) O(✓) N(✓)

Similarly, if secret is ""demon"":

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N
Secret: demon -> D, E, M, O, N

Feedback:
- M: present at secret position3? Guess position1: wrong position -> ""-""? 
- E: position2 correct ✓? 
- L: absent? So x? 
- O: ✓? 
- N: ✓? 

So M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)

If secret is ""melon"" itself: we win.

But we also have ""felon"": F E L O N

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N
Secret: felon -> F, E, L, O, N
Feedback:
- M: absent? x? 
- E: ✓? 
- L: present? at position3? Both have L at3 -> ✓? 
- O: ✓? 
- N: ✓? 

So M(x) E(✓) L(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

Therefore, by guessing ""melon"", we can distinguish: 

- If we get all ✓ (except possibly M), but if M(✓) then we win? 

But anyway, we'll get valuable feedback? 

Because we have E, O, N correct? 

So I'll guess ""melon""? 

Yes. 

So guess: melonBased on previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A are absent. N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- Guess 2 (""onset""): O is present (but not position 1), N is present (but not position 2), S and T are absent, E is present (but not position 4).

Key deductions:
- Secret word must include **O, N, E** (all present) and exclude **C, R, A, S, T** (absent).
- O, N, and E positions:
  - N cannot be at position 2 or 4 (from previous guesses), so it must be at **position 1, 3, or 5**.
  - E cannot be at position 4 or 5, so it must be at **position 1, 2, or 3**.
  - O cannot be at position 1, so it must be at **position 2, 3, 4, or 5**.

After testing feasible patterns, words fitting **E at position 2, O at position 4, and N at position 5** are promising candidates (e.g., _ E _ O N structure). Common examples include ""melon"", ""lemon"", ""demon"", and ""felon"". Among these, ""melon"" is selected because it:
- Uses common letters (M, L) not yet tested.
- Maximizes positional testing for E, O, N at new positions.
- Avoids risk of double letters (unlikely based on feedback).
- Could resolve multiple possibilities through feedback.",Guess 3: melon -> FEEDBACK: M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,DEMON,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) -> E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.
 - The secret word does contain both N and E, but neither is in the position we guessed.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C at position 1 -> wrong
   R at position 2 -> wrong
   A at position 3 -> wrong
   N at position 4 -> exists but not at position 4
   E at position 5 -> exists but not at position 5

 Therefore, for the next guess:
 - We must avoid using C, R, A.
 - We must include N and E.
 - N cannot be at position 4 and E cannot be at position 5.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can try a word that has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively, and avoids the excluded letters.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and do not have C, R, A.

 Also, note: we have 5 letters to guess and we know two letters (N and E) are present.

 We need to consider common English words.

 Possible words: 
 We can try words that have E and N in different positions.

 For example, let's list some words that have E and N, and without C, R, A:
 - ""lines"": has L, I, N, E, S -> but note: we don't know if L, I, S are in the word?
 - ""spine"": S, P, I, N, E -> again, no C, R, A.

 However, we also need to consider that the feedback did not show any correct positions in the first guess.

 We can try to place N and E in positions they couldn't be in the first guess.

 Since in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, so in the next guess we can try N at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
 Similarly, E was at position 5 and was wrong, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: the secret word must have N and E, but in different positions.

 Let's try to choose a word that maximizes new information.

 Another idea: since we have only two known letters, we should include other common letters to test.

 Common letters not used: S, T, O, P, L, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the same positions for N and E.

 Let me choose a word that has:
 - E at a position other than 5
 - N at a position other than 4

 And that doesn't use C, R, A.

 Example: ""senti"" is not 5 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.

 Consider ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E -> but check: N is at position 4, which is the same position as in ""crane"". We know N was not at position 4 in the secret word? So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's wrong? However, we are not forced to avoid it, but it would be wasteful.

 We know that position 4 is incorrect for N, so trying N again at position 4 won't help. Similarly, E at position 5 is incorrect.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.

 What about ""stone""? 
   S in position 1
   T in position 2
   O in position 3
   N in position 4 -> we know it's wrong because the secret word has N but not at position 4? So if I use ""stone"", then if N is at position 4 again, we'd get a '-' for N? But that would tell us nothing new? Actually, we already know it's not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 again, we can only get either:
     - If it turns out to be '-' again -> then we have learned nothing? Actually, it would be the same as before. But note: we know the secret word does have N, but we don't know where. So putting N at position 4 again will just confirm it's still not position 4 (which we already know).

 Therefore, it's better to put N in a different position to test a new position.

 Similarly for E.

 So let's try a word that puts N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but note position 4 we avoid) and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we need to avoid: C, R, A.

 I think of words:

 Option 1: ""inept"" -> I, N, E, P, T -> 
   Positions: 
      N at position 2? 
      E at position 3?
   But wait: ""inept"" has N at position 2 and E at position 3.

 Option 2: ""spend"": S, P, E, N, D -> 
   E at position 3, N at position 4 -> but N at position 4 is the same as before? So we avoid that.

 Option 3: ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N at position 2, E at position 4 -> that avoids the positions? 
   We didn't try E at position 4 and N at position 2 in the first guess?

 But note: we know E is not at position 5 and N not at position 4. We have no restriction for E at position 4? 
   So ""onset"": 
      position 1: O
      position 2: N
      position 3: S
      position 4: E
      position 5: T

 This way, we are testing N at position 2 (which wasn't tested before) and E at position 4 (which wasn't tested before).

 Also, O, S, T are new letters.

 Another candidate: ""tines"" -> T, I, N, E, S -> 
   positions: N at 3 and E at 4? Then T at 1, I at 2, S at 5.

 This also avoids putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 Let me compare:

 ""onset"": O (new), N (at pos2), S (new), E (at pos4), T (new)
 ""tines"": T (new), I (new), N (at pos3), E (at pos4), S (new)

 Both are valid. But note: ""onset"" is a common word? Yes.

 However, we have no information about the presence of any new letter. So either is fine.

 Since we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter or position, and note that S and T are common.

 I'll go with ""onset"".

 So the next guess: ""onset""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must **exclude C, R, A**.
- Must **include N and E**, with N avoiding position 4 and E avoiding position 5.
- Choose a word that tests new letters (e.g., common consonants) and positions for N/E.

A strong candidate is **""onset""**:
- Places N at **position 2** (a new position, avoiding position 4).
- Places E at **position 4** (a new position, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids invalid letters (C/R/A) and repositions N/E effectively.

<guess>onset</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: onset -> O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2. (We already knew N is not at position 4 from the first guess, so now we know it's also not at 2 or 4.)
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4. (We knew E not at position 5; now also not at 4.)
- T is not in the word.

So let's recap what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T.

Letters IN the word and their known positions to avoid:
- N: not at position 2,4 (and 5? We haven't checked yet, but note: in ""crane"" it was at 4 and ""onset"" at 2, so avoid 2,4 for N. We don't know about 1,3,5 yet.)
- E: not at position 4,5 (and avoid position 3? We haven't checked position 3 for E yet.)
- O: in the word and not at position 1.

Also, from the first guess we had E(-) meaning E is present but not at position 5. And in the second guess E(-) meaning not at position 4. So E is present but we have avoided positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, O is present and we know it's not at position 1 (from guess 2). So O must be in positions 2,3,4,5? But wait: position 4 and 5 for E are already avoided? But E is not O? So O can be at any position except 1.

Also N: we know it's present. We have tried: 
- In ""crane"" at position 4 -> not there
- In ""onset"" at position 2 -> not there

So N must be at position 1, 3, or 5? Wait: positions are 1 to 5. Not at 2 or 4. So positions left for N: 1,3,5.

We know the word has 5 letters and contains: O, N, E. That's at least three letters. And we have eliminated C, R, A, S, T.

But we don't know the other two letters? We haven't found all five letters yet? There are two more letters to discover.

We need to think of words that have O, N, E, and two other letters that are not C, R, A, S, T.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have indications from the feedback:

For E: must be at position 1,2, or 3 (since not 4 or 5). Similarly, O must be at positions 2,3,4, or 5 (since not 1). And N must be at 1,3, or 5.

Now let's think of possible words:

We need a word that contains O, N, E, and two other letters from the remaining.

We know E cannot be at 4 or 5 -> so E must be at 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, O must be at 2,3, or 4 or 5? Wait: but E might be at 1,2,3 and O can overlap? They are different letters.

Let's try to form patterns:

Possible placements:

Suppose E is at position 1: Then O can be at 2,3,4,5? And N can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1 because E is there? Wait: E and N are different.

But note: if E is at position 1, then O can be at 2,3,4,5 and N at 3,5? But at position 3: only one letter can be there.

Similarly, we have to assign positions.

We can list possible words:

Consider words with E in position 1: 
Then the word starts with E.
Must have O and N in the remaining positions, avoiding positions for O, N? 
But O cannot be at position 1? Already taken by E? So that's fine? O can be at 2,3,4,5? 
N can be at 3,5? But avoid 2 and 4.

Example words starting with E: 
E _ _ _ _

Must contain O and N, and avoid C,R,A,S,T.

For example: 
""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but does it have N? No.
""ENVOY"" -> E, N, V, O, Y -> has N and O? E at 1, N at 2? But N at 2: we know N cannot be at position 2? From guess 2! So no ""envo"" has N at position 2 -> invalid.

Another: ""EIGHT"" -> no O or N? Not.

What about ""EOSIN""? That's not common? Or ""eosin"" is a word? Meaning a dye? It's 5 letters: E, O, S, I, N -> but S is marked as absent? So cannot have S. So invalid.

Another: ""EXCON""? X, not in? Not a common word? Also, might have T? No, T is absent.

What about ""E"" words? Maybe E at 1 is rare? So perhaps E is not at 1.

Then consider E at position 2: 
_ E _ _ _

Then O can be at 3,4,5? And N must be at 1,3,5? But E is at 2. So we cannot have O at 2? And N cannot at 2? So N can be at 1,3,5.

Similarly, O at 3,4,5.

Let's form: positions:
1: (can be N or a new letter, not O? O can't be at 1? But wait: the word so far: position 1 is free? 
But if N is at position 1: then the word is N E _ _ _
Then O at 3,4,5? 

Or if N is at 3: then _ E N _ _
Then O at 4 or 5? 

Similarly, if N is at 5: _ E _ _ N, then O at 3 or 4? 

We must avoid the letters C,R,A,S,T.

For instance, let's try: if the word is _ E _ O _
But O is at position 4? Then we have _ E _ O _

Must also have N. Where? Position 1: then N E _ O _
Or position 3: _ E N O _
Or position 5: _ E _ O N

Now, we need to fill with letters from the remaining set.

Also, E must be at position 2? So we have:

Patterns:
1: N E _ O _ 
2: _ E N O _
3: _ E _ O N

But position 5 for the last one: we have E at 2 and O at 4, N at 5.

Now, we must pick letters for the blanks.

Consider pattern 1: N E _ O _
Positions 3 and 5 to fill? But we have O at 4? So positions 3 and 5: we need two more letters.

Words for pattern 1: 
For example: N E W O N -> ""newon"" not a word? 
N E M O N -> ""nemon"" not. 
N E L O N -> ""nelon"" not. 
N E P O N -> ""nepon""? Not common.

How about: ""DEVON""? D E V O N -> D not forbidden? And V not forbidden? But N is at position 5. Pattern: N E ...? Wait no: pattern 1 is N E _ O _, so position 3 and 5: the last letter is at 5? But in ""devon"": positions are D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, N at5 -> but we are having N at1? No: pattern 1 has N at1? So ""devon"" has D at1? Not matching.

Pattern 1: position 1: N, position 2: E, position 4: O, and then position 3: ?, position 5: ?

We need a word: N E x O y

Words: 
""NEVRO"" not a word? 
""NEGRO"" -> but R is eliminated? R is absent? So no R.
""NEUMO"" not a word?
""NEATO"" -> but T and A? T absent, A absent.

None? 

Pattern 2: _ E N O _
Meaning position1: ?, position2: E, position3: N, position4: O, position5: ?

Example words: 
""l e n o s"" -> S absent? 
""d e n o t"" -> T absent? 
""p e n o s"" -> S absent? 
""b e n o m"" -> not common? 
""hem not? 

What about ""lemon""? L E M O N -> letters: L,E,M,O,N. Check: 
L: allowed? 
M: allowed? 
N: at position 5? We haven't tried position 5 for N? So allowed? 
But E is at position 2 -> okay, E at 2 is not tested? 
O at position 4? We tested O at position 4? In ""onset"", O was at position 1? No: in ""onset"" the positions were position1: O, position2: N, position3: S, position4: E, position5: T. So O was tried at position1, that was wrong. So O at position4? In this word ""lemon"", O is at position4? That hasn't been tested? So possible? 

But wait: in ""lemon"", letter N is at position5? Previously we only tried N at positions 2 and 4? Position5 is new? So N is at5: okay.

Also, E at2: not tried? Fine.

The word ""lemon"" avoids the forbidden letters: L, M, O, N, E. None are C,R,A,S,T? L is allowed, M is allowed.

But we had feedback that N is not at position 2? Now we are putting N at position5? Fine.

But wait: we also need to check if this word has been excluded? No.

But we don't know if L and M are present? They might be absent? But we hope.

We are going to guess? We might get feedback.

But let's see if there is another pattern.

Pattern 3: _ E _ O N
Meaning position2: E, position4: O, position5: N? Then position1 and position3: two letters.

Example: ?? E ?? O N?

Words: 
""p i e d o n"" not? 
""cake O N"" but c forbidden?
We can have: ""d e ? o n"" -> For instance: ""demon"": D E M O N -> 
D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? 
But we wanted pattern _ E _ O N? 
Demon: positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)? So this fits pattern? Or wait: pattern: _ E _ O N -> so five positions: 1: ?, 2:E, 3: ?, 4:O,5:N.

Yes, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5.

Another possibility: ""gekon""? G,E,K,O,N? Yes: G at1, E at2, K at3, O at4, N at5? But ""gekon"" is a lizard? Not common? But acceptable? Or ""lemon"" might be better.

But note: in ""lemon"", it fits pattern 2: position1: L,2:E,3:N,4:O,5:M? Wait: lemon is L at1,E at2,M at3? Wait I think I confused.

Actually: 
lemon: L-E-M-O-N -> so position: 
1: L, 2: E, 3: M, 4: O, 5: N.

Ah, so it's _ E _ O ? at the end? But no: position4 O, position5 N? So pattern: _ E _ O N? Actually pattern: positions 1,2,3,4,5: L,E,M,O,N -> so matches pattern: _ E ? O N? Yes, pattern: position2:E, position4:O, position5:N -> pattern for positions 2,4,5? And position1 and 3 free.

But the N in ""lemon"" is at5? And O at4? We haven't tested N at5 and O at4? So both are possible? 

Similarly, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? Same pattern.

Now, we must consider E at position 3? We haven't tried that?

Wait: E must be at1,2, or3? We haven't tried position3 for E.

So another possibility: E at position3.

Then: _ _ E _ _

And O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? But position3 is E? So O at2,4,5? And N at1,3,or5? But position3 is E? So N at1 or5.

Patterns:

If E at3:

Option A: N at position1? Then pattern: N _ E _ _

And O at position2,4, or5? 

So: 
N O E _ _ -> N O E ? ?
But O at2: not tried? But O cannot be at1? We only tried O at1? So O at2: possible? 

But O at2: in ""onset"" O was at position1? So position2 was N? Now we put O at2? That hasn't been tested? 

But words: NO E L? Not? N O E L L? ""Noell"" not? 

N O E S? S absent? 

N O E? difficult.

Option: O at4: N _ E O _
Then: position1: N, position2:?, position3:E, position4:O, position5:?

Words: 
""n u e o n"" not.
""n i e o n"" not? 
""n e e o n"" -> E repeated? But our guesses allow repeated letters? Probably allowed? But let's assume unique letters unless specified? The rules don't say, but Wordle usually allows repeats. However, in this case E is at position2 and3? But we don't know? 

But our feedback? We haven't been told about doubles? So we must consider? But typically, if there is a double, the feedback would show? For instance, if we guess a word with a double, and the secret has one, it would mark accordingly? Since we haven't encountered, maybe no doubles?

Let's assume no doubles? Because if there were, the feedback might have indicated? But it's not explicit? 

Without knowing, perhaps better to avoid doubles? Or allow.

But in our known letters: O, N, E: probably distinct.

Similarly, option: O at5: N _ E _ O -> pattern? N at1, O at5. E at3. Position2 and4 unknown.

Words: ""n e d e? o"" -> not an easy word.

So back to the E at2? We have two candidate patterns:

pattern: ? E ? O N and ? E ? O N? Wait, same? We have two candidates: words like ""lemon"" (L-E-M-O-N) and ""demon"" (D-E-M-O-N) and ""gekon"" (G-E-K-O-N) etc.

But we don't know the first letter? 

But both ""lemon"" and ""demon"" are common words.

Also, another word: ""piano"" -> P I A N O -> but A is absent? Forbidden? So no.

We are missing one more pattern? E at3? We skipped.

Another word: ""opine"" -> O P I N E -> O at1? But wait: O is not at position1? We know O cannot be at1? So ""opine"" is O at1? Invalid? Because we know O not at1.

But let's consider E at1? We couldn't find words? Perhaps I missed.

If E at1: 
E _ _ _ _ 
Then O and N? O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? And N at3 or5? Not at2 or4.

Words: 
E L _ O N? Like ""e l k o n"" not? 
E L O S N? S absent? 
E N _ O? But N at2? But we know N cannot be at2? So cannot.

E at position1 and N at position3: E _ N _ _
Then O at position4 or5? 

If O at4: E _ N O _
Then: positions 2 and 5: two letters needed? 

Words: E C O N S -> C,S eliminated -> not. 
E T O N S -> T,S eliminated.

E U N O M? Not a word? 

E N N O S? N repeated? S? Eliminated.

So not found.

If O at5: E _ N O _
No: E _ N O _ -> positions:1,2,3,4: E ? N O? Then 5 missing? 

E at1, O, and N: so E ? N O ? 
Fifth letter? 

Words: E M O for? Not? 

Not common.

Therefore, the candidates are words with E at position2 and O at4 and N at5? Like _ E _ O N? 

With the middle letter position3: one letter? 

So five positions: letter1, E(2), letter3, O(4), N(5)

The word: ? E ? O N

So the structure: 
position1: ?
position2: E
position3: ?
position4: O
position5: N

So words: 

- lemon: L E M O N -> M at3? But we have M? Not tested? 
- demon: D E M O N -> M at3? 
- begon? Not common? 
- reckon? R E C O N -> R and C eliminated? 
- felon: F E L O N -> L at3? 
- hemel? Not? 
- memon? Not? 

Viable words: lemon, demon, felon, etc? 

Also: ""vekon"" no? 

Now, the first letter? And the third letter? Must be from the allowed set? No C,R,A,S,T? 

So for lemon: L and M? Allowed? 
Demon: D and M? 
Felon: F and L? 

All letters allowed? 

How about ""melon""? M E L O N? That would be M at1, E at2, L at3, O at4, N at5? And it's a common word. 

But ""melon"": has M and L? 

But note: from feedback, we know O is present? And E, N? Yes? 

And avoiding C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 

So ""melon"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""lemon"" is M and L? 

But ""lemon"": L at1, M at3, O at4, N at5? 

We don't know which? 

But both ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are anagrams? 

Actually: 
- lemon: L-E-M-O-N
- melon: M-E-L-O-N

So same letters? But different positions? 

We need to distinguish? 

But note: we have no information about letters M or L? So both are possible? 

However, we also have ""demon"": D-E-M-O-N? 

But D is a letter? 

We might want to choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? Or we can choose one? 

But we have 6 tries? And we might get lucky? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume we know the other two letters? But since the pattern seems tight, we can guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? 

But let's see the position of O? In both cases O is at position4, which hasn't been tested? 

Similarly, N at5? 

We need to decide? 

Another word: ""temon"" not common? 

So common words: lemon, melon, demon.

But note: ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are both words? 

What about ""nekon"" not? 

We can guess ""demon"" to test D? Or ""melon"" to test M at first position? 

I think ""melon"" is a good guess because it's common.

But let's list all possibilities: 
We have E at position2? O at position4? N at position5? 

Thus, the word is of the form: x E y O N? 

With x at1? y at3? 

x and y must be letters from: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But ""melon"": x=M, y=L? 
""lemon"": x=L, y=M? 
""demon"": x=D, y=M? 
""felon"": x=F, y=L? 

All are possible? 

To maximize new information: perhaps we should guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? But if we guess ""melon"", then we'll get feedback on M and L? 

Since ""melon"" and ""lemon"" share many letters? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has other letters? 

Another possibility: E could be at position1? But we didn't find a word? 

What about ""evzon""? Not a word? 

We might also consider E at position3?

With _ _ E O N? So positions:1 and2? 

Pattern: a b E O N? 

Words: ""queon"" not? 
""bread"" not? 
""scene"" S absent? 
""cream"" C,R,A eliminated? 
""gleam"" G L E A M -> A eliminated? 
""dream"" A? 
""steon"" S? 

Not available? 

So the only patterns seem to be _ E ? O N? 

So we must make a guess? 

Let's choose ""melon""? 

So:

Guess: melon

We are guessing ""melon"": M E L O N.

Now, let's compare with what we know:

M: new letter? We don't know? 
E: at position2? We have not tested E at2? 
L: new? 
O: at position4? Not tested? 
N: at position5? Not tested? 

This should help? 

If the word is ""melon"", we win? If not, we get feedback? 

But note: from ""melon"": 
If M is at1: O might be present? 

But we know O is present? 

So <guess>melon</guess>?

But wait: another possibility: what if O is not at position4? 

For example, we haven't tested O at position3? 

But we assumed E at2? 

But our deduction: E must be at1,2, or3? We have tried E at position2? 

But O can be at position3? For example, if E is at position3: then the word could be ? ? E ? ? 

But with O at position3? But then position3 has both E and O? So either O is elsewhere? 

Actually, if E is at3, then O cannot be at3? So O at2,4,5? 

But we have words? 

For example: if E is at3, O at2? Then word: _ O E _ _

Must have N: at1 or5? 

If at5: _ O E _ N? 
Words: do? 

""H o e?? n"" -> no? 

Or O at4: _ ? E O _ 
Then N at1 or5? 

If N at position1: N ? E O _? 
Words: N X E O Y? 

Example: ""n o e o n"" -> not and double O? 

Or N U E O L -> ""nucle"" with u? Not? 

Or N E E O L -> E repeated? 

Not common? 

O at5: _ ? E ? O 
And N at1: N ? E ? O 
Or at5: but O at5? Then N must be at1? 

Word: N ? E ? O 

Example: N O E L O -> ""noelo"" not? 

Or ""nae o"" not? 

So it seems _ E ? O N is the most promising? 

Thus, perhaps ""melon"" is a good guess.

But to be safe, we could guess a word that contains common letters? 

But I think we go with ""melon"".

So guess: melon

But note: we also have ""demon"", which has D? 

If we guess ""melon"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback like: 

If the secret word is ""demon"", and we guess ""melon"", then:

M: not? so x? 
E: at position2: correct? ✓? 
O: at position4: correct? 
N: at position5: correct? 
But if ""demon"" has M at3? Then L: not? 

Similarly, if secret is ""demon"", then feedback for ""melon"":

M: absent? So M(x)? 
E: at2? correct ✓? 
L: absent? L(x)? 
O: at4? ✓? 
N: at5? ✓?

But we know E,O,N present? So M and L absent? 

Then we'll know the third letter is M? And first letter is D? But then ""demon"" would be the only word remaining? 

Similarly, if secret is ""lemon"", then:

M: at position3? So E: position2 correct ✓, L: we guess L at3? But in ""melon"" L is at position3? Then feedback: 
M at1 absent? But position3 L? 
For L: in ""melon"", L is at position3? But secret ""lemon"" has L at position1? So L at position3? Since secret has L at1? So in secret: L is present? Therefore L in wrong position? So ? 
At feedback:

""melon"" vs ""lemon"":

Position1: M -> secret has L? So M absent? 
Position2: E -> E? Correct? ✓
Position3: L -> secret has M? So L absent? 
Position4: O -> O? Correct ✓? 
Position5: N -> N? Correct ✓? 

But wait: secret ""lemon"" has L at position1 and M at position3? 

Therefore when we guess ""melon"":

- M at1: not present? Because secret has L at1? And M? Secret has M at3? So M is present? But at wrong position? 

Ah, I see: we can't assume?

Let's clarify:

Secret word: lemon -> letters: L, E, M, O, N

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N

Feedback for each letter:

- M: Position1: secret position1 is L? So M is present? But not at position1 -> so since M is in secret (at position3), then we should get M at position1: wrong -> '-' ? Symbol ""-"" meaning in word but wrong position? 

But note: M appears in secret at position3? And in guess at position1? So feedback for M: ""in word but wrong position"", so ""-"".

Similarly, for E: position2: both have E? So ✓? 

For L: guess position3: L? But secret has L at position1? So L is present but wrong position? So ""-"".

For O: both position4? ✓? 

For N: both position5? ✓? 

So feedback: M(-) E(✓) L(-) O(✓) N(✓)

Similarly, if secret is ""demon"":

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N
Secret: demon -> D, E, M, O, N

Feedback:
- M: present at secret position3? Guess position1: wrong position -> ""-""? 
- E: position2 correct ✓? 
- L: absent? So x? 
- O: ✓? 
- N: ✓? 

So M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)

If secret is ""melon"" itself: we win.

But we also have ""felon"": F E L O N

Guess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N
Secret: felon -> F, E, L, O, N
Feedback:
- M: absent? x? 
- E: ✓? 
- L: present? at position3? Both have L at3 -> ✓? 
- O: ✓? 
- N: ✓? 

So M(x) E(✓) L(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

Therefore, by guessing ""melon"", we can distinguish: 

- If we get all ✓ (except possibly M), but if M(✓) then we win? 

But anyway, we'll get valuable feedback? 

Because we have E, O, N correct? 

So I'll guess ""melon""? 

Yes. 

So guess: melonBased on previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A are absent. N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- Guess 2 (""onset""): O is present (but not position 1), N is present (but not position 2), S and T are absent, E is present (but not position 4).

Key deductions:
- Secret word must include **O, N, E** (all present) and exclude **C, R, A, S, T** (absent).
- O, N, and E positions:
  - N cannot be at position 2 or 4 (from previous guesses), so it must be at **position 1, 3, or 5**.
  - E cannot be at position 4 or 5, so it must be at **position 1, 2, or 3**.
  - O cannot be at position 1, so it must be at **position 2, 3, 4, or 5**.

After testing feasible patterns, words fitting **E at position 2, O at position 4, and N at position 5** are promising candidates (e.g., _ E _ O N structure). Common examples include ""melon"", ""lemon"", ""demon"", and ""felon"". Among these, ""melon"" is selected because it:
- Uses common letters (M, L) not yet tested.
- Maximizes positional testing for E, O, N at new positions.
- Avoids risk of double letters (unlikely based on feedback).
- Could resolve multiple possibilities through feedback.

Let me think of 5-letter words.\n\n Consider ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E -> but check: N is at position 4, which is the same position as in ""crane"". We know N was not at position 4 in the secret word? So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s wrong? However, we are not forced to avoid it, but it would be wasteful.\n\n We know that position 4 is incorrect for N, so trying N again at position 4 won\'t help. Similarly, E at position 5 is incorrect.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.\n\n What about ""stone""? \n   S in position 1\n   T in position 2\n   O in position 3\n   N in position 4 -> we know it\'s wrong because the secret word has N but not at position 4? So if I use ""stone"", then if N is at position 4 again, we\'d get a \'-\' for N? But that would tell us nothing new? Actually, we already know it\'s not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 again, we can only get either:\n     - If it turns out to be \'-\' again -> then we have learned nothing? Actually, it would be the same as before. But note: we know the secret word does have N, but we don\'t know where. So putting N at position 4 again will just confirm it\'s still not position 4 (which we already know).\n\n Therefore, it\'s better to put N in a different position to test a new position.\n\n Similarly for E.\n\n So let\'s try a word that puts N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but note position 4 we avoid) and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Also, we need to avoid: C, R, A.\n\n I think of words:\n\n Option 1: ""inept"" -> I, N, E, P, T -> \n   Positions: \n      N at position 2? \n      E at position 3?\n   But wait: ""inept"" has N at position 2 and E at position 3.\n\n Option 2: ""spend"": S, P, E, N, D -> \n   E at position 3, N at position 4 -> but N at position 4 is the same as before? So we avoid that.\n\n Option 3: ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> \n   N at position 2, E at position 4 -> that avoids the positions? \n   We didn\'t try E at position 4 and N at position 2 in the first guess?\n\n But note: we know E is not at position 5 and N not at position 4. We have no restriction for E at position 4? \n   So ""onset"": \n      position 1: O\n      position 2: N\n      position 3: S\n      position 4: E\n      position 5: T\n\n This way, we are testing N at position 2 (which wasn\'t tested before) and E at position 4 (which wasn\'t tested before).\n\n Also, O, S, T are new letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""tines"" -> T, I, N, E, S -> \n   positions: N at 3 and E at 4? Then T at 1, I at 2, S at 5.\n\n This also avoids putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n ""onset"": O (new), N (at pos2), S (new), E (at pos4), T (new)\n ""tines"": T (new), I (new), N (at pos3), E (at pos4), S (new)\n\n Both are valid.

We haven\'t checked yet, but note: in ""crane"" it was at 4 and ""onset"" at 2, so avoid 2,4 for N. We don\'t know about 1,3,5 yet.)\n- E: not at position 4,5 (and avoid position 3? We haven\'t checked position 3 for E yet.)\n- O: in the word and not at position 1.\n\nAlso, from the first guess we had E(-) meaning E is present but not at position 5. And in the second guess E(-) meaning not at position 4. So E is present but we have avoided positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O is present and we know it\'s not at position 1 (from guess 2). So O must be in positions 2,3,4,5? But wait: position 4 and 5 for E are already avoided? But E is not O? So O can be at any position except 1.\n\nAlso N: we know it\'s present. We have tried: \n- In ""crane"" at position 4 -> not there\n- In ""onset"" at position 2 -> not there\n\nSo N must be at position 1, 3, or 5? Wait: positions are 1 to 5. Not at 2 or 4. So positions left for N: 1,3,5.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters and contains: O, N, E. That\'s at least three letters. And we have eliminated C, R, A, S, T.\n\nBut we don\'t know the other two letters? We haven\'t found all five letters yet? There are two more letters to discover.\n\nWe need to think of words that have O, N, E, and two other letters that are not C, R, A, S, T.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also have indications from the feedback:\n\nFor E: must be at position 1,2, or 3 (since not 4 or 5). Similarly, O must be at positions 2,3,4, or 5 (since not 1). And N must be at 1,3, or 5.\n\nNow let\'s think of possible words:\n\nWe need a word that contains O, N, E, and two other letters from the remaining.\n\nWe know E cannot be at 4 or 5 -> so E must be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O must be at 2,3, or 4 or 5? Wait: but E might be at 1,2,3 and O can overlap? They are different letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form patterns:\n\nPossible placements:\n\nSuppose E is at position 1: Then O can be at 2,3,4,5? And N can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1 because E is there? Wait: E and N are different.\n\nBut note: if E is at position 1, then O can be at 2,3,4,5 and N at 3,5? But at position 3: only one letter can be there.\n\nSimilarly, we have to assign positions.\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\nConsider words with E in position 1: \nThen the word starts with E.\nMust have O and N in the remaining positions, avoiding positions for O, N? \nBut O cannot be at position 1? Already taken by E? So that\'s fine? O can be at 2,3,4,5? \nN can be at 3,5? But avoid 2 and 4.\n\nExample words starting with E: \nE _ _ _ _\n\nMust contain O and N, and avoid C,R,A,S,T.\n\nFor example: \n""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but does it have N? No.\n""ENVOY"" -> E, N, V, O, Y -> has N and O? E at 1, N at 2? But N at 2: we know N cannot be at position 2? From guess 2! So no ""envo"" has N at position 2 -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""EIGHT"" -> no O or N? Not.\n\nWhat about ""EOSIN""? That\'s not common? Or ""eosin"" is a word? Meaning a dye? It\'s 5 letters: E, O, S, I, N -> but S is marked as absent? So cannot have S. So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""EXCON""? X, not in? Not a common word? Also, might have T? No, T is absent.\n\nWhat about ""E"" words? Maybe E at 1 is rare? So perhaps E is not at 1.\n\nThen consider E at position 2: \n_ E _ _ _\n\nThen O can be at 3,4,5? And N must be at 1,3,5? But E is at 2. So we cannot have O at 2? And N cannot at 2? So N can be at 1,3,5.\n\nSimilarly, O at 3,4,5.\n\nLet\'s form: positions:\n1: (can be N or a new letter, not O? O can\'t be at 1? But wait: the word so far: position 1 is free? \nBut if N is at position 1: then the word is N E _ _ _\nThen O at 3,4,5? \n\nOr if N is at 3: then _ E N _ _\nThen O at 4 or 5? \n\nSimilarly, if N is at 5: _ E _ _ N, then O at 3 or 4? \n\nWe must avoid the letters C,R,A,S,T.\n\nFor instance, let\'s try: if the word is _ E _ O _\nBut O is at position 4? Then we have _ E _ O _\n\nMust also have N. Where? Position 1: then N E _ O _\nOr position 3: _ E N O _\nOr position 5: _ E _ O N\n\nNow, we need to fill with letters from the remaining set.\n\nAlso, E must be at position 2? So we have:\n\nPatterns:\n1: N E _ O _ \n2: _ E N O _\n3: _ E _ O N\n\nBut position 5 for the last one: we have E at 2 and O at 4, N at 5.\n\nNow, we must pick letters for the blanks.\n\nConsider pattern 1: N E _ O _\nPositions 3 and 5 to fill? But we have O at 4? So positions 3 and 5: we need two more letters.\n\nWords for pattern 1: \nFor example: N E W O N -> ""newon"" not a word? \nN E M O N -> ""nemon"" not. \nN E L O N -> ""nelon"" not. \nN E P O N -> ""nepon""? Not common.\n\nHow about: ""DEVON""? D E V O N -> D not forbidden? And V not forbidden? But N is at position 5. Pattern: N E ...? Wait no: pattern 1 is N E _ O _, so position 3 and 5: the last letter is at 5? But in ""devon"": positions are D at1, E at2, V at3, O at4, N at5 -> but we are having N at1? No: pattern 1 has N at1? So ""devon"" has D at1? Not matching.\n\nPattern 1: position 1: N, position 2: E, position 4: O, and then position 3: ?, position 5: ?\n\nWe need a word: N E x O y\n\nWords: \n""NEVRO"" not a word? \n""NEGRO"" -> but R is eliminated? R is absent? So no R.\n""NEUMO"" not a word?\n""NEATO"" -> but T and A? T absent, A absent.\n\nNone? \n\nPattern 2: _ E N O _\nMeaning position1: ?, position2: E, position3: N, position4: O, position5: ?\n\nExample words: \n""l e n o s"" -> S absent? \n""d e n o t"" -> T absent? \n""p e n o s"" -> S absent? \n""b e n o m"" -> not common? \n""hem not? \n\nWhat about ""lemon""? L E M O N -> letters: L,E,M,O,N. Check: \nL: allowed? \nM: allowed? \nN: at position 5? We haven\'t tried position 5 for N? So allowed? \nBut E is at position 2 -> okay, E at 2 is not tested? \nO at position 4? We tested O at position 4? In ""onset"", O was at position 1? No: in ""onset"" the positions were position1: O, position2: N, position3: S, position4: E, position5: T. So O was tried at position1, that was wrong. So O at position4? In this word ""lemon"", O is at position4? That hasn\'t been tested? So possible? \n\nBut wait: in ""lemon"", letter N is at position5? Previously we only tried N at positions 2 and 4? Position5 is new? So N is at5: okay.\n\nAlso, E at2: not tried? Fine.\n\nThe word ""lemon"" avoids the forbidden letters: L, M, O, N, E. None are C,R,A,S,T? L is allowed, M is allowed.\n\nBut we had feedback that N is not at position 2? Now we are putting N at position5? Fine.\n\nBut wait: we also need to check if this word has been excluded? No.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L and M are present? They might be absent? But we hope.\n\nWe are going to guess? We might get feedback.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is another pattern.\n\nPattern 3: _ E _ O N\nMeaning position2: E, position4: O, position5: N? Then position1 and position3: two letters.\n\nExample: ?? E ?? O N?\n\nWords: \n""p i e d o n"" not? \n""cake O N"" but c forbidden?\nWe can have: ""d e ? o n"" -> For instance: ""demon"": D E M O N -> \nD at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? \nBut we wanted pattern _ E _ O N? \nDemon: positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)? So this fits pattern? Or wait: pattern: _ E _ O N -> so five positions: 1: ?, 2:E, 3: ?, 4:O,5:N.\n\nYes, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5.\n\nAnother possibility: ""gekon""? G,E,K,O,N? Yes: G at1, E at2, K at3, O at4, N at5? But ""gekon"" is a lizard? Not common? But acceptable? Or ""lemon"" might be better.\n\nBut note: in ""lemon"", it fits pattern 2: position1: L,2:E,3:N,4:O,5:M? Wait: lemon is L at1,E at2,M at3? Wait I think I confused.\n\nActually: \nlemon: L-E-M-O-N -> so position: \n1: L, 2: E, 3: M, 4: O, 5: N.\n\nAh, so it\'s _ E _ O ? at the end? But no: position4 O, position5 N? So pattern: _ E _ O N? Actually pattern: positions 1,2,3,4,5: L,E,M,O,N -> so matches pattern: _ E ? O N? Yes, pattern: position2:E, position4:O, position5:N -> pattern for positions 2,4,5? And position1 and 3 free.\n\nBut the N in ""lemon"" is at5? And O at4? We haven\'t tested N at5 and O at4? So both are possible? \n\nSimilarly, ""demon"": D at1, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? Same pattern.\n\nNow, we must consider E at position 3? We haven\'t tried that?\n\nWait: E must be at1,2, or3? We haven\'t tried position3 for E.\n\nSo another possibility: E at position3.\n\nThen: _ _ E _ _\n\nAnd O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? But position3 is E? So O at2,4,5? And N at1,3,or5? But position3 is E? So N at1 or5.\n\nPatterns:\n\nIf E at3:\n\nOption A: N at position1? Then pattern: N _ E _ _\n\nAnd O at position2,4, or5? \n\nSo: \nN O E _ _ -> N O E ? ?\nBut O at2: not tried? But O cannot be at1? We only tried O at1? So O at2: possible? \n\nBut O at2: in ""onset"" O was at position1? So position2 was N? Now we put O at2? That hasn\'t been tested? \n\nBut words: NO E L? Not? N O E L L? ""Noell"" not? \n\nN O E S? S absent? \n\nN O E? difficult.\n\nOption: O at4: N _ E O _\nThen: position1: N, position2:?, position3:E, position4:O, position5:?\n\nWords: \n""n u e o n"" not.\n""n i e o n"" not? \n""n e e o n"" -> E repeated? But our guesses allow repeated letters? Probably allowed? But let\'s assume unique letters unless specified? The rules don\'t say, but Wordle usually allows repeats. However, in this case E is at position2 and3? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut our feedback? We haven\'t been told about doubles? So we must consider? But typically, if there is a double, the feedback would show? For instance, if we guess a word with a double, and the secret has one, it would mark accordingly? Since we haven\'t encountered, maybe no doubles?\n\nLet\'s assume no doubles? Because if there were, the feedback might have indicated? But it\'s not explicit? \n\nWithout knowing, perhaps better to avoid doubles? Or allow.\n\nBut in our known letters: O, N, E: probably distinct.\n\nSimilarly, option: O at5: N _ E _ O -> pattern? N at1, O at5. E at3. Position2 and4 unknown.\n\nWords: ""n e d e? o"" -> not an easy word.\n\nSo back to the E at2? We have two candidate patterns:\n\npattern: ? E ? O N and ? E ? O N? Wait, same? We have two candidates: words like ""lemon"" (L-E-M-O-N) and ""demon"" (D-E-M-O-N) and ""gekon"" (G-E-K-O-N) etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know the first letter? \n\nBut both ""lemon"" and ""demon"" are common words.\n\nAlso, another word: ""piano"" -> P I A N O -> but A is absent? Forbidden? So no.\n\nWe are missing one more pattern? E at3? We skipped.\n\nAnother word: ""opine"" -> O P I N E -> O at1? But wait: O is not at position1? We know O cannot be at1? So ""opine"" is O at1? Invalid? Because we know O not at1.\n\nBut let\'s consider E at1? We couldn\'t find words? Perhaps I missed.\n\nIf E at1: \nE _ _ _ _ \nThen O and N? O cannot be at1? So O at2,3,4,5? And N at3 or5? Not at2 or4.\n\nWords: \nE L _ O N? Like ""e l k o n"" not? \nE L O S N? S absent? \nE N _ O? But N at2? But we know N cannot be at2? So cannot.\n\nE at position1 and N at position3: E _ N _ _\nThen O at position4 or5? \n\nIf O at4: E _ N O _\nThen: positions 2 and 5: two letters needed? \n\nWords: E C O N S -> C,S eliminated -> not. \nE T O N S -> T,S eliminated.\n\nE U N O M? Not a word? \n\nE N N O S? N repeated? S? Eliminated.\n\nSo not found.\n\nIf O at5: E _ N O _\nNo: E _ N O _ -> positions:1,2,3,4: E ? N O? Then 5 missing? \n\nE at1, O, and N: so E ? N O ? \nFifth letter? \n\nWords: E M O for? Not? \n\nNot common.\n\nTherefore, the candidates are words with E at position2 and O at4 and N at5? Like _ E _ O N? \n\nWith the middle letter position3: one letter? \n\nSo five positions: letter1, E(2), letter3, O(4), N(5)\n\nThe word: ? E ? O N\n\nSo the structure: \nposition1: ?\nposition2: E\nposition3: ?\nposition4: O\nposition5: N\n\nSo words: \n\n- lemon: L E M O N -> M at3? But we have M? Not tested? \n- demon: D E M O N -> M at3? \n- begon? Not common? \n- reckon? R E C O N -> R and C eliminated? \n- felon: F E L O N -> L at3? \n- hemel? Not? \n- memon? Not? \n\nViable words: lemon, demon, felon, etc? \n\nAlso: ""vekon"" no? \n\nNow, the first letter? And the third letter? Must be from the allowed set? No C,R,A,S,T? \n\nSo for lemon: L and M? Allowed? \nDemon: D and M? \nFelon: F and L? \n\nAll letters allowed? \n\nHow about ""melon""? M E L O N? That would be M at1, E at2, L at3, O at4, N at5? And it\'s a common word. \n\nBut ""melon"": has M and L? \n\nBut note: from feedback, we know O is present? And E, N? Yes? \n\nAnd avoiding C,R,A,S,T? Yes? \n\nSo ""melon"" is a candidate? \n\nSimilarly, ""lemon"" is M and L? \n\nBut ""lemon"": L at1, M at3, O at4, N at5? \n\nWe don\'t know which? \n\nBut both ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are anagrams? \n\nActually: \n- lemon: L-E-M-O-N\n- melon: M-E-L-O-N\n\nSo same letters? But different positions? \n\nWe need to distinguish? \n\nBut note: we have no information about letters M or L? So both are possible? \n\nHowever, we also have ""demon"": D-E-M-O-N? \n\nBut D is a letter? \n\nWe might want to choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? Or we can choose one? \n\nBut we have 6 tries? And we might get lucky? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume we know the other two letters? But since the pattern seems tight, we can guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? \n\nBut let\'s see the position of O? In both cases O is at position4, which hasn\'t been tested? \n\nSimilarly, N at5? \n\nWe need to decide? \n\nAnother word: ""temon"" not common? \n\nSo common words: lemon, melon, demon.\n\nBut note: ""lemon"" and ""melon"" are both words? \n\nWhat about ""nekon"" not? \n\nWe can guess ""demon"" to test D? Or ""melon"" to test M at first position? \n\nI think ""melon"" is a good guess because it\'s common.\n\nBut let\'s list all possibilities: \nWe have E at position2? O at position4? N at position5? \n\nThus, the word is of the form: x E y O N? \n\nWith x at1? y at3? \n\nx and y must be letters from: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? \n\nBut ""melon"": x=M, y=L? \n""lemon"": x=L, y=M? \n""demon"": x=D, y=M? \n""felon"": x=F, y=L? \n\nAll are possible? \n\nTo maximize new information: perhaps we should guess ""melon"" or ""lemon""? But if we guess ""melon"", then we\'ll get feedback on M and L? \n\nSince ""melon"" and ""lemon"" share many letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has other letters? \n\nAnother possibility: E could be at position1? But we didn\'t find a word? \n\nWhat about ""evzon""? Not a word? \n\nWe might also consider E at position3?\n\nWith _ _ E O N? So positions:1 and2? \n\nPattern: a b E O N? \n\nWords: ""queon"" not? \n""bread"" not? \n""scene"" S absent? \n""cream"" C,R,A eliminated? \n""gleam"" G L E A M -> A eliminated? \n""dream"" A? \n""steon"" S? \n\nNot available? \n\nSo the only patterns seem to be _ E ? O N? \n\nSo we must make a guess? \n\nLet\'s choose ""melon""? \n\nSo:\n\nGuess: melon\n\nWe are guessing ""melon"": M E L O N.\n\nNow, let\'s compare with what we know:\n\nM: new letter? We don\'t know? \nE: at position2? We have not tested E at2? \nL: new? \nO: at position4? Not tested? \nN: at position5? Not tested? \n\nThis should help? \n\nIf the word is ""melon"", we win? If not, we get feedback? \n\nBut note: from ""melon"": \nIf M is at1: O might be present? \n\nBut we know O is present? \n\nSo <guess>melon</guess>?\n\nBut wait: another possibility: what if O is not at position4? \n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested O at position3? \n\nBut we assumed E at2? \n\nBut our deduction: E must be at1,2, or3? We have tried E at position2? \n\nBut O can be at position3? For example, if E is at position3: then the word could be ? ? E ? ? \n\nBut with O at position3? But then position3 has both E and O? So either O is elsewhere? \n\nActually, if E is at3, then O cannot be at3? So O at2,4,5? \n\nBut we have words? \n\nFor example: if E is at3, O at2? Then word: _ O E _ _\n\nMust have N: at1 or5? \n\nIf at5: _ O E _ N? \nWords: do? \n\n""H o e?? n"" -> no? \n\nOr O at4: _ ? E O _ \nThen N at1 or5? \n\nIf N at position1: N ? E O _? \nWords: N X E O Y? \n\nExample: ""n o e o n"" -> not and double O? \n\nOr N U E O L -> ""nucle"" with u? Not? \n\nOr N E E O L -> E repeated? \n\nNot common? \n\nO at5: _ ? E ? O \nAnd N at1: N ? E ? O \nOr at5: but O at5? Then N must be at1? \n\nWord: N ? E ? O \n\nExample: N O E L O -> ""noelo"" not? \n\nOr ""nae o"" not? \n\nSo it seems _ E ? O N is the most promising? \n\nThus, perhaps ""melon"" is a good guess.\n\nBut to be safe, we could guess a word that contains common letters? \n\nBut I think we go with ""melon"".\n\nSo guess: melon\n\nBut note: we also have ""demon"", which has D? \n\nIf we guess ""melon"", and it\'s not the word, we might get feedback like: \n\nIf the secret word is ""demon"", and we guess ""melon"", then:\n\nM: not? so x? \nE: at position2: correct? ✓? \nO: at position4: correct? \nN: at position5: correct? \nBut if ""demon"" has M at3? Then L: not? \n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""demon"", then feedback for ""melon"":\n\nM: absent? So M(x)? \nE: at2? correct ✓? \nL: absent? L(x)? \nO: at4? ✓? \nN: at5? ✓?\n\nBut we know E,O,N present? So M and L absent? \n\nThen we\'ll know the third letter is M? And first letter is D? But then ""demon"" would be the only word remaining? \n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""lemon"", then:\n\nM: at position3? So E: position2 correct ✓, L: we guess L at3? But in ""melon"" L is at position3? Then feedback: \nM at1 absent? But position3 L? \nFor L: in ""melon"", L is at position3? But secret ""lemon"" has L at position1? So L at position3? Since secret has L at1? So in secret: L is present? Therefore L in wrong position? So ? \nAt feedback:\n\n""melon"" vs ""lemon"":\n\nPosition1: M -> secret has L? So M absent? \nPosition2: E -> E? Correct? ✓\nPosition3: L -> secret has M? So L absent? \nPosition4: O -> O? Correct ✓? \nPosition5: N -> N? Correct ✓? \n\nBut wait: secret ""lemon"" has L at position1 and M at position3? \n\nTherefore when we guess ""melon"":\n\n- M at1: not present? Because secret has L at1? And M? Secret has M at3? So M is present? But at wrong position? \n\nAh, I see: we can\'t assume?\n\nLet\'s clarify:\n\nSecret word: lemon -> letters: L, E, M, O, N\n\nGuess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N\n\nFeedback for each letter:\n\n- M: Position1: secret position1 is L? So M is present? But not at position1 -> so since M is in secret (at position3), then we should get M at position1: wrong -> \'-\' ? Symbol ""-"" meaning in word but wrong position? \n\nBut note: M appears in secret at position3? And in guess at position1? So feedback for M: ""in word but wrong position"", so ""-"".\n\nSimilarly, for E: position2: both have E? So ✓? \n\nFor L: guess position3: L? But secret has L at position1? So L is present but wrong position? So ""-"".\n\nFor O: both position4? ✓? \n\nFor N: both position5? ✓? \n\nSo feedback: M(-) E(✓) L(-) O(✓) N(✓)\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""demon"":\n\nGuess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N\nSecret: demon -> D, E, M, O, N\n\nFeedback:\n- M: present at secret position3? Guess position1: wrong position -> ""-""? \n- E: position2 correct ✓? \n- L: absent? So x? \n- O: ✓? \n- N: ✓? \n\nSo M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)\n\nIf secret is ""melon"" itself: we win.\n\nBut we also have ""felon"": F E L O N\n\nGuess: melon -> M, E, L, O, N\nSecret: felon -> F, E, L, O, N\nFeedback:\n- M: absent? x? \n- E: ✓? \n- L: present? at position3? Both have L at3 -> ✓? \n- O: ✓? \n- N: ✓? \n\nSo M(x) E(✓) L(✓) O(✓) N(✓)\n\nTherefore, by guessing ""melon"", we can distinguish: \n\n- If we get all ✓ (except possibly M), but if M(✓) then we win? \n\nBut anyway, we\'ll get valuable feedback? \n\nBecause we have E, O, N correct? \n\nSo I\'ll guess ""melon""? \n\nYes. \n\nSo guess: melonBased on previous feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A are absent.

Common examples include ""melon"", ""lemon"", ""demon"", and ""felon"". Among these, ""melon"" is selected because it:\n- Uses common letters (M, L) not yet tested.\n- Maximizes positional testing for E, O, N at new positions.\n- Avoids risk of double letters (unlikely based on feedback).\n- Could resolve multiple possibilities through feedback.\n\n<guess>melon</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: melon -> FEEDBACK: M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: onset -> O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not at position 4).
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know not at position 5).
- T is not in the word.

Guess 3: melon -> M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)
Meaning:
- M is in the word but not in position 1.
- E is correct at position 2 (so the word has E as the second letter).
- L is not in the word.
- O is correct at position 4 (so the word has O as the fourth letter).
- N is correct at position 5 (so the word has N as the fifth letter).

From the above:
- The word has E at position 2, O at position 4, N at 5. So the word structure: _ E _ O N
- We must fill the first and third positions.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, L (from the feedbacks). Therefore, the missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

Also, M is present but not at position 1 (according to guess 3).

Now, the word: position1: ?, position2: E, position3: ?, position4: O, position5: N

Since M is in the word (but not at position1), it must be at position3? Because that's the only unassigned spot? But note: positions are fixed. We have position1 and position3 to fill.

But we know M is not at position1? So M must be at position3? Because the only other unknown is position3? Position1 and position3?

But the word: first letter (position1: cannot be M because M(-) in guess3? Also, position3: currently an unknown. But note: in guess3 we had ""melon"", which had M at position1? And the feedback said M is in the word but not at that position? So we know that M is present? But at a different position? In the secret word, M is not at position1? So it must be at position3? Because the other positions are already filled? 

Wait: the positions in secret word:
- Position2: E (fixed)
- Position4: O (fixed)
- Position5: N (fixed)

Position1: not known? Position3: not known? 

We know M is in the word? So M must be at position1 or position3? But guess3: ""melon"" has M at position1? And we got M(-) meaning M is not at position1? Therefore, M must be at position3? 

Thus, the secret word has M at position3? 

Then? The word is: ? E M O N

Now, position1: must be a letter that is not absent? 

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, L? 

Also, from guess1 and guess2? We have eliminated some letters? 

We don't know the letter at position1? 

But M at position3? 

Therefore, the word is: {letter} E M O N

We need to fill position1? Must be a letter not in the excluded list? 

Excluded letters: C, R, A, S, T, L? 

And must be an English word? 

What are the possibilities? 

Common words: 
- demon: D E M O N -> D not excluded? 
- hem on? Not? 
- women: W O M E N -> structure doesn't match? 
- lemon: but L is excluded? 

Possible words: 
- demon: D E M O N?
- But D is not excluded? 

Check if D is excluded? We don't have feedback excluding D? 

Also: 
- semon? Not common? 
- gem on? Not a word? 
- demur? Not? 

So the only common word is ""demon""? 

But wait: ""demon"" has D E M O N? So fits: letter1=D, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? 

But is that the only common word? 

Another: ""kem on""? No? 

So ""demon"" seems to be the only possibility? 

But let's confirm: 

We know M is at position3? So the third letter must be M? 

And the word is _ E M O N? 

Now, the only common English word fitting is ""demon""? 

But in ""demon"": position1 is D? 

We haven't tested D? 

Therefore, we can guess ""demon""? 

If we guess ""demon"": 

Check against what we know? 
- Position1: D -> not excluded? 
- Position2: E -> matches? 
- Position3: M -> M is present? And we expect it? 
- Position4: O -> matches? 
- Position5: N -> matches? 

And we have no evidence against D? 

Therefore, it should be the word? 

But wait: ""demon"" is a word? Meaning devil? 

Yes? 

Let's verify the feedback we would get: 

If we guess ""demon"", and the secret is ""demon"": 

Feedback: D(✓) E(✓) M(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

But actually? 

We have almost concluded that the word must be ""demon""? 

But are there other words? 

What about ""jemon""? Not English? 

""remon""? Renowned? Not? 

""demon"" should be the word? 

Therefore, we can guess ""demon""? 

But note: we have 6 tries? So we can guess it? 

But let's be sure? 

Perhaps ""yemon""? Not? 

No? 

So <guess>demon</guess> 

But previous guesses: 

In guess3, we guessed ""melon"", which had M at position1? 

And we got M(-) meaning M is wrong position? 

Now, if the word is ""demon"": which has M at position3? 

Then in the feedback, M(-) is consistent? Because M in ""melon"" at1 is wrong? But M is actually at position3? 

Similarly, E at2 correct? O at4 correct? N at5 correct? 

So no conflicts? 

Thus, the next guess should be ""demon"". 

Alternatively, we could think: the only other possibility is another word, but no? 

So conclude.

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)**  
   - **C, R, A** are absent.  
   - **N and E** are present but **not in positions 4 or 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ONSET → O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)**  
   - **O** is present but **not in position 1**.  
   - **N** is present but **not in position 2** (already known not in position 4).  
   - **S and T** are absent.  
   - **E** is present but **not in position 4** (already known not in position 5).  

3. **Guess 3: MELON → M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)**  
   - **M** is present but **not in position 1**.  
   - **E is correct at position 2**.  
   - **L is absent**.  
   - **O is correct at position 4**.  
   - **N is correct at position 5**.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the structure: **\_ E \_ O N** (positions 2, 4, 5 fixed as E, O, N).  
- **Position 3 must be ""M""**:  
  - From Guess 3, M is present but not at position 1.  
  - Positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed (E, O, N), so M must be at position 3.  
- **Position 1** must be a letter:  
  - Not excluded (excluded: **C, R, A, S, T, L**).  
  - Must form a valid English word with ""E M O N"".  
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **""DEMON""**:  
  - **D E M O N**: Position 1 = D (not excluded), Position 3 = M (confirms feedback).  

### Next Guess Rationale:
- ""DEMON"" is the only viable candidate that matches all constraints:  
  - Correctly places E (position 2), M (position 3), O (position 4), N (position 5).  
  - Uses D (position 1), a valid letter not ruled out by feedback.  
- If correct, feedback will confirm all letters. If incorrect, feedback will refine possibilities, but no other common words fit the pattern (e.g., ""JEMON"" or ""YEMON"" are invalid).

<guess>demon</guess>",demon,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: onset -> O(-) N(-) S(x) E(-) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not at position 4).
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know not at position 5).
- T is not in the word.

Guess 3: melon -> M(-) E(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)
Meaning:
- M is in the word but not in position 1.
- E is correct at position 2 (so the word has E as the second letter).
- L is not in the word.
- O is correct at position 4 (so the word has O as the fourth letter).
- N is correct at position 5 (so the word has N as the fifth letter).

From the above:
- The word has E at position 2, O at position 4, N at 5. So the word structure: _ E _ O N
- We must fill the first and third positions.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, L (from the feedbacks). Therefore, the missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

Also, M is present but not at position 1 (according to guess 3).

Now, the word: position1: ?, position2: E, position3: ?, position4: O, position5: N

Since M is in the word (but not at position1), it must be at position3? Because that's the only unassigned spot? But note: positions are fixed. We have position1 and position3 to fill.

But we know M is not at position1? So M must be at position3? Because the only other unknown is position3? Position1 and position3?

But the word: first letter (position1: cannot be M because M(-) in guess3? Also, position3: currently an unknown. But note: in guess3 we had ""melon"", which had M at position1? And the feedback said M is in the word but not at that position? So we know that M is present? But at a different position? In the secret word, M is not at position1? So it must be at position3? Because the other positions are already filled? 

Wait: the positions in secret word:
- Position2: E (fixed)
- Position4: O (fixed)
- Position5: N (fixed)

Position1: not known? Position3: not known? 

We know M is in the word? So M must be at position1 or position3? But guess3: ""melon"" has M at position1? And we got M(-) meaning M is not at position1? Therefore, M must be at position3? 

Thus, the secret word has M at position3? 

Then? The word is: ? E M O N

Now, position1: must be a letter that is not absent? 

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, L? 

Also, from guess1 and guess2? We have eliminated some letters? 

We don't know the letter at position1? 

But M at position3? 

Therefore, the word is: {letter} E M O N

We need to fill position1? Must be a letter not in the excluded list? 

Excluded letters: C, R, A, S, T, L? 

And must be an English word? 

What are the possibilities? 

Common words: 
- demon: D E M O N -> D not excluded? 
- hem on? Not? 
- women: W O M E N -> structure doesn't match? 
- lemon: but L is excluded? 

Possible words: 
- demon: D E M O N?
- But D is not excluded? 

Check if D is excluded? We don't have feedback excluding D? 

Also: 
- semon? Not common? 
- gem on? Not a word? 
- demur? Not? 

So the only common word is ""demon""? 

But wait: ""demon"" has D E M O N? So fits: letter1=D, E at2, M at3, O at4, N at5? 

But is that the only common word? 

Another: ""kem on""? No? 

So ""demon"" seems to be the only possibility? 

But let's confirm: 

We know M is at position3? So the third letter must be M? 

And the word is _ E M O N? 

Now, the only common English word fitting is ""demon""? 

But in ""demon"": position1 is D? 

We haven't tested D? 

Therefore, we can guess ""demon""? 

If we guess ""demon"": 

Check against what we know? 
- Position1: D -> not excluded? 
- Position2: E -> matches? 
- Position3: M -> M is present? And we expect it? 
- Position4: O -> matches? 
- Position5: N -> matches? 

And we have no evidence against D? 

Therefore, it should be the word? 

But wait: ""demon"" is a word? Meaning devil? 

Yes? 

Let's verify the feedback we would get: 

If we guess ""demon"", and the secret is ""demon"": 

Feedback: D(✓) E(✓) M(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

But actually? 

We have almost concluded that the word must be ""demon""? 

But are there other words? 

What about ""jemon""? Not English? 

""remon""? Renowned? Not? 

""demon"" should be the word? 

Therefore, we can guess ""demon""? 

But note: we have 6 tries? So we can guess it? 

But let's be sure? 

Perhaps ""yemon""? Not? 

No? 

So <guess>demon</guess> 

But previous guesses: 

In guess3, we guessed ""melon"", which had M at position1? 

And we got M(-) meaning M is wrong position? 

Now, if the word is ""demon"": which has M at position3? 

Then in the feedback, M(-) is consistent? Because M in ""melon"" at1 is wrong? But M is actually at position3? 

Similarly, E at2 correct? O at4 correct? N at5 correct? 

So no conflicts? 

Thus, the next guess should be ""demon"". 

Alternatively, we could think: the only other possibility is another word, but no? 

So conclude.### Previous Feedback Analysis:
