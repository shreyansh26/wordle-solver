We are just starting the game. We have no information about the secret word yet.
Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can give us as much information as possible.
Ideally, we want to cover a variety of common letters and positions.

A common starting word in similar games is ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"", but I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E). However, note that the example used in the rules had BRISK and started with STORM and BRAVE.

But let me think: we want to maximize coverage of common letters and positions.

Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", which gives us S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the example feedback used STORM and BRAVE. Let's not be biased by that.

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels and common consonants.

However, let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

But we also want to cover different positions.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because C, R, A, N, E are all common and cover different positions.

But note: we have 6 guesses, and the example had BRISK.

Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has the advantage of having five distinct, common letters.

Therefore, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

So my first guess is ""CRANE"".
</think>
I am playing the Wordle-like game for the first time. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose an initial guess that maximizes the information I gain. This strategy involves picking a word with a balanced mix of vowels and consonants, common letters, and avoiding repetitions.

- Why choose this word? The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
  - It contains five distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
  - It includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which are among the most frequently used in English 5-letter words.
  - The letters cover a range of positions (first letter C, second R, etc.), helping me identify correct placements faster.
- Expected outcome: After submitting ""CRANE"", the feedback will show which letters are in the word (✓ or -) or absent (x). This will narrow down the secret word significantly for subsequent guesses, especially if I get hits on vowels or common consonants.

Now I'm ready to make my first guess.

We are given that the first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since we have eliminated these common letters, we need to choose a new word that uses other common letters and avoids these.

 Let's think about the remaining common letters in English 5-letter words. After removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common letters might include:
 S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 We should form a word that uses as many of these as possible and avoids the eliminated letters.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's aim for a word with high-frequency letters.

 Another popular choice is ""SPLIT"", but note that we have to avoid E, A, R, N, C.

 Let's list some words without C, R, A, N, E:

 Options:
 - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all are common and not eliminated.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also common.
 - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> but U and B are less common.

 ""SPLIT"" and ""MOIST"" are both good. I'll choose ""SPLIT"" because it has S, P, L, I, T which are all high frequency.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""STOMP"" or ""PILOT"", but let's stick with ""SPLIT"".

 However, note that we have 5 new letters: S, P, L, I, T.

 We hope to get some hits to narrow down the word.

 So, the next guess: ""SPLIT""

 But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback for CRANE was all misses, so no duplicates of C,R,A,N,E, but the secret word might have duplicates of other letters. However, we don't know yet.

 Since we are avoiding the eliminated letters, ""SPLIT"" is a valid choice.

 Let me confirm: 
   C, R, A, N, E are out. 
   S, P, L, I, T are all not in the eliminated set.

 Therefore, I will guess ""SPLIT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**. This eliminates 5 common letters, so we need a new guess that avoids them entirely and tests other high-frequency letters.

- **Strategy for second guess**:  
  - Focus on the next most common English letters not yet tested: **S, T, O, L, I, P, M, U, D, G, B, H, Y, etc.**  
  - Prioritize a word with **5 distinct, untested letters** to maximize new information.  
  - Ideal candidates: Words like **SPLIT** (tests S, P, L, I, T) or **MOIST** (tests M, O, I, S, T).  

I choose **""SPLIT""** because:  
- It covers 5 new high-frequency consonants/vowels (S, P, L, I, T).  
- If any letters match, their positions will help identify the secret word faster.  
- If all are absent, we eliminate another 5 letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose an initial guess that maximizes the information I gain. This strategy involves picking a word with a balanced mix of vowels and consonants, common letters, and avoiding repetitions.\n\n- Why choose this word? The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:\n  - It contains five distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n  - It includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which are among the most frequently used in English 5-letter words.\n  - The letters cover a range of positions (first letter C, second R, etc.), helping me identify correct placements faster.\n- Expected outcome: After submitting ""CRANE"", the feedback will show which letters are in the word (✓ or -) or absent (x).

We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all).
2. SPLIT: S(x), P(x), L(-), I(x), T(x). This means:
   - L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it was marked as present but wrong position).
   - S, P, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T.

We know that L is present, but not in the 3rd position.

Therefore, the secret word contains L, and it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T.

Now, we need to think of a word that includes L (in a position other than 3) and uses other letters that are still possible.

What letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So the remaining letters are from the English alphabet minus these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L is in the word, so we must include L.

We need to form a 5-letter word with L (not in position 3) and using only the remaining letters.

Common letters from the remaining set: O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible with the next guess.

A good candidate might be a word like ""MOULD"", but note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters. Let's check:

- M, O, U, L, D: 
  - M, O, U, D are not eliminated? 
  - Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T. So M, O, U, D are still available.

But note: we have L in the word, but in ""MOULD"", L is in the 4th position? Let's spell: M-O-U-L-D. So L is in position 4.

But we don't know if L can be in position 4 or not. We only know it's not in position 3.

However, we must avoid using any eliminated letters. Also, note that ""MOULD"" has a double L? No, it's M,O,U,L,D — all distinct? Actually, ""MOULD"" is 5 letters: M-O-U-L-D, so L is the fourth letter.

But we are allowed to use L again? The feedback for SPLIT had L as present, so we know there's at least one L. We don't know if there are more, but we can use L in the guess if we want, but it might not be necessary to repeat it.

However, since we have limited guesses, and we know L is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position to test.

But in this guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible. So including L again might not be efficient because we already know it's present. But we need to find its position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating L and test other letters, but then we won't get information about L's position.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2), we need to balance.

But note: we have to include L because it's the only letter we know is in the word. If we don't include L, we might not get any new information about other letters and we might not confirm the position of L.

So it's better to include L in the next guess, but in a different position than 3.

We can try to put L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Now, let's think of words that have L in one of these positions and use other available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters: O, U, M, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words:

- If L in position 1: words like ""LO..."", e.g., ""LOUD"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

  - ""LOBBY"" -> but B is available, but double B? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the rules don't say they aren't. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates yet. But ""LOBBY"" has two B's. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters. B is not eliminated. But let's see: L-O-B-B-Y. But we are testing B and Y, but we have two B's. It's acceptable, but we might waste a slot.

  - ""LUMPS"" -> but S is eliminated.

  - ""LOGIC"" -> C eliminated.

  - ""LUCKY"" -> C eliminated.

  - ""LOWLY"" -> double L, and W, Y. But we know L is present, but we don't know if there are two L's. Also, W and Y are available.

  - Better: ""LOAMY"" -> but A is eliminated.

  - ""LOFTY"" -> F and T? T is eliminated from SPLIT feedback.

T is eliminated, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, S, P, I, T are eliminated.

So no T.

So words with T are out.

Let me list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, words with L in position 1:

- ""LOUGH"" - a word? It's a Scottish word, but might not be common. We need common words.

- ""LOAMY"" - A eliminated.

- ""LOBBY"" - as above, but let's see: L(1), O(2), B(3), B(4), Y(5). But position 3 is B, and we don't know about B. But we are testing B and Y. Also, O is tested.

But we have two B's, which might not be ideal because if one B is correct, we don't know about the other. But it's acceptable.

- ""LUMPS"" - S eliminated.

- ""LUCKY"" - C and K? K is available, but C eliminated.

K is available? Yes, K is not eliminated.

But ""LUCKY"" has C, which is eliminated. So no.

- ""LANKY"" - A and N eliminated.

- ""LOOPY"" - O and P? P is eliminated.

P is eliminated.

So, ""LOBBY"" might be acceptable: L, O, B, B, Y.

But we are repeating B. Alternatively, we can find a word without repetition.

- ""LOVES"" - S and E eliminated.

- ""LOWLY"" - L, O, W, L, Y. This has two L's and W, Y. But we know L is present, so if we use two L's, we might get feedback on whether there is a second L. But in this case, L is in position 1 and 4. We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.

But let's see: ""LOWLY"" uses L, O, W, L, Y. Available letters: O, W, Y are available. But we are using L twice.

We can do that.

But to maximize new letters, maybe avoid repeating.

Another word: ""LOGIN"" - G and I? I is eliminated.

I is eliminated.

""LURCH"" - R and C eliminated.

""LYMPH"" - M, P, H? P eliminated.

P is eliminated.

So, let's try L in position 2.

Position 2: words like ""A..."", but A is eliminated. So no word can have A.

Position 2: the second letter. Words like _L___.

But the first letter cannot be C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T, and the second letter is L.

So first letter must be from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Words: ""BLUE"" - too short.

""BLUES"" - S eliminated.

""BLUER"" - R and E eliminated.

""BLUED"" - E eliminated? D is available, but E is eliminated.

""ALIGN"" - A eliminated.

""FLYBY"" - F, L, Y, B, Y. But double Y? ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? No, ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? Actually, it's F-L-Y-B-Y? That's 5 letters? F, L, Y, B, Y — positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:B, 5:Y. So two Y's.

But we are testing F, Y, B, and L is in position 2.

But we know L is present, so we are testing F, Y, B.

But we have two Y's, which might be inefficient.

""GLYPH"" - G, L, Y, P, H. But P is eliminated.

""OLIVE"" - O, L, I, V, E. I and E eliminated.

""ULCER"" - U, L, C, E, R. C, E, R eliminated.

""ALOUD"" - A eliminated.

""CLOUD"" - C eliminated.

So, let's try L in position 4.

Position 4: words like ___L_

First three letters and last letter from available, and L in fourth.

For example, ""FOUL"" - too short.

""FOULS"" - S eliminated.

""PROWL"" - P and R eliminated.

""TRAWL"" - T, R, A eliminated.

""GROWL"" - G, R, O, W, L. R eliminated.

""JOULE"" - J, O, U, L, E. E eliminated.

""MOULD"" - M, O, U, L, D. This seems good. M, O, U, D are available. L in position 4.

We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.

So ""MOULD"" uses M, O, U, L, D. All available except L which we know is present.

But we are using L again, which is fine.

Similarly, position 5: words like ____L.

For example, ""FINAL"" - N and A eliminated.

""VOCAL"" - V, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.

""MEDAL"" - M, E, D, A, L. E and A eliminated.

""MODAL"" - M, O, D, A, L. A eliminated.

""FOCAL"" - F, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.

""LOCAL"" - L, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated, and double L.

So, ""MOULD"" seems a good candidate: M, O, U, L, D.

We test M, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

If L is in position 4, we get a ✓, else if it's present but not in 4, we get a -.

Also, we test M, O, U, D.

Another candidate: ""GOURD"" - G, O, U, R, D. But R is eliminated.

""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. But L is in position 4? W-O-U-L-D, so L is position 4. And W, O, U, D are available.

""WOULD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""COULD"" has C eliminated.

""SHOULD"" is 6 letters.

So ""WOULD"" is good: W, O, U, L, D.

We test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

But we already have ""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"". Both are similar.

Another one: ""FJORD"" - F, J, O, R, D. R eliminated.

""BOUND"" - B, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.

""FOUND"" - F, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.

""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"" are both valid.

Let's choose ""WOULD"" because W is a less common letter, but we need to test it. Or ""MOULD"" is fine.

But M is more common than W? In word frequency, M is more common.

But we have to test them.

Another word: ""GOLD"" - too short.

""GOLLY"" - G, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? G-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But we know L is not in position 3, so if we use ""GOLLY"", the L in position 3 would be wrong, and position 4 might be correct or not. But we are testing G, O, Y as well.

But we have two L's, which might be messy.

I think ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.

Let me choose ""MOULD"".

But in ""MOULD"", L is in position 4. We don't know if that's correct.

Another word without repeating L: but we have to include L, so we can't avoid it.

We could choose a word that has L in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 5.

But earlier it was hard.

What about ""LOVED"" - E eliminated.

""LIVED"" - I and E eliminated.

""LOBED"" - E eliminated.

""LUBED"" - E eliminated.

""OILED"" - O, I, L, E, D. I and E eliminated.

""BULKY"" - B, U, L, K, Y. U, L, K, Y. And B. All available. L in position 3? B-U-L-K-Y, so L is position 3. But we know from SPLIT that L is not in position 3. So we cannot use a word with L in position 3 because we know it's wrong.

In SPLIT, L was in position 3 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position, so position 3 is incorrect for L.

Therefore, we must avoid putting L in position 3 in our guess.

In ""BULKY"", L is in position 3, which we know is wrong, so it would be a waste.

Similarly, any word with L in position 3 is not useful for L, but we could use it to test other letters? But it would be inefficient because we know L is not there.

So better to put L in a position that could be correct: 1,2,4,5.

Back to ""MOULD"": M-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.

""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.

""YOUTH"" - but no L, and T is eliminated.

We must include L.

Another word: ""GLOOM"" - G, L, O, O, M. Double O, and L in position 2. But O is available.

""GLOOM"" has L in position 2.

Spelling: G-L-O-O-M. So position 2 is L.

And G, O, M are available.

But double O: if O is in the word, we might not know if there is one or two, but it's acceptable.

Similarly, ""BLOOM"" - B, L, O, O, M. Same.

But B is available.

""BLOOM"" might be good: B, L, O, O, M. L in position 2.

We test B, L, O, M.

But we have two O's, so if O is present, we get two feedbacks.

But it's better than nothing.

Compared to ""MOULD"", which has no duplicates.

I think ""BLOOM"" is also a possibility.

But let's see frequency: O is common, so testing O is good.

Another word: ""FLUME"" - F, L, U, M, E. E eliminated.

""BLUME"" - not a word? Or proper noun.

""GLUME"" - not common.

""PLUMB"" - P eliminated.

So, I think ""MOULD"" or ""BLOOM"" or ""WOULD"".

I'll go with ""MOULD"" because it has distinct letters except that we are reusing L, but L is necessary.

In ""MOULD"", the letters are M, O, U, L, D — all distinct? Yes, M,O,U,L,D are all different.

Similarly, ""WOULD"": W,O,U,L,D — distinct.

""BLOOM"": B,L,O,O,M — O repeated.

So to maximize new letters, ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.

Let me choose ""MOULD"".

But we have to consider that U might be less common, but it's worth testing.

Another common word: ""COULD"" but C eliminated.

""SHOUL"" not a word.

""MOULD"" is a word, meaning a form for casting.

In American English, it's ""mold"", but we are playing with 5-letter words, and ""MOULD"" is acceptable in British English, but I think the word list might include it.

To be safe, let's choose ""WOULD"", which is very common.

""WOULD"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""COULD"" is common but C eliminated.

So ""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D.

We test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

If L is in position 4, we get a ✓ for L, else a -.

Also, we get information about W, O, U, D.

If any are present, we know.

If not, we eliminate them.

We have 4 guesses left, so it's okay.

But we know L is present, so if we don't get a ✓ for L, then L is not in position 4, so it must be in 1,2, or 5.

Similarly, if we get a - for L, then it's present but not in 4.

If we get a ✓, then position 4 is correct.

So I think ""WOULD"" is a good guess.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: O, U, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

""WOULD"" tests W, O, U, L, D. W is less common, but O and U are vowels, D is common.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. But T is eliminated.

""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H. G and H are available. But no L.

We must include L.

""LOUGH"" - L, O, U, G, H. L in position 1. And O, U, G, H.

""LOUGH"" is a word (a lake or sea inlet), but might be obscure.

""DOLLY"" - D, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? D-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But position 3 is invalid for L, so we would get x for position 3 and maybe - for position 4 if L is there, but it's messy.

Not ideal.

""GULLY"" - G, U, L, L, Y. Double L, position 3 and 4. Again, position 3 is invalid.

So avoid.

I think ""WOULD"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""WOULD"".

But let's confirm the feedback from guess 2: SPLIT had L in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, so L is in the word, not in 3.

So guess: ""WOULD""

<guess>WOULD</guess>

But in the response format, we need to output only the word in the tags.

But first, let's write the thought process.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT)**: 
     - S, P, I, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 3.

2. **Summary of Known Information**:
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T (9 letters total).
   - **Confirmed Present Letter**: L is in the word, but not in position 3. Therefore, L must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (16 letters).
   - **Goal for Next Guess**: 
     - Must include L (since it's confirmed present) in a position other than 3 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 5).
     - Test as many new, high-frequency letters as possible from the remaining set to gather more information.
     - Avoid all eliminated letters.

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Why include L?** Since L is confirmed present, reusing it helps identify its correct position (1, 2, 4, or 5). Skipping L risks wasting a guess on letters that might not be relevant.
   - **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: From the remaining letters, common English letters like O, U, D, M, and W are good candidates for testing. Less common letters (e.g., J, Q, X, Z) are avoided for now.
   - **Avoid position 3 for L**: The guess must place L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to avoid redundant feedback.
   - **Word Selection**:
     - Considered ""MOULD"" (M, O, U, L, D) but opted against it due to potential obscurity.
     - ""WOULD"" (W, O, U, L, D) is a common word that fits perfectly:
       - Uses L in position 4 (a valid position to test).
       - Tests new high-frequency letters: O, U, D, and W.
       - All letters are distinct and from the remaining set (no eliminated letters).
       - If L is in position 4, feedback will confirm it (✓); if not, it may appear as (-) if present elsewhere. Feedback on O, U, D, W will help narrow possibilities further.
   - **Alternatives rejected**:
     - ""BLOOM"" (B, L, O, O, M) has a repeated O, which reduces information efficiency.
     - ""LOUGH"" (L, O, U, G, H) is less common and tests lower-frequency letters like G and H.
     - ""GULLY"" (G, U, L, L, Y) places L in position 3 (invalid) and has a repeat.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   - If ""WOULD"" gets feedback, we will:
     - Confirm if L is in position 4 or elsewhere.
     - Learn if O, U, D, or W are present (and their positions if marked ✓ or -).
     - Eliminate more letters if any are absent (x), further reducing the word list.

Given the above, ""WOULD"" is a strong guess to maximize information with the remaining letters and constraints.

<guess>WOULD</guess>",WOULD,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all).
2. SPLIT: S(x), P(x), L(-), I(x), T(x). This means:
   - L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it was marked as present but wrong position).
   - S, P, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T.

We know that L is present, but not in the 3rd position.

Therefore, the secret word contains L, and it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T.

Now, we need to think of a word that includes L (in a position other than 3) and uses other letters that are still possible.

What letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So the remaining letters are from the English alphabet minus these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L is in the word, so we must include L.

We need to form a 5-letter word with L (not in position 3) and using only the remaining letters.

Common letters from the remaining set: O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible with the next guess.

A good candidate might be a word like ""MOULD"", but note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters. Let's check:

- M, O, U, L, D: 
  - M, O, U, D are not eliminated? 
  - Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T. So M, O, U, D are still available.

But note: we have L in the word, but in ""MOULD"", L is in the 4th position? Let's spell: M-O-U-L-D. So L is in position 4.

But we don't know if L can be in position 4 or not. We only know it's not in position 3.

However, we must avoid using any eliminated letters. Also, note that ""MOULD"" has a double L? No, it's M,O,U,L,D — all distinct? Actually, ""MOULD"" is 5 letters: M-O-U-L-D, so L is the fourth letter.

But we are allowed to use L again? The feedback for SPLIT had L as present, so we know there's at least one L. We don't know if there are more, but we can use L in the guess if we want, but it might not be necessary to repeat it.

However, since we have limited guesses, and we know L is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position to test.

But in this guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible. So including L again might not be efficient because we already know it's present. But we need to find its position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating L and test other letters, but then we won't get information about L's position.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2), we need to balance.

But note: we have to include L because it's the only letter we know is in the word. If we don't include L, we might not get any new information about other letters and we might not confirm the position of L.

So it's better to include L in the next guess, but in a different position than 3.

We can try to put L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Now, let's think of words that have L in one of these positions and use other available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters: O, U, M, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words:

- If L in position 1: words like ""LO..."", e.g., ""LOUD"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

  - ""LOBBY"" -> but B is available, but double B? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the rules don't say they aren't. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates yet. But ""LOBBY"" has two B's. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters. B is not eliminated. But let's see: L-O-B-B-Y. But we are testing B and Y, but we have two B's. It's acceptable, but we might waste a slot.

  - ""LUMPS"" -> but S is eliminated.

  - ""LOGIC"" -> C eliminated.

  - ""LUCKY"" -> C eliminated.

  - ""LOWLY"" -> double L, and W, Y. But we know L is present, but we don't know if there are two L's. Also, W and Y are available.

  - Better: ""LOAMY"" -> but A is eliminated.

  - ""LOFTY"" -> F and T? T is eliminated from SPLIT feedback.

T is eliminated, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, S, P, I, T are eliminated.

So no T.

So words with T are out.

Let me list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, words with L in position 1:

- ""LOUGH"" - a word? It's a Scottish word, but might not be common. We need common words.

- ""LOAMY"" - A eliminated.

- ""LOBBY"" - as above, but let's see: L(1), O(2), B(3), B(4), Y(5). But position 3 is B, and we don't know about B. But we are testing B and Y. Also, O is tested.

But we have two B's, which might not be ideal because if one B is correct, we don't know about the other. But it's acceptable.

- ""LUMPS"" - S eliminated.

- ""LUCKY"" - C and K? K is available, but C eliminated.

K is available? Yes, K is not eliminated.

But ""LUCKY"" has C, which is eliminated. So no.

- ""LANKY"" - A and N eliminated.

- ""LOOPY"" - O and P? P is eliminated.

P is eliminated.

So, ""LOBBY"" might be acceptable: L, O, B, B, Y.

But we are repeating B. Alternatively, we can find a word without repetition.

- ""LOVES"" - S and E eliminated.

- ""LOWLY"" - L, O, W, L, Y. This has two L's and W, Y. But we know L is present, so if we use two L's, we might get feedback on whether there is a second L. But in this case, L is in position 1 and 4. We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.

But let's see: ""LOWLY"" uses L, O, W, L, Y. Available letters: O, W, Y are available. But we are using L twice.

We can do that.

But to maximize new letters, maybe avoid repeating.

Another word: ""LOGIN"" - G and I? I is eliminated.

I is eliminated.

""LURCH"" - R and C eliminated.

""LYMPH"" - M, P, H? P eliminated.

P is eliminated.

So, let's try L in position 2.

Position 2: words like ""A..."", but A is eliminated. So no word can have A.

Position 2: the second letter. Words like _L___.

But the first letter cannot be C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T, and the second letter is L.

So first letter must be from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Words: ""BLUE"" - too short.

""BLUES"" - S eliminated.

""BLUER"" - R and E eliminated.

""BLUED"" - E eliminated? D is available, but E is eliminated.

""ALIGN"" - A eliminated.

""FLYBY"" - F, L, Y, B, Y. But double Y? ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? No, ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? Actually, it's F-L-Y-B-Y? That's 5 letters? F, L, Y, B, Y — positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:B, 5:Y. So two Y's.

But we are testing F, Y, B, and L is in position 2.

But we know L is present, so we are testing F, Y, B.

But we have two Y's, which might be inefficient.

""GLYPH"" - G, L, Y, P, H. But P is eliminated.

""OLIVE"" - O, L, I, V, E. I and E eliminated.

""ULCER"" - U, L, C, E, R. C, E, R eliminated.

""ALOUD"" - A eliminated.

""CLOUD"" - C eliminated.

So, let's try L in position 4.

Position 4: words like ___L_

First three letters and last letter from available, and L in fourth.

For example, ""FOUL"" - too short.

""FOULS"" - S eliminated.

""PROWL"" - P and R eliminated.

""TRAWL"" - T, R, A eliminated.

""GROWL"" - G, R, O, W, L. R eliminated.

""JOULE"" - J, O, U, L, E. E eliminated.

""MOULD"" - M, O, U, L, D. This seems good. M, O, U, D are available. L in position 4.

We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.

So ""MOULD"" uses M, O, U, L, D. All available except L which we know is present.

But we are using L again, which is fine.

Similarly, position 5: words like ____L.

For example, ""FINAL"" - N and A eliminated.

""VOCAL"" - V, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.

""MEDAL"" - M, E, D, A, L. E and A eliminated.

""MODAL"" - M, O, D, A, L. A eliminated.

""FOCAL"" - F, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.

""LOCAL"" - L, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated, and double L.

So, ""MOULD"" seems a good candidate: M, O, U, L, D.

We test M, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

If L is in position 4, we get a ✓, else if it's present but not in 4, we get a -.

Also, we test M, O, U, D.

Another candidate: ""GOURD"" - G, O, U, R, D. But R is eliminated.

""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. But L is in position 4? W-O-U-L-D, so L is position 4. And W, O, U, D are available.

""WOULD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""COULD"" has C eliminated.

""SHOULD"" is 6 letters.

So ""WOULD"" is good: W, O, U, L, D.

We test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

But we already have ""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"". Both are similar.

Another one: ""FJORD"" - F, J, O, R, D. R eliminated.

""BOUND"" - B, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.

""FOUND"" - F, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.

""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"" are both valid.

Let's choose ""WOULD"" because W is a less common letter, but we need to test it. Or ""MOULD"" is fine.

But M is more common than W? In word frequency, M is more common.

But we have to test them.

Another word: ""GOLD"" - too short.

""GOLLY"" - G, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? G-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But we know L is not in position 3, so if we use ""GOLLY"", the L in position 3 would be wrong, and position 4 might be correct or not. But we are testing G, O, Y as well.

But we have two L's, which might be messy.

I think ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.

Let me choose ""MOULD"".

But in ""MOULD"", L is in position 4. We don't know if that's correct.

Another word without repeating L: but we have to include L, so we can't avoid it.

We could choose a word that has L in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 5.

But earlier it was hard.

What about ""LOVED"" - E eliminated.

""LIVED"" - I and E eliminated.

""LOBED"" - E eliminated.

""LUBED"" - E eliminated.

""OILED"" - O, I, L, E, D. I and E eliminated.

""BULKY"" - B, U, L, K, Y. U, L, K, Y. And B. All available. L in position 3? B-U-L-K-Y, so L is position 3. But we know from SPLIT that L is not in position 3. So we cannot use a word with L in position 3 because we know it's wrong.

In SPLIT, L was in position 3 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position, so position 3 is incorrect for L.

Therefore, we must avoid putting L in position 3 in our guess.

In ""BULKY"", L is in position 3, which we know is wrong, so it would be a waste.

Similarly, any word with L in position 3 is not useful for L, but we could use it to test other letters? But it would be inefficient because we know L is not there.

So better to put L in a position that could be correct: 1,2,4,5.

Back to ""MOULD"": M-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.

""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.

""YOUTH"" - but no L, and T is eliminated.

We must include L.

Another word: ""GLOOM"" - G, L, O, O, M. Double O, and L in position 2. But O is available.

""GLOOM"" has L in position 2.

Spelling: G-L-O-O-M. So position 2 is L.

And G, O, M are available.

But double O: if O is in the word, we might not know if there is one or two, but it's acceptable.

Similarly, ""BLOOM"" - B, L, O, O, M. Same.

But B is available.

""BLOOM"" might be good: B, L, O, O, M. L in position 2.

We test B, L, O, M.

But we have two O's, so if O is present, we get two feedbacks.

But it's better than nothing.

Compared to ""MOULD"", which has no duplicates.

I think ""BLOOM"" is also a possibility.

But let's see frequency: O is common, so testing O is good.

Another word: ""FLUME"" - F, L, U, M, E. E eliminated.

""BLUME"" - not a word? Or proper noun.

""GLUME"" - not common.

""PLUMB"" - P eliminated.

So, I think ""MOULD"" or ""BLOOM"" or ""WOULD"".

I'll go with ""MOULD"" because it has distinct letters except that we are reusing L, but L is necessary.

In ""MOULD"", the letters are M, O, U, L, D — all distinct? Yes, M,O,U,L,D are all different.

Similarly, ""WOULD"": W,O,U,L,D — distinct.

""BLOOM"": B,L,O,O,M — O repeated.

So to maximize new letters, ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.

Let me choose ""MOULD"".

But we have to consider that U might be less common, but it's worth testing.

Another common word: ""COULD"" but C eliminated.

""SHOUL"" not a word.

""MOULD"" is a word, meaning a form for casting.

In American English, it's ""mold"", but we are playing with 5-letter words, and ""MOULD"" is acceptable in British English, but I think the word list might include it.

To be safe, let's choose ""WOULD"", which is very common.

""WOULD"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""COULD"" is common but C eliminated.

So ""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D.

We test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

If L is in position 4, we get a ✓ for L, else a -.

Also, we get information about W, O, U, D.

If any are present, we know.

If not, we eliminate them.

We have 4 guesses left, so it's okay.

But we know L is present, so if we don't get a ✓ for L, then L is not in position 4, so it must be in 1,2, or 5.

Similarly, if we get a - for L, then it's present but not in 4.

If we get a ✓, then position 4 is correct.

So I think ""WOULD"" is a good guess.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: O, U, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

""WOULD"" tests W, O, U, L, D. W is less common, but O and U are vowels, D is common.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. But T is eliminated.

""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H. G and H are available. But no L.

We must include L.

""LOUGH"" - L, O, U, G, H. L in position 1. And O, U, G, H.

""LOUGH"" is a word (a lake or sea inlet), but might be obscure.

""DOLLY"" - D, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? D-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But position 3 is invalid for L, so we would get x for position 3 and maybe - for position 4 if L is there, but it's messy.

Not ideal.

""GULLY"" - G, U, L, L, Y. Double L, position 3 and 4. Again, position 3 is invalid.

So avoid.

I think ""WOULD"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""WOULD"".

But let's confirm the feedback from guess 2: SPLIT had L in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, so L is in the word, not in 3.

So guess: ""WOULD""

<guess>WOULD</guess>

But in the response format, we need to output only the word in the tags.

But first, let's write the thought process.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT)**: 
     - S, P, I, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 3.

2. **Summary of Known Information**:
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T (9 letters total).
   - **Confirmed Present Letter**: L is in the word, but not in position 3. Therefore, L must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (16 letters).
   - **Goal for Next Guess**: 
     - Must include L (since it's confirmed present) in a position other than 3 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 5).
     - Test as many new, high-frequency letters as possible from the remaining set to gather more information.
     - Avoid all eliminated letters.

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Why include L?** Since L is confirmed present, reusing it helps identify its correct position (1, 2, 4, or 5). Skipping L risks wasting a guess on letters that might not be relevant.
   - **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: From the remaining letters, common English letters like O, U, D, M, and W are good candidates for testing. Less common letters (e.g., J, Q, X, Z) are avoided for now.
   - **Avoid position 3 for L**: The guess must place L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to avoid redundant feedback.
   - **Word Selection**:
     - Considered ""MOULD"" (M, O, U, L, D) but opted against it due to potential obscurity.
     - ""WOULD"" (W, O, U, L, D) is a common word that fits perfectly:
       - Uses L in position 4 (a valid position to test).
       - Tests new high-frequency letters: O, U, D, and W.
       - All letters are distinct and from the remaining set (no eliminated letters).
       - If L is in position 4, feedback will confirm it (✓); if not, it may appear as (-) if present elsewhere. Feedback on O, U, D, W will help narrow possibilities further.
   - **Alternatives rejected**:
     - ""BLOOM"" (B, L, O, O, M) has a repeated O, which reduces information efficiency.
     - ""LOUGH"" (L, O, U, G, H) is less common and tests lower-frequency letters like G and H.
     - ""GULLY"" (G, U, L, L, Y) places L in position 3 (invalid) and has a repeat.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   - If ""WOULD"" gets feedback, we will:
     - Confirm if L is in position 4 or elsewhere.
     - Learn if O, U, D, or W are present (and their positions if marked ✓ or -).
     - Eliminate more letters if any are absent (x), further reducing the word list.

Given the above, ""WOULD"" is a strong guess to maximize information with the remaining letters and constraints.",Guess 3: WOULD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) U(x) L(-) D(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We have no information about the secret word yet.
Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can give us as much information as possible.
Ideally, we want to cover a variety of common letters and positions.

A common starting word in similar games is ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"", but I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E). However, note that the example used in the rules had BRISK and started with STORM and BRAVE.

But let me think: we want to maximize coverage of common letters and positions.

Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", which gives us S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the example feedback used STORM and BRAVE. Let's not be biased by that.

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels and common consonants.

However, let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

But we also want to cover different positions.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because C, R, A, N, E are all common and cover different positions.

But note: we have 6 guesses, and the example had BRISK.

Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has the advantage of having five distinct, common letters.

Therefore, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

So my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am playing the Wordle-like game for the first time. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose an initial guess that maximizes the information I gain. This strategy involves picking a word with a balanced mix of vowels and consonants, common letters, and avoiding repetitions.

- Why choose this word? The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
  - It contains five distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
  - It includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which are among the most frequently used in English 5-letter words.
  - The letters cover a range of positions (first letter C, second R, etc.), helping me identify correct placements faster.
- Expected outcome: After submitting ""CRANE"", the feedback will show which letters are in the word (✓ or -) or absent (x). This will narrow down the secret word significantly for subsequent guesses, especially if I get hits on vowels or common consonants.

Now I'm ready to make my first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since we have eliminated these common letters, we need to choose a new word that uses other common letters and avoids these.

 Let's think about the remaining common letters in English 5-letter words. After removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common letters might include:
 S, T, O, I, L, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 We should form a word that uses as many of these as possible and avoids the eliminated letters.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's aim for a word with high-frequency letters.

 Another popular choice is ""SPLIT"", but note that we have to avoid E, A, R, N, C.

 Let's list some words without C, R, A, N, E:

 Options:
 - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all are common and not eliminated.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also common.
 - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> but U and B are less common.

 ""SPLIT"" and ""MOIST"" are both good. I'll choose ""SPLIT"" because it has S, P, L, I, T which are all high frequency.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""STOMP"" or ""PILOT"", but let's stick with ""SPLIT"".

 However, note that we have 5 new letters: S, P, L, I, T.

 We hope to get some hits to narrow down the word.

 So, the next guess: ""SPLIT""

 But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback for CRANE was all misses, so no duplicates of C,R,A,N,E, but the secret word might have duplicates of other letters. However, we don't know yet.

 Since we are avoiding the eliminated letters, ""SPLIT"" is a valid choice.

 Let me confirm: 
   C, R, A, N, E are out. 
   S, P, L, I, T are all not in the eliminated set.

 Therefore, I will guess ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**. This eliminates 5 common letters, so we need a new guess that avoids them entirely and tests other high-frequency letters.

- **Strategy for second guess**:  
  - Focus on the next most common English letters not yet tested: **S, T, O, L, I, P, M, U, D, G, B, H, Y, etc.**  
  - Prioritize a word with **5 distinct, untested letters** to maximize new information.  
  - Ideal candidates: Words like **SPLIT** (tests S, P, L, I, T) or **MOIST** (tests M, O, I, S, T).  

I choose **""SPLIT""** because:  
- It covers 5 new high-frequency consonants/vowels (S, P, L, I, T).  
- If any letters match, their positions will help identify the secret word faster.  
- If all are absent, we eliminate another 5 letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.

<guess>SPLIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all).
2. SPLIT: S(x), P(x), L(-), I(x), T(x). This means:
   - L is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since it was marked as present but wrong position).
   - S, P, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T.

We know that L is present, but not in the 3rd position.

Therefore, the secret word contains L, and it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T.

Now, we need to think of a word that includes L (in a position other than 3) and uses other letters that are still possible.

What letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So the remaining letters are from the English alphabet minus these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L is in the word, so we must include L.

We need to form a 5-letter word with L (not in position 3) and using only the remaining letters.

Common letters from the remaining set: O, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible with the next guess.

A good candidate might be a word like ""MOULD"", but note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters. Let's check:

- M, O, U, L, D: 
  - M, O, U, D are not eliminated? 
  - Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T. So M, O, U, D are still available.

But note: we have L in the word, but in ""MOULD"", L is in the 4th position? Let's spell: M-O-U-L-D. So L is in position 4.

But we don't know if L can be in position 4 or not. We only know it's not in position 3.

However, we must avoid using any eliminated letters. Also, note that ""MOULD"" has a double L? No, it's M,O,U,L,D — all distinct? Actually, ""MOULD"" is 5 letters: M-O-U-L-D, so L is the fourth letter.

But we are allowed to use L again? The feedback for SPLIT had L as present, so we know there's at least one L. We don't know if there are more, but we can use L in the guess if we want, but it might not be necessary to repeat it.

However, since we have limited guesses, and we know L is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position to test.

But in this guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible. So including L again might not be efficient because we already know it's present. But we need to find its position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating L and test other letters, but then we won't get information about L's position.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2), we need to balance.

But note: we have to include L because it's the only letter we know is in the word. If we don't include L, we might not get any new information about other letters and we might not confirm the position of L.

So it's better to include L in the next guess, but in a different position than 3.

We can try to put L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Now, let's think of words that have L in one of these positions and use other available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters: O, U, M, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words:

- If L in position 1: words like ""LO..."", e.g., ""LOUD"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

  - ""LOBBY"" -> but B is available, but double B? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the rules don't say they aren't. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates yet. But ""LOBBY"" has two B's. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters. B is not eliminated. But let's see: L-O-B-B-Y. But we are testing B and Y, but we have two B's. It's acceptable, but we might waste a slot.

  - ""LUMPS"" -> but S is eliminated.

  - ""LOGIC"" -> C eliminated.

  - ""LUCKY"" -> C eliminated.

  - ""LOWLY"" -> double L, and W, Y. But we know L is present, but we don't know if there are two L's. Also, W and Y are available.

  - Better: ""LOAMY"" -> but A is eliminated.

  - ""LOFTY"" -> F and T? T is eliminated from SPLIT feedback.

T is eliminated, so we cannot use T.

Similarly, S, P, I, T are eliminated.

So no T.

So words with T are out.

Let me list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, words with L in position 1:

- ""LOUGH"" - a word? It's a Scottish word, but might not be common. We need common words.

- ""LOAMY"" - A eliminated.

- ""LOBBY"" - as above, but let's see: L(1), O(2), B(3), B(4), Y(5). But position 3 is B, and we don't know about B. But we are testing B and Y. Also, O is tested.

But we have two B's, which might not be ideal because if one B is correct, we don't know about the other. But it's acceptable.

- ""LUMPS"" - S eliminated.

- ""LUCKY"" - C and K? K is available, but C eliminated.

K is available? Yes, K is not eliminated.

But ""LUCKY"" has C, which is eliminated. So no.

- ""LANKY"" - A and N eliminated.

- ""LOOPY"" - O and P? P is eliminated.

P is eliminated.

So, ""LOBBY"" might be acceptable: L, O, B, B, Y.

But we are repeating B. Alternatively, we can find a word without repetition.

- ""LOVES"" - S and E eliminated.

- ""LOWLY"" - L, O, W, L, Y. This has two L's and W, Y. But we know L is present, so if we use two L's, we might get feedback on whether there is a second L. But in this case, L is in position 1 and 4. We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.

But let's see: ""LOWLY"" uses L, O, W, L, Y. Available letters: O, W, Y are available. But we are using L twice.

We can do that.

But to maximize new letters, maybe avoid repeating.

Another word: ""LOGIN"" - G and I? I is eliminated.

I is eliminated.

""LURCH"" - R and C eliminated.

""LYMPH"" - M, P, H? P eliminated.

P is eliminated.

So, let's try L in position 2.

Position 2: words like ""A..."", but A is eliminated. So no word can have A.

Position 2: the second letter. Words like _L___.

But the first letter cannot be C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T, and the second letter is L.

So first letter must be from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Words: ""BLUE"" - too short.

""BLUES"" - S eliminated.

""BLUER"" - R and E eliminated.

""BLUED"" - E eliminated? D is available, but E is eliminated.

""ALIGN"" - A eliminated.

""FLYBY"" - F, L, Y, B, Y. But double Y? ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? No, ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? Actually, it's F-L-Y-B-Y? That's 5 letters? F, L, Y, B, Y — positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:B, 5:Y. So two Y's.

But we are testing F, Y, B, and L is in position 2.

But we know L is present, so we are testing F, Y, B.

But we have two Y's, which might be inefficient.

""GLYPH"" - G, L, Y, P, H. But P is eliminated.

""OLIVE"" - O, L, I, V, E. I and E eliminated.

""ULCER"" - U, L, C, E, R. C, E, R eliminated.

""ALOUD"" - A eliminated.

""CLOUD"" - C eliminated.

So, let's try L in position 4.

Position 4: words like ___L_

First three letters and last letter from available, and L in fourth.

For example, ""FOUL"" - too short.

""FOULS"" - S eliminated.

""PROWL"" - P and R eliminated.

""TRAWL"" - T, R, A eliminated.

""GROWL"" - G, R, O, W, L. R eliminated.

""JOULE"" - J, O, U, L, E. E eliminated.

""MOULD"" - M, O, U, L, D. This seems good. M, O, U, D are available. L in position 4.

We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.

So ""MOULD"" uses M, O, U, L, D. All available except L which we know is present.

But we are using L again, which is fine.

Similarly, position 5: words like ____L.

For example, ""FINAL"" - N and A eliminated.

""VOCAL"" - V, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.

""MEDAL"" - M, E, D, A, L. E and A eliminated.

""MODAL"" - M, O, D, A, L. A eliminated.

""FOCAL"" - F, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.

""LOCAL"" - L, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated, and double L.

So, ""MOULD"" seems a good candidate: M, O, U, L, D.

We test M, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

If L is in position 4, we get a ✓, else if it's present but not in 4, we get a -.

Also, we test M, O, U, D.

Another candidate: ""GOURD"" - G, O, U, R, D. But R is eliminated.

""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. But L is in position 4? W-O-U-L-D, so L is position 4. And W, O, U, D are available.

""WOULD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""COULD"" has C eliminated.

""SHOULD"" is 6 letters.

So ""WOULD"" is good: W, O, U, L, D.

We test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

But we already have ""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"". Both are similar.

Another one: ""FJORD"" - F, J, O, R, D. R eliminated.

""BOUND"" - B, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.

""FOUND"" - F, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.

""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"" are both valid.

Let's choose ""WOULD"" because W is a less common letter, but we need to test it. Or ""MOULD"" is fine.

But M is more common than W? In word frequency, M is more common.

But we have to test them.

Another word: ""GOLD"" - too short.

""GOLLY"" - G, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? G-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But we know L is not in position 3, so if we use ""GOLLY"", the L in position 3 would be wrong, and position 4 might be correct or not. But we are testing G, O, Y as well.

But we have two L's, which might be messy.

I think ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.

Let me choose ""MOULD"".

But in ""MOULD"", L is in position 4. We don't know if that's correct.

Another word without repeating L: but we have to include L, so we can't avoid it.

We could choose a word that has L in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 5.

But earlier it was hard.

What about ""LOVED"" - E eliminated.

""LIVED"" - I and E eliminated.

""LOBED"" - E eliminated.

""LUBED"" - E eliminated.

""OILED"" - O, I, L, E, D. I and E eliminated.

""BULKY"" - B, U, L, K, Y. U, L, K, Y. And B. All available. L in position 3? B-U-L-K-Y, so L is position 3. But we know from SPLIT that L is not in position 3. So we cannot use a word with L in position 3 because we know it's wrong.

In SPLIT, L was in position 3 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position, so position 3 is incorrect for L.

Therefore, we must avoid putting L in position 3 in our guess.

In ""BULKY"", L is in position 3, which we know is wrong, so it would be a waste.

Similarly, any word with L in position 3 is not useful for L, but we could use it to test other letters? But it would be inefficient because we know L is not there.

So better to put L in a position that could be correct: 1,2,4,5.

Back to ""MOULD"": M-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.

""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.

""YOUTH"" - but no L, and T is eliminated.

We must include L.

Another word: ""GLOOM"" - G, L, O, O, M. Double O, and L in position 2. But O is available.

""GLOOM"" has L in position 2.

Spelling: G-L-O-O-M. So position 2 is L.

And G, O, M are available.

But double O: if O is in the word, we might not know if there is one or two, but it's acceptable.

Similarly, ""BLOOM"" - B, L, O, O, M. Same.

But B is available.

""BLOOM"" might be good: B, L, O, O, M. L in position 2.

We test B, L, O, M.

But we have two O's, so if O is present, we get two feedbacks.

But it's better than nothing.

Compared to ""MOULD"", which has no duplicates.

I think ""BLOOM"" is also a possibility.

But let's see frequency: O is common, so testing O is good.

Another word: ""FLUME"" - F, L, U, M, E. E eliminated.

""BLUME"" - not a word? Or proper noun.

""GLUME"" - not common.

""PLUMB"" - P eliminated.

So, I think ""MOULD"" or ""BLOOM"" or ""WOULD"".

I'll go with ""MOULD"" because it has distinct letters except that we are reusing L, but L is necessary.

In ""MOULD"", the letters are M, O, U, L, D — all distinct? Yes, M,O,U,L,D are all different.

Similarly, ""WOULD"": W,O,U,L,D — distinct.

""BLOOM"": B,L,O,O,M — O repeated.

So to maximize new letters, ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.

Let me choose ""MOULD"".

But we have to consider that U might be less common, but it's worth testing.

Another common word: ""COULD"" but C eliminated.

""SHOUL"" not a word.

""MOULD"" is a word, meaning a form for casting.

In American English, it's ""mold"", but we are playing with 5-letter words, and ""MOULD"" is acceptable in British English, but I think the word list might include it.

To be safe, let's choose ""WOULD"", which is very common.

""WOULD"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""COULD"" is common but C eliminated.

So ""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D.

We test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.

If L is in position 4, we get a ✓ for L, else a -.

Also, we get information about W, O, U, D.

If any are present, we know.

If not, we eliminate them.

We have 4 guesses left, so it's okay.

But we know L is present, so if we don't get a ✓ for L, then L is not in position 4, so it must be in 1,2, or 5.

Similarly, if we get a - for L, then it's present but not in 4.

If we get a ✓, then position 4 is correct.

So I think ""WOULD"" is a good guess.

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: O, U, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

""WOULD"" tests W, O, U, L, D. W is less common, but O and U are vowels, D is common.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. But T is eliminated.

""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H. G and H are available. But no L.

We must include L.

""LOUGH"" - L, O, U, G, H. L in position 1. And O, U, G, H.

""LOUGH"" is a word (a lake or sea inlet), but might be obscure.

""DOLLY"" - D, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? D-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But position 3 is invalid for L, so we would get x for position 3 and maybe - for position 4 if L is there, but it's messy.

Not ideal.

""GULLY"" - G, U, L, L, Y. Double L, position 3 and 4. Again, position 3 is invalid.

So avoid.

I think ""WOULD"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""WOULD"".

But let's confirm the feedback from guess 2: SPLIT had L in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, so L is in the word, not in 3.

So guess: ""WOULD""

<guess>WOULD</guess>

But in the response format, we need to output only the word in the tags.

But first, let's write the thought process.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT)**: 
     - S, P, I, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 3.

2. **Summary of Known Information**:
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T (9 letters total).
   - **Confirmed Present Letter**: L is in the word, but not in position 3. Therefore, L must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (16 letters).
   - **Goal for Next Guess**: 
     - Must include L (since it's confirmed present) in a position other than 3 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 5).
     - Test as many new, high-frequency letters as possible from the remaining set to gather more information.
     - Avoid all eliminated letters.

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Why include L?** Since L is confirmed present, reusing it helps identify its correct position (1, 2, 4, or 5). Skipping L risks wasting a guess on letters that might not be relevant.
   - **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: From the remaining letters, common English letters like O, U, D, M, and W are good candidates for testing. Less common letters (e.g., J, Q, X, Z) are avoided for now.
   - **Avoid position 3 for L**: The guess must place L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to avoid redundant feedback.
   - **Word Selection**:
     - Considered ""MOULD"" (M, O, U, L, D) but opted against it due to potential obscurity.
     - ""WOULD"" (W, O, U, L, D) is a common word that fits perfectly:
       - Uses L in position 4 (a valid position to test).
       - Tests new high-frequency letters: O, U, D, and W.
       - All letters are distinct and from the remaining set (no eliminated letters).
       - If L is in position 4, feedback will confirm it (✓); if not, it may appear as (-) if present elsewhere. Feedback on O, U, D, W will help narrow possibilities further.
   - **Alternatives rejected**:
     - ""BLOOM"" (B, L, O, O, M) has a repeated O, which reduces information efficiency.
     - ""LOUGH"" (L, O, U, G, H) is less common and tests lower-frequency letters like G and H.
     - ""GULLY"" (G, U, L, L, Y) places L in position 3 (invalid) and has a repeat.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   - If ""WOULD"" gets feedback, we will:
     - Confirm if L is in position 4 or elsewhere.
     - Learn if O, U, D, or W are present (and their positions if marked ✓ or -).
     - Eliminate more letters if any are absent (x), further reducing the word list.

Given the above, ""WOULD"" is a strong guess to maximize information with the remaining letters and constraints.

So L is in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L can be in position 4 or not. We only know it\'s not in position 3.\n\nHowever, we must avoid using any eliminated letters. Also, note that ""MOULD"" has a double L? No, it\'s M,O,U,L,D — all distinct? Actually, ""MOULD"" is 5 letters: M-O-U-L-D, so L is the fourth letter.\n\nBut we are allowed to use L again? The feedback for SPLIT had L as present, so we know there\'s at least one L. We don\'t know if there are more, but we can use L in the guess if we want, but it might not be necessary to repeat it.\n\nHowever, since we have limited guesses, and we know L is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position to test.\n\nBut in this guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible. So including L again might not be efficient because we already know it\'s present. But we need to find its position.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid repeating L and test other letters, but then we won\'t get information about L\'s position.\n\nGiven that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2), we need to balance.\n\nBut note: we have to include L because it\'s the only letter we know is in the word. If we don\'t include L, we might not get any new information about other letters and we might not confirm the position of L.\n\nSo it\'s better to include L in the next guess, but in a different position than 3.\n\nWe can try to put L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that have L in one of these positions and use other available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should prioritize common letters: O, U, M, D, G, B, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If L in position 1: words like ""LO..."", e.g., ""LOUD"", but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n  - ""LOBBY"" -> but B is available, but double B? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but the rules don\'t say they aren\'t. However, we haven\'t encountered any duplicates yet. But ""LOBBY"" has two B\'s. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters. B is not eliminated. But let\'s see: L-O-B-B-Y. But we are testing B and Y, but we have two B\'s. It\'s acceptable, but we might waste a slot.\n\n  - ""LUMPS"" -> but S is eliminated.\n\n  - ""LOGIC"" -> C eliminated.\n\n  - ""LUCKY"" -> C eliminated.\n\n  - ""LOWLY"" -> double L, and W, Y. But we know L is present, but we don\'t know if there are two L\'s. Also, W and Y are available.\n\n  - Better: ""LOAMY"" -> but A is eliminated.\n\n  - ""LOFTY"" -> F and T? T is eliminated from SPLIT feedback.\n\nT is eliminated, so we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, S, P, I, T are eliminated.\n\nSo no T.\n\nSo words with T are out.\n\nLet me list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, words with L in position 1:\n\n- ""LOUGH"" - a word? It\'s a Scottish word, but might not be common. We need common words.\n\n- ""LOAMY"" - A eliminated.\n\n- ""LOBBY"" - as above, but let\'s see: L(1), O(2), B(3), B(4), Y(5). But position 3 is B, and we don\'t know about B. But we are testing B and Y. Also, O is tested.\n\nBut we have two B\'s, which might not be ideal because if one B is correct, we don\'t know about the other. But it\'s acceptable.\n\n- ""LUMPS"" - S eliminated.\n\n- ""LUCKY"" - C and K? K is available, but C eliminated.\n\nK is available? Yes, K is not eliminated.\n\nBut ""LUCKY"" has C, which is eliminated. So no.\n\n- ""LANKY"" - A and N eliminated.\n\n- ""LOOPY"" - O and P? P is eliminated.\n\nP is eliminated.\n\nSo, ""LOBBY"" might be acceptable: L, O, B, B, Y.\n\nBut we are repeating B. Alternatively, we can find a word without repetition.\n\n- ""LOVES"" - S and E eliminated.\n\n- ""LOWLY"" - L, O, W, L, Y. This has two L\'s and W, Y. But we know L is present, so if we use two L\'s, we might get feedback on whether there is a second L. But in this case, L is in position 1 and 4. We know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""LOWLY"" uses L, O, W, L, Y. Available letters: O, W, Y are available. But we are using L twice.\n\nWe can do that.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, maybe avoid repeating.\n\nAnother word: ""LOGIN"" - G and I? I is eliminated.\n\nI is eliminated.\n\n""LURCH"" - R and C eliminated.\n\n""LYMPH"" - M, P, H? P eliminated.\n\nP is eliminated.\n\nSo, let\'s try L in position 2.\n\nPosition 2: words like ""A..."", but A is eliminated. So no word can have A.\n\nPosition 2: the second letter. Words like _L___.\n\nBut the first letter cannot be C,R,A,N,E,S,P,I,T, and the second letter is L.\n\nSo first letter must be from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.\n\nWords: ""BLUE"" - too short.\n\n""BLUES"" - S eliminated.\n\n""BLUER"" - R and E eliminated.\n\n""BLUED"" - E eliminated? D is available, but E is eliminated.\n\n""ALIGN"" - A eliminated.\n\n""FLYBY"" - F, L, Y, B, Y. But double Y? ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? No, ""FLYBY"" is F-L-Y-B-Y? Actually, it\'s F-L-Y-B-Y? That\'s 5 letters? F, L, Y, B, Y — positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:B, 5:Y. So two Y\'s.\n\nBut we are testing F, Y, B, and L is in position 2.\n\nBut we know L is present, so we are testing F, Y, B.\n\nBut we have two Y\'s, which might be inefficient.\n\n""GLYPH"" - G, L, Y, P, H. But P is eliminated.\n\n""OLIVE"" - O, L, I, V, E. I and E eliminated.\n\n""ULCER"" - U, L, C, E, R. C, E, R eliminated.\n\n""ALOUD"" - A eliminated.\n\n""CLOUD"" - C eliminated.\n\nSo, let\'s try L in position 4.\n\nPosition 4: words like ___L_\n\nFirst three letters and last letter from available, and L in fourth.\n\nFor example, ""FOUL"" - too short.\n\n""FOULS"" - S eliminated.\n\n""PROWL"" - P and R eliminated.\n\n""TRAWL"" - T, R, A eliminated.\n\n""GROWL"" - G, R, O, W, L. R eliminated.\n\n""JOULE"" - J, O, U, L, E. E eliminated.\n\n""MOULD"" - M, O, U, L, D. This seems good. M, O, U, D are available. L in position 4.\n\nWe know L is not in position 3, but position 4 is possible.\n\nSo ""MOULD"" uses M, O, U, L, D. All available except L which we know is present.\n\nBut we are using L again, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: words like ____L.\n\nFor example, ""FINAL"" - N and A eliminated.\n\n""VOCAL"" - V, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.\n\n""MEDAL"" - M, E, D, A, L. E and A eliminated.\n\n""MODAL"" - M, O, D, A, L. A eliminated.\n\n""FOCAL"" - F, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated.\n\n""LOCAL"" - L, O, C, A, L. C and A eliminated, and double L.\n\nSo, ""MOULD"" seems a good candidate: M, O, U, L, D.\n\nWe test M, O, U, D, and L in position 4.\n\nIf L is in position 4, we get a ✓, else if it\'s present but not in 4, we get a -.\n\nAlso, we test M, O, U, D.\n\nAnother candidate: ""GOURD"" - G, O, U, R, D. But R is eliminated.\n\n""WOULD"" - W, O, U, L, D. But L is in position 4? W-O-U-L-D, so L is position 4. And W, O, U, D are available.\n\n""WOULD"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""COULD"" has C eliminated.\n\n""SHOULD"" is 6 letters.\n\nSo ""WOULD"" is good: W, O, U, L, D.\n\nWe test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.\n\nBut we already have ""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"". Both are similar.\n\nAnother one: ""FJORD"" - F, J, O, R, D. R eliminated.\n\n""BOUND"" - B, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.\n\n""FOUND"" - F, O, U, N, D. N eliminated.\n\n""MOULD"" and ""WOULD"" are both valid.\n\nLet\'s choose ""WOULD"" because W is a less common letter, but we need to test it. Or ""MOULD"" is fine.\n\nBut M is more common than W? In word frequency, M is more common.\n\nBut we have to test them.\n\nAnother word: ""GOLD"" - too short.\n\n""GOLLY"" - G, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? G-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But we know L is not in position 3, so if we use ""GOLLY"", the L in position 3 would be wrong, and position 4 might be correct or not. But we are testing G, O, Y as well.\n\nBut we have two L\'s, which might be messy.\n\nI think ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.\n\nLet me choose ""MOULD"".\n\nBut in ""MOULD"", L is in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nAnother word without repeating L: but we have to include L, so we can\'t avoid it.\n\nWe could choose a word that has L in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nBut earlier it was hard.\n\nWhat about ""LOVED"" - E eliminated.\n\n""LIVED"" - I and E eliminated.\n\n""LOBED"" - E eliminated.\n\n""LUBED"" - E eliminated.\n\n""OILED"" - O, I, L, E, D. I and E eliminated.\n\n""BULKY"" - B, U, L, K, Y. U, L, K, Y. And B. All available. L in position 3? B-U-L-K-Y, so L is position 3. But we know from SPLIT that L is not in position 3. So we cannot use a word with L in position 3 because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nIn SPLIT, L was in position 3 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position, so position 3 is incorrect for L.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting L in position 3 in our guess.\n\nIn ""BULKY"", L is in position 3, which we know is wrong, so it would be a waste.\n\nSimilarly, any word with L in position 3 is not useful for L, but we could use it to test other letters? But it would be inefficient because we know L is not there.\n\nSo better to put L in a position that could be correct: 1,2,4,5.\n\nBack to ""MOULD"": M-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.\n\n""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D, L in position 4.\n\n""YOUTH"" - but no L, and T is eliminated.\n\nWe must include L.\n\nAnother word: ""GLOOM"" - G, L, O, O, M. Double O, and L in position 2. But O is available.\n\n""GLOOM"" has L in position 2.\n\nSpelling: G-L-O-O-M. So position 2 is L.\n\nAnd G, O, M are available.\n\nBut double O: if O is in the word, we might not know if there is one or two, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLOOM"" - B, L, O, O, M. Same.\n\nBut B is available.\n\n""BLOOM"" might be good: B, L, O, O, M. L in position 2.\n\nWe test B, L, O, M.\n\nBut we have two O\'s, so if O is present, we get two feedbacks.\n\nBut it\'s better than nothing.\n\nCompared to ""MOULD"", which has no duplicates.\n\nI think ""BLOOM"" is also a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s see frequency: O is common, so testing O is good.\n\nAnother word: ""FLUME"" - F, L, U, M, E. E eliminated.\n\n""BLUME"" - not a word? Or proper noun.\n\n""GLUME"" - not common.\n\n""PLUMB"" - P eliminated.\n\nSo, I think ""MOULD"" or ""BLOOM"" or ""WOULD"".\n\nI\'ll go with ""MOULD"" because it has distinct letters except that we are reusing L, but L is necessary.\n\nIn ""MOULD"", the letters are M, O, U, L, D — all distinct? Yes, M,O,U,L,D are all different.\n\nSimilarly, ""WOULD"": W,O,U,L,D — distinct.\n\n""BLOOM"": B,L,O,O,M — O repeated.\n\nSo to maximize new letters, ""MOULD"" or ""WOULD"" is better.\n\nLet me choose ""MOULD"".\n\nBut we have to consider that U might be less common, but it\'s worth testing.\n\nAnother common word: ""COULD"" but C eliminated.\n\n""SHOUL"" not a word.\n\n""MOULD"" is a word, meaning a form for casting.\n\nIn American English, it\'s ""mold"", but we are playing with 5-letter words, and ""MOULD"" is acceptable in British English, but I think the word list might include it.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s choose ""WOULD"", which is very common.\n\n""WOULD"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""COULD"" is common but C eliminated.\n\nSo ""WOULD"": W-O-U-L-D.\n\nWe test W, O, U, D, and L in position 4.\n\nIf L is in position 4, we get a ✓ for L, else a -.\n\nAlso, we get information about W, O, U, D.\n\nIf any are present, we know.\n\nIf not, we eliminate them.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut we know L is present, so if we don\'t get a ✓ for L, then L is not in position 4, so it must be in 1,2, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we get a - for L, then it\'s present but not in 4.\n\nIf we get a ✓, then position 4 is correct.\n\nSo I think ""WOULD"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: O, U, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.\n\n""WOULD"" tests W, O, U, L, D. W is less common, but O and U are vowels, D is common.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. But T is eliminated.\n\n""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H. G and H are available. But no L.\n\nWe must include L.\n\n""LOUGH"" - L, O, U, G, H. L in position 1. And O, U, G, H.\n\n""LOUGH"" is a word (a lake or sea inlet), but might be obscure.\n\n""DOLLY"" - D, O, L, L, Y. Double L, and L in position 3? D-O-L-L-Y, so position 3 and 4 are L. But position 3 is invalid for L, so we would get x for position 3 and maybe - for position 4 if L is there, but it\'s messy.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""GULLY"" - G, U, L, L, Y. Double L, position 3 and 4. Again, position 3 is invalid.\n\nSo avoid.\n\nI think ""WOULD"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""WOULD"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback from guess 2: SPLIT had L in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, so L is in the word, not in 3.\n\nSo guess: ""WOULD""\n\n<guess>WOULD</guess>\n\nBut in the response format, we need to output only the word in the tags.\n\nBut first, let\'s write the thought process.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.\n   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT)**: \n     - S, P, I, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.\n     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n\n2. **Summary of Known Information**:\n   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T (9 letters total).\n   - **Confirmed Present Letter**: L is in the word, but not in position 3. Therefore, L must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (16 letters).\n   - **Goal for Next Guess**: \n     - Must include L (since it\'s confirmed present) in a position other than 3 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n     - Test as many new, high-frequency letters as possible from the remaining set to gather more information.\n     - Avoid all eliminated letters.\n\n3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:\n   - **Why include L?** Since L is confirmed present, reusing it helps identify its correct position (1, 2, 4, or 5). Skipping L risks wasting a guess on letters that might not be relevant.\n   - **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: From the remaining letters, common English letters like O, U, D, M, and W are good candidates for testing. Less common letters (e.g., J, Q, X, Z) are avoided for now.\n   - **Avoid position 3 for L**: The guess must place L in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to avoid redundant feedback.\n   - **Word Selection**:\n     - Considered ""MOULD"" (M, O, U, L, D) but opted against it due to potential obscurity.\n     - ""WOULD"" (W, O, U, L, D) is a common word that fits perfectly:\n       - Uses L in position 4 (a valid position to test).\n       - Tests new high-frequency letters: O, U, D, and W.\n       - All letters are distinct and from the remaining set (no eliminated letters).\n       - If L is in position 4, feedback will confirm it (✓); if not, it may appear as (-) if present elsewhere. Feedback on O, U, D, W will help narrow possibilities further.\n   - **Alternatives rejected**:\n     - ""BLOOM"" (B, L, O, O, M) has a repeated O, which reduces information efficiency.\n     - ""LOUGH"" (L, O, U, G, H) is less common and tests lower-frequency letters like G and H.\n     - ""GULLY"" (G, U, L, L, Y) places L in position 3 (invalid) and has a repeat.\n\n4. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - If ""WOULD"" gets feedback, we will:\n     - Confirm if L is in position 4 or elsewhere.\n     - Learn if O, U, D, or W are present (and their positions if marked ✓ or -).\n     - Eliminate more letters if any are absent (x), further reducing the word list.\n\nGiven the above, ""WOULD"" is a strong guess to maximize information with the remaining letters and constraints.\n\n<guess>WOULD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(-) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: WOULD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) U(x) L(-) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
2. SPLIT: S(x), P(x), L(-) [L is present but not in position 3], I(x), T(x). So L is in the word, but not in position 3.
3. WOULD: W(x), O(-) [O is present but not in position 2], U(x), L(-) [L is present but not in position 4], D(✓) [D is present and in position 5].

So, from this, we know:

- The secret word contains: L (from SPLIT and WOULD), O (from WOULD, present but not in position 2), and D (in position 5).
- L is not in position 3 (from SPLIT) and not in position 4 (from WOULD). Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 2 (since position 5 is taken by D, so L cannot be there).
- D is fixed in position 5: so the word ends with D.

Also, we have eliminated the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T, W, U.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T, W, U.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z. But note that O and L are already known to be in the word, so we don't need to test them again? Actually, we know O is present but we don't know its position, and L is present and must be in position 1 or 2.

We also have D in position 5.

So the word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 5=D.

L must be in position 1 or 2.

O is in the word, but not in position 2 (from WOULD feedback: O was in position 2 and got ""-"", so O is present but not in position 2). Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But position 1 might be L, so O could be in 3 or 4.

Now, we need to form a word that fits:

- Position 1: either L or O? But if L is in position 1, then O cannot be in 1. Similarly, if L is in position 2, then O can be in 1, 3, or 4.

But we don't know which one.

Also, we have to use only the remaining letters for the other positions.

Remaining letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z. And we know O and L are in the word, but we are going to use them in the guess.

We also have D fixed at position 5.

So for the next guess, we should try to resolve the position of L and O.

We have two cases for L: position 1 or 2.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities.

But we have to use only non-eliminated letters.

Let me list the constraints:

- Position 1: could be L or O or another letter? But we know L must be in 1 or 2, and O must be in 1,3,4. But if position 1 is not L, then it must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because we don't have other known letters.

Actually, the only known letters are L, O, D. D is fixed at 5. So positions 1,2,3,4 must contain L, O, and two other letters from the remaining set.

But we don't know the two other letters.

We have to guess a word that has D at the end, L in position 1 or 2, O in 1,3, or 4 (but not 2), and the other letters from the available set.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that tests common letters.

Possible words:

First, if L is in position 1, then the word starts with L, and O cannot be in 1, so O must be in 3 or 4.

For example: L _ _ O D, or L _ O _ D.

But we need to fill the blanks with available letters.

Similarly, if L is in position 2, then the word has _ L _ _ D, and O can be in 1,3,4.

But position 1 cannot be O? No, if L is in 2, then position 1 can be O? But O cannot be in position 2, which is already L, so that's fine. O can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But if O is in position 1, then we have O L _ _ D.

We need to find words that fit these patterns and use available letters.

Let's list possible words:

Case 1: L in position 1.

- Then word: L ? ? ? D

  - O must be in 3 or 4: so L ? O ? D or L ? ? O D

  - Available letters for the blanks: from B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,X,Y,Z.

  - Examples:

    - ""LOVED"": but V is available, but E is eliminated. No, E is out.

    - ""LOMED"" not a word.

    - ""LOGGED"" too long.

    - 5-letter words: ""LOGOD"" not a word.

    - ""LIVED"" I and E eliminated.

    - ""LOBED"" E eliminated.

    - ""LURED"" U and E eliminated.

    - Hard to find.

    - ""LYNCH"": L-Y-N-C-H, but N and C eliminated.

    - ""LYMPH"": M and P? P eliminated.

    - ""LYCEE"" not and letters eliminated.

    - Perhaps ""LOORD"" not a word.

    - ""LOOED"" has E.

    - Maybe ""LOOKD"" not a word.

    - This is difficult.

Case 2: L in position 2.

- Word: ? L ? ? D

  - O can be in 1,3,4.

  - If O in position 1: O L ? ? D

    - Then we have O L ? ? D

    - Examples: ""OLPID"" not a word.

    - ""OLDEN"" E and N eliminated.

    - ""OLDER"" E and R eliminated.

    - ""OLIVE"" I and E eliminated.

    - ""OLENT"" not a word.

    - ""OLPHE"" not.

    - ""GOLPH"" not.

    - ""BOLDS"": B, O, L, D, S. But S eliminated.

    - ""COLDS"" C and S eliminated.

    - ""FOLDS"": F, O, L, D, S. S eliminated.

    - ""HOLDS"": H, O, L, D, S. S eliminated.

    - ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S. S eliminated.

    - But S is eliminated, so no.

    - ""YOLKS"": Y, O, L, K, S. S eliminated.

    - ""VOLKS"" not a word.

    - ""FOLKY"" F, O, L, K, Y. But no D at the end? We need D at the end.

    - The word must end with D, so the last letter is D, so we have ? L ? ? D, so the fourth letter must be the one before D.

    - For O in position 1: O L ? ? D, so the third and fourth letters to be filled.

    - Words: ""MOLDY"": M, O, L, D, Y. But D is in position 4? O-L-D-Y-D? No, ""MOLDY"" is M-O-L-D-Y, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:L, 4:D, 5:Y. But we need position 5 to be D, so it doesn't fit.

    - We need the fifth letter to be D, so the word must end with D. So the pattern is ? L ? ? D, meaning the fourth character is the fourth letter, and fifth is D.

    - So for O in position 1: O L X Y D, where X and Y are letters.

    - Examples: ""GOLD"" is 4 letters.

    - ""BOLDS"" is B-O-L-D-S, so positions:1:B,2:O,3:L,4:D,5:S. But S eliminated, and position 4 is D, but we need position 5 to be D, not 4.

    - We need position 5 to be D, so the fourth letter is not D, it's another letter, and fifth is D.

    - So the word is of the form: ? L ? ? D, so the last two letters are ? D, meaning the fourth letter is some letter, and fifth is D.

    - For example, ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D, but I and N eliminated.

    - ""GLAND"": G-L-A-N-D, A and N eliminated.

    - ""FLYED"" not a word.

    - ""CLOUD"" C eliminated.

    - ""BLOOD"" B-L-O-O-D, so positions:1:B,2:L,3:O,4:O,5:D. This fits: ? L ? ? D with O in position 3 and 4? But we have O in position 3 and 4, but we only need one O? But it's possible.

    - ""BLOOD"" has two O's, but O is already known to be present, so it could be that there are two O's.

    - But in ""BLOOD"", L is in position 2, which is allowed, and O is in position 3 and 4, and D in 5.

    - But from feedback, O is present but not in position 2, which is satisfied.

    - Also, L is in position 2, which is a possible position for L.

    - But we have to check if the letters are available: B, L, O, O, D. L and O are known, D is fixed at 5. B is available (not eliminated).

    - Eliminated letters do not include B, so B is okay.

    - So ""BLOOD"" is a possible guess.

    - Similarly, ""FLOOD"": F-L-O-O-D, F is available.

    - ""GLOOM"" is G-L-O-O-M, not ending with D.

    - ""BROOD"" has R eliminated.

    - ""BLOOD"" and ""FLOOD"" are options.

    - Also, ""BLOOD"" has O in position 3 and 4, so if we guess it, we can see if O is in the word twice or not.

    - But we know O is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

    - Similarly, if O is in position 1, for example, ""OLDB"" not a word.

    - ""OLDEN"" eliminated.

    - ""OLDER"" eliminated.

    - ""MOLDY"" not ending with D.

    - Another word: ""HOLD"" too short.

    - ""JOLTY"" J-O-L-T-Y, T eliminated.

    - So ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"" seem possible.

  - If O is in position 3: then word: ? L O ? D

    - Examples: ""BLOOD"" has O in 3 and 4, so it fits if we consider O in 3.

    - ""CLOMP"" C eliminated.

    - ""GLOOM"" not ending with D.

    - ""BLOBS"" B-L-O-B-S, S eliminated.

    - ""BLOBS"" has B twice and S.

    - ""BLOCK"" C eliminated.

    - ""FLOOR"" F-L-O-O-R, R eliminated.

    - ""BLOOM"" B-L-O-O-M, not ending with D.

    - ""GLOVE"" E eliminated.

    - So not many options.

  - If O is in position 4: then word: ? L ? O D

    - Examples: ""BLOOD"" has O in 3 and 4, so position 4 is O.

    - ""CLODS"" C and S eliminated.

    - ""PLODS"" P and S eliminated.

    - ""GLOSS"" G-L-O-S-S, S eliminated.

    - ""BLOWY"" B-L-O-W-Y, not ending with D.

    - ""CLOYS"" C and S and Y? Not.

    - So again, ""BLOOD"" and ""FLOOD"" are the main candidates.

But in ""BLOOD"", L is in position 2, O in position 3 and 4, D in 5.

We also have the possibility of L in position 1.

If L is in position 1, then O in 3 or 4.

For example, L ? O ? D or L ? ? O D.

Words: ""LOORD"" not a word.

""LOVED"" E eliminated.

""LOFTS"" O in position 2? L-O-F-T-S, but O in position 2, but from WOULD feedback, O is not in position 2, so if we put O in position 2, it would be wrong, but in this case for L in position 1, O cannot be in position 2 because it's not allowed.

For L in position 1, O must be in 3 or 4.

So L ? O ? D or L ? ? O D.

""LOOED"" has E.

""LOOKD"" not.

""LOTUS"" T and S eliminated.

""LOBBY"" not ending with D.

""LOBED"" E eliminated.

""LOGIN"" I and N eliminated.

""LUCKY"" C and K? K is available, but C eliminated and U eliminated? U is eliminated, so no.

U is eliminated.

""LYMPH"" P eliminated.

""LYNCH"" N and C eliminated.

""JUMBO"" J-U-M-B-O, U eliminated.

So it's hard to find a word for L in position 1.

Therefore, it's more likely that L is in position 2, and we should guess ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"".

But let's not forget that O could be in position 1.

For example, O L ? ? D.

Words: ""OLDB"" not.

""OLDEN"" eliminated.

""OLDER"" eliminated.

""OLIVE"" eliminated.

""OLENT"" not.

""OLOGY"" O-L-O-G-Y, not ending with D.

""OLPES"" not.

So no common words.

Therefore, the only reasonable guesses are ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"".

I think ""BLOOD"" is more common.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""BLOOD"":

- B in position 1: if B is in the word, we get feedback, else not.
- L in position 2: since L is in the word, and position 2 is a candidate, we might get ✓ or -.
- O in position 3: O is present, but we don't know if position 3 is correct.
- O in position 4: similarly.
- D in position 5: we know it's ✓.

But we have two O's, so the feedback might be tricky.

Since we know O is present, if we get a ✓ for one O and - for the other, or both -, etc.

But it might give us information.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has L in position 1 to test that case.

For example, ""LO...D"" but we couldn't find one.

""LOUND"" not a word.

""LOUND"" not.

""LURED"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""LOHOC"" not.

I think it's not possible, so we should go with ""BLOOD"".

But there is another word: ""GOODY"" G-O-O-D-Y, but not ending with D? G-O-O-D-Y, position 5 is Y, not D.

We need position 5 to be D.

""GOOLD"" not a word.

""JOLDY"" not.

So, I think ""BLOOD"" is the best bet.

But let's consider the feedback from WOULD: D is ✓ in position 5, so we know that.

In ""BLOOD"", we have:

- Position 1: B
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: D

We know position 5 is D, so that will be ✓.

L is in position 2. Since L is in the word and not in position 3 or 4, position 2 is possible. If L is in position 2 in the secret word, we get ✓ for L. If not, we get - (because L is present but in another position, which must be 1, but we are testing position 2).

Similarly, O is in position 3 and 4. O is present, but not in position 2. If O is in position 3, we might get ✓ or -, similarly for position 4.

But we don't know if there are two O's or one.

B is a new letter.

If we get B absent, then B is not in the word.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: since we know D is at 5, and L is in 1 or 2, O in 1,3,4 (but not 2), we can try a word with L in position 1 and O in position 3, for example.

But we need a word like L ? O ? D.

With available letters.

For example, ""LOMED"" not a word.

""LOVED"" eliminated.

""LONED"" N and E eliminated.

""LOBED"" eliminated.

""LURED"" eliminated.

""LIMED"" I and E eliminated.

""LAMED"" A and E eliminated.

""LOGOD"" not.

""LOFED"" not.

""LOKEY"" O in position 2? L-O-K-E-Y, but O in position 2 is not allowed, and E eliminated.

So no.

Therefore, I think we should guess ""BLOOD"".

Or ""FLOOD"", which is similar.

Let's choose ""BLOOD"".

But in ""BLOOD"", if the secret word has only one O, and it is in position 3, then in our guess, position 3 O might be ✓ or -, and position 4 O would be x if there is no second O.

Similarly, if O is in position 4, then position 4 O might be ✓, and position 3 O might be x or - if there is only one O.

But it could be messy.

To avoid confusion, we could guess a word with only one O and L in position 2.

For example, ""BLOND"": B-L-O-N-D, but N eliminated.

""BROOD"" R eliminated.

""BLOOM"" not ending with D.

""BLOCS"" C and S eliminated.

""BLOWY"" not.

""BLUFF"" U eliminated.

""BLUEY"" U eliminated.

""BLYPE"" not a word.

So no.

Another word: ""GLORY"" G-L-O-R-Y, R eliminated.

""GLOSS"" S eliminated.

""GLOVE"" E eliminated.

So I think ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"" is the way to go.

Let's choose ""BLOOD"".

But let's see the available letters: B is available, so it's fine.

Perhaps ""MOLDY"" but ends with Y, not D.

No.

""GOLDY"" not.

So, I'll go with ""BLOOD"".

But in the feedback, we have to be careful.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has L in position 1 to test that.

For example, ""LYTED"" not a word.

""LYMES"" not.

I think it's not possible, so ""BLOOD"" is the guess.

<guess>BLOOD</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback from WOULD: O is present but not in position 2, and L is present but not in position 4.

In ""BLOOD"", L is in position 2, which is not 3 or 4, so it could be correct.

O is in position 3 and 4, not 2, so it could be correct.

D in position 5 is correct.

B is new.

So it's a valid guess.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT)**: 
     - S, P, I, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (WOULD)**:
     - W and U are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - O is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 2.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 4.
     - D is present and correct (✓), meaning D is in the secret word and in position 5.

2. **Summary of Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - D is in position 5 (from WOULD feedback).
     - L is present but not in position 3 (from SPLIT) or position 4 (from WOULD). Since position 5 is occupied by D, L must be in position 1 or 2.
     - O is present but not in position 2 (from WOULD). Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T, W, U (11 letters total). These cannot be in the word.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z (12 letters). However, since L and O are confirmed present, the secret word contains L, O, D, and two additional letters from the remaining set.
   - **Word Structure**:
     - Position 5 is D (fixed).
     - Position 1 or 2 must be L (since L cannot be in 3, 4, or 5).
     - O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).
     - The remaining positions (e.g., positions not occupied by L or O) must be filled with letters from the remaining set.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Goal**: Resolve the positions of L and O while testing new letters. Since L must be in position 1 or 2, and O in 1, 3, or 4, we need a guess that:
     - Includes L in position 1 or 2 to test its location.
     - Includes O in a valid position (1, 3, or 4, but not 2).
     - Uses D in position 5 (to confirm it remains correct).
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.
     - Tests high-frequency remaining letters like B, M, G, or Y.
   - **Chosen Word: ""BLOOD""**:
     - **Why ""BLOOD""?** 
       - It places L in position 2 (testing if L is correct there).
       - It places O in positions 3 and 4 (testing if O is in either spot; if O is only in one of these positions, feedback will clarify).
       - It uses D in position 5 (expected to be ✓).
       - It tests B (a high-frequency letter) in position 1.
       - All letters are valid: B is not eliminated, and L, O, D are confirmed present.
     - **Why not other words?** 
       - Words like ""FLOOD"" (F in position 1) were considered, but B is slightly more common than F. 
       - Words with L in position 1 (e.g., ""LO...D"") were explored, but no valid common words fit the constraints (e.g., ""LOVED"" uses eliminated E, ""BLOOM"" lacks D at the end). 
       - ""BLOOD"" efficiently tests multiple cases: if L is in position 2 (✓ or -) and O in positions 3/4 (✓, -, or x for duplicates).
   - **Expected Feedback Insights**:
     - If L is in position 2, it will be ✓; if not, it will be - (indicating L is in position 1).
     - O feedback will reveal if it is in position 3, 4, both, or neither (though we know O is present).
     - B feedback will indicate if it is in the word.
     - D is expected to be ✓, providing no new info but confirming consistency.

4. **Risk Consideration**: 
   - ""BLOOD"" has a repeated O, which could complicate feedback (e.g., if only one O is present). However, it maximizes information by testing L position 2 and O positions 3/4 in one guess, leveraging the limited remaining options.

<guess>BLOOD</guess>",BLOOD,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
2. SPLIT: S(x), P(x), L(-) [L is present but not in position 3], I(x), T(x). So L is in the word, but not in position 3.
3. WOULD: W(x), O(-) [O is present but not in position 2], U(x), L(-) [L is present but not in position 4], D(✓) [D is present and in position 5].

So, from this, we know:

- The secret word contains: L (from SPLIT and WOULD), O (from WOULD, present but not in position 2), and D (in position 5).
- L is not in position 3 (from SPLIT) and not in position 4 (from WOULD). Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 2 (since position 5 is taken by D, so L cannot be there).
- D is fixed in position 5: so the word ends with D.

Also, we have eliminated the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T, W, U.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T, W, U.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z. But note that O and L are already known to be in the word, so we don't need to test them again? Actually, we know O is present but we don't know its position, and L is present and must be in position 1 or 2.

We also have D in position 5.

So the word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 5=D.

L must be in position 1 or 2.

O is in the word, but not in position 2 (from WOULD feedback: O was in position 2 and got ""-"", so O is present but not in position 2). Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But position 1 might be L, so O could be in 3 or 4.

Now, we need to form a word that fits:

- Position 1: either L or O? But if L is in position 1, then O cannot be in 1. Similarly, if L is in position 2, then O can be in 1, 3, or 4.

But we don't know which one.

Also, we have to use only the remaining letters for the other positions.

Remaining letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z. And we know O and L are in the word, but we are going to use them in the guess.

We also have D fixed at position 5.

So for the next guess, we should try to resolve the position of L and O.

We have two cases for L: position 1 or 2.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities.

But we have to use only non-eliminated letters.

Let me list the constraints:

- Position 1: could be L or O or another letter? But we know L must be in 1 or 2, and O must be in 1,3,4. But if position 1 is not L, then it must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because we don't have other known letters.

Actually, the only known letters are L, O, D. D is fixed at 5. So positions 1,2,3,4 must contain L, O, and two other letters from the remaining set.

But we don't know the two other letters.

We have to guess a word that has D at the end, L in position 1 or 2, O in 1,3, or 4 (but not 2), and the other letters from the available set.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that tests common letters.

Possible words:

First, if L is in position 1, then the word starts with L, and O cannot be in 1, so O must be in 3 or 4.

For example: L _ _ O D, or L _ O _ D.

But we need to fill the blanks with available letters.

Similarly, if L is in position 2, then the word has _ L _ _ D, and O can be in 1,3,4.

But position 1 cannot be O? No, if L is in 2, then position 1 can be O? But O cannot be in position 2, which is already L, so that's fine. O can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But if O is in position 1, then we have O L _ _ D.

We need to find words that fit these patterns and use available letters.

Let's list possible words:

Case 1: L in position 1.

- Then word: L ? ? ? D

  - O must be in 3 or 4: so L ? O ? D or L ? ? O D

  - Available letters for the blanks: from B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,X,Y,Z.

  - Examples:

    - ""LOVED"": but V is available, but E is eliminated. No, E is out.

    - ""LOMED"" not a word.

    - ""LOGGED"" too long.

    - 5-letter words: ""LOGOD"" not a word.

    - ""LIVED"" I and E eliminated.

    - ""LOBED"" E eliminated.

    - ""LURED"" U and E eliminated.

    - Hard to find.

    - ""LYNCH"": L-Y-N-C-H, but N and C eliminated.

    - ""LYMPH"": M and P? P eliminated.

    - ""LYCEE"" not and letters eliminated.

    - Perhaps ""LOORD"" not a word.

    - ""LOOED"" has E.

    - Maybe ""LOOKD"" not a word.

    - This is difficult.

Case 2: L in position 2.

- Word: ? L ? ? D

  - O can be in 1,3,4.

  - If O in position 1: O L ? ? D

    - Then we have O L ? ? D

    - Examples: ""OLPID"" not a word.

    - ""OLDEN"" E and N eliminated.

    - ""OLDER"" E and R eliminated.

    - ""OLIVE"" I and E eliminated.

    - ""OLENT"" not a word.

    - ""OLPHE"" not.

    - ""GOLPH"" not.

    - ""BOLDS"": B, O, L, D, S. But S eliminated.

    - ""COLDS"" C and S eliminated.

    - ""FOLDS"": F, O, L, D, S. S eliminated.

    - ""HOLDS"": H, O, L, D, S. S eliminated.

    - ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S. S eliminated.

    - But S is eliminated, so no.

    - ""YOLKS"": Y, O, L, K, S. S eliminated.

    - ""VOLKS"" not a word.

    - ""FOLKY"" F, O, L, K, Y. But no D at the end? We need D at the end.

    - The word must end with D, so the last letter is D, so we have ? L ? ? D, so the fourth letter must be the one before D.

    - For O in position 1: O L ? ? D, so the third and fourth letters to be filled.

    - Words: ""MOLDY"": M, O, L, D, Y. But D is in position 4? O-L-D-Y-D? No, ""MOLDY"" is M-O-L-D-Y, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:L, 4:D, 5:Y. But we need position 5 to be D, so it doesn't fit.

    - We need the fifth letter to be D, so the word must end with D. So the pattern is ? L ? ? D, meaning the fourth character is the fourth letter, and fifth is D.

    - So for O in position 1: O L X Y D, where X and Y are letters.

    - Examples: ""GOLD"" is 4 letters.

    - ""BOLDS"" is B-O-L-D-S, so positions:1:B,2:O,3:L,4:D,5:S. But S eliminated, and position 4 is D, but we need position 5 to be D, not 4.

    - We need position 5 to be D, so the fourth letter is not D, it's another letter, and fifth is D.

    - So the word is of the form: ? L ? ? D, so the last two letters are ? D, meaning the fourth letter is some letter, and fifth is D.

    - For example, ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D, but I and N eliminated.

    - ""GLAND"": G-L-A-N-D, A and N eliminated.

    - ""FLYED"" not a word.

    - ""CLOUD"" C eliminated.

    - ""BLOOD"" B-L-O-O-D, so positions:1:B,2:L,3:O,4:O,5:D. This fits: ? L ? ? D with O in position 3 and 4? But we have O in position 3 and 4, but we only need one O? But it's possible.

    - ""BLOOD"" has two O's, but O is already known to be present, so it could be that there are two O's.

    - But in ""BLOOD"", L is in position 2, which is allowed, and O is in position 3 and 4, and D in 5.

    - But from feedback, O is present but not in position 2, which is satisfied.

    - Also, L is in position 2, which is a possible position for L.

    - But we have to check if the letters are available: B, L, O, O, D. L and O are known, D is fixed at 5. B is available (not eliminated).

    - Eliminated letters do not include B, so B is okay.

    - So ""BLOOD"" is a possible guess.

    - Similarly, ""FLOOD"": F-L-O-O-D, F is available.

    - ""GLOOM"" is G-L-O-O-M, not ending with D.

    - ""BROOD"" has R eliminated.

    - ""BLOOD"" and ""FLOOD"" are options.

    - Also, ""BLOOD"" has O in position 3 and 4, so if we guess it, we can see if O is in the word twice or not.

    - But we know O is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

    - Similarly, if O is in position 1, for example, ""OLDB"" not a word.

    - ""OLDEN"" eliminated.

    - ""OLDER"" eliminated.

    - ""MOLDY"" not ending with D.

    - Another word: ""HOLD"" too short.

    - ""JOLTY"" J-O-L-T-Y, T eliminated.

    - So ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"" seem possible.

  - If O is in position 3: then word: ? L O ? D

    - Examples: ""BLOOD"" has O in 3 and 4, so it fits if we consider O in 3.

    - ""CLOMP"" C eliminated.

    - ""GLOOM"" not ending with D.

    - ""BLOBS"" B-L-O-B-S, S eliminated.

    - ""BLOBS"" has B twice and S.

    - ""BLOCK"" C eliminated.

    - ""FLOOR"" F-L-O-O-R, R eliminated.

    - ""BLOOM"" B-L-O-O-M, not ending with D.

    - ""GLOVE"" E eliminated.

    - So not many options.

  - If O is in position 4: then word: ? L ? O D

    - Examples: ""BLOOD"" has O in 3 and 4, so position 4 is O.

    - ""CLODS"" C and S eliminated.

    - ""PLODS"" P and S eliminated.

    - ""GLOSS"" G-L-O-S-S, S eliminated.

    - ""BLOWY"" B-L-O-W-Y, not ending with D.

    - ""CLOYS"" C and S and Y? Not.

    - So again, ""BLOOD"" and ""FLOOD"" are the main candidates.

But in ""BLOOD"", L is in position 2, O in position 3 and 4, D in 5.

We also have the possibility of L in position 1.

If L is in position 1, then O in 3 or 4.

For example, L ? O ? D or L ? ? O D.

Words: ""LOORD"" not a word.

""LOVED"" E eliminated.

""LOFTS"" O in position 2? L-O-F-T-S, but O in position 2, but from WOULD feedback, O is not in position 2, so if we put O in position 2, it would be wrong, but in this case for L in position 1, O cannot be in position 2 because it's not allowed.

For L in position 1, O must be in 3 or 4.

So L ? O ? D or L ? ? O D.

""LOOED"" has E.

""LOOKD"" not.

""LOTUS"" T and S eliminated.

""LOBBY"" not ending with D.

""LOBED"" E eliminated.

""LOGIN"" I and N eliminated.

""LUCKY"" C and K? K is available, but C eliminated and U eliminated? U is eliminated, so no.

U is eliminated.

""LYMPH"" P eliminated.

""LYNCH"" N and C eliminated.

""JUMBO"" J-U-M-B-O, U eliminated.

So it's hard to find a word for L in position 1.

Therefore, it's more likely that L is in position 2, and we should guess ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"".

But let's not forget that O could be in position 1.

For example, O L ? ? D.

Words: ""OLDB"" not.

""OLDEN"" eliminated.

""OLDER"" eliminated.

""OLIVE"" eliminated.

""OLENT"" not.

""OLOGY"" O-L-O-G-Y, not ending with D.

""OLPES"" not.

So no common words.

Therefore, the only reasonable guesses are ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"".

I think ""BLOOD"" is more common.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""BLOOD"":

- B in position 1: if B is in the word, we get feedback, else not.
- L in position 2: since L is in the word, and position 2 is a candidate, we might get ✓ or -.
- O in position 3: O is present, but we don't know if position 3 is correct.
- O in position 4: similarly.
- D in position 5: we know it's ✓.

But we have two O's, so the feedback might be tricky.

Since we know O is present, if we get a ✓ for one O and - for the other, or both -, etc.

But it might give us information.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has L in position 1 to test that case.

For example, ""LO...D"" but we couldn't find one.

""LOUND"" not a word.

""LOUND"" not.

""LURED"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""LOHOC"" not.

I think it's not possible, so we should go with ""BLOOD"".

But there is another word: ""GOODY"" G-O-O-D-Y, but not ending with D? G-O-O-D-Y, position 5 is Y, not D.

We need position 5 to be D.

""GOOLD"" not a word.

""JOLDY"" not.

So, I think ""BLOOD"" is the best bet.

But let's consider the feedback from WOULD: D is ✓ in position 5, so we know that.

In ""BLOOD"", we have:

- Position 1: B
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: D

We know position 5 is D, so that will be ✓.

L is in position 2. Since L is in the word and not in position 3 or 4, position 2 is possible. If L is in position 2 in the secret word, we get ✓ for L. If not, we get - (because L is present but in another position, which must be 1, but we are testing position 2).

Similarly, O is in position 3 and 4. O is present, but not in position 2. If O is in position 3, we might get ✓ or -, similarly for position 4.

But we don't know if there are two O's or one.

B is a new letter.

If we get B absent, then B is not in the word.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: since we know D is at 5, and L is in 1 or 2, O in 1,3,4 (but not 2), we can try a word with L in position 1 and O in position 3, for example.

But we need a word like L ? O ? D.

With available letters.

For example, ""LOMED"" not a word.

""LOVED"" eliminated.

""LONED"" N and E eliminated.

""LOBED"" eliminated.

""LURED"" eliminated.

""LIMED"" I and E eliminated.

""LAMED"" A and E eliminated.

""LOGOD"" not.

""LOFED"" not.

""LOKEY"" O in position 2? L-O-K-E-Y, but O in position 2 is not allowed, and E eliminated.

So no.

Therefore, I think we should guess ""BLOOD"".

Or ""FLOOD"", which is similar.

Let's choose ""BLOOD"".

But in ""BLOOD"", if the secret word has only one O, and it is in position 3, then in our guess, position 3 O might be ✓ or -, and position 4 O would be x if there is no second O.

Similarly, if O is in position 4, then position 4 O might be ✓, and position 3 O might be x or - if there is only one O.

But it could be messy.

To avoid confusion, we could guess a word with only one O and L in position 2.

For example, ""BLOND"": B-L-O-N-D, but N eliminated.

""BROOD"" R eliminated.

""BLOOM"" not ending with D.

""BLOCS"" C and S eliminated.

""BLOWY"" not.

""BLUFF"" U eliminated.

""BLUEY"" U eliminated.

""BLYPE"" not a word.

So no.

Another word: ""GLORY"" G-L-O-R-Y, R eliminated.

""GLOSS"" S eliminated.

""GLOVE"" E eliminated.

So I think ""BLOOD"" or ""FLOOD"" is the way to go.

Let's choose ""BLOOD"".

But let's see the available letters: B is available, so it's fine.

Perhaps ""MOLDY"" but ends with Y, not D.

No.

""GOLDY"" not.

So, I'll go with ""BLOOD"".

But in the feedback, we have to be careful.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has L in position 1 to test that.

For example, ""LYTED"" not a word.

""LYMES"" not.

I think it's not possible, so ""BLOOD"" is the guess.

<guess>BLOOD</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback from WOULD: O is present but not in position 2, and L is present but not in position 4.

In ""BLOOD"", L is in position 2, which is not 3 or 4, so it could be correct.

O is in position 3 and 4, not 2, so it could be correct.

D in position 5 is correct.

B is new.

So it's a valid guess.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT)**: 
     - S, P, I, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (WOULD)**:
     - W and U are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
     - O is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning O is in the secret word but not in position 2.
     - L is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning L is in the secret word but not in position 4.
     - D is present and correct (✓), meaning D is in the secret word and in position 5.

2. **Summary of Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - D is in position 5 (from WOULD feedback).
     - L is present but not in position 3 (from SPLIT) or position 4 (from WOULD). Since position 5 is occupied by D, L must be in position 1 or 2.
     - O is present but not in position 2 (from WOULD). Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, T, W, U (11 letters total). These cannot be in the word.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z (12 letters). However, since L and O are confirmed present, the secret word contains L, O, D, and two additional letters from the remaining set.
   - **Word Structure**:
     - Position 5 is D (fixed).
     - Position 1 or 2 must be L (since L cannot be in 3, 4, or 5).
     - O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).
     - The remaining positions (e.g., positions not occupied by L or O) must be filled with letters from the remaining set.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Goal**: Resolve the positions of L and O while testing new letters. Since L must be in position 1 or 2, and O in 1, 3, or 4, we need a guess that:
     - Includes L in position 1 or 2 to test its location.
     - Includes O in a valid position (1, 3, or 4, but not 2).
     - Uses D in position 5 (to confirm it remains correct).
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.
     - Tests high-frequency remaining letters like B, M, G, or Y.
   - **Chosen Word: ""BLOOD""**:
     - **Why ""BLOOD""?** 
       - It places L in position 2 (testing if L is correct there).
       - It places O in positions 3 and 4 (testing if O is in either spot; if O is only in one of these positions, feedback will clarify).
       - It uses D in position 5 (expected to be ✓).
       - It tests B (a high-frequency letter) in position 1.
       - All letters are valid: B is not eliminated, and L, O, D are confirmed present.
     - **Why not other words?** 
       - Words like ""FLOOD"" (F in position 1) were considered, but B is slightly more common than F. 
       - Words with L in position 1 (e.g., ""LO...D"") were explored, but no valid common words fit the constraints (e.g., ""LOVED"" uses eliminated E, ""BLOOM"" lacks D at the end). 
       - ""BLOOD"" efficiently tests multiple cases: if L is in position 2 (✓ or -) and O in positions 3/4 (✓, -, or x for duplicates).
   - **Expected Feedback Insights**:
     - If L is in position 2, it will be ✓; if not, it will be - (indicating L is in position 1).
     - O feedback will reveal if it is in position 3, 4, both, or neither (though we know O is present).
     - B feedback will indicate if it is in the word.
     - D is expected to be ✓, providing no new info but confirming consistency.

4. **Risk Consideration**: 
   - ""BLOOD"" has a repeated O, which could complicate feedback (e.g., if only one O is present). However, it maximizes information by testing L position 2 and O positions 3/4 in one guess, leveraging the limited remaining options.",Guess 4: BLOOD -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) O(✓) O(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
