We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
 - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has A and E, but A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.
 - Uses other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, we can try putting A in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, or 5). But note: E is also in the word and not at position 5, so E can be in positions 1-4.

 However, we have to avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 We also know that the word does not have C, R, N.

 Let's try to use a word that has A and E and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""SLATE"", but let's check:
 - S, L, A, T, E.
 But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and we know it's not there. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position. So we cannot put A at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and we know it's not at position 5, so in the new word we can put E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try to form a word with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - Put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that has D, I, U which are less common? Also, we have E at position 4 (which is allowed) and avoids position 5. But we also want to test more common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A at position 2 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""PLATE"" -> P, L, A, T, E. 
 - A is at position 3? Again position 3 is not allowed for A. So we avoid.

 How about ""TASER""? 
 - T, A, S, E, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.

 We must avoid R.

 Another idea: ""STEAL"" -> S, T, E, A, L.
 - A is at position 4 (which is new) and E is at position 3 (which is allowed because we only know E is not at 5). 
 - Also, we are introducing S, T, L.

 But note: the word ""STEAL"" has E at position 3 and A at position 4.

 Let's check the letters: S, T, E, A, L. None of these are C, R, or N. So it's valid.

 However, we must make sure that we are not repeating the same positions for A and E that we know are wrong? 
 - For A: in ""crane"" it was at position 3, now we are putting it at position 4 -> that's a new position, so okay.
 - For E: in ""crane"" it was at position 5, now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position, so okay.

 Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems like a good candidate.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but with A at position 3? We cannot because we know A is not at position 3. So we must avoid that.

 Another option: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T and we already know A must not be at position 3? In ""LATTE"", A is at position 2. But also, we have E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot use E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""LATTE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another option: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. 
 - A is at position 3? Again, we cannot put A at position 3.

 How about ""LEAST""? 
 - L, E, A, S, T.
 - E is at position 2 (allowed), A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.

 So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5.

 - ""STEAK"": S, T, E, A, K -> E at position 3, A at position 4 -> that's okay. Also, we introduce S, T, K.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STEAK"" is a valid word.

 However, we are introducing K which is less common? But it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M -> E at 3, A at 4 -> same as above. But M is a common letter.

 But wait, in the first guess we had E as present but not at position 5. We don't know about position 1,2,3,4 for E. Similarly for A, we know it's not at 3, so we can put at 1,2,4,5? But we haven't tried position 1 or 2 for A.

 However, we are trying to get as much new information as possible. Using ""STEAL"" (if we can form it without A at 3 and E at 5) is not possible because in ""STEAL"" we have to put A at 4 and E at 3? Actually, in ""STEAL"":
 - Position 1: S
 - Position 2: T
 - Position 3: E -> that's E at 3, which is allowed.
 - Position 4: A -> that's A at 4, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3).
 - Position 5: L

 But wait, we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. That's acceptable.

 However, I just realized: in ""STEAL"", the A is at position 4 and E at position 3. That's fine.

 But let me check the spelling: ""STEAL"" is a valid word.

 So, both ""STEAL"" and ""STEAK"" are options.

 However, we also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We know C, R, N are out. Both words avoid these.

 Now, which one gives more information? 
 - ""STEAL"" uses S, T, E, A, L -> we already know E and A are in the word, so we are testing S, T, L.
 - ""STEAK"" uses S, T, E, A, K -> testing S, T, K.

 Since L is more common than K, maybe ""STEAL"" is better.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if L or K is in the word. We want to cover more ground.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat the known letters (A and E) and tests entirely new letters? But we have to include A and E because they are in the word. So we must include them.

 Actually, we don't have to include them? The rules don't require that, but it's beneficial because we can get their positions. However, we are allowed to guess without them? But that might not be efficient.

 But note: we know A and E are in the word, so we should use them to narrow down the positions.

 So, I think ""STEAL"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: 
 S at position 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

 But wait: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? That's correct. But we are putting E at 3, which is a new position. Similarly, A is at 4, which is new.

 However, we also know that A is not at position 3 (from the first guess) and we are not putting it at 3, so that's good.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".

 But note: the word ""STEAL"" is valid and meets the criteria.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES"" -> T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2 (allowed), E at position 4 (allowed). But then we have S at the end? Also, we are introducing the same letters.

 However, ""TALES"" has A at 2 and E at 4. That's acceptable.

 But which one is better? ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are anagrams? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

 So the information we get will be about the positions of these letters.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, both are equally good.

 I'll pick ""STEAL"" arbitrarily.

 So, the next guess is ""STEAL"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically, A is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoids placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Excludes C, R, and N (since they are not in the word).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""STEAL"" because:
- It places A at position 4 (a new position, avoiding position 3).
- It places E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces new common letters: S, T, and L.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

This guess should help narrow down the positions of A and E while testing three new letters.

 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
 - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has A and E, but A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.
 - Uses other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, we can try putting A in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, or 5). But note: E is also in the word and not at position 5, so E can be in positions 1-4.

 However, we have to avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 We also know that the word does not have C, R, N.

 Let's try to use a word that has A and E and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""SLATE"", but let's check:
 - S, L, A, T, E.
 But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and we know it's not there. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position. So we cannot put A at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and we know it's not at position 5, so in the new word we can put E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try to form a word with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - Put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that has D, I, U which are less common? Also, we have E at position 4 (which is allowed) and avoids position 5. But we also want to test more common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A at position 2 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""PLATE"" -> P, L, A, T, E. 
 - A is at position 3? Again position 3 is not allowed for A. So we avoid.

 How about ""TASER""? 
 - T, A, S, E, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.

 We must avoid R.

 Another idea: ""STEAL"" -> S, T, E, A, L.
 - A is at position 4 (which is new) and E is at position 3 (which is allowed because we only know E is not at 5). 
 - Also, we are introducing S, T, L.

 But note: the word ""STEAL"" has E at position 3 and A at position 4.

 Let's check the letters: S, T, E, A, L. None of these are C, R, or N. So it's valid.

 However, we must make sure that we are not repeating the same positions for A and E that we know are wrong? 
 - For A: in ""crane"" it was at position 3, now we are putting it at position 4 -> that's a new position, so okay.
 - For E: in ""crane"" it was at position 5, now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position, so okay.

 Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems like a good candidate.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but with A at position 3? We cannot because we know A is not at position 3. So we must avoid that.

 Another option: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T and we already know A must not be at position 3? In ""LATTE"", A is at position 2. But also, we have E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot use E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""LATTE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another option: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. 
 - A is at position 3? Again, we cannot put A at position 3.

 How about ""LEAST""? 
 - L, E, A, S, T.
 - E is at position 2 (allowed), A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.

 So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5.

 - ""STEAK"": S, T, E, A, K -> E at position 3, A at position 4 -> that's okay. Also, we introduce S, T, K.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STEAK"" is a valid word.

 However, we are introducing K which is less common? But it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M -> E at 3, A at 4 -> same as above. But M is a common letter.

 But wait, in the first guess we had E as present but not at position 5. We don't know about position 1,2,3,4 for E. Similarly for A, we know it's not at 3, so we can put at 1,2,4,5? But we haven't tried position 1 or 2 for A.

 However, we are trying to get as much new information as possible. Using ""STEAL"" (if we can form it without A at 3 and E at 5) is not possible because in ""STEAL"" we have to put A at 4 and E at 3? Actually, in ""STEAL"":
 - Position 1: S
 - Position 2: T
 - Position 3: E -> that's E at 3, which is allowed.
 - Position 4: A -> that's A at 4, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3).
 - Position 5: L

 But wait, we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. That's acceptable.

 However, I just realized: in ""STEAL"", the A is at position 4 and E at position 3. That's fine.

 But let me check the spelling: ""STEAL"" is a valid word.

 So, both ""STEAL"" and ""STEAK"" are options.

 However, we also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We know C, R, N are out. Both words avoid these.

 Now, which one gives more information? 
 - ""STEAL"" uses S, T, E, A, L -> we already know E and A are in the word, so we are testing S, T, L.
 - ""STEAK"" uses S, T, E, A, K -> testing S, T, K.

 Since L is more common than K, maybe ""STEAL"" is better.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if L or K is in the word. We want to cover more ground.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat the known letters (A and E) and tests entirely new letters? But we have to include A and E because they are in the word. So we must include them.

 Actually, we don't have to include them? The rules don't require that, but it's beneficial because we can get their positions. However, we are allowed to guess without them? But that might not be efficient.

 But note: we know A and E are in the word, so we should use them to narrow down the positions.

 So, I think ""STEAL"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: 
 S at position 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

 But wait: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? That's correct. But we are putting E at 3, which is a new position. Similarly, A is at 4, which is new.

 However, we also know that A is not at position 3 (from the first guess) and we are not putting it at 3, so that's good.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".

 But note: the word ""STEAL"" is valid and meets the criteria.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES"" -> T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2 (allowed), E at position 4 (allowed). But then we have S at the end? Also, we are introducing the same letters.

 However, ""TALES"" has A at 2 and E at 4. That's acceptable.

 But which one is better? ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are anagrams? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

 So the information we get will be about the positions of these letters.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, both are equally good.

 I'll pick ""STEAL"" arbitrarily.

 So, the next guess is ""STEAL"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically, A is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoids placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Excludes C, R, and N (since they are not in the word).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""STEAL"" because:
- It places A at position 4 (a new position, avoiding position 3).
- It places E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces new common letters: S, T, and L.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

This guess should help narrow down the positions of A and E while testing three new letters.

We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

Guess 2: steal -> S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1.
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- E is in the word, but not in position 3 (this is new, because now we know E isn't in pos 3 either).
- A is in the word, but not in position 4 (new information).
- L is not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters in the word: A, E, S, T (because they got '-' in at least one guess, meaning they are present).
Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L (marked with 'x').

Positions we know are incorrect for certain letters:
- A: not in position 3 (from guess1), not in position 4 (from guess2)
- E: not in position 5 (from guess1), not in position 3 (from guess2)
- S: not in position 1 (from guess2)
- T: not in position 2 (from guess2)

We also know the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Now, we must form a new word that:
- Uses only the letters A, E, S, T and other letters we haven't tried (since C,R,N,L are out) but must include A,E,S,T because they are in the word? 
  Actually, we have to include exactly the letters that are in the word? No, we can include other letters to test them, but we know A,E,S,T are in, so excluding them might not be efficient.

However, we have only 6 tries, so we should try to use the known letters and test their positions while introducing at most one new letter.

But note: we have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We know the word must contain A,E,S,T and one more letter (since it's 5 letters).

What are the possible positions for A,E,S,T?

We know:
- A is not at pos3 or pos4.
- E is not at pos3 or pos5.
- S is not at pos1.
- T is not at pos2.

Also, the word cannot have L, C, R, N.

We need to assign positions to A,E,S,T and find a fifth letter that isn't C,R,N,L or any other excluded.

Since we know four letters, the fifth is still unknown. We can try to guess words that have A,E,S,T and one new letter that is common.

But first, let's think about the positions.

The available positions for each letter:

A: can be pos1,2,5 (because not 3,4)
E: can be pos1,2,4 (not 3,5)
S: can be pos2,3,4,5 (not 1)
T: can be pos1,3,4,5 (not 2)

We also know that A,E,S,T must all appear exactly once? Not necessarily, but until we find duplicates, we assume distinct.

Now, we need to form a word with these constraints.

We also want to test the fifth letter.

Common vowels and consonants left: we haven't tried B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we want common ones.

Another idea: since we have two vowels (A,E) and two consonants (S,T), the fifth letter could be a vowel or consonant.

Let's try to list possible words that have A,E,S,T and one more letter.

For example:
- Words with these four and one more: like ""TASER"" but R is out. 
- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D -> but in ""STEAD"": 
  S at1? We know S cannot be at1, so if we put S at1, we are violating. Also, positions: 
  If S at1, but we know S not at1? Wait, in our constraints, S cannot be at pos1.

So in ""STEAD"", S is at position1 -> which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""SATED"": S at1 -> forbidden.
""TASKE"" - but K and E? And R not present? Wait, ""TASKE"" isn't a word? Let me think.

More possibilities:
- ""TEASE"": T,E,A,S,E -> duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, let's avoid for now because E appears twice and we don't know.

""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> that has H and no duplicate.

In ""HASTE"":
- Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.
Check our constraints:
- A: position2 -> allowed (since A can be at1,2,5)
- E: position5 -> but E cannot be at position5? We know E not at5 from guess1. So E at5 is invalid.

Thus, ""HASTE"" is invalid because E is at5.

How about ""HATES"":
- H1, A2, T3, E4, S5.
Check:
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed (since E can be at1,2,4)
- S at5: allowed (S not forbidden at5)
- T at3: allowed (T can be at3)

Therefore, ""HATES"" is a valid word that fits the constraints.

Now, we are introducing H. Is H a common letter? It's not uncommon.

Alternatively, ""HEATS"": same letters? But ""HEATS"" would be H1, E2, A3, T4, S5? 
- But A at position3 is forbidden? We know A cannot be at3. So invalid.

Another word: ""GATES"": G,A,T,E,S -> G1, A2, T3, E4, S5.
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- T at3: allowed (since T can be at3? Yes, because T cannot be at2, but 3 is allowed)
- S at5: allowed

So ""GATES"" is a possibility.

But we are introducing G.

Another one: ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.
But E at5 is not allowed.

""BASTE"": same as above, E at5 -> invalid.

Another possibility: ""OASIS"" - but missing T, and duplicate S? Not containing T.

We need S,T,A,E.

Perhaps ""FATES"": F1, A2, T3, E4, S5 -> same as GATES? Yes.

So words like _ A T E S? With the first letter? H, G, F, etc.

But the pattern that works is: position1: new letter, position2: A, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.

But note: we don't know that A must be at2. It could be elsewhere.

For example, could A be at position5?

Suppose A at position5: then we need positions for S,T,E.

For instance: ""STOAE"" - not a word? Or ""SETAE"" - not common.

Common words: ""SEPTA"": S,E,P,T,A -> 
S at1 -> forbidden? S cannot be at position1. So invalid.

Perhaps A at position1: e.g., ""ASTER"" - but R is out. ""ASHET"" - not a word? 

What about ""TAPES"": T,A,P,E,S -> T1, A2, P3, E4, S5.
- T at1: allowed (T can be at1)
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- S at5: allowed
So ""TAPES"" would be good, introducing P.

But then we are introducing a new letter again.

Alternatively, without introducing new letters? That's impossible because we only have A,E,S,T and we need a fifth letter.

So we must introduce one new letter.

Now, comparing:
- ""HATES"": H new letter
- ""GATES"": G new letter
- ""FATES"": F new letter
- ""TAPES"": T at position1 and P new

But in ""TAPES"", note that T is at position1 and that's allowed. We are also testing P.

Since we don't have information about the new letters, any could work. But we want to choose one that covers common letters.

We also haven't tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: D, P, M, etc.

But let's note: from the feedback, we have two '-' for E and A each time, meaning they are definitely not in those positions. Also, for S and T, we have only one '-' each, meaning we have one wrong position each.

We have no correct placements yet.

Perhaps we should also consider that S and T might be movable.

But let's go back to the constraints and try to assign positions.

Consider:
- Position1: cannot be S. It could be T, or A, or E, but A can be at1, E can be at1?
  E at1: possible? Yes, E can be at position1,2,4. So E at1 is allowed.
- Similarly, A at1 is allowed.

So possible:

Option 1: Position1: E, Position2: A -> but A at2? Then position3,4,5 for S,T and one more letter. But S cannot be at1, T cannot be at2? But here T could go elsewhere.

But E at1 and A at2: let's find a word: e.g., ""EASTS"" -> duplicate, not good. ""EAT _ _"": ""EATER"" but R out. ""EATEN"" N out. ""EATER"" is invalid.

Another option: Position1: T, position then? For example, ""T? ? ? ?""

But T at position1: allowed. Then we need A,E,S and one more. And positions.

We know: T at1, then position2: cannot be T? And cannot be T? Position2 can be A or E? But A can be at2? How about ""TA?ES"": ""TAMES"", ""TAPES"", ""TARES"" but R out. ""TABES"" not word? ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TASES"": S duplicate? But ""TASET"" not word.

""TASKS"": K, but S at position4? And E missing? We must have E.

The word must have E. So ""TAPES"" is good.

What about position1: A? A at1: allowed? Then A1. Then for example: ""A?TES"": ""ASTER"" R out. ""ATTES"" duplicate T. ""ACTES"" C out. ""AITES"" not word. ""AGUES"" not containing T. Hard.

Another: ""AS?ET"": but we need T and E, and not S at1? If A is at1, then S cannot be at1 but that's fine, S can be elsewhere. But E must not be at5. So ""A? ? E S"" pattern? For example, ""ABYES"" not word? ""AUTES"" not common? ""AISLE"" contains L out? L is not allowed? L is out. ""ARISE"" R out. ""ASHES"" not T? We need T.

So difficult to put A at1.

Position1: S is forbidden, so not S.

So position1 possibilities: T, E, A? We saw A at1 is difficult. E at1 we tried. T at1 seems promising with words like ""TAPES"".

But also, ""TEAMS"": T,E,A,M,S -> T1, E2, A3, M4, S5? 
But in ""TEAMS"": we have E at2? That's allowed? And A at position3? But A cannot be at position3? Because from guess1, A not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""TEALS"" -> L out.

Therefore, ""TAPES"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""HEATS"" we saw has A at pos3? Forbidden.

What about ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H -> but no S? We must have S. So missing S.

All words must contain A,E,S,T.

We can think of words with S not at the end? For example, if S is in position2? But position2 can be S? Yes, because S can be at2. But T cannot be at2? T not at2, so S at2 is okay.

For instance: ""?S A? E??"" 

But we have constraints.

Let me try: position1: new letter (say H) 
position2: S (allowed, since S not at1) 
position3: ? Cannot be A because A not at3. Also, cannot be E? We are not sure? E can be at3? But from guess2, E was at position3 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position3? Exactly, E cannot be at3. So position3 cannot be E or A? It must be a new letter? Or T? T can be at3? Yes.

So possibility: position1: H, position2: S, position3: T (allowed? T can be at3), position4: E? That's allowed? E not at4? Wait, E can be at4. Then position5: A? But A can be at5? Yes.

So ""HSTEA"" ? That's not a word. ""H S T E A"" -> ""HASTE"" but H1,A2,S3,T4,E5 -> we already saw ""HASTE"" has E at5? Forbidden.

Wait, in ""HASTE"", E is at5? Forbidden. But if we rearrange: ""H S T E A"" -> no English word.

Alternatively, position4: A? But A not at4? From guess2, A was at4 and we got ""-"", meaning not at4. So A not at4? Yes, so position4 cannot be A.

Similarly, position5: E cannot be at5? Yes.

So in the word ""H S T E A"" or similar, we have to avoid:
At position4: cannot be A? Because A not at4, and cannot have E there? Wait, E can be at4? But A cannot be at4.

But for position4, if we put E: allowed? Then position5: A? Because A can be at5? So ""H?ST E A"" structure? 

Word: ""HIST E A"" -> ""HISTEA""? not a word.

Perhaps different ordering.

Another pattern: position1: T, position2: S? But T can be at1, S can be at2? But we know T cannot be at2? No: T cannot be at position2. Position2 is for S? Then T would be at position1: so T at1 and S at2: then ""TS? ? ?""

For example, ""TSADE"" not word? ""TSUNAMI"" too long. Not good.

Perhaps ""TEAS followed by one letter"": but ""TEASE"" duplicate E? And E at4 then? And S at4? But we have four letters and need one more? ""TEAS"" is 4 letters.

I think the options are limited. 

Therefore, going back, words like ""TAPES"" or ""HATES"" or ""GATES"" seem plausible.

Among these, let's choose one that uses a common letter. 

Note: we haven't tried D, M, P, etc.

Since in ""HATES"" we introduce H, in ""GATES"" G, in ""TAPES"" we introduce P.

P is more common than H and G? Let me think. 

Or D: is there a word ""DATES"": D1,A2,T3,E4,S5? 
Check constraints:
- A at2: allowed
- T at3: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- S at5: allowed
So ""DATES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATES"": M1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Allowed? Yes.
""FATES"": F1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Yes.

So ""DATES"" uses D. D is a common letter.

Alternatively, we can try to have S not at the end. That might give more positional information.

For example, consider ""STADE"" -> but S at1 forbidden? No, in ""STADE"": S1,T2,A3,D4,E5? 
But S at1 forbidden? Yes. Also A at3 forbidden? Because not position3.

So not.

""TASTE"": T1,A2,S3,T4,E5? Duplicate T? And A2 allowed, T4 allowed, but E5 forbidden? and S3? And we have duplicate T? Also, S at position3 might be allowed? But we don't know about duplicates yet? Also, E at5 forbidden.

Another word: ""SEATS"": S1,E2,A3,T4,S5? Duplicate S? S at1 forbidden? E at2 allowed? A at3? Forbidden? And E at2 allowed, but A at3 not allowed.

So invalid.

Therefore, the safest is to use a word following the pattern: [new] A T E S, with A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? But S at5 is last, which we haven't tested before? That's fine.

But we have placed S at5: we don't know if that's correct.

We can also try a word with S not at5? How? For example:

Suppose we have S at position2? Then we need A,E,T and one new letter? 

But word: ""S? ? ? ?"" , but S at1? Forbidden. If S at2? It's allowed? Then for example: ""ISLET"" L out. ""USAGE"" G, but no T? Not containing T? ""T is needed"".

""PASTE"": again S at position3? And E at5? Forbidden.

Thus, the pattern is hard to break.

Therefore, I choose ""DATES"" because it introduces D, which is common.

But note: in this word, we are fixing A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? We don't know if they are correct, but we are testing these positions and the new letter.

If the feedback shows some ✓, we'll know.

Also, if the word is wrong, we'll get information about D and the positions.

So guess: ""DATES""

Let me summarize:

We have:
- Known letters: A,E,S,T must be in the word.
- Excluded letters: C,R,N,L.
- Word pattern: 5 letters including A,E,S,T and one new (D).

In ""DATES"": D at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5.

Check against constraints:
- S: not at1 → S at5, not1 → allowed.
- T: not at2 → T at3, not2 → allowed.
- A: not at3 or4 → position2 → allowed.
- E: not at2 (it's at4), and not at3 or5 → E at4 → allowed? E can be at4? Yes.

So all constraints satisfied.

Therefore, next guess: ""DATES""

<guess>dates</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  
   - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: steal**  
   - S, T, E, and A are in the secret word.  
   - S is not in position 1.  
   - T is not in position 2.  
   - E is not in position 3.  
   - A is not in position 4.  
   - L is not in the secret word.

### Analysis:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, E, S, T.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.  
  - S cannot be in position 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- The secret word must have a fifth letter (not C, R, N, L).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that includes A, E, S, T and one new common letter (e.g., D, M, P, etc.), while respecting position constraints.  
- Prioritize testing new positions:  
  - Place A in position 2 (untested position).  
  - Place E in position 4 (untested position).  
  - Place T in position 3 (untested position).  
- Introduce a common new letter like D to gather information.  
- The word **DATES** fits:  
  - D (new) at position 1.  
  - A at position 2 (allowed).  
  - T at position 3 (allowed).  
  - E at position 4 (allowed).  
  - S at position 5 (allowed, and avoids position 1).  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces D as the fifth letter. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities in future guesses.

<guess>dates</guess>",dates,"We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

Guess 2: steal -> S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1.
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- E is in the word, but not in position 3 (this is new, because now we know E isn't in pos 3 either).
- A is in the word, but not in position 4 (new information).
- L is not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters in the word: A, E, S, T (because they got '-' in at least one guess, meaning they are present).
Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L (marked with 'x').

Positions we know are incorrect for certain letters:
- A: not in position 3 (from guess1), not in position 4 (from guess2)
- E: not in position 5 (from guess1), not in position 3 (from guess2)
- S: not in position 1 (from guess2)
- T: not in position 2 (from guess2)

We also know the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Now, we must form a new word that:
- Uses only the letters A, E, S, T and other letters we haven't tried (since C,R,N,L are out) but must include A,E,S,T because they are in the word? 
  Actually, we have to include exactly the letters that are in the word? No, we can include other letters to test them, but we know A,E,S,T are in, so excluding them might not be efficient.

However, we have only 6 tries, so we should try to use the known letters and test their positions while introducing at most one new letter.

But note: we have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We know the word must contain A,E,S,T and one more letter (since it's 5 letters).

What are the possible positions for A,E,S,T?

We know:
- A is not at pos3 or pos4.
- E is not at pos3 or pos5.
- S is not at pos1.
- T is not at pos2.

Also, the word cannot have L, C, R, N.

We need to assign positions to A,E,S,T and find a fifth letter that isn't C,R,N,L or any other excluded.

Since we know four letters, the fifth is still unknown. We can try to guess words that have A,E,S,T and one new letter that is common.

But first, let's think about the positions.

The available positions for each letter:

A: can be pos1,2,5 (because not 3,4)
E: can be pos1,2,4 (not 3,5)
S: can be pos2,3,4,5 (not 1)
T: can be pos1,3,4,5 (not 2)

We also know that A,E,S,T must all appear exactly once? Not necessarily, but until we find duplicates, we assume distinct.

Now, we need to form a word with these constraints.

We also want to test the fifth letter.

Common vowels and consonants left: we haven't tried B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we want common ones.

Another idea: since we have two vowels (A,E) and two consonants (S,T), the fifth letter could be a vowel or consonant.

Let's try to list possible words that have A,E,S,T and one more letter.

For example:
- Words with these four and one more: like ""TASER"" but R is out. 
- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D -> but in ""STEAD"": 
  S at1? We know S cannot be at1, so if we put S at1, we are violating. Also, positions: 
  If S at1, but we know S not at1? Wait, in our constraints, S cannot be at pos1.

So in ""STEAD"", S is at position1 -> which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""SATED"": S at1 -> forbidden.
""TASKE"" - but K and E? And R not present? Wait, ""TASKE"" isn't a word? Let me think.

More possibilities:
- ""TEASE"": T,E,A,S,E -> duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, let's avoid for now because E appears twice and we don't know.

""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> that has H and no duplicate.

In ""HASTE"":
- Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.
Check our constraints:
- A: position2 -> allowed (since A can be at1,2,5)
- E: position5 -> but E cannot be at position5? We know E not at5 from guess1. So E at5 is invalid.

Thus, ""HASTE"" is invalid because E is at5.

How about ""HATES"":
- H1, A2, T3, E4, S5.
Check:
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed (since E can be at1,2,4)
- S at5: allowed (S not forbidden at5)
- T at3: allowed (T can be at3)

Therefore, ""HATES"" is a valid word that fits the constraints.

Now, we are introducing H. Is H a common letter? It's not uncommon.

Alternatively, ""HEATS"": same letters? But ""HEATS"" would be H1, E2, A3, T4, S5? 
- But A at position3 is forbidden? We know A cannot be at3. So invalid.

Another word: ""GATES"": G,A,T,E,S -> G1, A2, T3, E4, S5.
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- T at3: allowed (since T can be at3? Yes, because T cannot be at2, but 3 is allowed)
- S at5: allowed

So ""GATES"" is a possibility.

But we are introducing G.

Another one: ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.
But E at5 is not allowed.

""BASTE"": same as above, E at5 -> invalid.

Another possibility: ""OASIS"" - but missing T, and duplicate S? Not containing T.

We need S,T,A,E.

Perhaps ""FATES"": F1, A2, T3, E4, S5 -> same as GATES? Yes.

So words like _ A T E S? With the first letter? H, G, F, etc.

But the pattern that works is: position1: new letter, position2: A, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.

But note: we don't know that A must be at2. It could be elsewhere.

For example, could A be at position5?

Suppose A at position5: then we need positions for S,T,E.

For instance: ""STOAE"" - not a word? Or ""SETAE"" - not common.

Common words: ""SEPTA"": S,E,P,T,A -> 
S at1 -> forbidden? S cannot be at position1. So invalid.

Perhaps A at position1: e.g., ""ASTER"" - but R is out. ""ASHET"" - not a word? 

What about ""TAPES"": T,A,P,E,S -> T1, A2, P3, E4, S5.
- T at1: allowed (T can be at1)
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- S at5: allowed
So ""TAPES"" would be good, introducing P.

But then we are introducing a new letter again.

Alternatively, without introducing new letters? That's impossible because we only have A,E,S,T and we need a fifth letter.

So we must introduce one new letter.

Now, comparing:
- ""HATES"": H new letter
- ""GATES"": G new letter
- ""FATES"": F new letter
- ""TAPES"": T at position1 and P new

But in ""TAPES"", note that T is at position1 and that's allowed. We are also testing P.

Since we don't have information about the new letters, any could work. But we want to choose one that covers common letters.

We also haven't tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: D, P, M, etc.

But let's note: from the feedback, we have two '-' for E and A each time, meaning they are definitely not in those positions. Also, for S and T, we have only one '-' each, meaning we have one wrong position each.

We have no correct placements yet.

Perhaps we should also consider that S and T might be movable.

But let's go back to the constraints and try to assign positions.

Consider:
- Position1: cannot be S. It could be T, or A, or E, but A can be at1, E can be at1?
  E at1: possible? Yes, E can be at position1,2,4. So E at1 is allowed.
- Similarly, A at1 is allowed.

So possible:

Option 1: Position1: E, Position2: A -> but A at2? Then position3,4,5 for S,T and one more letter. But S cannot be at1, T cannot be at2? But here T could go elsewhere.

But E at1 and A at2: let's find a word: e.g., ""EASTS"" -> duplicate, not good. ""EAT _ _"": ""EATER"" but R out. ""EATEN"" N out. ""EATER"" is invalid.

Another option: Position1: T, position then? For example, ""T? ? ? ?""

But T at position1: allowed. Then we need A,E,S and one more. And positions.

We know: T at1, then position2: cannot be T? And cannot be T? Position2 can be A or E? But A can be at2? How about ""TA?ES"": ""TAMES"", ""TAPES"", ""TARES"" but R out. ""TABES"" not word? ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TASES"": S duplicate? But ""TASET"" not word.

""TASKS"": K, but S at position4? And E missing? We must have E.

The word must have E. So ""TAPES"" is good.

What about position1: A? A at1: allowed? Then A1. Then for example: ""A?TES"": ""ASTER"" R out. ""ATTES"" duplicate T. ""ACTES"" C out. ""AITES"" not word. ""AGUES"" not containing T. Hard.

Another: ""AS?ET"": but we need T and E, and not S at1? If A is at1, then S cannot be at1 but that's fine, S can be elsewhere. But E must not be at5. So ""A? ? E S"" pattern? For example, ""ABYES"" not word? ""AUTES"" not common? ""AISLE"" contains L out? L is not allowed? L is out. ""ARISE"" R out. ""ASHES"" not T? We need T.

So difficult to put A at1.

Position1: S is forbidden, so not S.

So position1 possibilities: T, E, A? We saw A at1 is difficult. E at1 we tried. T at1 seems promising with words like ""TAPES"".

But also, ""TEAMS"": T,E,A,M,S -> T1, E2, A3, M4, S5? 
But in ""TEAMS"": we have E at2? That's allowed? And A at position3? But A cannot be at position3? Because from guess1, A not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""TEALS"" -> L out.

Therefore, ""TAPES"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""HEATS"" we saw has A at pos3? Forbidden.

What about ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H -> but no S? We must have S. So missing S.

All words must contain A,E,S,T.

We can think of words with S not at the end? For example, if S is in position2? But position2 can be S? Yes, because S can be at2. But T cannot be at2? T not at2, so S at2 is okay.

For instance: ""?S A? E??"" 

But we have constraints.

Let me try: position1: new letter (say H) 
position2: S (allowed, since S not at1) 
position3: ? Cannot be A because A not at3. Also, cannot be E? We are not sure? E can be at3? But from guess2, E was at position3 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position3? Exactly, E cannot be at3. So position3 cannot be E or A? It must be a new letter? Or T? T can be at3? Yes.

So possibility: position1: H, position2: S, position3: T (allowed? T can be at3), position4: E? That's allowed? E not at4? Wait, E can be at4. Then position5: A? But A can be at5? Yes.

So ""HSTEA"" ? That's not a word. ""H S T E A"" -> ""HASTE"" but H1,A2,S3,T4,E5 -> we already saw ""HASTE"" has E at5? Forbidden.

Wait, in ""HASTE"", E is at5? Forbidden. But if we rearrange: ""H S T E A"" -> no English word.

Alternatively, position4: A? But A not at4? From guess2, A was at4 and we got ""-"", meaning not at4. So A not at4? Yes, so position4 cannot be A.

Similarly, position5: E cannot be at5? Yes.

So in the word ""H S T E A"" or similar, we have to avoid:
At position4: cannot be A? Because A not at4, and cannot have E there? Wait, E can be at4? But A cannot be at4.

But for position4, if we put E: allowed? Then position5: A? Because A can be at5? So ""H?ST E A"" structure? 

Word: ""HIST E A"" -> ""HISTEA""? not a word.

Perhaps different ordering.

Another pattern: position1: T, position2: S? But T can be at1, S can be at2? But we know T cannot be at2? No: T cannot be at position2. Position2 is for S? Then T would be at position1: so T at1 and S at2: then ""TS? ? ?""

For example, ""TSADE"" not word? ""TSUNAMI"" too long. Not good.

Perhaps ""TEAS followed by one letter"": but ""TEASE"" duplicate E? And E at4 then? And S at4? But we have four letters and need one more? ""TEAS"" is 4 letters.

I think the options are limited. 

Therefore, going back, words like ""TAPES"" or ""HATES"" or ""GATES"" seem plausible.

Among these, let's choose one that uses a common letter. 

Note: we haven't tried D, M, P, etc.

Since in ""HATES"" we introduce H, in ""GATES"" G, in ""TAPES"" we introduce P.

P is more common than H and G? Let me think. 

Or D: is there a word ""DATES"": D1,A2,T3,E4,S5? 
Check constraints:
- A at2: allowed
- T at3: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- S at5: allowed
So ""DATES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATES"": M1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Allowed? Yes.
""FATES"": F1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Yes.

So ""DATES"" uses D. D is a common letter.

Alternatively, we can try to have S not at the end. That might give more positional information.

For example, consider ""STADE"" -> but S at1 forbidden? No, in ""STADE"": S1,T2,A3,D4,E5? 
But S at1 forbidden? Yes. Also A at3 forbidden? Because not position3.

So not.

""TASTE"": T1,A2,S3,T4,E5? Duplicate T? And A2 allowed, T4 allowed, but E5 forbidden? and S3? And we have duplicate T? Also, S at position3 might be allowed? But we don't know about duplicates yet? Also, E at5 forbidden.

Another word: ""SEATS"": S1,E2,A3,T4,S5? Duplicate S? S at1 forbidden? E at2 allowed? A at3? Forbidden? And E at2 allowed, but A at3 not allowed.

So invalid.

Therefore, the safest is to use a word following the pattern: [new] A T E S, with A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? But S at5 is last, which we haven't tested before? That's fine.

But we have placed S at5: we don't know if that's correct.

We can also try a word with S not at5? How? For example:

Suppose we have S at position2? Then we need A,E,T and one new letter? 

But word: ""S? ? ? ?"" , but S at1? Forbidden. If S at2? It's allowed? Then for example: ""ISLET"" L out. ""USAGE"" G, but no T? Not containing T? ""T is needed"".

""PASTE"": again S at position3? And E at5? Forbidden.

Thus, the pattern is hard to break.

Therefore, I choose ""DATES"" because it introduces D, which is common.

But note: in this word, we are fixing A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? We don't know if they are correct, but we are testing these positions and the new letter.

If the feedback shows some ✓, we'll know.

Also, if the word is wrong, we'll get information about D and the positions.

So guess: ""DATES""

Let me summarize:

We have:
- Known letters: A,E,S,T must be in the word.
- Excluded letters: C,R,N,L.
- Word pattern: 5 letters including A,E,S,T and one new (D).

In ""DATES"": D at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5.

Check against constraints:
- S: not at1 → S at5, not1 → allowed.
- T: not at2 → T at3, not2 → allowed.
- A: not at3 or4 → position2 → allowed.
- E: not at2 (it's at4), and not at3 or5 → E at4 → allowed? E can be at4? Yes.

So all constraints satisfied.

Therefore, next guess: ""DATES""

<guess>dates</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  
   - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: steal**  
   - S, T, E, and A are in the secret word.  
   - S is not in position 1.  
   - T is not in position 2.  
   - E is not in position 3.  
   - A is not in position 4.  
   - L is not in the secret word.

### Analysis:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, E, S, T.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.  
  - S cannot be in position 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- The secret word must have a fifth letter (not C, R, N, L).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that includes A, E, S, T and one new common letter (e.g., D, M, P, etc.), while respecting position constraints.  
- Prioritize testing new positions:  
  - Place A in position 2 (untested position).  
  - Place E in position 4 (untested position).  
  - Place T in position 3 (untested position).  
- Introduce a common new letter like D to gather information.  
- The word **DATES** fits:  
  - D (new) at position 1.  
  - A at position 2 (allowed).  
  - T at position 3 (allowed).  
  - E at position 4 (allowed).  
  - S at position 5 (allowed, and avoids position 1).  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces D as the fifth letter. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities in future guesses.",Guess 3: dates -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(-) T(-) E(✓) S(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
 - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has A and E, but A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.
 - Uses other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Since A is in the word but not at position 3, we can try putting A in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, or 5). But note: E is also in the word and not at position 5, so E can be in positions 1-4.

 However, we have to avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 We also know that the word does not have C, R, N.

 Let's try to use a word that has A and E and also introduces new common letters.

 Example: We could try ""SLATE"", but let's check:
 - S, L, A, T, E.
 But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and we know it's not there. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position. So we cannot put A at position 3.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and we know it's not at position 5, so in the new word we can put E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try to form a word with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - Put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that has D, I, U which are less common? Also, we have E at position 4 (which is allowed) and avoids position 5. But we also want to test more common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A at position 2 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""PLATE"" -> P, L, A, T, E. 
 - A is at position 3? Again position 3 is not allowed for A. So we avoid.

 How about ""TASER""? 
 - T, A, S, E, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.

 We must avoid R.

 Another idea: ""STEAL"" -> S, T, E, A, L.
 - A is at position 4 (which is new) and E is at position 3 (which is allowed because we only know E is not at 5). 
 - Also, we are introducing S, T, L.

 But note: the word ""STEAL"" has E at position 3 and A at position 4.

 Let's check the letters: S, T, E, A, L. None of these are C, R, or N. So it's valid.

 However, we must make sure that we are not repeating the same positions for A and E that we know are wrong? 
 - For A: in ""crane"" it was at position 3, now we are putting it at position 4 -> that's a new position, so okay.
 - For E: in ""crane"" it was at position 5, now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position, so okay.

 Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems like a good candidate.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but with A at position 3? We cannot because we know A is not at position 3. So we must avoid that.

 Another option: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T and we already know A must not be at position 3? In ""LATTE"", A is at position 2. But also, we have E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot use E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""LATTE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another option: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. 
 - A is at position 3? Again, we cannot put A at position 3.

 How about ""LEAST""? 
 - L, E, A, S, T.
 - E is at position 2 (allowed), A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.

 So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5.

 - ""STEAK"": S, T, E, A, K -> E at position 3, A at position 4 -> that's okay. Also, we introduce S, T, K.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STEAK"" is a valid word.

 However, we are introducing K which is less common? But it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M -> E at 3, A at 4 -> same as above. But M is a common letter.

 But wait, in the first guess we had E as present but not at position 5. We don't know about position 1,2,3,4 for E. Similarly for A, we know it's not at 3, so we can put at 1,2,4,5? But we haven't tried position 1 or 2 for A.

 However, we are trying to get as much new information as possible. Using ""STEAL"" (if we can form it without A at 3 and E at 5) is not possible because in ""STEAL"" we have to put A at 4 and E at 3? Actually, in ""STEAL"":
 - Position 1: S
 - Position 2: T
 - Position 3: E -> that's E at 3, which is allowed.
 - Position 4: A -> that's A at 4, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3).
 - Position 5: L

 But wait, we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. That's acceptable.

 However, I just realized: in ""STEAL"", the A is at position 4 and E at position 3. That's fine.

 But let me check the spelling: ""STEAL"" is a valid word.

 So, both ""STEAL"" and ""STEAK"" are options.

 However, we also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We know C, R, N are out. Both words avoid these.

 Now, which one gives more information? 
 - ""STEAL"" uses S, T, E, A, L -> we already know E and A are in the word, so we are testing S, T, L.
 - ""STEAK"" uses S, T, E, A, K -> testing S, T, K.

 Since L is more common than K, maybe ""STEAL"" is better.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if L or K is in the word. We want to cover more ground.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat the known letters (A and E) and tests entirely new letters? But we have to include A and E because they are in the word. So we must include them.

 Actually, we don't have to include them? The rules don't require that, but it's beneficial because we can get their positions. However, we are allowed to guess without them? But that might not be efficient.

 But note: we know A and E are in the word, so we should use them to narrow down the positions.

 So, I think ""STEAL"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: 
 S at position 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

 But wait: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? That's correct. But we are putting E at 3, which is a new position. Similarly, A is at 4, which is new.

 However, we also know that A is not at position 3 (from the first guess) and we are not putting it at 3, so that's good.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".

 But note: the word ""STEAL"" is valid and meets the criteria.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES"" -> T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2 (allowed), E at position 4 (allowed). But then we have S at the end? Also, we are introducing the same letters.

 However, ""TALES"" has A at 2 and E at 4. That's acceptable.

 But which one is better? ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are anagrams? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

 So the information we get will be about the positions of these letters.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, both are equally good.

 I'll pick ""STEAL"" arbitrarily.

 So, the next guess is ""STEAL"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically, A is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoids placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Excludes C, R, and N (since they are not in the word).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""STEAL"" because:
- It places A at position 4 (a new position, avoiding position 3).
- It places E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces new common letters: S, T, and L.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

This guess should help narrow down the positions of A and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

Guess 2: steal -> S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1.
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- E is in the word, but not in position 3 (this is new, because now we know E isn't in pos 3 either).
- A is in the word, but not in position 4 (new information).
- L is not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters in the word: A, E, S, T (because they got '-' in at least one guess, meaning they are present).
Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L (marked with 'x').

Positions we know are incorrect for certain letters:
- A: not in position 3 (from guess1), not in position 4 (from guess2)
- E: not in position 5 (from guess1), not in position 3 (from guess2)
- S: not in position 1 (from guess2)
- T: not in position 2 (from guess2)

We also know the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have evidence of duplicates.

Now, we must form a new word that:
- Uses only the letters A, E, S, T and other letters we haven't tried (since C,R,N,L are out) but must include A,E,S,T because they are in the word? 
  Actually, we have to include exactly the letters that are in the word? No, we can include other letters to test them, but we know A,E,S,T are in, so excluding them might not be efficient.

However, we have only 6 tries, so we should try to use the known letters and test their positions while introducing at most one new letter.

But note: we have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We know the word must contain A,E,S,T and one more letter (since it's 5 letters).

What are the possible positions for A,E,S,T?

We know:
- A is not at pos3 or pos4.
- E is not at pos3 or pos5.
- S is not at pos1.
- T is not at pos2.

Also, the word cannot have L, C, R, N.

We need to assign positions to A,E,S,T and find a fifth letter that isn't C,R,N,L or any other excluded.

Since we know four letters, the fifth is still unknown. We can try to guess words that have A,E,S,T and one new letter that is common.

But first, let's think about the positions.

The available positions for each letter:

A: can be pos1,2,5 (because not 3,4)
E: can be pos1,2,4 (not 3,5)
S: can be pos2,3,4,5 (not 1)
T: can be pos1,3,4,5 (not 2)

We also know that A,E,S,T must all appear exactly once? Not necessarily, but until we find duplicates, we assume distinct.

Now, we need to form a word with these constraints.

We also want to test the fifth letter.

Common vowels and consonants left: we haven't tried B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we want common ones.

Another idea: since we have two vowels (A,E) and two consonants (S,T), the fifth letter could be a vowel or consonant.

Let's try to list possible words that have A,E,S,T and one more letter.

For example:
- Words with these four and one more: like ""TASER"" but R is out. 
- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D -> but in ""STEAD"": 
  S at1? We know S cannot be at1, so if we put S at1, we are violating. Also, positions: 
  If S at1, but we know S not at1? Wait, in our constraints, S cannot be at pos1.

So in ""STEAD"", S is at position1 -> which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""SATED"": S at1 -> forbidden.
""TASKE"" - but K and E? And R not present? Wait, ""TASKE"" isn't a word? Let me think.

More possibilities:
- ""TEASE"": T,E,A,S,E -> duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, let's avoid for now because E appears twice and we don't know.

""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> that has H and no duplicate.

In ""HASTE"":
- Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.
Check our constraints:
- A: position2 -> allowed (since A can be at1,2,5)
- E: position5 -> but E cannot be at position5? We know E not at5 from guess1. So E at5 is invalid.

Thus, ""HASTE"" is invalid because E is at5.

How about ""HATES"":
- H1, A2, T3, E4, S5.
Check:
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed (since E can be at1,2,4)
- S at5: allowed (S not forbidden at5)
- T at3: allowed (T can be at3)

Therefore, ""HATES"" is a valid word that fits the constraints.

Now, we are introducing H. Is H a common letter? It's not uncommon.

Alternatively, ""HEATS"": same letters? But ""HEATS"" would be H1, E2, A3, T4, S5? 
- But A at position3 is forbidden? We know A cannot be at3. So invalid.

Another word: ""GATES"": G,A,T,E,S -> G1, A2, T3, E4, S5.
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- T at3: allowed (since T can be at3? Yes, because T cannot be at2, but 3 is allowed)
- S at5: allowed

So ""GATES"" is a possibility.

But we are introducing G.

Another one: ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.
But E at5 is not allowed.

""BASTE"": same as above, E at5 -> invalid.

Another possibility: ""OASIS"" - but missing T, and duplicate S? Not containing T.

We need S,T,A,E.

Perhaps ""FATES"": F1, A2, T3, E4, S5 -> same as GATES? Yes.

So words like _ A T E S? With the first letter? H, G, F, etc.

But the pattern that works is: position1: new letter, position2: A, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.

But note: we don't know that A must be at2. It could be elsewhere.

For example, could A be at position5?

Suppose A at position5: then we need positions for S,T,E.

For instance: ""STOAE"" - not a word? Or ""SETAE"" - not common.

Common words: ""SEPTA"": S,E,P,T,A -> 
S at1 -> forbidden? S cannot be at position1. So invalid.

Perhaps A at position1: e.g., ""ASTER"" - but R is out. ""ASHET"" - not a word? 

What about ""TAPES"": T,A,P,E,S -> T1, A2, P3, E4, S5.
- T at1: allowed (T can be at1)
- A at2: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- S at5: allowed
So ""TAPES"" would be good, introducing P.

But then we are introducing a new letter again.

Alternatively, without introducing new letters? That's impossible because we only have A,E,S,T and we need a fifth letter.

So we must introduce one new letter.

Now, comparing:
- ""HATES"": H new letter
- ""GATES"": G new letter
- ""FATES"": F new letter
- ""TAPES"": T at position1 and P new

But in ""TAPES"", note that T is at position1 and that's allowed. We are also testing P.

Since we don't have information about the new letters, any could work. But we want to choose one that covers common letters.

We also haven't tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: D, P, M, etc.

But let's note: from the feedback, we have two '-' for E and A each time, meaning they are definitely not in those positions. Also, for S and T, we have only one '-' each, meaning we have one wrong position each.

We have no correct placements yet.

Perhaps we should also consider that S and T might be movable.

But let's go back to the constraints and try to assign positions.

Consider:
- Position1: cannot be S. It could be T, or A, or E, but A can be at1, E can be at1?
  E at1: possible? Yes, E can be at position1,2,4. So E at1 is allowed.
- Similarly, A at1 is allowed.

So possible:

Option 1: Position1: E, Position2: A -> but A at2? Then position3,4,5 for S,T and one more letter. But S cannot be at1, T cannot be at2? But here T could go elsewhere.

But E at1 and A at2: let's find a word: e.g., ""EASTS"" -> duplicate, not good. ""EAT _ _"": ""EATER"" but R out. ""EATEN"" N out. ""EATER"" is invalid.

Another option: Position1: T, position then? For example, ""T? ? ? ?""

But T at position1: allowed. Then we need A,E,S and one more. And positions.

We know: T at1, then position2: cannot be T? And cannot be T? Position2 can be A or E? But A can be at2? How about ""TA?ES"": ""TAMES"", ""TAPES"", ""TARES"" but R out. ""TABES"" not word? ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TASES"": S duplicate? But ""TASET"" not word.

""TASKS"": K, but S at position4? And E missing? We must have E.

The word must have E. So ""TAPES"" is good.

What about position1: A? A at1: allowed? Then A1. Then for example: ""A?TES"": ""ASTER"" R out. ""ATTES"" duplicate T. ""ACTES"" C out. ""AITES"" not word. ""AGUES"" not containing T. Hard.

Another: ""AS?ET"": but we need T and E, and not S at1? If A is at1, then S cannot be at1 but that's fine, S can be elsewhere. But E must not be at5. So ""A? ? E S"" pattern? For example, ""ABYES"" not word? ""AUTES"" not common? ""AISLE"" contains L out? L is not allowed? L is out. ""ARISE"" R out. ""ASHES"" not T? We need T.

So difficult to put A at1.

Position1: S is forbidden, so not S.

So position1 possibilities: T, E, A? We saw A at1 is difficult. E at1 we tried. T at1 seems promising with words like ""TAPES"".

But also, ""TEAMS"": T,E,A,M,S -> T1, E2, A3, M4, S5? 
But in ""TEAMS"": we have E at2? That's allowed? And A at position3? But A cannot be at position3? Because from guess1, A not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""TEALS"" -> L out.

Therefore, ""TAPES"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""HEATS"" we saw has A at pos3? Forbidden.

What about ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H -> but no S? We must have S. So missing S.

All words must contain A,E,S,T.

We can think of words with S not at the end? For example, if S is in position2? But position2 can be S? Yes, because S can be at2. But T cannot be at2? T not at2, so S at2 is okay.

For instance: ""?S A? E??"" 

But we have constraints.

Let me try: position1: new letter (say H) 
position2: S (allowed, since S not at1) 
position3: ? Cannot be A because A not at3. Also, cannot be E? We are not sure? E can be at3? But from guess2, E was at position3 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position3? Exactly, E cannot be at3. So position3 cannot be E or A? It must be a new letter? Or T? T can be at3? Yes.

So possibility: position1: H, position2: S, position3: T (allowed? T can be at3), position4: E? That's allowed? E not at4? Wait, E can be at4. Then position5: A? But A can be at5? Yes.

So ""HSTEA"" ? That's not a word. ""H S T E A"" -> ""HASTE"" but H1,A2,S3,T4,E5 -> we already saw ""HASTE"" has E at5? Forbidden.

Wait, in ""HASTE"", E is at5? Forbidden. But if we rearrange: ""H S T E A"" -> no English word.

Alternatively, position4: A? But A not at4? From guess2, A was at4 and we got ""-"", meaning not at4. So A not at4? Yes, so position4 cannot be A.

Similarly, position5: E cannot be at5? Yes.

So in the word ""H S T E A"" or similar, we have to avoid:
At position4: cannot be A? Because A not at4, and cannot have E there? Wait, E can be at4? But A cannot be at4.

But for position4, if we put E: allowed? Then position5: A? Because A can be at5? So ""H?ST E A"" structure? 

Word: ""HIST E A"" -> ""HISTEA""? not a word.

Perhaps different ordering.

Another pattern: position1: T, position2: S? But T can be at1, S can be at2? But we know T cannot be at2? No: T cannot be at position2. Position2 is for S? Then T would be at position1: so T at1 and S at2: then ""TS? ? ?""

For example, ""TSADE"" not word? ""TSUNAMI"" too long. Not good.

Perhaps ""TEAS followed by one letter"": but ""TEASE"" duplicate E? And E at4 then? And S at4? But we have four letters and need one more? ""TEAS"" is 4 letters.

I think the options are limited. 

Therefore, going back, words like ""TAPES"" or ""HATES"" or ""GATES"" seem plausible.

Among these, let's choose one that uses a common letter. 

Note: we haven't tried D, M, P, etc.

Since in ""HATES"" we introduce H, in ""GATES"" G, in ""TAPES"" we introduce P.

P is more common than H and G? Let me think. 

Or D: is there a word ""DATES"": D1,A2,T3,E4,S5? 
Check constraints:
- A at2: allowed
- T at3: allowed
- E at4: allowed
- S at5: allowed
So ""DATES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATES"": M1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Allowed? Yes.
""FATES"": F1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Yes.

So ""DATES"" uses D. D is a common letter.

Alternatively, we can try to have S not at the end. That might give more positional information.

For example, consider ""STADE"" -> but S at1 forbidden? No, in ""STADE"": S1,T2,A3,D4,E5? 
But S at1 forbidden? Yes. Also A at3 forbidden? Because not position3.

So not.

""TASTE"": T1,A2,S3,T4,E5? Duplicate T? And A2 allowed, T4 allowed, but E5 forbidden? and S3? And we have duplicate T? Also, S at position3 might be allowed? But we don't know about duplicates yet? Also, E at5 forbidden.

Another word: ""SEATS"": S1,E2,A3,T4,S5? Duplicate S? S at1 forbidden? E at2 allowed? A at3? Forbidden? And E at2 allowed, but A at3 not allowed.

So invalid.

Therefore, the safest is to use a word following the pattern: [new] A T E S, with A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? But S at5 is last, which we haven't tested before? That's fine.

But we have placed S at5: we don't know if that's correct.

We can also try a word with S not at5? How? For example:

Suppose we have S at position2? Then we need A,E,T and one new letter? 

But word: ""S? ? ? ?"" , but S at1? Forbidden. If S at2? It's allowed? Then for example: ""ISLET"" L out. ""USAGE"" G, but no T? Not containing T? ""T is needed"".

""PASTE"": again S at position3? And E at5? Forbidden.

Thus, the pattern is hard to break.

Therefore, I choose ""DATES"" because it introduces D, which is common.

But note: in this word, we are fixing A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? We don't know if they are correct, but we are testing these positions and the new letter.

If the feedback shows some ✓, we'll know.

Also, if the word is wrong, we'll get information about D and the positions.

So guess: ""DATES""

Let me summarize:

We have:
- Known letters: A,E,S,T must be in the word.
- Excluded letters: C,R,N,L.
- Word pattern: 5 letters including A,E,S,T and one new (D).

In ""DATES"": D at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5.

Check against constraints:
- S: not at1 → S at5, not1 → allowed.
- T: not at2 → T at3, not2 → allowed.
- A: not at3 or4 → position2 → allowed.
- E: not at2 (it's at4), and not at3 or5 → E at4 → allowed? E can be at4? Yes.

So all constraints satisfied.

Therefore, next guess: ""DATES""

<guess>dates</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  
   - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: steal**  
   - S, T, E, and A are in the secret word.  
   - S is not in position 1.  
   - T is not in position 2.  
   - E is not in position 3.  
   - A is not in position 4.  
   - L is not in the secret word.

### Analysis:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, E, S, T.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.  
  - S cannot be in position 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- The secret word must have a fifth letter (not C, R, N, L).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that includes A, E, S, T and one new common letter (e.g., D, M, P, etc.), while respecting position constraints.  
- Prioritize testing new positions:  
  - Place A in position 2 (untested position).  
  - Place E in position 4 (untested position).  
  - Place T in position 3 (untested position).  
- Introduce a common new letter like D to gather information.  
- The word **DATES** fits:  
  - D (new) at position 1.  
  - A at position 2 (allowed).  
  - T at position 3 (allowed).  
  - E at position 4 (allowed).  
  - S at position 5 (allowed, and avoids position 1).  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and introduces D as the fifth letter. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities in future guesses.

But note: E is also in the word and not at position 5, so E can be in positions 1-4.\n\n However, we have to avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.\n\n We also know that the word does not have C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s try to use a word that has A and E and also introduces new common letters.\n\n Example: We could try ""SLATE"", but let\'s check:\n - S, L, A, T, E.\n But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and we know it\'s not there. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position. So we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and we know it\'s not at position 5, so in the new word we can put E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word with A not at 3 and E not at 5.\n\n Possibilities: \n - Put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that has D, I, U which are less common? Also, we have E at position 4 (which is allowed) and avoids position 5. But we also want to test more common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with A at position 2 and E at position 4? \n\n Example: ""PLATE"" -> P, L, A, T, E. \n - A is at position 3? Again position 3 is not allowed for A. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""TASER""? \n - T, A, S, E, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.\n\n We must avoid R.\n\n Another idea: ""STEAL"" -> S, T, E, A, L.\n - A is at position 4 (which is new) and E is at position 3 (which is allowed because we only know E is not at 5). \n - Also, we are introducing S, T, L.\n\n But note: the word ""STEAL"" has E at position 3 and A at position 4.\n\n Let\'s check the letters: S, T, E, A, L. None of these are C, R, or N. So it\'s valid.\n\n However, we must make sure that we are not repeating the same positions for A and E that we know are wrong? \n - For A: in ""crane"" it was at position 3, now we are putting it at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so okay.\n - For E: in ""crane"" it was at position 5, now we are putting it at position 3 -> that\'s a new position, so okay.\n\n Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but with A at position 3? We cannot because we know A is not at position 3. So we must avoid that.\n\n Another option: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T and we already know A must not be at position 3? In ""LATTE"", A is at position 2. But also, we have E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot use E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""LATTE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.\n\n Another option: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. \n - A is at position 3? Again, we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n How about ""LEAST""? \n - L, E, A, S, T.\n - E is at position 2 (allowed), A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.\n\n So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Let me try to list words that have A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.\n\n Possibilities:\n - ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5.\n\n - ""STEAK"": S, T, E, A, K -> E at position 3, A at position 4 -> that\'s okay. Also, we introduce S, T, K.\n\n But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STEAK"" is a valid word.\n\n However, we are introducing K which is less common? But it\'s acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M -> E at 3, A at 4 -> same as above. But M is a common letter.\n\n But wait, in the first guess we had E as present but not at position 5. We don\'t know about position 1,2,3,4 for E. Similarly for A, we know it\'s not at 3, so we can put at 1,2,4,5? But we haven\'t tried position 1 or 2 for A.\n\n However, we are trying to get as much new information as possible. Using ""STEAL"" (if we can form it without A at 3 and E at 5) is not possible because in ""STEAL"" we have to put A at 4 and E at 3? Actually, in ""STEAL"":\n - Position 1: S\n - Position 2: T\n - Position 3: E -> that\'s E at 3, which is allowed.\n - Position 4: A -> that\'s A at 4, which is allowed (since we only know A is not at 3).\n - Position 5: L\n\n But wait, we are putting E at 3 and A at 4. That\'s acceptable.\n\n However, I just realized: in ""STEAL"", the A is at position 4 and E at position 3. That\'s fine.\n\n But let me check the spelling: ""STEAL"" is a valid word.\n\n So, both ""STEAL"" and ""STEAK"" are options.\n\n However, we also want to avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We know C, R, N are out. Both words avoid these.\n\n Now, which one gives more information? \n - ""STEAL"" uses S, T, E, A, L -> we already know E and A are in the word, so we are testing S, T, L.\n - ""STEAK"" uses S, T, E, A, K -> testing S, T, K.\n\n Since L is more common than K, maybe ""STEAL"" is better.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious because we don\'t know if L or K is in the word. We want to cover more ground.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat the known letters (A and E) and tests entirely new letters? But we have to include A and E because they are in the word. So we must include them.\n\n Actually, we don\'t have to include them? The rules don\'t require that, but it\'s beneficial because we can get their positions. However, we are allowed to guess without them? But that might not be efficient.\n\n But note: we know A and E are in the word, so we should use them to narrow down the positions.\n\n So, I think ""STEAL"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me write it: \n S at position 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.\n\n But wait: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? That\'s correct. But we are putting E at 3, which is a new position. Similarly, A is at 4, which is new.\n\n However, we also know that A is not at position 3 (from the first guess) and we are not putting it at 3, so that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".\n\n But note: the word ""STEAL"" is valid and meets the criteria.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that\'s out.\n\n Another option: ""TALES"" -> T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2 (allowed), E at position 4 (allowed). But then we have S at the end? Also, we are introducing the same letters.\n\n However, ""TALES"" has A at 2 and E at 4. That\'s acceptable.\n\n But which one is better? ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are anagrams? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.\n\n So the information we get will be about the positions of these letters.\n\n Since we don\'t have any information about the positions of A and E except that A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, both are equally good.\n\n I\'ll pick ""STEAL"" arbitrarily.\n\n So, the next guess is ""STEAL"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically, A is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoids placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.\n- Excludes C, R, and N (since they are not in the word).\n- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""STEAL"" because:\n- It places A at position 4 (a new position, avoiding position 3).\n- It places E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).\n- It introduces new common letters: S, T, and L.\n- It avoids C, R, and N.\n\nThis guess should help narrow down the positions of A and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N are not in the word.\n- A is in the word, but not in position 3.\n- E is in the word, but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: steal -> S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)\nMeaning:\n- S is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- T is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word, but not in position 3 (this is new, because now we know E isn\'t in pos 3 either).\n- A is in the word, but not in position 4 (new information).\n- L is not in the word.\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nLetters in the word: A, E, S, T (because they got \'-\' in at least one guess, meaning they are present).\nLetters not in the word: C, R, N, L (marked with \'x\').\n\nPositions we know are incorrect for certain letters:\n- A: not in position 3 (from guess1), not in position 4 (from guess2)\n- E: not in position 5 (from guess1), not in position 3 (from guess2)\n- S: not in position 1 (from guess2)\n- T: not in position 2 (from guess2)\n\nWe also know the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nNow, we must form a new word that:\n- Uses only the letters A, E, S, T and other letters we haven\'t tried (since C,R,N,L are out) but must include A,E,S,T because they are in the word? \n  Actually, we have to include exactly the letters that are in the word? No, we can include other letters to test them, but we know A,E,S,T are in, so excluding them might not be efficient.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 tries, so we should try to use the known letters and test their positions while introducing at most one new letter.\n\nBut note: we have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe know the word must contain A,E,S,T and one more letter (since it\'s 5 letters).\n\nWhat are the possible positions for A,E,S,T?\n\nWe know:\n- A is not at pos3 or pos4.\n- E is not at pos3 or pos5.\n- S is not at pos1.\n- T is not at pos2.\n\nAlso, the word cannot have L, C, R, N.\n\nWe need to assign positions to A,E,S,T and find a fifth letter that isn\'t C,R,N,L or any other excluded.\n\nSince we know four letters, the fifth is still unknown. We can try to guess words that have A,E,S,T and one new letter that is common.\n\nBut first, let\'s think about the positions.\n\nThe available positions for each letter:\n\nA: can be pos1,2,5 (because not 3,4)\nE: can be pos1,2,4 (not 3,5)\nS: can be pos2,3,4,5 (not 1)\nT: can be pos1,3,4,5 (not 2)\n\nWe also know that A,E,S,T must all appear exactly once? Not necessarily, but until we find duplicates, we assume distinct.\n\nNow, we need to form a word with these constraints.\n\nWe also want to test the fifth letter.\n\nCommon vowels and consonants left: we haven\'t tried B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we want common ones.\n\nAnother idea: since we have two vowels (A,E) and two consonants (S,T), the fifth letter could be a vowel or consonant.\n\nLet\'s try to list possible words that have A,E,S,T and one more letter.\n\nFor example:\n- Words with these four and one more: like ""TASER"" but R is out. \n- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D -> but in ""STEAD"": \n  S at1? We know S cannot be at1, so if we put S at1, we are violating. Also, positions: \n  If S at1, but we know S not at1? Wait, in our constraints, S cannot be at pos1.\n\nSo in ""STEAD"", S is at position1 -> which is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""SATED"": S at1 -> forbidden.\n""TASKE"" - but K and E? And R not present? Wait, ""TASKE"" isn\'t a word? Let me think.\n\nMore possibilities:\n- ""TEASE"": T,E,A,S,E -> duplicate E? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, let\'s avoid for now because E appears twice and we don\'t know.\n\n""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> that has H and no duplicate.\n\nIn ""HASTE"":\n- Positions: H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.\nCheck our constraints:\n- A: position2 -> allowed (since A can be at1,2,5)\n- E: position5 -> but E cannot be at position5? We know E not at5 from guess1. So E at5 is invalid.\n\nThus, ""HASTE"" is invalid because E is at5.\n\nHow about ""HATES"":\n- H1, A2, T3, E4, S5.\nCheck:\n- A at2: allowed\n- E at4: allowed (since E can be at1,2,4)\n- S at5: allowed (S not forbidden at5)\n- T at3: allowed (T can be at3)\n\nTherefore, ""HATES"" is a valid word that fits the constraints.\n\nNow, we are introducing H. Is H a common letter? It\'s not uncommon.\n\nAlternatively, ""HEATS"": same letters? But ""HEATS"" would be H1, E2, A3, T4, S5? \n- But A at position3 is forbidden? We know A cannot be at3. So invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""GATES"": G,A,T,E,S -> G1, A2, T3, E4, S5.\n- A at2: allowed\n- E at4: allowed\n- T at3: allowed (since T can be at3? Yes, because T cannot be at2, but 3 is allowed)\n- S at5: allowed\n\nSo ""GATES"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we are introducing G.\n\nAnother one: ""PASTE"": P,A,S,T,E -> P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.\nBut E at5 is not allowed.\n\n""BASTE"": same as above, E at5 -> invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OASIS"" - but missing T, and duplicate S? Not containing T.\n\nWe need S,T,A,E.\n\nPerhaps ""FATES"": F1, A2, T3, E4, S5 -> same as GATES? Yes.\n\nSo words like _ A T E S? With the first letter? H, G, F, etc.\n\nBut the pattern that works is: position1: new letter, position2: A, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know that A must be at2. It could be elsewhere.\n\nFor example, could A be at position5?\n\nSuppose A at position5: then we need positions for S,T,E.\n\nFor instance: ""STOAE"" - not a word? Or ""SETAE"" - not common.\n\nCommon words: ""SEPTA"": S,E,P,T,A -> \nS at1 -> forbidden? S cannot be at position1. So invalid.\n\nPerhaps A at position1: e.g., ""ASTER"" - but R is out. ""ASHET"" - not a word? \n\nWhat about ""TAPES"": T,A,P,E,S -> T1, A2, P3, E4, S5.\n- T at1: allowed (T can be at1)\n- A at2: allowed\n- E at4: allowed\n- S at5: allowed\nSo ""TAPES"" would be good, introducing P.\n\nBut then we are introducing a new letter again.\n\nAlternatively, without introducing new letters? That\'s impossible because we only have A,E,S,T and we need a fifth letter.\n\nSo we must introduce one new letter.\n\nNow, comparing:\n- ""HATES"": H new letter\n- ""GATES"": G new letter\n- ""FATES"": F new letter\n- ""TAPES"": T at position1 and P new\n\nBut in ""TAPES"", note that T is at position1 and that\'s allowed. We are also testing P.\n\nSince we don\'t have information about the new letters, any could work. But we want to choose one that covers common letters.\n\nWe also haven\'t tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters: D, P, M, etc.\n\nBut let\'s note: from the feedback, we have two \'-\' for E and A each time, meaning they are definitely not in those positions. Also, for S and T, we have only one \'-\' each, meaning we have one wrong position each.\n\nWe have no correct placements yet.\n\nPerhaps we should also consider that S and T might be movable.\n\nBut let\'s go back to the constraints and try to assign positions.\n\nConsider:\n- Position1: cannot be S. It could be T, or A, or E, but A can be at1, E can be at1?\n  E at1: possible? Yes, E can be at position1,2,4. So E at1 is allowed.\n- Similarly, A at1 is allowed.\n\nSo possible:\n\nOption 1: Position1: E, Position2: A -> but A at2? Then position3,4,5 for S,T and one more letter. But S cannot be at1, T cannot be at2? But here T could go elsewhere.\n\nBut E at1 and A at2: let\'s find a word: e.g., ""EASTS"" -> duplicate, not good. ""EAT _ _"": ""EATER"" but R out. ""EATEN"" N out. ""EATER"" is invalid.\n\nAnother option: Position1: T, position then? For example, ""T? ? ? ?""\n\nBut T at position1: allowed. Then we need A,E,S and one more. And positions.\n\nWe know: T at1, then position2: cannot be T? And cannot be T? Position2 can be A or E? But A can be at2? How about ""TA?ES"": ""TAMES"", ""TAPES"", ""TARES"" but R out. ""TABES"" not word? ""TAPES"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TASES"": S duplicate? But ""TASET"" not word.\n\n""TASKS"": K, but S at position4? And E missing? We must have E.\n\nThe word must have E. So ""TAPES"" is good.\n\nWhat about position1: A? A at1: allowed? Then A1. Then for example: ""A?TES"": ""ASTER"" R out. ""ATTES"" duplicate T. ""ACTES"" C out. ""AITES"" not word. ""AGUES"" not containing T. Hard.\n\nAnother: ""AS?ET"": but we need T and E, and not S at1? If A is at1, then S cannot be at1 but that\'s fine, S can be elsewhere. But E must not be at5. So ""A? ? E S"" pattern? For example, ""ABYES"" not word? ""AUTES"" not common? ""AISLE"" contains L out? L is not allowed? L is out. ""ARISE"" R out. ""ASHES"" not T? We need T.\n\nSo difficult to put A at1.\n\nPosition1: S is forbidden, so not S.\n\nSo position1 possibilities: T, E, A? We saw A at1 is difficult. E at1 we tried. T at1 seems promising with words like ""TAPES"".\n\nBut also, ""TEAMS"": T,E,A,M,S -> T1, E2, A3, M4, S5? \nBut in ""TEAMS"": we have E at2? That\'s allowed? And A at position3? But A cannot be at position3? Because from guess1, A not at pos3. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TEALS"" -> L out.\n\nTherefore, ""TAPES"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""HEATS"" we saw has A at pos3? Forbidden.\n\nWhat about ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H -> but no S? We must have S. So missing S.\n\nAll words must contain A,E,S,T.\n\nWe can think of words with S not at the end? For example, if S is in position2? But position2 can be S? Yes, because S can be at2. But T cannot be at2? T not at2, so S at2 is okay.\n\nFor instance: ""?S A? E??"" \n\nBut we have constraints.\n\nLet me try: position1: new letter (say H) \nposition2: S (allowed, since S not at1) \nposition3: ? Cannot be A because A not at3. Also, cannot be E? We are not sure? E can be at3? But from guess2, E was at position3 and we got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position3? Exactly, E cannot be at3. So position3 cannot be E or A? It must be a new letter? Or T? T can be at3? Yes.\n\nSo possibility: position1: H, position2: S, position3: T (allowed? T can be at3), position4: E? That\'s allowed? E not at4? Wait, E can be at4. Then position5: A? But A can be at5? Yes.\n\nSo ""HSTEA"" ? That\'s not a word. ""H S T E A"" -> ""HASTE"" but H1,A2,S3,T4,E5 -> we already saw ""HASTE"" has E at5? Forbidden.\n\nWait, in ""HASTE"", E is at5? Forbidden. But if we rearrange: ""H S T E A"" -> no English word.\n\nAlternatively, position4: A? But A not at4? From guess2, A was at4 and we got ""-"", meaning not at4. So A not at4? Yes, so position4 cannot be A.\n\nSimilarly, position5: E cannot be at5? Yes.\n\nSo in the word ""H S T E A"" or similar, we have to avoid:\nAt position4: cannot be A? Because A not at4, and cannot have E there? Wait, E can be at4? But A cannot be at4.\n\nBut for position4, if we put E: allowed? Then position5: A? Because A can be at5? So ""H?ST E A"" structure? \n\nWord: ""HIST E A"" -> ""HISTEA""? not a word.\n\nPerhaps different ordering.\n\nAnother pattern: position1: T, position2: S? But T can be at1, S can be at2? But we know T cannot be at2? No: T cannot be at position2. Position2 is for S? Then T would be at position1: so T at1 and S at2: then ""TS? ? ?""\n\nFor example, ""TSADE"" not word? ""TSUNAMI"" too long. Not good.\n\nPerhaps ""TEAS followed by one letter"": but ""TEASE"" duplicate E? And E at4 then? And S at4? But we have four letters and need one more? ""TEAS"" is 4 letters.\n\nI think the options are limited. \n\nTherefore, going back, words like ""TAPES"" or ""HATES"" or ""GATES"" seem plausible.\n\nAmong these, let\'s choose one that uses a common letter. \n\nNote: we haven\'t tried D, M, P, etc.\n\nSince in ""HATES"" we introduce H, in ""GATES"" G, in ""TAPES"" we introduce P.\n\nP is more common than H and G? Let me think. \n\nOr D: is there a word ""DATES"": D1,A2,T3,E4,S5? \nCheck constraints:\n- A at2: allowed\n- T at3: allowed\n- E at4: allowed\n- S at5: allowed\nSo ""DATES"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""MATES"": M1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Allowed? Yes.\n""FATES"": F1,A2,T3,E4,S5? Yes.\n\nSo ""DATES"" uses D. D is a common letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to have S not at the end. That might give more positional information.\n\nFor example, consider ""STADE"" -> but S at1 forbidden? No, in ""STADE"": S1,T2,A3,D4,E5? \nBut S at1 forbidden? Yes. Also A at3 forbidden? Because not position3.\n\nSo not.\n\n""TASTE"": T1,A2,S3,T4,E5? Duplicate T? And A2 allowed, T4 allowed, but E5 forbidden? and S3? And we have duplicate T? Also, S at position3 might be allowed? But we don\'t know about duplicates yet? Also, E at5 forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""SEATS"": S1,E2,A3,T4,S5? Duplicate S? S at1 forbidden? E at2 allowed? A at3? Forbidden? And E at2 allowed, but A at3 not allowed.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nTherefore, the safest is to use a word following the pattern: [new] A T E S, with A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? But S at5 is last, which we haven\'t tested before? That\'s fine.\n\nBut we have placed S at5: we don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nWe can also try a word with S not at5? How? For example:\n\nSuppose we have S at position2? Then we need A,E,T and one new letter? \n\nBut word: ""S? ? ? ?"" , but S at1? Forbidden. If S at2? It\'s allowed? Then for example: ""ISLET"" L out. ""USAGE"" G, but no T? Not containing T? ""T is needed"".\n\n""PASTE"": again S at position3? And E at5? Forbidden.\n\nThus, the pattern is hard to break.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""DATES"" because it introduces D, which is common.\n\nBut note: in this word, we are fixing A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5? We don\'t know if they are correct, but we are testing these positions and the new letter.\n\nIf the feedback shows some ✓, we\'ll know.\n\nAlso, if the word is wrong, we\'ll get information about D and the positions.\n\nSo guess: ""DATES""\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nWe have:\n- Known letters: A,E,S,T must be in the word.\n- Excluded letters: C,R,N,L.\n- Word pattern: 5 letters including A,E,S,T and one new (D).\n\nIn ""DATES"": D at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5.\n\nCheck against constraints:\n- S: not at1 → S at5, not1 → allowed.\n- T: not at2 → T at3, not2 → allowed.\n- A: not at3 or4 → position2 → allowed.\n- E: not at2 (it\'s at4), and not at3 or5 → E at4 → allowed?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 1
- T: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 2
- E: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 3
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 4
- L: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""dates""
- D: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 2
- T: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 3
- E: ✓ (correct position) -> E is at position 4!
- S: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 5

So, from all the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains: A, E, S, T (and one more letter, since we have 5 letters and we know 4: A, E, S, T).
2. The secret word does NOT contain: C, R, N, L, D.
3. Position information:
   - E is at position 4 (from guess 3: E is correct at position 4).
   - A is not at position 2, 3, or 4 (from guess1: not 3; guess2: not 4; guess3: not 2).
   - Since A must be in the word and positions are 1,2,3,4,5, and we know not 2,3,4, so A must be at position 1 or 5.
   - S is not at position 1 (from guess2) and not at position 5 (from guess3). So S must be at position 2 or 3.
   - T is not at position 2 (from guess2) and not at position 3 (from guess3). So T must be at position 1 or 5? But note: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know T not at 2 and not at 3, so T can be at 1,4,5. But position 4 is taken by E (E is fixed at 4). So T cannot be at 4. Therefore, T must be at position 1 or 5.

But note: we have two letters that could be at position 1 or 5: A and T. And S must be at 2 or 3.

Also, the fifth letter is unknown, but we know it is not C,R,N,L,D.

Now, let's list the known constraints:

- Position 1: either A or T (since A can be 1 or 5, T can be 1 or 5, and they can't both be at 1, so one at 1 and the other at 5? Or one of them at 1 and the fifth letter at 5? But we have to assign all positions.)

Actually, the word has 5 positions:

Position 1: one of A, T, or the fifth letter? But we know A and T are in the word, and they must be placed. Also, S is in the word and must be at 2 or 3.

Let me denote the fifth letter as X (unknown).

The word: [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4] [P5]

We know:
- P4 = E (fixed)

Now, for A: must be at P1 or P5.
For T: must be at P1 or P5 (but not the same as A, unless duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so assume distinct for now).
For S: must be at P2 or P3.

But note: if A is at P1, then T must be at P5 (since P1 is taken and T cannot be at 2,3,4). Similarly, if T is at P1, then A must be at P5.

So two cases:

Case 1: P1 = A, P5 = T
Case 2: P1 = T, P5 = A

In both cases, we have:
- P2 and P3: one is S and the other is the fifth letter X.

But S must be at P2 or P3, and the remaining position (P2 or P3) is X.

Also, we know that from guess2, when we had ""steal"" (S at1, T at2, E at3, A at4, L at5), we got S, T, E, A all as '-' meaning they are in the word but not at those positions. We already used that to say S not at1, T not at2, E not at3, A not at4.

Similarly, in guess3, ""dates"" (D at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5) we got A not at2, T not at3, E correct at4, S not at5.

Now, we need to find a word that fits one of the two cases and has a fifth letter that is not C,R,N,L,D.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: P1 = A, P5 = T
Then the word is: A [P2] [P3] E T
Where P2 and P3 are S and X (the unknown letter), in some order.

Case 2: P1 = T, P5 = A
Then the word is: T [P2] [P3] E A

We need to find valid English words for these patterns.

First, let's list possible words for Case 1: A _ _ E T
With the middle two positions being S and X (X not C,R,N,L,D).

Possible words:
- A B E T? -> ""ABET"" is 4 letters? We need 5: A _ _ E T, so two letters in the middle. ""ABET"" is 4, so not.
- 5-letter words: 
  - ""ASSET"" -> but S duplicate? And we have S at P2 and P3? But in ""ASSET"": A, S, S, E, T -> but we have two S's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in our feedback so far, we haven't seen duplicates, and we have 4 distinct letters (A,E,S,T) plus one more, so if the fifth letter is S, then duplicate S? But we have S in the word, so if the fifth letter is S, then duplicate. But we don't have evidence against duplicates.

But let's check: in ""ASSET"", we have A at1, S at2, S at3, E at4, T at5. 
But we know S must be at P2 or P3? Here it is at both? But that's possible? However, in our constraints, we have S in the word, and we are placing it at P2 and P3? But that would be two S's? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid assuming no duplicates until we have evidence.

But to be safe, let's consider both possibilities.

First, without duplicates: then the fifth letter is not S, so in Case 1: A X Y E T, where one of X or Y is S and the other is a new letter.

Similarly for Case 2.

But let's list actual words.

Case 1: A _ _ E T
Possible words:
- ""ABET"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""ABLET"" -> but L is excluded? L is not allowed.
- ""ACET"" not 5.
- ""ADEPT"" -> D is excluded? D is not allowed (from guess3, D is x).
- ""AFRET"" not a word.
- ""AGENT"" -> G, but N is excluded? N is not allowed.
- ""AHENT"" not word.
- ""AIERY"" not word.
- ""ALERT"" -> L excluded.
- ""AMEND"" -> M, but D excluded and N excluded? D and N are out.
- ""APERT"" -> P, but ""APERT"" is not common? Let me check: ""apert"" is not a standard word. 
- ""ARETT"" not word.
- ""ASPER"" -> R excluded.
- ""ASSET"" -> duplicate S? But let's consider: A,S,S,E,T. This has duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, S is already known to be in the word, so if we have two S, then it's okay? But in our feedback, we haven't encountered a duplicate yet.

But we can try to avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ASTER"" -> R excluded.

""ATOKE"" -> O, K? ""ATOKE"" is a word? Meaning a type of fish? But let's see: A,T,O,K,E -> but in our pattern A _ _ E T, so it would be A, T, O, E, T? That doesn't fit because the last letter is T, but we have T at the end? Pattern is A _ _ E T, so positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:T. So for ""ATOKE"": A1, T2, O3, K4, E5 -> but that doesn't match because E is at5? But we need E at4 and T at5. So not.

I think ""ASSET"" is a common word that fits: A1, S2, S3, E4, T5. But we have E at4 which is fixed, and T at5. And A at1. Now, check constraints for S: we have S at2 and S at3? But we know S must be in the word, and we have two S's? But we don't have feedback that says S is only one. So it's possible.

But in our constraints, we said S must be at position2 or 3? Here it is at both? That satisfies that it is at position2 and 3? But we only required that S is at one of 2 or 3? But if it is at both, that's fine? However, we also have the fifth letter? In ""ASSET"", the fifth letter is S? So the letters are A, S, E, T and the fifth is S? So duplicate S.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The game allows duplicate letters? In Wordle, duplicates are allowed.

But let's see the feedback: in previous guesses, we didn't have duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word can't have duplicates.

So ""ASSET"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it violates any feedback.

Check against feedback:
- A at1: we have no feedback that A cannot be at1? We only know A not at2,3,4. So at1 is allowed.
- S at2 and S at3: we know S not at1 and not at5? From guess2: S not at1, and guess3: S not at5. So S at2 and S at3 are allowed? But we don't have feedback on position2 and 3 for S? So it's okay.
- E at4: correct, as we know.
- T at5: we know T not at2 and not at3? But at5 is allowed? We have no feedback that T cannot be at5? Only that T not at2 and not at3. So T at5 is allowed.

Therefore, ""ASSET"" is a possible word.

But we also have Case 2: T at1 and A at5.

Case 2: T _ _ E A

Possible words: T ? ? E A

With the middle two being S and X.

Words:
- ""TABEA"" not word.
- ""TACET"" -> C excluded.
- ""TALEA"" -> L excluded.
- ""TAPET"" -> P, but duplicate T? ""TAPET"" is a word? Meaning a type of tapestry? But let's see: T,A,P,E,T -> duplicate T? And E at4, A at5? Pattern: T1, A2, P3, E4, T5? But we have T at1 and T at5? Duplicate T? And A at2? But we know A not at2? From guess3, A not at2. So invalid.

""TAREA"" -> R excluded.

""TASSE"" -> T1, A2, S3, S4, E5? But E5? We know E not at5? From guess1, E not at5. So invalid.

""TASTE"" -> T1, A2, S3, T4, E5? Duplicate T? And A at2? Not allowed (A not at2). Also E at5 not allowed.

""TATIE"" -> not common? And A at2 not allowed.

""TAXED"" -> X, D? T1, A2, X3, E4, D5? But A at2 not allowed? And D excluded.

""TEADE"" -> E at2? But we have E at4? And duplicate E? T1, E2, A3, D4, E5? But A at3 not allowed? And E at2 and E5? Also D excluded.

Not working.

""TENSE"" -> T1, E2, N3, S4, E5? But N excluded? And E at2 and E5? Also, we have E at4? Not matching pattern.

Another word: ""TERSE"" -> T1, E2, R3, S4, E5? R excluded, E at2 and E5? Not.

""TESTE"" -> duplicate T and E? T1, E2, S3, T4, E5? But E at2 and E5? And T at1 and T4? Also, E at5 not allowed.

I think Case 2 is harder to find words. So perhaps Case 1 is more likely.

But we have ""ASSET"" for Case 1.

But in ""ASSET"", we have duplicate S. Is that acceptable? Yes, because Wordle allows duplicate letters.

But we haven't tested for duplicates, so it's possible.

Are there other words for Case 1 without duplicates?

For example, A _ _ E T, with two different letters in the middle, one being S and the other a new letter.

So: A X S E T or A S X E T.

Where X is a new letter not in {C,R,N,L,D} and not A,E,S,T.

For A X S E T:
- ""ABSET"" not a word.
- ""ADSET"" -> D excluded.
- ""AESET"" duplicate E? Not.
- ""AFSET"" not word.
- ""AGSET"" not word.
- ""AISET"" not word.
- ""AKSET"" not word.
- ""AMSET"" -> M? ""amset"" not word? ""Anset"" not.
- ""ANSET"" -> N excluded.
- ""APSET"" not word.
- ""ARSET"" -> R excluded.
- ""ASSET"" we have, but duplicate.
- ""AUSET"" not word.
- ""AWSET"" not word.

For A S X E T:
- ""ASBET"" not word.
- ""ASDET"" D excluded.
- ""ASFET"" not word.
- ""ASGET"" not.
- ""ASHET"" -> H? ""ashET"" not word? ""Ashet"" is a word? I think not common. 
- ""ASKET"" -> K? ""asket"" not word? 
- ""ASMET"" not.
- ""ASNET"" N excluded.
- ""ASPET"" not word.
- ""ASRET"" R excluded.
- ""ASSET"" duplicate.
- ""ASTET"" duplicate T? T is at the end? ""astet"" not word.
- ""ASWET"" not.

So it seems ""ASSET"" is the only common word for Case 1.

But what about Case 2? We had trouble.

Another possibility: what if the fifth letter is at position1 or 5? But in our cases, we have A and T at 1 and 5.

But we must consider that the fifth letter could be at position1 or 5, and A and T at the middle? But no, because we have constraints on A and T positions.

A can only be at 1 or 5, T at 1 or 5, and S at 2 or 3.

But if we put the fifth letter at position1, then A and T must be at 5 and the other at 2 or 3? But A cannot be at 2 or 3? We know A not at2,3,4. So A must be at1 or5. Similarly, T not at2,3, and 4 is taken, so T must be at1 or5.

Therefore, position1 and 5 must be occupied by A and T in some order, and the fifth letter must be at position2 or3, with S at the other.

So we are back to the two cases.

In Case 2, we need a word T X Y E A, with X and Y being S and a new letter.

For example, T S X E A or T X S E A.

But T S X E A: 
- ""TSA E A"" -> ""TSEA"" not 5. ""TSADE"" -> D excluded? ""TSADE"" is not common? And D excluded.
- ""TSK E A"" not word.
- ""TSP E A"" not.

T X S E A:
- ""TAS E A"" -> ""TASEA"" not word.
- ""TBS E A"" not.
- ""TCS E A"" not, C excluded.
- ""TDS E A"" D excluded.
- ""TES E A"" -> ""TESE A"" not. ""TESEA"" not word.
- ""TFS E A"" not.
- ""TGS E A"" not.
- ""THS E A"" -> ""THESA"" not word? ""Thesea"" is not a word.
- ""TIS E A"" not.
- ""TJS E A"" not.
- ""TKS E A"" not.
- ""TLS E A"" L excluded.
- ""TMS E A"" not.
- ""TNS E A"" N excluded.
- ""TOS E A"" -> ""TOSEA"" not word.
- ""TPS E A"" -> ""TPSEA"" not.
- ""TQS E A"" not.
- ""TRS E A"" R excluded.
- ""TSS E A"" duplicate S? ""TSSEA"" not word.
- ""TTS E A"" duplicate T? not.
- ""TUS E A"" -> ""TUSEA"" not word.
- ""TVS E A"" not.
- ""TWS E A"" not.
- ""TXS E A"" not.
- ""TYS E A"" not.
- ""TZS E A"" not.

So no common words for Case 2.

Therefore, the only common word we have is ""ASSET"" for Case 1.

But we must consider that in ""ASSET"", we have S at position2 and S at position3. Is that consistent with feedback?

In guess2: we had ""steal"" with S at position1 -> we got S as '-' meaning S is in the word but not at1. That's satisfied because S is at2 and3.

In guess3: ""dates"" with S at position5 -> we got S as '-' meaning not at5. That's satisfied.

Also, for A: in ""ASSET"", A is at1. We have no feedback that A cannot be at1. We only know not at2,3,4.

Similarly for T: at5, and we know T not at2,3, and at5 is allowed.

E at4 is correct.

So ""ASSET"" seems to fit.

But we have to make sure about the duplicate S. The game allows duplicate letters, so it's possible.

Perhaps there is another word we missed.

What about ""AISLE""? But L excluded.

Or ""ASHES""? But H, and S duplicate? And E at5 not allowed? In ""ASHES"": A1,S2,H3,E4,S5? But E at4? That's good, but S at2 and S5? And we have S at5? But from guess3, S not at5? We got S as '-' in ""dates"" at position5, meaning S is not at5. So S cannot be at5. Therefore, ""ASHES"" has S at5, which is invalid.

Similarly, any word with S at5 is invalid.

In ""ASSET"", S is at2 and3, not at5, so that's okay.

Therefore, I think ""ASSET"" is the best guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""ASSET"":

- A: at position1. In previous guesses, we never had A at1, so we don't have direct feedback, but it's allowed.
- S: at2 and3. We have feedback that S is not at1 and not at5, so positions2 and3 are new and allowed.
- E: at4, which we know is correct.
- T: at5, which is allowed.

So it should be a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ASSET"".

But note: we are on guess4, and we have two more guesses if needed.

But if ""ASSET"" is correct, we win.

If not, we get more feedback.

So let's go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C, R, N: Not in the word (x).  
  - A: In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  
  - E: In the word but wrong position (not position 5).  
- **Guess 2: steal**  
  - S, T, E, A: In the word but wrong positions (S not position 1, T not position 2, E not position 3, A not position 4).  
  - L: Not in the word (x).  
- **Guess 3: dates**  
  - D: Not in the word (x).  
  - A: In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - T: In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  
  - E: Correct position (position 4) (✓).  
  - S: In the word but wrong position (not position 5).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  
   - A, E, S, T are in the secret word.  
   - E is fixed at **position 4** (from Guess 3's ✓).  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, N, L, D are not in the word.  

3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Must be in position 1 or 5.  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5. Must be in position 2 or 3.  
   - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by E).  
   - **E**: Fixed at position 4.  

4. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word has 5 letters: A, E, S, T, and one unknown letter (not C, R, N, L, D).  
   - E is at position 4.  
   - Two possible cases based on A and T positions:  
     - **Case 1**: A at position 1, T at position 5.  
     - **Case 2**: T at position 1, A at position 5.  
   - S must be at position 2 or 3, and the unknown letter fills the remaining position (2 or 3).  

5. **Evaluation of Cases**:  
   - **Case 1 (A at 1, T at 5)**: The word pattern is `A _ _ E T`.  
     - The middle positions (2 and 3) must be filled with S and the unknown letter.  
     - The only common English word fitting this pattern (with the unknown letter constraints) is **ASSET** (A at 1, S at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5).  
     - This uses duplicate S, which is allowed in Wordle rules.  
     - Validation:  
       - A at position 1 (allowed, not 2/3/4).  
       - S at positions 2 and 3 (allowed, not 1/5).  
       - E at position 4 (correct).  
       - T at position 5 (allowed, not 2/3).  
   - **Case 2 (T at 1, A at 5)**: The word pattern is `T _ _ E A`.  
     - No common English words fit this pattern without violating constraints (e.g., excluded letters or invalid positions).  

### Conclusion:
- **ASSET** is the only viable word that fits all constraints:  
  - Includes A, E, S, T.  
  - Avoids C, R, N, L, D.  
  - Respects all position rules (A at 1, S at 2/3, E at 4, T at 5).  
- If correct, this guess will solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will provide critical information to refine the next guess (e.g., confirming duplicate S or revealing the unknown letter).

<guess>asset</guess>",asset,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 1
- T: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 2
- E: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 3
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 4
- L: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""dates""
- D: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 2
- T: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 3
- E: ✓ (correct position) -> E is at position 4!
- S: - (in word, wrong position) -> not at position 5

So, from all the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains: A, E, S, T (and one more letter, since we have 5 letters and we know 4: A, E, S, T).
2. The secret word does NOT contain: C, R, N, L, D.
3. Position information:
   - E is at position 4 (from guess 3: E is correct at position 4).
   - A is not at position 2, 3, or 4 (from guess1: not 3; guess2: not 4; guess3: not 2).
   - Since A must be in the word and positions are 1,2,3,4,5, and we know not 2,3,4, so A must be at position 1 or 5.
   - S is not at position 1 (from guess2) and not at position 5 (from guess3). So S must be at position 2 or 3.
   - T is not at position 2 (from guess2) and not at position 3 (from guess3). So T must be at position 1 or 5? But note: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know T not at 2 and not at 3, so T can be at 1,4,5. But position 4 is taken by E (E is fixed at 4). So T cannot be at 4. Therefore, T must be at position 1 or 5.

But note: we have two letters that could be at position 1 or 5: A and T. And S must be at 2 or 3.

Also, the fifth letter is unknown, but we know it is not C,R,N,L,D.

Now, let's list the known constraints:

- Position 1: either A or T (since A can be 1 or 5, T can be 1 or 5, and they can't both be at 1, so one at 1 and the other at 5? Or one of them at 1 and the fifth letter at 5? But we have to assign all positions.)

Actually, the word has 5 positions:

Position 1: one of A, T, or the fifth letter? But we know A and T are in the word, and they must be placed. Also, S is in the word and must be at 2 or 3.

Let me denote the fifth letter as X (unknown).

The word: [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4] [P5]

We know:
- P4 = E (fixed)

Now, for A: must be at P1 or P5.
For T: must be at P1 or P5 (but not the same as A, unless duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so assume distinct for now).
For S: must be at P2 or P3.

But note: if A is at P1, then T must be at P5 (since P1 is taken and T cannot be at 2,3,4). Similarly, if T is at P1, then A must be at P5.

So two cases:

Case 1: P1 = A, P5 = T
Case 2: P1 = T, P5 = A

In both cases, we have:
- P2 and P3: one is S and the other is the fifth letter X.

But S must be at P2 or P3, and the remaining position (P2 or P3) is X.

Also, we know that from guess2, when we had ""steal"" (S at1, T at2, E at3, A at4, L at5), we got S, T, E, A all as '-' meaning they are in the word but not at those positions. We already used that to say S not at1, T not at2, E not at3, A not at4.

Similarly, in guess3, ""dates"" (D at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, S at5) we got A not at2, T not at3, E correct at4, S not at5.

Now, we need to find a word that fits one of the two cases and has a fifth letter that is not C,R,N,L,D.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: P1 = A, P5 = T
Then the word is: A [P2] [P3] E T
Where P2 and P3 are S and X (the unknown letter), in some order.

Case 2: P1 = T, P5 = A
Then the word is: T [P2] [P3] E A

We need to find valid English words for these patterns.

First, let's list possible words for Case 1: A _ _ E T
With the middle two positions being S and X (X not C,R,N,L,D).

Possible words:
- A B E T? -> ""ABET"" is 4 letters? We need 5: A _ _ E T, so two letters in the middle. ""ABET"" is 4, so not.
- 5-letter words: 
  - ""ASSET"" -> but S duplicate? And we have S at P2 and P3? But in ""ASSET"": A, S, S, E, T -> but we have two S's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in our feedback so far, we haven't seen duplicates, and we have 4 distinct letters (A,E,S,T) plus one more, so if the fifth letter is S, then duplicate S? But we have S in the word, so if the fifth letter is S, then duplicate. But we don't have evidence against duplicates.

But let's check: in ""ASSET"", we have A at1, S at2, S at3, E at4, T at5. 
But we know S must be at P2 or P3? Here it is at both? But that's possible? However, in our constraints, we have S in the word, and we are placing it at P2 and P3? But that would be two S's? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid assuming no duplicates until we have evidence.

But to be safe, let's consider both possibilities.

First, without duplicates: then the fifth letter is not S, so in Case 1: A X Y E T, where one of X or Y is S and the other is a new letter.

Similarly for Case 2.

But let's list actual words.

Case 1: A _ _ E T
Possible words:
- ""ABET"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""ABLET"" -> but L is excluded? L is not allowed.
- ""ACET"" not 5.
- ""ADEPT"" -> D is excluded? D is not allowed (from guess3, D is x).
- ""AFRET"" not a word.
- ""AGENT"" -> G, but N is excluded? N is not allowed.
- ""AHENT"" not word.
- ""AIERY"" not word.
- ""ALERT"" -> L excluded.
- ""AMEND"" -> M, but D excluded and N excluded? D and N are out.
- ""APERT"" -> P, but ""APERT"" is not common? Let me check: ""apert"" is not a standard word. 
- ""ARETT"" not word.
- ""ASPER"" -> R excluded.
- ""ASSET"" -> duplicate S? But let's consider: A,S,S,E,T. This has duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, S is already known to be in the word, so if we have two S, then it's okay? But in our feedback, we haven't encountered a duplicate yet.

But we can try to avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ASTER"" -> R excluded.

""ATOKE"" -> O, K? ""ATOKE"" is a word? Meaning a type of fish? But let's see: A,T,O,K,E -> but in our pattern A _ _ E T, so it would be A, T, O, E, T? That doesn't fit because the last letter is T, but we have T at the end? Pattern is A _ _ E T, so positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:T. So for ""ATOKE"": A1, T2, O3, K4, E5 -> but that doesn't match because E is at5? But we need E at4 and T at5. So not.

I think ""ASSET"" is a common word that fits: A1, S2, S3, E4, T5. But we have E at4 which is fixed, and T at5. And A at1. Now, check constraints for S: we have S at2 and S at3? But we know S must be in the word, and we have two S's? But we don't have feedback that says S is only one. So it's possible.

But in our constraints, we said S must be at position2 or 3? Here it is at both? That satisfies that it is at position2 and 3? But we only required that S is at one of 2 or 3? But if it is at both, that's fine? However, we also have the fifth letter? In ""ASSET"", the fifth letter is S? So the letters are A, S, E, T and the fifth is S? So duplicate S.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The game allows duplicate letters? In Wordle, duplicates are allowed.

But let's see the feedback: in previous guesses, we didn't have duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word can't have duplicates.

So ""ASSET"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it violates any feedback.

Check against feedback:
- A at1: we have no feedback that A cannot be at1? We only know A not at2,3,4. So at1 is allowed.
- S at2 and S at3: we know S not at1 and not at5? From guess2: S not at1, and guess3: S not at5. So S at2 and S at3 are allowed? But we don't have feedback on position2 and 3 for S? So it's okay.
- E at4: correct, as we know.
- T at5: we know T not at2 and not at3? But at5 is allowed? We have no feedback that T cannot be at5? Only that T not at2 and not at3. So T at5 is allowed.

Therefore, ""ASSET"" is a possible word.

But we also have Case 2: T at1 and A at5.

Case 2: T _ _ E A

Possible words: T ? ? E A

With the middle two being S and X.

Words:
- ""TABEA"" not word.
- ""TACET"" -> C excluded.
- ""TALEA"" -> L excluded.
- ""TAPET"" -> P, but duplicate T? ""TAPET"" is a word? Meaning a type of tapestry? But let's see: T,A,P,E,T -> duplicate T? And E at4, A at5? Pattern: T1, A2, P3, E4, T5? But we have T at1 and T at5? Duplicate T? And A at2? But we know A not at2? From guess3, A not at2. So invalid.

""TAREA"" -> R excluded.

""TASSE"" -> T1, A2, S3, S4, E5? But E5? We know E not at5? From guess1, E not at5. So invalid.

""TASTE"" -> T1, A2, S3, T4, E5? Duplicate T? And A at2? Not allowed (A not at2). Also E at5 not allowed.

""TATIE"" -> not common? And A at2 not allowed.

""TAXED"" -> X, D? T1, A2, X3, E4, D5? But A at2 not allowed? And D excluded.

""TEADE"" -> E at2? But we have E at4? And duplicate E? T1, E2, A3, D4, E5? But A at3 not allowed? And E at2 and E5? Also D excluded.

Not working.

""TENSE"" -> T1, E2, N3, S4, E5? But N excluded? And E at2 and E5? Also, we have E at4? Not matching pattern.

Another word: ""TERSE"" -> T1, E2, R3, S4, E5? R excluded, E at2 and E5? Not.

""TESTE"" -> duplicate T and E? T1, E2, S3, T4, E5? But E at2 and E5? And T at1 and T4? Also, E at5 not allowed.

I think Case 2 is harder to find words. So perhaps Case 1 is more likely.

But we have ""ASSET"" for Case 1.

But in ""ASSET"", we have duplicate S. Is that acceptable? Yes, because Wordle allows duplicate letters.

But we haven't tested for duplicates, so it's possible.

Are there other words for Case 1 without duplicates?

For example, A _ _ E T, with two different letters in the middle, one being S and the other a new letter.

So: A X S E T or A S X E T.

Where X is a new letter not in {C,R,N,L,D} and not A,E,S,T.

For A X S E T:
- ""ABSET"" not a word.
- ""ADSET"" -> D excluded.
- ""AESET"" duplicate E? Not.
- ""AFSET"" not word.
- ""AGSET"" not word.
- ""AISET"" not word.
- ""AKSET"" not word.
- ""AMSET"" -> M? ""amset"" not word? ""Anset"" not.
- ""ANSET"" -> N excluded.
- ""APSET"" not word.
- ""ARSET"" -> R excluded.
- ""ASSET"" we have, but duplicate.
- ""AUSET"" not word.
- ""AWSET"" not word.

For A S X E T:
- ""ASBET"" not word.
- ""ASDET"" D excluded.
- ""ASFET"" not word.
- ""ASGET"" not.
- ""ASHET"" -> H? ""ashET"" not word? ""Ashet"" is a word? I think not common. 
- ""ASKET"" -> K? ""asket"" not word? 
- ""ASMET"" not.
- ""ASNET"" N excluded.
- ""ASPET"" not word.
- ""ASRET"" R excluded.
- ""ASSET"" duplicate.
- ""ASTET"" duplicate T? T is at the end? ""astet"" not word.
- ""ASWET"" not.

So it seems ""ASSET"" is the only common word for Case 1.

But what about Case 2? We had trouble.

Another possibility: what if the fifth letter is at position1 or 5? But in our cases, we have A and T at 1 and 5.

But we must consider that the fifth letter could be at position1 or 5, and A and T at the middle? But no, because we have constraints on A and T positions.

A can only be at 1 or 5, T at 1 or 5, and S at 2 or 3.

But if we put the fifth letter at position1, then A and T must be at 5 and the other at 2 or 3? But A cannot be at 2 or 3? We know A not at2,3,4. So A must be at1 or5. Similarly, T not at2,3, and 4 is taken, so T must be at1 or5.

Therefore, position1 and 5 must be occupied by A and T in some order, and the fifth letter must be at position2 or3, with S at the other.

So we are back to the two cases.

In Case 2, we need a word T X Y E A, with X and Y being S and a new letter.

For example, T S X E A or T X S E A.

But T S X E A: 
- ""TSA E A"" -> ""TSEA"" not 5. ""TSADE"" -> D excluded? ""TSADE"" is not common? And D excluded.
- ""TSK E A"" not word.
- ""TSP E A"" not.

T X S E A:
- ""TAS E A"" -> ""TASEA"" not word.
- ""TBS E A"" not.
- ""TCS E A"" not, C excluded.
- ""TDS E A"" D excluded.
- ""TES E A"" -> ""TESE A"" not. ""TESEA"" not word.
- ""TFS E A"" not.
- ""TGS E A"" not.
- ""THS E A"" -> ""THESA"" not word? ""Thesea"" is not a word.
- ""TIS E A"" not.
- ""TJS E A"" not.
- ""TKS E A"" not.
- ""TLS E A"" L excluded.
- ""TMS E A"" not.
- ""TNS E A"" N excluded.
- ""TOS E A"" -> ""TOSEA"" not word.
- ""TPS E A"" -> ""TPSEA"" not.
- ""TQS E A"" not.
- ""TRS E A"" R excluded.
- ""TSS E A"" duplicate S? ""TSSEA"" not word.
- ""TTS E A"" duplicate T? not.
- ""TUS E A"" -> ""TUSEA"" not word.
- ""TVS E A"" not.
- ""TWS E A"" not.
- ""TXS E A"" not.
- ""TYS E A"" not.
- ""TZS E A"" not.

So no common words for Case 2.

Therefore, the only common word we have is ""ASSET"" for Case 1.

But we must consider that in ""ASSET"", we have S at position2 and S at position3. Is that consistent with feedback?

In guess2: we had ""steal"" with S at position1 -> we got S as '-' meaning S is in the word but not at1. That's satisfied because S is at2 and3.

In guess3: ""dates"" with S at position5 -> we got S as '-' meaning not at5. That's satisfied.

Also, for A: in ""ASSET"", A is at1. We have no feedback that A cannot be at1. We only know not at2,3,4.

Similarly for T: at5, and we know T not at2,3, and at5 is allowed.

E at4 is correct.

So ""ASSET"" seems to fit.

But we have to make sure about the duplicate S. The game allows duplicate letters, so it's possible.

Perhaps there is another word we missed.

What about ""AISLE""? But L excluded.

Or ""ASHES""? But H, and S duplicate? And E at5 not allowed? In ""ASHES"": A1,S2,H3,E4,S5? But E at4? That's good, but S at2 and S5? And we have S at5? But from guess3, S not at5? We got S as '-' in ""dates"" at position5, meaning S is not at5. So S cannot be at5. Therefore, ""ASHES"" has S at5, which is invalid.

Similarly, any word with S at5 is invalid.

In ""ASSET"", S is at2 and3, not at5, so that's okay.

Therefore, I think ""ASSET"" is the best guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""ASSET"":

- A: at position1. In previous guesses, we never had A at1, so we don't have direct feedback, but it's allowed.
- S: at2 and3. We have feedback that S is not at1 and not at5, so positions2 and3 are new and allowed.
- E: at4, which we know is correct.
- T: at5, which is allowed.

So it should be a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ASSET"".

But note: we are on guess4, and we have two more guesses if needed.

But if ""ASSET"" is correct, we win.

If not, we get more feedback.

So let's go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C, R, N: Not in the word (x).  
  - A: In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  
  - E: In the word but wrong position (not position 5).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  
   - A, E, S, T are in the secret word.  
   - E is fixed at **position 4** (from Guess 3's ✓).  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, N, L, D are not in the word.  

3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Must be in position 1 or 5.  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5. Must be in position 2 or 3.  
   - **T**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by E).

4. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word has 5 letters: A, E, S, T, and one unknown letter (not C, R, N, L, D).  
   - E is at position 4.  
   - Two possible cases based on A and T positions:  
     - **Case 1**: A at position 1, T at position 5.  
     - **Case 2**: T at position 1, A at position 5.  
   - S must be at position 2 or 3, and the unknown letter fills the remaining position (2 or 3).  

5. **Evaluation of Cases**:  
   - **Case 1 (A at 1, T at 5)**: The word pattern is `A _ _ E T`.  
     - The middle positions (2 and 3) must be filled with S and the unknown letter.  
     - The only common English word fitting this pattern (with the unknown letter constraints) is **ASSET** (A at 1, S at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5).  
     - This uses duplicate S, which is allowed in Wordle rules.  
     - Validation:  
       - A at position 1 (allowed, not 2/3/4).

       - E at position 4 (correct).  
       - T at position 5 (allowed, not 2/3).  
   - **Case 2 (T at 1, A at 5)**: The word pattern is `T _ _ E A`.  
     - No common English words fit this pattern without violating constraints (e.g., excluded letters or invalid positions).  

### Conclusion:
- **ASSET** is the only viable word that fits all constraints:  
  - Includes A, E, S, T.  
  - Avoids C, R, N, L, D.  
  - Respects all position rules (A at 1, S at 2/3, E at 4, T at 5).  
- If correct, this guess will solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will provide critical information to refine the next guess (e.g., confirming duplicate S or revealing the unknown letter).",Guess 4: asset -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
