We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so a good first guess should aim to cover common letters and positions.
 I recall that in word games like Wordle, a good starting strategy is to use a word with common letters and minimal repeated letters.
 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. Something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" could be good.

 However, note that the feedback will help us eliminate or confirm letters. To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters.

 After considering, I think ""CRATE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, T, E – which are common letters.

 But wait, the example word was ""BRISK"" and the example guess was ""STORM"", so let's stick to common practice.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a word meaning the profit from land, but it's obscure) is sometimes used by enthusiasts for its letter frequency. However, I want to stick to common words.

 Instead, I'll go with ""SLATE"". This word has S, L, A, T, E – all common. Also, it includes a vowel (A and E) and common consonants.

 Another popular choice is ""CRANE"", which also has five distinct letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess: CRANE
</think>
<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's advantageous to choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The word should have a mix of vowels and consonants that frequently appear in 5-letter English words. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:

- It contains two common vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are unique, so feedback will provide clear information about each letter.
- It covers more frequent letters compared to other starters like random words with rare letters.
- After this guess, feedback (✓, -, x) will reveal which letters are correct, misplaced, or absent, helping to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

The game rules require a valid 5-letter English word, and ""CRANE"" is valid.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 3).

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position (not position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for A: We know it's not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common vowels and consonants. Since we know A is present, we can focus on other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants (like S, T, L, D, etc.).

Let's think of words that have A in a different position and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example, we can try:
- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", etc.
- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", ""SAUCE"", but note we must avoid C and E? ""SAUCE"" has C and E which are excluded. So not good.
- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"", but N is excluded. ""PLATE"" has E and T? But E is excluded. So we need to avoid E.
- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common, or ""AROMA"", but we have to avoid R? R is excluded.

We must avoid C, R, N, E. So the word cannot have any of these.

Let me list some common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y.

We know A is in the word, so we should include A and also try to test other common letters.

I think a good strategy is to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct there, and then use other common letters.

For example, let's try ""ALOUD"":
- A in position 1: if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - or if absent? But we know A is present, so it must be either ✓ or -.
- L, O, U, D are new letters.

But ""ALOUD"" has A in position 1, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, we can try ""SALAD"", but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, we want to maximize information, so distinct letters are better.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" but it has A in position 2 and 5? And we avoid R, N, E, C? ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we have to avoid R, N, E, C? It doesn't have those, so it's okay. But it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we know A is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

But using a word with two A's might not be efficient because if one A is marked, we don't know which one. However, the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So, let's try to find a word with A in a new position and four other new letters.

Possible words:
- A in position 1: AUDIO (but O is a vowel, and we get to test A, U, D, I, O). But note: we have to avoid R, N, E, C? AUDIO has A, U, D, I, O. None of the excluded letters. So that's good.

- A in position 2: We can try ""BAYOU"" but that's not very common. Or ""HABIT"", which has H, A, B, I, T. That avoids the excluded letters.

- A in position 4: ""PLAIT"" but it has T and I, but also avoid excluded? PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T. No excluded letters.

- A in position 5: ""MANGA"" has N and we know N is excluded. Not good. ""GUAVA"" has V, but also two A's? And we avoid excluded? G, U, A, V, A. No excluded, but two A's.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in position 1 (which we haven't tested, and we know A is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4,5).
- It introduces four new vowels and consonants: U, D, I, O. Since we don't know about these, it's good to test them.

But note: the secret word might not have these, but we need to test common letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with more common consonants. For example, ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y. But A is in position 2? And we avoid excluded? S, A, L, T, Y: no C, R, N, E. So that's also good.

But in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2, which is a new position.

We have two good options: ""AUDIO"" and ""SALTY"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a bit heavy on vowels, and we might want to test some consonants. But it's acceptable.

Another word: ""PAINT"" has N, which is excluded. Not good.

""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S. A in position 2? And no excluded letters. That's also good.

But ""LAMPS"" has A in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests multiple vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A), and we can get information about other vowels.

So, next guess: AUDIO

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but is it here? We'll see)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: O

We avoid C, R, N, E.

So, this is a valid guess.

After this, we'll get feedback on each letter.

Alternatively, if we want to test more consonants, ""SALTY"" is also good. But I think ""AUDIO"" is fine.

I recall that in Wordle, after knowing A is present, testing other vowels is important.

So, I'll go with ""AUDIO"".
</think>
<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with -).

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent, so the new guess must avoid these.
3. For the second guess, prioritize:
   - Including A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
   - Introducing new common letters to gather more information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L or vowels like O, I, U).
   - Avoiding repeated letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- ""AUDIO"" was considered (A in position 1), but it focuses heavily on vowels and may not test enough consonants.
- ""SALTY"" (A in position 2) is a strong alternative, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and avoids excluded letters. It also tests A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions.

Chose ""SALTY"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new, untested position).
- It introduces S, L, T, Y—all common letters not yet evaluated.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word with no repeated letters or excluded characters (C, R, N, E).
- This guess will provide feedback on A's position and the presence of S, L, T, Y, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly.
</thought>

<guess>SALTY</guess>",SALTY,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 3).

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common, or ""AROMA"", but we have to avoid R? R is excluded.

We must avoid C, R, N, E. So the word cannot have any of these.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so a good first guess should aim to cover common letters and positions.
 I recall that in word games like Wordle, a good starting strategy is to use a word with common letters and minimal repeated letters.
 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. Something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" could be good.

 However, note that the feedback will help us eliminate or confirm letters. To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters.

 After considering, I think ""CRATE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, T, E – which are common letters.

 But wait, the example word was ""BRISK"" and the example guess was ""STORM"", so let's stick to common practice.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a word meaning the profit from land, but it's obscure) is sometimes used by enthusiasts for its letter frequency. However, I want to stick to common words.

 Instead, I'll go with ""SLATE"". This word has S, L, A, T, E – all common. Also, it includes a vowel (A and E) and common consonants.

 Another popular choice is ""CRANE"", which also has five distinct letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess: CRANE<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's advantageous to choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The word should have a mix of vowels and consonants that frequently appear in 5-letter English words. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:

- It contains two common vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are unique, so feedback will provide clear information about each letter.
- It covers more frequent letters compared to other starters like random words with rare letters.
- After this guess, feedback (✓, -, x) will reveal which letters are correct, misplaced, or absent, helping to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

The game rules require a valid 5-letter English word, and ""CRANE"" is valid.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 3).

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position (not position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for A: We know it's not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common vowels and consonants. Since we know A is present, we can focus on other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants (like S, T, L, D, etc.).

Let's think of words that have A in a different position and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example, we can try:
- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", etc.
- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", ""SAUCE"", but note we must avoid C and E? ""SAUCE"" has C and E which are excluded. So not good.
- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"", but N is excluded. ""PLATE"" has E and T? But E is excluded. So we need to avoid E.
- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common, or ""AROMA"", but we have to avoid R? R is excluded.

We must avoid C, R, N, E. So the word cannot have any of these.

Let me list some common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y.

We know A is in the word, so we should include A and also try to test other common letters.

I think a good strategy is to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct there, and then use other common letters.

For example, let's try ""ALOUD"":
- A in position 1: if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - or if absent? But we know A is present, so it must be either ✓ or -.
- L, O, U, D are new letters.

But ""ALOUD"" has A in position 1, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, we can try ""SALAD"", but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, we want to maximize information, so distinct letters are better.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" but it has A in position 2 and 5? And we avoid R, N, E, C? ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we have to avoid R, N, E, C? It doesn't have those, so it's okay. But it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we know A is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

But using a word with two A's might not be efficient because if one A is marked, we don't know which one. However, the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So, let's try to find a word with A in a new position and four other new letters.

Possible words:
- A in position 1: AUDIO (but O is a vowel, and we get to test A, U, D, I, O). But note: we have to avoid R, N, E, C? AUDIO has A, U, D, I, O. None of the excluded letters. So that's good.

- A in position 2: We can try ""BAYOU"" but that's not very common. Or ""HABIT"", which has H, A, B, I, T. That avoids the excluded letters.

- A in position 4: ""PLAIT"" but it has T and I, but also avoid excluded? PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T. No excluded letters.

- A in position 5: ""MANGA"" has N and we know N is excluded. Not good. ""GUAVA"" has V, but also two A's? And we avoid excluded? G, U, A, V, A. No excluded, but two A's.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in position 1 (which we haven't tested, and we know A is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4,5).
- It introduces four new vowels and consonants: U, D, I, O. Since we don't know about these, it's good to test them.

But note: the secret word might not have these, but we need to test common letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with more common consonants. For example, ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y. But A is in position 2? And we avoid excluded? S, A, L, T, Y: no C, R, N, E. So that's also good.

But in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2, which is a new position.

We have two good options: ""AUDIO"" and ""SALTY"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a bit heavy on vowels, and we might want to test some consonants. But it's acceptable.

Another word: ""PAINT"" has N, which is excluded. Not good.

""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S. A in position 2? And no excluded letters. That's also good.

But ""LAMPS"" has A in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests multiple vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A), and we can get information about other vowels.

So, next guess: AUDIO

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but is it here? We'll see)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: O

We avoid C, R, N, E.

So, this is a valid guess.

After this, we'll get feedback on each letter.

Alternatively, if we want to test more consonants, ""SALTY"" is also good. But I think ""AUDIO"" is fine.

I recall that in Wordle, after knowing A is present, testing other vowels is important.

So, I'll go with ""AUDIO"".<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with -).

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent, so the new guess must avoid these.
3. For the second guess, prioritize:
   - Including A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
   - Introducing new common letters to gather more information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L or vowels like O, I, U).
   - Avoiding repeated letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- ""AUDIO"" was considered (A in position 1), but it focuses heavily on vowels and may not test enough consonants.
- ""SALTY"" (A in position 2) is a strong alternative, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and avoids excluded letters. It also tests A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions.

Chose ""SALTY"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new, untested position).
- It introduces S, L, T, Y—all common letters not yet evaluated.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word with no repeated letters or excluded characters (C, R, N, E).
- This guess will provide feedback on A's position and the presence of S, L, T, Y, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly.

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in CRANE it was position 3).

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(x), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S, L, Y are NOT in the word.
- A is again marked as ""wrong position"" (-). Since in SALTY, A is in position 2, this means A is in the word but not in position 2. Previously from CRANE, we know A is not in position 3. So A could be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is marked as ""wrong position"" (-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in SALTY, T is in position 4).

So, combining all we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (all marked x in both guesses).
Present letters (wrong position): A and T.

We know:
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4. So T could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 1, 4, and 5 are the only possibilities for A. T cannot be in the same position as A if that position is occupied, but we don't know the positions yet.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to think of a new guess that:
- Includes A (since we know it's present) and places it in one of the untried positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note, we don't know which position is correct, so we might want to test a word that puts A in a new position and also tests T in a new position.
- Includes T (since T is present, but not in position 4) and places it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But we should avoid position 4 for T (already tried).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So, the available letters are all except: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

We can use: A, T, and any other letters not in the absent list. For example: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We also need to form a valid English word.

Now, let's consider possibilities for A's position:

- If A is in position 1: then words like A _ _ _ _
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Similarly for T, which must be in the word but not in position 4.

Since we have T as a present letter, and A as present, we should try a word that includes both A and T, and positions them in new spots.

Also, we want to introduce new letters to get more information.

Available positions:
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3. So in the next guess, we might try A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T cannot be in position 4, so in the next guess, we should avoid putting T in position 4.

Let's brainstorm words:

First, try A in position 1: A _ _ _ _
We need to avoid C,R,N,E,S,L,Y. Common words: 
- ABATE? But E is excluded. Not possible.
- ADAPT? D is allowed, P and T. But we have T available. ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T - but has two A's? Also, positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But we know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback says A is present but not in position 2 or 3? Wait, from Guess 2: SALTY has A in position 2, marked wrong; from CRANE in position 3, marked wrong. So A can be in position 1,4,5. In ADAPT, we have A in positions 1 and 3. But position 3 is forbidden? We must avoid A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So having A in position 3 in a guess will result in x or -? But we know A is present, so if we put A in a wrong position, it will be -. But we don't want to put A in forbidden positions to save a guess? Actually, we can do that to test, but it's inefficient.

Better to avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 in our next guess because we know it's not there. So for a word that starts with A, we don't put A again in pos 3? In ADAPT, we have two A's: first at pos1 and third at pos3. But pos3 is known to be incorrect for A, so we wouldn't put A there if we can help it.

So let's avoid words that have A in position 3. Similarly, avoid position 2 for A.

So for A in position 1: 
- Words like: A D O P T? But D,O,P,T. But ""ADOPT"" is a word: A,D,O,P,T. Positions: A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5). This avoids A in positions 2 and 3? Position 3 is O, not A. This is fine. Moreover, D,O,P,T are new letters.

But note, T is in position 5. We know T is present, and we haven't tried T in position 5? In SALTY, T was in position 4 (which was wrong). So T in pos5 is new.

Also, in this word, A is in pos1 and T in pos5.

But we need to check if T can be in position 5? Yes, possible.

Another idea: A in position 4? Words like _ _ _ A _
For example: with T, say ...T.A? Or something.

First, let's list some words:

Option 1: A in pos 1: ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T)
- Puts A in pos 1, T in pos 5.
- Tests D, O, P.

Option 2: A in pos 5: words ending with A, and including T.
For example: P I T A ? But we need to avoid S,L, etc. ""MORTA""? No, ""DEOTA""? No. Common words: ""DATA""? But D,A,T,A (two A's) and positions: D(1),A(2),T(3),A(4). But A in pos2? We know A is not in pos2, so if we put an A in pos2, it will be marked x? No, the feedback will mark each letter individually. But we know that A cannot be in pos2, so if we put A in pos2, it will be incorrect and thus not present? Actually, the A is present elsewhere, but in this word, we have two A's. The secret word has at least one A, but if we put an A in pos2, and the secret A is in pos4, then for pos2 we might get x because it's not the right position? Or could it be marked with -? Only if the secret word has another A in a different position? But we don't know how many A's.

This might be messy. Let's avoid duplicated letters for clarity? So stick to words with unique letters if possible.

But ADOPT has unique letters.

Another word with A in pos5: ""OUT A""? No. ""HOOTA""? Not word. How about ""HAV TA""? No. It's hard to find words ending with A.

Let's go to A in pos4: words like _ _ _ A _
For example: include T? T could be in pos1,2,3, or5.

Word: ...A.
Try ""DRAFT"": but R is excluded? No, R is absent.
""GRAFT"": R absent? Yes, R excluded.
""SHALT"": H,A,L,T. But L is excluded? Yes, L is absent, so S is absent? We need to avoid L.

We cannot use L.

What word? ""BAG T A""? Hard.

Word: OPT A? But positions: O,P,T,A,? Not easy.

Perhaps ""A in pos1"" is easier.

Alternative to ADOPT: ""ADMIT""? D,M,I,T. But has A in pos1? And we avoid excluded? A,D,M,I,T. Letters not excluded: yes. But wait: in ADMIT, M is new, I and T? T is known present.

ADMIT: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5). This places T in position 5.

Another: ""AUDIT""? But U,D,I,T. But we used U in AUDIO? No, we didn't. In second guess we used SALTY, not AUDIO.

ADMIT and AUDIT both end with T.

But in ADMIT: we have A in 1, T in 5.

Similarly, AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T. Also ends T.

But note: I is a new letter.

We also need to consider whether we can put T in position 1,2,3? But for now, let's pick a word that might help.

Since we don't know A's position, we can pick a word that uses A in a position we haven't tried: pos1,4,5. We tried pos2 and 3 already? In CRANE, A was pos3; in SALTY, A was pos2. So we haven't tried A in pos1,4, or5.

Similarly for T: only tried in pos4 (in SALTY which was wrong). So we haven't tested T in pos1,2,3,5.

To kill two birds with one stone, we can try a word with A in pos1 and T in pos5? Then the feedback for A will tell if it's in pos1. Similarly, T in pos5 will tell if it's there.

So options: ADOPT, ADMIT, AUDIT, etc.

Also, we can try A in pos4 and T in another position? But let's start with A in pos1.

Another word: ""APT LY""? Not a word. How about ""ATOM""? But 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

ADOPT: A, D, O, P, T -> letters: D,O,P,T (new)

ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> letters: D,M,I,T

AUDIT: A, U, D, I, T

Which one to choose?

We should choose one with common letters to maximize information.

Also, avoid letters that might be rare.

I think ADOPT is fine, but P is less common? Not sure.

Another common word: ""ARGON"" but ""R"" is excluded.

Cannot.

How about ""ABOUT""? But O,U,T. A,B,O,U,T. Avoid absent? A in pos1, B in pos2, O pos3, U pos4, T pos5. But ""B"" is new, O and U also. But we avoid excluded: no C,R,N,E,S,L,Y? Yes.

B is common? ABOUT is a valid word.

So we have ABOUT, ADOPT, AUDIT, etc.

But note that in ABOUT, T is in pos5, same as our plan.

Similarly, AUDIT has T in pos5.

Alternatively, to test T in a different position? But pos5 is fine.

We also need to consider that if A is not in pos1, then we'll know A must be in pos4 or 5.

Similarly, if T is not in pos5, then T must be in pos1,2,3.

I think both ABOUT and ADOPT are reasonable.

Let me choose AUDIT? Because it has U and I, which are vowels we haven't tested? But U and I might be less common? Not sure.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P are available.

ABOUT has B and U.

ADOPT has D,P,O.

I think I'll go with ABOUT: letters A,B,O,U,T. All new except A and T.

Feedback will give:
- For A in pos1: ✓ if present and correct, or - if in word but wrong position? If - it would mean A is elsewhere but we know it's present. Actually, if A is not in pos1, it might be in pos4 or5, and we'll get - for A in pos1? Then we'll get feedback on other letters.

Similarly for T in pos5.

The word ABOUT:

- Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

After guessing, we get feedback per position.

But note: we know A is present and T is present, so if we put A in pos1 and it's wrong, it will be -, same for T in pos5.

But that's okay.

I think ABOUT is a good word.

Given the constraints, let's pick ABOUT.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

- **Key Insights from Previous Feedback:**  
  - From Guess 1 (CRANE): We know A is present but not in position 3. Letters C, R, N, and E are absent.  
  - From Guess 2 (SALTY): We know A is present but not in position 2 (since it was marked wrong position). Also, T is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, and Y are absent.  
  - Combining this:  
    - **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5** (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
    - **T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5** (position 4 is ruled out).  
    - **Absent letters:** C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (cannot be used in the new guess).  
    - **Present letters:** A and T (must appear in the new guess).  

- **Strategy for the Next Guess:**  
  - The guess must include both A and T to confirm their positions.  
  - Test A in a new untried position (position 1, 4, or 5) and T in a new untried position (position 1, 2, 3, or 5). Avoid positions that have been ruled out.  
  - Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Since vowels/consonants like O, U, B, D, M are not yet tested and not excluded, they are good candidates.  
  - Avoid repeated or absent letters for clarity.  
  - Prioritize words where A is placed in position 1 (to test if it is correct) and T in position 5 (to test if it fits). This helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.  

- **Word Selection:**  
  - Words considered:  
    - **ABOUT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: B, O, U (common and not excluded).  
    - **ADOPT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: D, O, P.  
    - **AUDIT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: U, D, I.  
  - **Choice Rationale**: ""ABOUT"" is selected because:  
    - It tests A in a new position (1) and T in a new position (5).  
    - It introduces high-frequency letters like B, O, and U, maximizing information gain.  
    - It is a common, valid 5-letter word.  
    - Feedback will clearly indicate:  
      - If A is indeed in position 1 (✓/–).  
      - If T is in position 5 (✓/–).  
      - Presence/absence of B, O, U.  

This guess aligns with accumulating maximum information while adhering to known constraints.

<guess>ABOUT</guess>",ABOUT,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in CRANE it was position 3).

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(x), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S, L, Y are NOT in the word.
- A is again marked as ""wrong position"" (-). Since in SALTY, A is in position 2, this means A is in the word but not in position 2. Previously from CRANE, we know A is not in position 3. So A could be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is marked as ""wrong position"" (-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in SALTY, T is in position 4).

So, combining all we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (all marked x in both guesses).
Present letters (wrong position): A and T.

We know:
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4. So T could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 1, 4, and 5 are the only possibilities for A. T cannot be in the same position as A if that position is occupied, but we don't know the positions yet.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to think of a new guess that:
- Includes A (since we know it's present) and places it in one of the untried positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note, we don't know which position is correct, so we might want to test a word that puts A in a new position and also tests T in a new position.
- Includes T (since T is present, but not in position 4) and places it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But we should avoid position 4 for T (already tried).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So, the available letters are all except: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

We can use: A, T, and any other letters not in the absent list. For example: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We also need to form a valid English word.

Now, let's consider possibilities for A's position:

- If A is in position 1: then words like A _ _ _ _
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Similarly for T, which must be in the word but not in position 4.

Since we have T as a present letter, and A as present, we should try a word that includes both A and T, and positions them in new spots.

Also, we want to introduce new letters to get more information.

Available positions:
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3. So in the next guess, we might try A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T cannot be in position 4, so in the next guess, we should avoid putting T in position 4.

Let's brainstorm words:

First, try A in position 1: A _ _ _ _
We need to avoid C,R,N,E,S,L,Y. Common words: 
- ABATE? But E is excluded. Not possible.
- ADAPT? D is allowed, P and T. But we have T available. ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T - but has two A's? Also, positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But we know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback says A is present but not in position 2 or 3? Wait, from Guess 2: SALTY has A in position 2, marked wrong; from CRANE in position 3, marked wrong. So A can be in position 1,4,5. In ADAPT, we have A in positions 1 and 3. But position 3 is forbidden? We must avoid A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So having A in position 3 in a guess will result in x or -? But we know A is present, so if we put A in a wrong position, it will be -. But we don't want to put A in forbidden positions to save a guess? Actually, we can do that to test, but it's inefficient.

Better to avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 in our next guess because we know it's not there. So for a word that starts with A, we don't put A again in pos 3? In ADAPT, we have two A's: first at pos1 and third at pos3. But pos3 is known to be incorrect for A, so we wouldn't put A there if we can help it.

So let's avoid words that have A in position 3. Similarly, avoid position 2 for A.

So for A in position 1: 
- Words like: A D O P T? But D,O,P,T. But ""ADOPT"" is a word: A,D,O,P,T. Positions: A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5). This avoids A in positions 2 and 3? Position 3 is O, not A. This is fine. Moreover, D,O,P,T are new letters.

But note, T is in position 5. We know T is present, and we haven't tried T in position 5? In SALTY, T was in position 4 (which was wrong). So T in pos5 is new.

Also, in this word, A is in pos1 and T in pos5.

But we need to check if T can be in position 5? Yes, possible.

Another idea: A in position 4? Words like _ _ _ A _
For example: with T, say ...T.A? Or something.

First, let's list some words:

Option 1: A in pos 1: ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T)
- Puts A in pos 1, T in pos 5.
- Tests D, O, P.

Option 2: A in pos 5: words ending with A, and including T.
For example: P I T A ? But we need to avoid S,L, etc. ""MORTA""? No, ""DEOTA""? No. Common words: ""DATA""? But D,A,T,A (two A's) and positions: D(1),A(2),T(3),A(4). But A in pos2? We know A is not in pos2, so if we put an A in pos2, it will be marked x? No, the feedback will mark each letter individually. But we know that A cannot be in pos2, so if we put A in pos2, it will be incorrect and thus not present? Actually, the A is present elsewhere, but in this word, we have two A's. The secret word has at least one A, but if we put an A in pos2, and the secret A is in pos4, then for pos2 we might get x because it's not the right position? Or could it be marked with -? Only if the secret word has another A in a different position? But we don't know how many A's.

This might be messy. Let's avoid duplicated letters for clarity? So stick to words with unique letters if possible.

But ADOPT has unique letters.

Another word with A in pos5: ""OUT A""? No. ""HOOTA""? Not word. How about ""HAV TA""? No. It's hard to find words ending with A.

Let's go to A in pos4: words like _ _ _ A _
For example: include T? T could be in pos1,2,3, or5.

Word: ...A.
Try ""DRAFT"": but R is excluded? No, R is absent.
""GRAFT"": R absent? Yes, R excluded.
""SHALT"": H,A,L,T. But L is excluded? Yes, L is absent, so S is absent? We need to avoid L.

We cannot use L.

What word? ""BAG T A""? Hard.

Word: OPT A? But positions: O,P,T,A,? Not easy.

Perhaps ""A in pos1"" is easier.

Alternative to ADOPT: ""ADMIT""? D,M,I,T. But has A in pos1? And we avoid excluded? A,D,M,I,T. Letters not excluded: yes. But wait: in ADMIT, M is new, I and T? T is known present.

ADMIT: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5). This places T in position 5.

Another: ""AUDIT""? But U,D,I,T. But we used U in AUDIO? No, we didn't. In second guess we used SALTY, not AUDIO.

ADMIT and AUDIT both end with T.

But in ADMIT: we have A in 1, T in 5.

Similarly, AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T. Also ends T.

But note: I is a new letter.

We also need to consider whether we can put T in position 1,2,3? But for now, let's pick a word that might help.

Since we don't know A's position, we can pick a word that uses A in a position we haven't tried: pos1,4,5. We tried pos2 and 3 already? In CRANE, A was pos3; in SALTY, A was pos2. So we haven't tried A in pos1,4, or5.

Similarly for T: only tried in pos4 (in SALTY which was wrong). So we haven't tested T in pos1,2,3,5.

To kill two birds with one stone, we can try a word with A in pos1 and T in pos5? Then the feedback for A will tell if it's in pos1. Similarly, T in pos5 will tell if it's there.

So options: ADOPT, ADMIT, AUDIT, etc.

Also, we can try A in pos4 and T in another position? But let's start with A in pos1.

Another word: ""APT LY""? Not a word. How about ""ATOM""? But 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

ADOPT: A, D, O, P, T -> letters: D,O,P,T (new)

ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> letters: D,M,I,T

AUDIT: A, U, D, I, T

Which one to choose?

We should choose one with common letters to maximize information.

Also, avoid letters that might be rare.

I think ADOPT is fine, but P is less common? Not sure.

Another common word: ""ARGON"" but ""R"" is excluded.

Cannot.

How about ""ABOUT""? But O,U,T. A,B,O,U,T. Avoid absent? A in pos1, B in pos2, O pos3, U pos4, T pos5. But ""B"" is new, O and U also. But we avoid excluded: no C,R,N,E,S,L,Y? Yes.

B is common? ABOUT is a valid word.

So we have ABOUT, ADOPT, AUDIT, etc.

But note that in ABOUT, T is in pos5, same as our plan.

Similarly, AUDIT has T in pos5.

Alternatively, to test T in a different position? But pos5 is fine.

We also need to consider that if A is not in pos1, then we'll know A must be in pos4 or 5.

Similarly, if T is not in pos5, then T must be in pos1,2,3.

I think both ABOUT and ADOPT are reasonable.

Let me choose AUDIT? Because it has U and I, which are vowels we haven't tested? But U and I might be less common? Not sure.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P are available.

ABOUT has B and U.

ADOPT has D,P,O.

I think I'll go with ABOUT: letters A,B,O,U,T. All new except A and T.

Feedback will give:
- For A in pos1: ✓ if present and correct, or - if in word but wrong position? If - it would mean A is elsewhere but we know it's present. Actually, if A is not in pos1, it might be in pos4 or5, and we'll get - for A in pos1? Then we'll get feedback on other letters.

Similarly for T in pos5.

The word ABOUT:

- Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

After guessing, we get feedback per position.

But note: we know A is present and T is present, so if we put A in pos1 and it's wrong, it will be -, same for T in pos5.

But that's okay.

I think ABOUT is a good word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so a good first guess should aim to cover common letters and positions.
 I recall that in word games like Wordle, a good starting strategy is to use a word with common letters and minimal repeated letters.
 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. Something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" could be good.

 However, note that the feedback will help us eliminate or confirm letters. To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters.

 After considering, I think ""CRATE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, T, E – which are common letters.

 But wait, the example word was ""BRISK"" and the example guess was ""STORM"", so let's stick to common practice.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a word meaning the profit from land, but it's obscure) is sometimes used by enthusiasts for its letter frequency. However, I want to stick to common words.

 Instead, I'll go with ""SLATE"". This word has S, L, A, T, E – all common. Also, it includes a vowel (A and E) and common consonants.

 Another popular choice is ""CRANE"", which also has five distinct letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess: CRANE<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's advantageous to choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The word should have a mix of vowels and consonants that frequently appear in 5-letter English words. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:

- It contains two common vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are unique, so feedback will provide clear information about each letter.
- It covers more frequent letters compared to other starters like random words with rare letters.
- After this guess, feedback (✓, -, x) will reveal which letters are correct, misplaced, or absent, helping to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

The game rules require a valid 5-letter English word, and ""CRANE"" is valid.
</thought>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 3).

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position (not position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for A: We know it's not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common vowels and consonants. Since we know A is present, we can focus on other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants (like S, T, L, D, etc.).

Let's think of words that have A in a different position and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example, we can try:
- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", etc.
- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", ""SAUCE"", but note we must avoid C and E? ""SAUCE"" has C and E which are excluded. So not good.
- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"", but N is excluded. ""PLATE"" has E and T? But E is excluded. So we need to avoid E.
- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common, or ""AROMA"", but we have to avoid R? R is excluded.

We must avoid C, R, N, E. So the word cannot have any of these.

Let me list some common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y.

We know A is in the word, so we should include A and also try to test other common letters.

I think a good strategy is to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct there, and then use other common letters.

For example, let's try ""ALOUD"":
- A in position 1: if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - or if absent? But we know A is present, so it must be either ✓ or -.
- L, O, U, D are new letters.

But ""ALOUD"" has A in position 1, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, we can try ""SALAD"", but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, we want to maximize information, so distinct letters are better.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" but it has A in position 2 and 5? And we avoid R, N, E, C? ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we have to avoid R, N, E, C? It doesn't have those, so it's okay. But it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we know A is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

But using a word with two A's might not be efficient because if one A is marked, we don't know which one. However, the feedback will show for each position.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So, let's try to find a word with A in a new position and four other new letters.

Possible words:
- A in position 1: AUDIO (but O is a vowel, and we get to test A, U, D, I, O). But note: we have to avoid R, N, E, C? AUDIO has A, U, D, I, O. None of the excluded letters. So that's good.

- A in position 2: We can try ""BAYOU"" but that's not very common. Or ""HABIT"", which has H, A, B, I, T. That avoids the excluded letters.

- A in position 4: ""PLAIT"" but it has T and I, but also avoid excluded? PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T. No excluded letters.

- A in position 5: ""MANGA"" has N and we know N is excluded. Not good. ""GUAVA"" has V, but also two A's? And we avoid excluded? G, U, A, V, A. No excluded, but two A's.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in position 1 (which we haven't tested, and we know A is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4,5).
- It introduces four new vowels and consonants: U, D, I, O. Since we don't know about these, it's good to test them.

But note: the secret word might not have these, but we need to test common letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with more common consonants. For example, ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y. But A is in position 2? And we avoid excluded? S, A, L, T, Y: no C, R, N, E. So that's also good.

But in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2, which is a new position.

We have two good options: ""AUDIO"" and ""SALTY"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a bit heavy on vowels, and we might want to test some consonants. But it's acceptable.

Another word: ""PAINT"" has N, which is excluded. Not good.

""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S. A in position 2? And no excluded letters. That's also good.

But ""LAMPS"" has A in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests multiple vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A), and we can get information about other vowels.

So, next guess: AUDIO

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but is it here? We'll see)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: O

We avoid C, R, N, E.

So, this is a valid guess.

After this, we'll get feedback on each letter.

Alternatively, if we want to test more consonants, ""SALTY"" is also good. But I think ""AUDIO"" is fine.

I recall that in Wordle, after knowing A is present, testing other vowels is important.

So, I'll go with ""AUDIO"".<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with -).

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, but it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent, so the new guess must avoid these.
3. For the second guess, prioritize:
   - Including A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
   - Introducing new common letters to gather more information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L or vowels like O, I, U).
   - Avoiding repeated letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options:
- ""AUDIO"" was considered (A in position 1), but it focuses heavily on vowels and may not test enough consonants.
- ""SALTY"" (A in position 2) is a strong alternative, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and avoids excluded letters. It also tests A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions.

Chose ""SALTY"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (a new, untested position).
- It introduces S, L, T, Y—all common letters not yet evaluated.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word with no repeated letters or excluded characters (C, R, N, E).
- This guess will provide feedback on A's position and the presence of S, L, T, Y, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly.

<guess>SALTY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in CRANE it was position 3).

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(x), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S, L, Y are NOT in the word.
- A is again marked as ""wrong position"" (-). Since in SALTY, A is in position 2, this means A is in the word but not in position 2. Previously from CRANE, we know A is not in position 3. So A could be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is marked as ""wrong position"" (-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in SALTY, T is in position 4).

So, combining all we know:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (all marked x in both guesses).
Present letters (wrong position): A and T.

We know:
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4. So T could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note: position 1, 4, and 5 are the only possibilities for A. T cannot be in the same position as A if that position is occupied, but we don't know the positions yet.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to think of a new guess that:
- Includes A (since we know it's present) and places it in one of the untried positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note, we don't know which position is correct, so we might want to test a word that puts A in a new position and also tests T in a new position.
- Includes T (since T is present, but not in position 4) and places it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But we should avoid position 4 for T (already tried).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So, the available letters are all except: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

We can use: A, T, and any other letters not in the absent list. For example: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We also need to form a valid English word.

Now, let's consider possibilities for A's position:

- If A is in position 1: then words like A _ _ _ _
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Similarly for T, which must be in the word but not in position 4.

Since we have T as a present letter, and A as present, we should try a word that includes both A and T, and positions them in new spots.

Also, we want to introduce new letters to get more information.

Available positions:
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3. So in the next guess, we might try A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T cannot be in position 4, so in the next guess, we should avoid putting T in position 4.

Let's brainstorm words:

First, try A in position 1: A _ _ _ _
We need to avoid C,R,N,E,S,L,Y. Common words: 
- ABATE? But E is excluded. Not possible.
- ADAPT? D is allowed, P and T. But we have T available. ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T - but has two A's? Also, positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But we know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback says A is present but not in position 2 or 3? Wait, from Guess 2: SALTY has A in position 2, marked wrong; from CRANE in position 3, marked wrong. So A can be in position 1,4,5. In ADAPT, we have A in positions 1 and 3. But position 3 is forbidden? We must avoid A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So having A in position 3 in a guess will result in x or -? But we know A is present, so if we put A in a wrong position, it will be -. But we don't want to put A in forbidden positions to save a guess? Actually, we can do that to test, but it's inefficient.

Better to avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 in our next guess because we know it's not there. So for a word that starts with A, we don't put A again in pos 3? In ADAPT, we have two A's: first at pos1 and third at pos3. But pos3 is known to be incorrect for A, so we wouldn't put A there if we can help it.

So let's avoid words that have A in position 3. Similarly, avoid position 2 for A.

So for A in position 1: 
- Words like: A D O P T? But D,O,P,T. But ""ADOPT"" is a word: A,D,O,P,T. Positions: A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5). This avoids A in positions 2 and 3? Position 3 is O, not A. This is fine. Moreover, D,O,P,T are new letters.

But note, T is in position 5. We know T is present, and we haven't tried T in position 5? In SALTY, T was in position 4 (which was wrong). So T in pos5 is new.

Also, in this word, A is in pos1 and T in pos5.

But we need to check if T can be in position 5? Yes, possible.

Another idea: A in position 4? Words like _ _ _ A _
For example: with T, say ...T.A? Or something.

First, let's list some words:

Option 1: A in pos 1: ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T)
- Puts A in pos 1, T in pos 5.
- Tests D, O, P.

Option 2: A in pos 5: words ending with A, and including T.
For example: P I T A ? But we need to avoid S,L, etc. ""MORTA""? No, ""DEOTA""? No. Common words: ""DATA""? But D,A,T,A (two A's) and positions: D(1),A(2),T(3),A(4). But A in pos2? We know A is not in pos2, so if we put an A in pos2, it will be marked x? No, the feedback will mark each letter individually. But we know that A cannot be in pos2, so if we put A in pos2, it will be incorrect and thus not present? Actually, the A is present elsewhere, but in this word, we have two A's. The secret word has at least one A, but if we put an A in pos2, and the secret A is in pos4, then for pos2 we might get x because it's not the right position? Or could it be marked with -? Only if the secret word has another A in a different position? But we don't know how many A's.

This might be messy. Let's avoid duplicated letters for clarity? So stick to words with unique letters if possible.

But ADOPT has unique letters.

Another word with A in pos5: ""OUT A""? No. ""HOOTA""? Not word. How about ""HAV TA""? No. It's hard to find words ending with A.

Let's go to A in pos4: words like _ _ _ A _
For example: include T? T could be in pos1,2,3, or5.

Word: ...A.
Try ""DRAFT"": but R is excluded? No, R is absent.
""GRAFT"": R absent? Yes, R excluded.
""SHALT"": H,A,L,T. But L is excluded? Yes, L is absent, so S is absent? We need to avoid L.

We cannot use L.

What word? ""BAG T A""? Hard.

Word: OPT A? But positions: O,P,T,A,? Not easy.

Perhaps ""A in pos1"" is easier.

Alternative to ADOPT: ""ADMIT""? D,M,I,T. But has A in pos1? And we avoid excluded? A,D,M,I,T. Letters not excluded: yes. But wait: in ADMIT, M is new, I and T? T is known present.

ADMIT: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5). This places T in position 5.

Another: ""AUDIT""? But U,D,I,T. But we used U in AUDIO? No, we didn't. In second guess we used SALTY, not AUDIO.

ADMIT and AUDIT both end with T.

But in ADMIT: we have A in 1, T in 5.

Similarly, AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T. Also ends T.

But note: I is a new letter.

We also need to consider whether we can put T in position 1,2,3? But for now, let's pick a word that might help.

Since we don't know A's position, we can pick a word that uses A in a position we haven't tried: pos1,4,5. We tried pos2 and 3 already? In CRANE, A was pos3; in SALTY, A was pos2. So we haven't tried A in pos1,4, or5.

Similarly for T: only tried in pos4 (in SALTY which was wrong). So we haven't tested T in pos1,2,3,5.

To kill two birds with one stone, we can try a word with A in pos1 and T in pos5? Then the feedback for A will tell if it's in pos1. Similarly, T in pos5 will tell if it's there.

So options: ADOPT, ADMIT, AUDIT, etc.

Also, we can try A in pos4 and T in another position? But let's start with A in pos1.

Another word: ""APT LY""? Not a word. How about ""ATOM""? But 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

ADOPT: A, D, O, P, T -> letters: D,O,P,T (new)

ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> letters: D,M,I,T

AUDIT: A, U, D, I, T

Which one to choose?

We should choose one with common letters to maximize information.

Also, avoid letters that might be rare.

I think ADOPT is fine, but P is less common? Not sure.

Another common word: ""ARGON"" but ""R"" is excluded.

Cannot.

How about ""ABOUT""? But O,U,T. A,B,O,U,T. Avoid absent? A in pos1, B in pos2, O pos3, U pos4, T pos5. But ""B"" is new, O and U also. But we avoid excluded: no C,R,N,E,S,L,Y? Yes.

B is common? ABOUT is a valid word.

So we have ABOUT, ADOPT, AUDIT, etc.

But note that in ABOUT, T is in pos5, same as our plan.

Similarly, AUDIT has T in pos5.

Alternatively, to test T in a different position? But pos5 is fine.

We also need to consider that if A is not in pos1, then we'll know A must be in pos4 or 5.

Similarly, if T is not in pos5, then T must be in pos1,2,3.

I think both ABOUT and ADOPT are reasonable.

Let me choose AUDIT? Because it has U and I, which are vowels we haven't tested? But U and I might be less common? Not sure.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P are available.

ABOUT has B and U.

ADOPT has D,P,O.

I think I'll go with ABOUT: letters A,B,O,U,T. All new except A and T.

Feedback will give:
- For A in pos1: ✓ if present and correct, or - if in word but wrong position? If - it would mean A is elsewhere but we know it's present. Actually, if A is not in pos1, it might be in pos4 or5, and we'll get - for A in pos1? Then we'll get feedback on other letters.

Similarly for T in pos5.

The word ABOUT:

- Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

After guessing, we get feedback per position.

But note: we know A is present and T is present, so if we put A in pos1 and it's wrong, it will be -, same for T in pos5.

But that's okay.

I think ABOUT is a good word.

Given the constraints, let's pick ABOUT.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

- **Key Insights from Previous Feedback:**  
  - From Guess 1 (CRANE): We know A is present but not in position 3. Letters C, R, N, and E are absent.  
  - From Guess 2 (SALTY): We know A is present but not in position 2 (since it was marked wrong position). Also, T is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, and Y are absent.  
  - Combining this:  
    - **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5** (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
    - **T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5** (position 4 is ruled out).  
    - **Absent letters:** C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (cannot be used in the new guess).  
    - **Present letters:** A and T (must appear in the new guess).  

- **Strategy for the Next Guess:**  
  - The guess must include both A and T to confirm their positions.  
  - Test A in a new untried position (position 1, 4, or 5) and T in a new untried position (position 1, 2, 3, or 5). Avoid positions that have been ruled out.  
  - Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Since vowels/consonants like O, U, B, D, M are not yet tested and not excluded, they are good candidates.  
  - Avoid repeated or absent letters for clarity.  
  - Prioritize words where A is placed in position 1 (to test if it is correct) and T in position 5 (to test if it fits). This helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.  

- **Word Selection:**  
  - Words considered:  
    - **ABOUT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: B, O, U (common and not excluded).  
    - **ADOPT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: D, O, P.  
    - **AUDIT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: U, D, I.  
  - **Choice Rationale**: ""ABOUT"" is selected because:  
    - It tests A in a new position (1) and T in a new position (5).  
    - It introduces high-frequency letters like B, O, and U, maximizing information gain.  
    - It is a common, valid 5-letter word.  
    - Feedback will clearly indicate:  
      - If A is indeed in position 1 (✓/–).  
      - If T is in position 5 (✓/–).  
      - Presence/absence of B, O, U.  

This guess aligns with accumulating maximum information while adhering to known constraints.

""SAUCE"" has C and E which are excluded. So not good.\n- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"", but N is excluded. ""PLATE"" has E and T? But E is excluded. So we need to avoid E.\n- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common, or ""AROMA"", but we have to avoid R? R is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.

But we know A is present, so it must be either ✓ or -.\n- L, O, U, D are new letters.\n\nBut ""ALOUD"" has A in position 1, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But it\'s possible. However, we want to maximize information, so distinct letters are better.\n\nAnother idea: ""PASTA"" but it has A in position 2 and 5? And we avoid R, N, E, C? ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we have to avoid R, N, E, C? It doesn\'t have those, so it\'s okay. But it has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Also, we know A is present, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice.\n\nBut using a word with two A\'s might not be efficient because if one A is marked, we don\'t know which one. However, the feedback will show for each position.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word with A in a new position and four other new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- A in position 1: AUDIO (but O is a vowel, and we get to test A, U, D, I, O). But note: we have to avoid R, N, E, C? AUDIO has A, U, D, I, O. None of the excluded letters. So that\'s good.\n\n- A in position 2: We can try ""BAYOU"" but that\'s not very common. Or ""HABIT"", which has H, A, B, I, T. That avoids the excluded letters.\n\n- A in position 4: ""PLAIT"" but it has T and I, but also avoid excluded? PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T. No excluded letters.\n\n- A in position 5: ""MANGA"" has N and we know N is excluded. Not good. ""GUAVA"" has V, but also two A\'s? And we avoid excluded? G, U, A, V, A. No excluded, but two A\'s.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because:\n- It has A in position 1 (which we haven\'t tested, and we know A is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4,5).\n- It introduces four new vowels and consonants: U, D, I, O. Since we don\'t know about these, it\'s good to test them.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not have these, but we need to test common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with more common consonants. For example, ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y. But A is in position 2? And we avoid excluded? S, A, L, T, Y: no C, R, N, E. So that\'s also good.\n\nBut in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2, which is a new position.\n\nWe have two good options: ""AUDIO"" and ""SALTY"".\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a bit heavy on vowels, and we might want to test some consonants. But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""PAINT"" has N, which is excluded. Not good.\n\n""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S. A in position 2? And no excluded letters. That\'s also good.\n\nBut ""LAMPS"" has A in position 2.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests multiple vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A), and we can get information about other vowels.\n\nSo, next guess: AUDIO\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but is it here? We\'ll see)\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: D\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: O\n\nWe avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, this is a valid guess.\n\nAfter this, we\'ll get feedback on each letter.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test more consonants, ""SALTY"" is also good. But I think ""AUDIO"" is fine.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, after knowing A is present, testing other vowels is important.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"".<thought>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with -).\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains the letter A, but it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).\n2. The letters C, R, N, E are absent, so the new guess must avoid these.\n3. For the second guess, prioritize:\n   - Including A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.\n   - Introducing new common letters to gather more information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L or vowels like O, I, U).\n   - Avoiding repeated letters to maximize information gain.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""AUDIO"" was considered (A in position 1), but it focuses heavily on vowels and may not test enough consonants.\n- ""SALTY"" (A in position 2) is a strong alternative, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and avoids excluded letters. It also tests A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions.\n\nChose ""SALTY"" because:\n- It places A in position 2 (a new, untested position).\n- It introduces S, L, T, Y—all common letters not yet evaluated.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word with no repeated letters or excluded characters (C, R, N, E).\n- This guess will provide feedback on A\'s position and the presence of S, L, T, Y, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>SALTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in CRANE it was position 3).\n\nGuess 2: SALTY -> S(x), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- S, L, Y are NOT in the word.\n- A is again marked as ""wrong position"" (-). Since in SALTY, A is in position 2, this means A is in the word but not in position 2. Previously from CRANE, we know A is not in position 3. So A could be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- T is marked as ""wrong position"" (-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in SALTY, T is in position 4).\n\nSo, combining all we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (all marked x in both guesses).\nPresent letters (wrong position): A and T.\n\nWe know:\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2 or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- T is in the word, but not in position 4. So T could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: position 1, 4, and 5 are the only possibilities for A. T cannot be in the same position as A if that position is occupied, but we don\'t know the positions yet.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\nNow, we need to think of a new guess that:\n- Includes A (since we know it\'s present) and places it in one of the untried positions: 1, 4, or 5. But note, we don\'t know which position is correct, so we might want to test a word that puts A in a new position and also tests T in a new position.\n- Includes T (since T is present, but not in position 4) and places it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But we should avoid position 4 for T (already tried).\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.\n\nSo, the available letters are all except: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.\n\nWe can use: A, T, and any other letters not in the absent list. For example: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.\n\nWe also need to form a valid English word.\n\nNow, let\'s consider possibilities for A\'s position:\n\n- If A is in position 1: then words like A _ _ _ _\n- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _\n- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A\n\nSimilarly for T, which must be in the word but not in position 4.\n\nSince we have T as a present letter, and A as present, we should try a word that includes both A and T, and positions them in new spots.\n\nAlso, we want to introduce new letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable positions:\n- A cannot be in position 2 or 3. So in the next guess, we might try A in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- T cannot be in position 4, so in the next guess, we should avoid putting T in position 4.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words:\n\nFirst, try A in position 1: A _ _ _ _\nWe need to avoid C,R,N,E,S,L,Y. Common words: \n- ABATE? But E is excluded. Not possible.\n- ADAPT? D is allowed, P and T. But we have T available. ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T - but has two A\'s? Also, positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But we know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback says A is present but not in position 2 or 3? Wait, from Guess 2: SALTY has A in position 2, marked wrong; from CRANE in position 3, marked wrong. So A can be in position 1,4,5. In ADAPT, we have A in positions 1 and 3. But position 3 is forbidden? We must avoid A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So having A in position 3 in a guess will result in x or -? But we know A is present, so if we put A in a wrong position, it will be -. But we don\'t want to put A in forbidden positions to save a guess? Actually, we can do that to test, but it\'s inefficient.\n\nBetter to avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 in our next guess because we know it\'s not there. So for a word that starts with A, we don\'t put A again in pos 3? In ADAPT, we have two A\'s: first at pos1 and third at pos3. But pos3 is known to be incorrect for A, so we wouldn\'t put A there if we can help it.\n\nSo let\'s avoid words that have A in position 3. Similarly, avoid position 2 for A.\n\nSo for A in position 1: \n- Words like: A D O P T? But D,O,P,T. But ""ADOPT"" is a word: A,D,O,P,T. Positions: A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5). This avoids A in positions 2 and 3? Position 3 is O, not A. This is fine. Moreover, D,O,P,T are new letters.\n\nBut note, T is in position 5. We know T is present, and we haven\'t tried T in position 5? In SALTY, T was in position 4 (which was wrong). So T in pos5 is new.\n\nAlso, in this word, A is in pos1 and T in pos5.\n\nBut we need to check if T can be in position 5? Yes, possible.\n\nAnother idea: A in position 4? Words like _ _ _ A _\nFor example: with T, say ...T.A? Or something.\n\nFirst, let\'s list some words:\n\nOption 1: A in pos 1: ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T)\n- Puts A in pos 1, T in pos 5.\n- Tests D, O, P.\n\nOption 2: A in pos 5: words ending with A, and including T.\nFor example: P I T A ? But we need to avoid S,L, etc. ""MORTA""? No, ""DEOTA""? No. Common words: ""DATA""? But D,A,T,A (two A\'s) and positions: D(1),A(2),T(3),A(4). But A in pos2? We know A is not in pos2, so if we put an A in pos2, it will be marked x? No, the feedback will mark each letter individually. But we know that A cannot be in pos2, so if we put A in pos2, it will be incorrect and thus not present? Actually, the A is present elsewhere, but in this word, we have two A\'s. The secret word has at least one A, but if we put an A in pos2, and the secret A is in pos4, then for pos2 we might get x because it\'s not the right position? Or could it be marked with -? Only if the secret word has another A in a different position? But we don\'t know how many A\'s.\n\nThis might be messy. Let\'s avoid duplicated letters for clarity? So stick to words with unique letters if possible.\n\nBut ADOPT has unique letters.\n\nAnother word with A in pos5: ""OUT A""? No. ""HOOTA""? Not word. How about ""HAV TA""? No. It\'s hard to find words ending with A.\n\nLet\'s go to A in pos4: words like _ _ _ A _\nFor example: include T? T could be in pos1,2,3, or5.\n\nWord: ...A.\nTry ""DRAFT"": but R is excluded? No, R is absent.\n""GRAFT"": R absent? Yes, R excluded.\n""SHALT"": H,A,L,T. But L is excluded? Yes, L is absent, so S is absent? We need to avoid L.\n\nWe cannot use L.\n\nWhat word? ""BAG T A""? Hard.\n\nWord: OPT A? But positions: O,P,T,A,? Not easy.\n\nPerhaps ""A in pos1"" is easier.\n\nAlternative to ADOPT: ""ADMIT""? D,M,I,T. But has A in pos1? And we avoid excluded? A,D,M,I,T. Letters not excluded: yes. But wait: in ADMIT, M is new, I and T? T is known present.\n\nADMIT: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5). This places T in position 5.\n\nAnother: ""AUDIT""? But U,D,I,T. But we used U in AUDIO? No, we didn\'t. In second guess we used SALTY, not AUDIO.\n\nADMIT and AUDIT both end with T.\n\nBut in ADMIT: we have A in 1, T in 5.\n\nSimilarly, AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T. Also ends T.\n\nBut note: I is a new letter.\n\nWe also need to consider whether we can put T in position 1,2,3? But for now, let\'s pick a word that might help.\n\nSince we don\'t know A\'s position, we can pick a word that uses A in a position we haven\'t tried: pos1,4,5. We tried pos2 and 3 already? In CRANE, A was pos3; in SALTY, A was pos2. So we haven\'t tried A in pos1,4, or5.\n\nSimilarly for T: only tried in pos4 (in SALTY which was wrong). So we haven\'t tested T in pos1,2,3,5.\n\nTo kill two birds with one stone, we can try a word with A in pos1 and T in pos5? Then the feedback for A will tell if it\'s in pos1. Similarly, T in pos5 will tell if it\'s there.\n\nSo options: ADOPT, ADMIT, AUDIT, etc.\n\nAlso, we can try A in pos4 and T in another position? But let\'s start with A in pos1.\n\nAnother word: ""APT LY""? Not a word. How about ""ATOM""? But 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nADOPT: A, D, O, P, T -> letters: D,O,P,T (new)\n\nADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> letters: D,M,I,T\n\nAUDIT: A, U, D, I, T\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe should choose one with common letters to maximize information.\n\nAlso, avoid letters that might be rare.\n\nI think ADOPT is fine, but P is less common? Not sure.\n\nAnother common word: ""ARGON"" but ""R"" is excluded.\n\nCannot.\n\nHow about ""ABOUT""? But O,U,T. A,B,O,U,T. Avoid absent? A in pos1, B in pos2, O pos3, U pos4, T pos5. But ""B"" is new, O and U also. But we avoid excluded: no C,R,N,E,S,L,Y? Yes.\n\nB is common? ABOUT is a valid word.\n\nSo we have ABOUT, ADOPT, AUDIT, etc.\n\nBut note that in ABOUT, T is in pos5, same as our plan.\n\nSimilarly, AUDIT has T in pos5.\n\nAlternatively, to test T in a different position? But pos5 is fine.\n\nWe also need to consider that if A is not in pos1, then we\'ll know A must be in pos4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if T is not in pos5, then T must be in pos1,2,3.\n\nI think both ABOUT and ADOPT are reasonable.\n\nLet me choose AUDIT? Because it has U and I, which are vowels we haven\'t tested? But U and I might be less common? Not sure.\n\nCommon consonants: B, D, M, P are available.\n\nABOUT has B and U.\n\nADOPT has D,P,O.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ABOUT: letters A,B,O,U,T. All new except A and T.\n\nFeedback will give:\n- For A in pos1: ✓ if present and correct, or - if in word but wrong position? If - it would mean A is elsewhere but we know it\'s present. Actually, if A is not in pos1, it might be in pos4 or5, and we\'ll get - for A in pos1? Then we\'ll get feedback on other letters.\n\nSimilarly for T in pos5.\n\nThe word ABOUT:\n\n- Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T\n\nAfter guessing, we get feedback per position.\n\nBut note: we know A is present and T is present, so if we put A in pos1 and it\'s wrong, it will be -, same for T in pos5.\n\nBut that\'s okay.\n\nI think ABOUT is a good word.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s pick ABOUT.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n- **Key Insights from Previous Feedback:**  \n  - From Guess 1 (CRANE): We know A is present but not in position 3. Letters C, R, N, and E are absent.  \n  - From Guess 2 (SALTY): We know A is present but not in position 2 (since it was marked wrong position). Also, T is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, and Y are absent.  \n  - Combining this:  \n    - **A must be in position 1, 4, or 5** (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  \n    - **T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5** (position 4 is ruled out).  \n    - **Absent letters:** C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (cannot be used in the new guess).  \n    - **Present letters:** A and T (must appear in the new guess).  \n\n- **Strategy for the Next Guess:**  \n  - The guess must include both A and T to confirm their positions.  \n  - Test A in a new untried position (position 1, 4, or 5) and T in a new untried position (position 1, 2, 3, or 5). Avoid positions that have been ruled out.  \n  - Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Since vowels/consonants like O, U, B, D, M are not yet tested and not excluded, they are good candidates.  \n  - Avoid repeated or absent letters for clarity.  \n  - Prioritize words where A is placed in position 1 (to test if it is correct) and T in position 5 (to test if it fits). This helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.  \n\n- **Word Selection:**  \n  - Words considered:  \n    - **ABOUT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: B, O, U (common and not excluded).  \n    - **ADOPT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: D, O, P.  \n    - **AUDIT**: A in position 1, T in position 5. New letters: U, D, I.  \n  - **Choice Rationale**: ""ABOUT"" is selected because:  \n    - It tests A in a new position (1) and T in a new position (5).  \n    - It introduces high-frequency letters like B, O, and U, maximizing information gain.  \n    - It is a common, valid 5-letter word.  \n    - Feedback will clearly indicate:  \n      - If A is indeed in position 1 (✓/–).  \n      - If T is in position 5 (✓/–).  \n      - Presence/absence of B, O, U.  \n\nThis guess aligns with accumulating maximum information while adhering to known constraints.\n\n<guess>ABOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(✓) U(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1 (CRANE): 
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is present but not in position 3; C,R,N,E absent.

Guess 2 (SALTY):
  S(x), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x) → A is not in position 2; T is present but not in position 4; S,L,Y absent.

Guess 3 (ABOUT):
  A(✓), B(x), O(✓), U(x), T(✓) → A is correct in position 1; O is correct in position 3; T is correct in position 5; B and U absent.

So, we know:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- Therefore, the word is: A ? O ? T

We need to find the missing letters for position 2 and 4.

Also, from feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, B, U (from ABOUT, B and U are absent)
- Present letters: We have A, O, T fixed in positions 1,3,5. The feedback for A in Guess1 and Guess2 showed it was present but misplaced, but now it's fixed in position 1. Similarly, T was misplaced before but now fixed in position 5.

Now, we have two unknown positions: 2 and 4.

The word must be a valid English word of the form A _ O _ T.

We also have absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, B, U. So we cannot use these.

We might have other present letters from previous feedback? But in Guess1 and Guess2, we only know about A and T being present (but now fixed) and the other letters were absent.

We must fill position 2 and 4 with letters not absent and not A,O,T (since they are used, but A,O,T are fixed so they cannot appear again unless the word has duplicates? But we don't have information about duplicates yet.

Possible letters: All English letters except the absent ones: C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U and except A,O,T? Not necessarily, except we know A,O,T are already used in their positions, but we might have duplicates? For example, could the word have another A? Or O? Or T?

But let's see:

In Guess1 (CRANE), A was present but in wrong position (position 3). But now in ABOUT we have A in position 1 correct. Since position 1 A is correct, that means the A in CRANE (position 3) was a different A? Only if there are two A's. But we don't know yet.

Similarly for T: in Guess2 (SALTY), T was present but in wrong position (4). Now in ABOUT, T is in position 5 and correct. So in SALTY, position 4 T was wrong, so if there was only one T, then it couldn't be in position 4. But if there is a duplicate T, it could be elsewhere? But we have T in position 5.

For the secret word, since position 1 A, position 3 O, position 5 T are fixed, then for position 2 and 4, we need to use letters that are not absent and might be available.

But absent letters are: C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U.

Also, from Guess1 and Guess other feedback, we haven't heard of other present letters? Only that A and T were present.

But now they are placed.

So, for position 2 and 4, we can use any letters except: C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U, and possibly not A,O,T? But A,O,T might appear again? For example, could the word be ""A O O T T""? No, that's not 5 letters.

We need valid English words.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: all letters not in absent list and not A,O,T? Or could one of them be A,O,T if duplicated?

But A,O,T are already used. But if the word has duplicate letters, then we can use them again? For example, position 2 could be A if the word has two A's? But we don't know.

Let's think about the structure: A _ O _ T.

We have unused letters: many are available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

But not all are common.

Now, common words of the form A _ O _ T:

- ""ABOUT"": but we used it and got B absent? So not that.
- ""AFOOT"": A F O O T → positions: A(1), F(2), O(3), O(4), T(5). But O at position 4? And we have position 3 O fixed? So it's valid? But we need to check letter availability: F is not absent? We haven't eliminated F. Also O is present? But here O appears twice? We have position 3 O fixed, so if we put O at position 4, is that possible? The feedback would tell us.

But let's list possible words:

Common words:
- A F O O T → ""AFOOT""
- A D O R T → ""ADORT"" not a word? ""ADOPT"" but we avoid O at position 3? But in ADOPT, it's A,D,O,P,T → O at position 3? But that matches because we have position 3 O fixed? In A_D_O_T? But ADOPT has O at position 3? No: ADOPT: A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5). That matches the structure: A _ O _ T. But P at position 4.

Similarly, ""ADOPT"" is a valid word.

Also, ""AGO_T""? ""AGOUT"" not word? ""AHORT"" not. 

""AMORT"": A M O R T → but R is absent? R is excluded.

""APART"": A P A R T → but R is absent? Also A appears twice? Positions: A(1), P(2), A(3), R(4), T(5). But position 3 is O? No, our word requires O at position 3? In this case it's A at position 3, conflict. Not possible.

We must have O at position 3.

So words: A _ O _ T.

Other options:
- ""AFOOT"": A F O O T → F is not absent? O at position 4? But O is already at position 3? Could be duplicate O? But we need to check if O is duplicated? Not known.
- ""ADOPT"": A D O P T
- ""ALOFT"": A L O F T? But L is absent? From SALTY, L is absent, no.
- ""AHO_T"": Not common. ""AHOUT"" not word? 
- ""AZO_T"": ""AZOTE"" but E is absent? ""AZOTE"" is a word? E is absent? E is excluded. No.
- ""AVO_T"": ""AVOID"" but ends with D? Not T. ""AVOST"" not word.

So common words: 
1. AFOOT: A,F,O,O,T → with O at position 4? Structure: position2: F, position4: O.
2. ADOPT: A,D,O,P,T → position2: D, position4: P.

Also, ""ABOAT"" not word. ""ABOUT"" eliminated.

What about ""AVO T"" something? ""AVOID""? No, ends with D.

""AMOWT"" not word.

Perhaps ""ADMIT"" but has M,I? ADMIT: A,D,M,I,T → position3: M? But we need position3 to be O? Not matching.

We must have O at position 3.

So words that fit: ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T) and AFOOT (A,F,O,O,T)

In ABOUT guess, we got O(✓), meaning O is correct in position 3. So yes.

ADOPT: 
- Position2: D
- Position4: P

AFOOT:
- Position2: F
- Position4: O

Now, we haven't tested D, F, P, etc? And we don't know if O can be duplicated? For instance, in AFOOT, if we put O at position4, but position3 is O, so if secret has only one O, then O at position4 would be absent or wrong position? But at position3 it is fixed? Only one O? But from feedback, we have O marked correct at position3? But we don't know about duplicate O. So it's possible.

Similarly, we haven't eliminated D or F or P.

In our previous guesses, did we have D or F or P? No, not tested.

So both ADOPT and AFOOT are candidates.

We need to choose a guess to differentiate.

We have 3 guesses left? Starting from first guess, now fourth guess? Let's see: we had guess1, guess2, guess3, now guess4.

But we can guess one of these? But we might not get it right? Or we can use a word that tests the possibilities.

But let's see the available letters: we have two positions to fill? But we know the pattern.

Alternatively, we can guess ADOPT directly? Or AFOOT?

But we can also guess a word that has D and F? To test one letter? But limited time.

Since we have only a few options, it's best to guess one of the candidate solutions.

But let's see: for AFOOT, if the word were AFOOT, what does that imply? Then position4 is O? And position2 is F? And the letter O appears twice? We don't know that.

For ADOPT, position2 D, position4 P.

We haven't had any feedback about D, F, P being present? No, we haven't tested them? Only absent letters list? We know C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U are absent? So D,F,P are possible? Yes.

So we need to test.

With one guess, we can guess ADOPT? If AFOOT is secret, then for ADOPT: 
- Position1: A(✓) since A is fixed at position1? So ✓
- Position2: D? In secret AFOOT, position2 is F, so D would be x (absent) unless duplicate.
- Position3: O(✓)
- Position4: P? In AFOOT, position4 is O? So P absent? x
- Position5: T(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ADOPT, and the secret is AFOOT, feedback: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(✓)

Then we know position2 should be F? And position4 O? Then we guess AFOOT next.

Similarly, if we guess AFOOT and secret is ADOPT: A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(✓) because position4 O might be misplaced? But in ADOPT, position4 is P? So O would be? In AFOOT guess, if secret ADOPT, then position4 O? Absent? Or wrong position? But ADOPT has only one O at position3? So O at position4 in AFOOT guess: since secret has only O at position3, then O at position4 should be absent? Marked x? Or -? Only if there is another O? But there isn't? So it might be x.

Similarly for F: secret ADOPT has no F? So F absent? x.

So if secret is ADOPT, AFOOT guess: A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(x) T(✓) because the second O is not present? But O is present only once at position3? So position4 O in AFOOT is marked x? Yes.

So we can distinguish.

But we have one guess? Or more? We have 6 tries? So guess4 can be ADOPT? Or AFOOT? Or another word.

To save guesses, we can use a word that has both possibilities? For example, a word that tests D and F? But we have two positions? Position2 and position4? We need to know both letters? It might not be efficient.

Since there are only two strong candidates? We can guess ADOPT? If it's the word? Then we win? If not, we know it's AFOOT? Because if ADOPT

Suppose we guess ADOPT:

Case 1: secret is ADOPT → we win.

Case 2: secret is AFOOT → then feedback: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(?) → wait, position5 T? If secret AFOOT, T is at position5? So T(✓). Then feedback: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(✓)

Then we know: position2 should be F? Because it must start with A, third O, fifth T? And we didn't have F? So next guess AFOOT.

Similarly, If we guess AFOOT:

- If secret AFOOT, win.
- If secret ADOPT, then A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(x) T(✓) because the fourth letter O is absent? Then we know position2 D and position4 P? Then guess ADOPT next? But that's the same as above? So one extra guess wasted? We have tries left? 6-3= 3 tries? We are at guess4.

If we guess ADOPT now:

- If correct, we win.
- If not? Then with the feedback? We can guess AFOOT on guess5.

Similarly, if we guess AFOOT and not correct? Then guess ADOPT on guess5.

But we can choose which one to guess first? Since both are valid? Let's pick ADOPT? Or AFOOT?

But note: in ABOUT guess, we have O(✓) at position3? Suppose we haven't tested O elsewhere? But we don't need? Both have O at position3.

But also, is there another word? Like ""AHOUT""? Not word? ""APO_T"" not common? ""AVO_T"" not.

Another word: ""AWORT""? But R is absent? No.

""AGO T""? ""AGOUT"" is a word? A G O U T → but U is absent? From ABOUT, U absent? So ""AGOUT"" has U? But U is excluded? Then not possible? Yes, U is absent? So invalid.

Therefore, only possible common words: ADOPT and AFOOT.

So we can guess either?

But let's check the letters? D? F? P? O duplicate? Not known.

We can also consider if there are other words? For example, ""A HOT""? Not? ""A D O W T""? ""ADOWT""? Not word. ""A M O W T"" ""AMOWT""? Not word.

So likely only ADOPT and AFOOT.

Therefore, choose one? Let's choose ADOPT? Because it has distinct letters? And P, D not tested? But same for F.

ADOPT is more common? So guess ADOPT?

But we might lose a try? But we have tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes both possibilities? But position2 and position4 must be tested? And we can't cover both with one word for both positions? Not easily? Unless we guess a word with F and D? But F and D in other positions? Also difficult? How? For example, ""DEFY"" has E? Excluded? Not 5 letters.

Better to guess one candidate? I think ADOPT.

So next guess: ADOPT

Result: if correct, win? If not, then it's AFOOT and we guess next time.

So guess: ADOPT<thought>
- **Feedback Inference**:
  - Position 1: A is fixed (✓ from ABOUT).
  - Position 3: O is fixed (✓ from ABOUT).
  - Position 5: T is fixed (✓ from ABOUT).
  - Word structure: A _ O _ T.
  - Absent letters (from all feedback): C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, B, U.
  - Unknown positions: 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not absent and not conflicting existing information.

- **Possible Candidates**:
  - ""ADOPT"" (letters: A,D,O,P,T) → D in position 2, P in position 4.
  - ""AFOOT"" (letters: A,F,O,O,T) → F in position 2, O in position 4. Note duplicate O, but position 3 O is fixed, so O at position 4 may or may not be valid.
  - Despite duplicate O possibility, both are valid English words fitting the pattern.

- **Decision**:
  - Since only two candidates remain, guess ""ADOPT"" to test the solution directly.
  - If correct (feedback: ✓✓ for positions 2/4 if D/P correct), game wins.
  - If incorrect (e.g., D and P marked absent/wrong position), then ""AFOOT"" is confirmed, to be guessed next.
  - Uses Guess 4 efficiently—saves one attempt on non-candidates.

</thought>

<guess>ADOPT</guess> 
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- The secret word is confirmed to start with ""A"", end with ""T"", and have ""O"" in position 3 (as per ✓ in ABOUT). So the pattern is: **A _ O _ T**.
- Absent letters (marked x in any previous feedback): **C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, B, U**.
- Unknown positions: 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list and not conflicting (e.g., not forced duplicates, but duplicates are possible).
- Only two common English words fit this pattern and constraints:  
  1. **ADOPT** (positions: D in 2, P in 4)  
  2. **AFOOT** (positions: F in 2, O in 4).  

Given this, ""ADOPT"" is guessed to test one candidate solution directly. If correct, it wins; if not, ""AFOOT"" will be the next logical guess. This maximizes efficiency with the current information. 

<thought>
- Position 1 (A) and position 5 (T) are fixed from ABOUT's ✓ feedback. Position 3 (O) is also fixed, leaving positions 2 and 4 unknown.
- The absent letters eliminate many common options (e.g., ABOUT, ALOFT, APART), narrowing to two likely words: ADOPT and AFOOT.
- ADOPT is selected because:
  - It introduces untested letters (D and P) to quickly validate/invalidate their presence.
  - If feedback shows D/P as incorrect, AFOOT (with F and O in position 4) is implied.
  - Guessing a candidate solution (vs. a non-solution test word) conserves guesses efficiently.
</thought>

<guess>ADOPT</guess>",ADOPT,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1 (CRANE): 
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is present but not in position 3; C,R,N,E absent.

Guess 2 (SALTY):
  S(x), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x) → A is not in position 2; T is present but not in position 4; S,L,Y absent.

Guess 3 (ABOUT):
  A(✓), B(x), O(✓), U(x), T(✓) → A is correct in position 1; O is correct in position 3; T is correct in position 5; B and U absent.

So, we know:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- Therefore, the word is: A ? O ? T

We need to find the missing letters for position 2 and 4.

Also, from feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, B, U (from ABOUT, B and U are absent)
- Present letters: We have A, O, T fixed in positions 1,3,5. The feedback for A in Guess1 and Guess2 showed it was present but misplaced, but now it's fixed in position 1. Similarly, T was misplaced before but now fixed in position 5.

Now, we have two unknown positions: 2 and 4.

The word must be a valid English word of the form A _ O _ T.

We also have absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, B, U. So we cannot use these.

We might have other present letters from previous feedback? But in Guess1 and Guess2, we only know about A and T being present (but now fixed) and the other letters were absent.

We must fill position 2 and 4 with letters not absent and not A,O,T (since they are used, but A,O,T are fixed so they cannot appear again unless the word has duplicates? But we don't have information about duplicates yet.

Possible letters: All English letters except the absent ones: C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U and except A,O,T? Not necessarily, except we know A,O,T are already used in their positions, but we might have duplicates? For example, could the word have another A? Or O? Or T?

But let's see:

In Guess1 (CRANE), A was present but in wrong position (position 3). But now in ABOUT we have A in position 1 correct. Since position 1 A is correct, that means the A in CRANE (position 3) was a different A? Only if there are two A's. But we don't know yet.

Similarly for T: in Guess2 (SALTY), T was present but in wrong position (4). Now in ABOUT, T is in position 5 and correct. So in SALTY, position 4 T was wrong, so if there was only one T, then it couldn't be in position 4. But if there is a duplicate T, it could be elsewhere? But we have T in position 5.

For the secret word, since position 1 A, position 3 O, position 5 T are fixed, then for position 2 and 4, we need to use letters that are not absent and might be available.

But absent letters are: C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U.

Also, from Guess1 and Guess other feedback, we haven't heard of other present letters? Only that A and T were present.

But now they are placed.

So, for position 2 and 4, we can use any letters except: C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U, and possibly not A,O,T? But A,O,T might appear again? For example, could the word be ""A O O T T""? No, that's not 5 letters.

We need valid English words.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: all letters not in absent list and not A,O,T? Or could one of them be A,O,T if duplicated?

But A,O,T are already used. But if the word has duplicate letters, then we can use them again? For example, position 2 could be A if the word has two A's? But we don't know.

Let's think about the structure: A _ O _ T.

We have unused letters: many are available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

But not all are common.

Now, common words of the form A _ O _ T:

- ""ABOUT"": but we used it and got B absent? So not that.
- ""AFOOT"": A F O O T → positions: A(1), F(2), O(3), O(4), T(5). But O at position 4? And we have position 3 O fixed? So it's valid? But we need to check letter availability: F is not absent? We haven't eliminated F. Also O is present? But here O appears twice? We have position 3 O fixed, so if we put O at position 4, is that possible? The feedback would tell us.

But let's list possible words:

Common words:
- A F O O T → ""AFOOT""
- A D O R T → ""ADORT"" not a word? ""ADOPT"" but we avoid O at position 3? But in ADOPT, it's A,D,O,P,T → O at position 3? But that matches because we have position 3 O fixed? In A_D_O_T? But ADOPT has O at position 3? No: ADOPT: A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5). That matches the structure: A _ O _ T. But P at position 4.

Similarly, ""ADOPT"" is a valid word.

Also, ""AGO_T""? ""AGOUT"" not word? ""AHORT"" not. 

""AMORT"": A M O R T → but R is absent? R is excluded.

""APART"": A P A R T → but R is absent? Also A appears twice? Positions: A(1), P(2), A(3), R(4), T(5). But position 3 is O? No, our word requires O at position 3? In this case it's A at position 3, conflict. Not possible.

We must have O at position 3.

So words: A _ O _ T.

Other options:
- ""AFOOT"": A F O O T → F is not absent? O at position 4? But O is already at position 3? Could be duplicate O? But we need to check if O is duplicated? Not known.
- ""ADOPT"": A D O P T
- ""ALOFT"": A L O F T? But L is absent? From SALTY, L is absent, no.
- ""AHO_T"": Not common. ""AHOUT"" not word? 
- ""AZO_T"": ""AZOTE"" but E is absent? ""AZOTE"" is a word? E is absent? E is excluded. No.
- ""AVO_T"": ""AVOID"" but ends with D? Not T. ""AVOST"" not word.

So common words: 
1. AFOOT: A,F,O,O,T → with O at position 4? Structure: position2: F, position4: O.
2. ADOPT: A,D,O,P,T → position2: D, position4: P.

Also, ""ABOAT"" not word. ""ABOUT"" eliminated.

What about ""AVO T"" something? ""AVOID""? No, ends with D.

""AMOWT"" not word.

Perhaps ""ADMIT"" but has M,I? ADMIT: A,D,M,I,T → position3: M? But we need position3 to be O? Not matching.

We must have O at position 3.

So words that fit: ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T) and AFOOT (A,F,O,O,T)

In ABOUT guess, we got O(✓), meaning O is correct in position 3. So yes.

ADOPT: 
- Position2: D
- Position4: P

AFOOT:
- Position2: F
- Position4: O

Now, we haven't tested D, F, P, etc? And we don't know if O can be duplicated? For instance, in AFOOT, if we put O at position4, but position3 is O, so if secret has only one O, then O at position4 would be absent or wrong position? But at position3 it is fixed? Only one O? But from feedback, we have O marked correct at position3? But we don't know about duplicate O. So it's possible.

Similarly, we haven't eliminated D or F or P.

In our previous guesses, did we have D or F or P? No, not tested.

So both ADOPT and AFOOT are candidates.

We need to choose a guess to differentiate.

We have 3 guesses left? Starting from first guess, now fourth guess? Let's see: we had guess1, guess2, guess3, now guess4.

But we can guess one of these? But we might not get it right? Or we can use a word that tests the possibilities.

But let's see the available letters: we have two positions to fill? But we know the pattern.

Alternatively, we can guess ADOPT directly? Or AFOOT?

But we can also guess a word that has D and F? To test one letter? But limited time.

Since we have only a few options, it's best to guess one of the candidate solutions.

But let's see: for AFOOT, if the word were AFOOT, what does that imply? Then position4 is O? And position2 is F? And the letter O appears twice? We don't know that.

For ADOPT, position2 D, position4 P.

We haven't had any feedback about D, F, P being present? No, we haven't tested them? Only absent letters list? We know C,R,N,E,S,L,Y,B,U are absent? So D,F,P are possible? Yes.

So we need to test.

With one guess, we can guess ADOPT? If AFOOT is secret, then for ADOPT: 
- Position1: A(✓) since A is fixed at position1? So ✓
- Position2: D? In secret AFOOT, position2 is F, so D would be x (absent) unless duplicate.
- Position3: O(✓)
- Position4: P? In AFOOT, position4 is O? So P absent? x
- Position5: T(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ADOPT, and the secret is AFOOT, feedback: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(✓)

Then we know position2 should be F? And position4 O? Then we guess AFOOT next.

Similarly, if we guess AFOOT and secret is ADOPT: A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(✓) because position4 O might be misplaced? But in ADOPT, position4 is P? So O would be? In AFOOT guess, if secret ADOPT, then position4 O? Absent? Or wrong position? But ADOPT has only one O at position3? So O at position4 in AFOOT guess: since secret has only O at position3, then O at position4 should be absent? Marked x? Or -? Only if there is another O? But there isn't? So it might be x.

Similarly for F: secret ADOPT has no F? So F absent? x.

So if secret is ADOPT, AFOOT guess: A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(x) T(✓) because the second O is not present? But O is present only once at position3? So position4 O in AFOOT is marked x? Yes.

So we can distinguish.

But we have one guess? Or more? We have 6 tries? So guess4 can be ADOPT? Or AFOOT? Or another word.

To save guesses, we can use a word that has both possibilities? For example, a word that tests D and F? But we have two positions? Position2 and position4? We need to know both letters? It might not be efficient.

Since there are only two strong candidates? We can guess ADOPT? If it's the word? Then we win? If not, we know it's AFOOT? Because if ADOPT

Suppose we guess ADOPT:

Case 1: secret is ADOPT → we win.

Case 2: secret is AFOOT → then feedback: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(?) → wait, position5 T? If secret AFOOT, T is at position5? So T(✓). Then feedback: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(✓)

Then we know: position2 should be F? Because it must start with A, third O, fifth T? And we didn't have F? So next guess AFOOT.

Similarly, If we guess AFOOT:

- If secret AFOOT, win.
- If secret ADOPT, then A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(x) T(✓) because the fourth letter O is absent? Then we know position2 D and position4 P? Then guess ADOPT next? But that's the same as above? So one extra guess wasted? We have tries left? 6-3= 3 tries? We are at guess4.

If we guess ADOPT now:

- If correct, we win.
- If not? Then with the feedback? We can guess AFOOT on guess5.

Similarly, if we guess AFOOT and not correct? Then guess ADOPT on guess5.

But we can choose which one to guess first? Since both are valid? Let's pick ADOPT? Or AFOOT?

But note: in ABOUT guess, we have O(✓) at position3? Suppose we haven't tested O elsewhere? But we don't need? Both have O at position3.

But also, is there another word? Like ""AHOUT""? Not word? ""APO_T"" not common? ""AVO_T"" not.

Another word: ""AWORT""? But R is absent? No.

""AGO T""? ""AGOUT"" is a word? A G O U T → but U is absent? From ABOUT, U absent? So ""AGOUT"" has U? But U is excluded? Then not possible? Yes, U is absent? So invalid.

Therefore, only possible common words: ADOPT and AFOOT.

So we can guess either?

But let's check the letters? D? F? P? O duplicate? Not known.

We can also consider if there are other words? For example, ""A HOT""? Not? ""A D O W T""? ""ADOWT""? Not word. ""A M O W T"" ""AMOWT""? Not word.

So likely only ADOPT and AFOOT.

Therefore, choose one? Let's choose ADOPT? Because it has distinct letters? And P, D not tested? But same for F.

ADOPT is more common? So guess ADOPT?

But we might lose a try? But we have tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes both possibilities? But position2 and position4 must be tested? And we can't cover both with one word for both positions? Not easily? Unless we guess a word with F and D? But F and D in other positions? Also difficult? How? For example, ""DEFY"" has E? Excluded? Not 5 letters.

Better to guess one candidate? I think ADOPT.

So next guess: ADOPT

Result: if correct, win? If not, then it's AFOOT and we guess next time.
