We are at the start of the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good initial guess should cover a variety of common letters to maximize the information we get from the feedback.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
 Words that include many common letters are often used as first guesses.

 Popular starting words include: 
   - CRANE
   - SLATE
   - ROAST
   - SALET

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N) and covers five distinct letters.

 So, my first guess: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This is quite informative because it eliminates these five common letters.

 Now, we need to choose a second guess that avoids these letters and uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We should avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Common letters not yet tried: 
   Vowels: O, U, I (since A and E are out)
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We want a word that uses as many common letters as possible from the remaining set.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, P, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SPLIT"" or ""MOUTH"" or ""PUDGY"", but let's aim for a word with high-frequency letters.

 Consider: 
   S, T, L are very common. Also, O and U for vowels.

 Since we have no vowels from the first set, we need to include vowels that are still possible: O, U, I.

 Possible words:
   ""SOUTH"" - includes S, O, U, T, H (all common)
   ""PIOUS"" - includes P, I, O, U, S
   ""BUOYS"" - but B and Y are less common

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""OUIJA"" - but that has J which is rare and only 4 letters? No, OUIJA is 5 letters: O, U, I, J, A. But A is already eliminated. So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""OUIJA"" is invalid because of A and also J is rare.

 Let's try to form a word without the eliminated letters.

 How about ""MOIST""? 
   M, O, I, S, T - all are new and common.

 Or ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so we cannot use E. Also, we have eliminated R, A, N, C.

 Another good option: ""PLUMB"" but that has B and M, and U. But we might want to avoid rare letters.

 After eliminating C, R, A, N, E, the most common letters left are: S, T, O, L, I, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.

 We can use a word that covers multiple of these.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: 
   M, O, I, S, T - all are common and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" has G, H, O, U, L - but G and H are less common than S and T.

 Another one: ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P.

 But ""MOIST"" has the advantage of including a vowel (O and I) and common consonants.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So, second guess: MOIST

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. For the next guess, I need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

I should prioritize:
- High-frequency consonants like S, T, L, M, D, P
- Untested vowels (O, U, I)
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E)

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters: M, O, I, S, T
- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)
- Maximizes coverage of frequent letters not yet tested

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

But we might want to avoid rare letters.\n\n After eliminating C, R, A, N, E, the most common letters left are: S, T, O, L, I, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.\n\n We can use a word that covers multiple of these.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: \n   M, O, I, S, T - all are common and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n\n Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" has G, H, O, U, L - but G and H are less common than S and T.\n\n Another one: ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P.\n\n But ""MOIST"" has the advantage of including a vowel (O and I) and common consonants.\n\n Let\'s go with ""MOIST"".\n\n So, second guess: MOIST\n\n We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) -> so the secret word contains none of these.
2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)

From the second guess, we know:
- S is in the word and in the correct position. Since it was the fourth letter in ""MOIST"", that means the fourth letter of the secret word is S.
- M, O, I, T are absent. So we can add these to the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T

We also know the fourth letter is S.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ S _

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes S in the fourth position (since we know it's correct and we want to use that to our advantage)
- Avoids all eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T
- Uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters among these: L, D, U, P, F, G, H, B, Y

We should try to cover as many of these as possible.

We also note that we have no vowels left except U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). So the word must contain U or sometimes Y as a vowel? But Y can be a vowel or consonant.

However, note that the secret word must have at least one vowel (or Y). The vowels we have left are U and sometimes Y (if used as a vowel). But we also have W (as in 'cwm') but that's rare. So likely the word has U or Y.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word that has S in the fourth position and uses new letters.

Possible words:

We need words of the form: _ _ _ S _

With the available letters.

Let's think of words that end with S? But it's the fourth letter, so the word could be like: X X X S X

Examples:
- FOCUS -> but O and C are eliminated.
- BONUS -> O and N eliminated.
- FUSED -> E and D? But E is eliminated.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

What about ""PULPS""? Let's check:
P, U, L, P, S -> but we have two P's? And the fourth letter is S, good. But we have eliminated letters? P is not eliminated, U, L, S (we know S is in, but we can use it again? Actually, we know S is in the word, but we can use it in the guess to test other positions? However, in this case, we know the fourth is S, so we should keep S in the fourth position to avoid wasting a spot.

But in the guess, we can put S only in the fourth position because if we put it elsewhere and it's not in the word (but we know it is in the fourth) then we might get confusing feedback. So best to keep S in the fourth position.

So the guess must have S in the fourth position.

Now, we need to choose the other four letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

We also want to test as many new letters as possible, so avoid repeating letters if possible.

Let's list possible words:

- BULBS? -> B, U, L, B, S -> but B repeated and the last letter is S? No, the fourth is S, so the word is _ _ _ S _, so the last letter is the fifth.

""BULBS"" would be B U L B S -> so fourth is B? No, positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:B, 5:S -> but we need fourth to be S, so that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, S, letter5.

So for example:
- FUSSY? But we have S repeated and Y. But F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be S, which it is, but the third is also S. But we don't know if the word has multiple S's. However, we are trying to avoid repeats to test more letters.

But we know S is in the fourth position, but there might be another S? We don't know.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters if possible.

What words have S in the fourth position and use available letters?

Let's think:
- ...S. 

Examples:
- PLUS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- We need 5-letter words.

Possible words:
- PULUS? Not a word.
- FUSEL? But E is eliminated.
- GUSSY? G U S S Y -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but S repeated and we don't know if there is a third S? Also, G and Y are new.

But we have two S's, which might not be efficient.

- BUSKY? B U S K Y -> 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> but the fourth letter is K, not S. We need the fourth to be S.

So the word must have the structure: ? ? ? S ?

So the third letter cannot be S if we want to avoid repetition? But it can be.

Let's search for words ending with ""S"" plus one letter? No, the fourth is S, so the last part is ""S?"".

Common endings: ""S"" followed by a letter, like ""ST"" but T is eliminated, ""SE"" E eliminated, ""SS"" but that would be S in fourth and fifth, ""SH"" H is available, etc.

Available endings: S + B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.

But we need the whole word.

Let's list some words:
- FUSSY: F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we have S in third and fourth. We know fourth is S, but third might be S or not. Also, F, U, Y are new.
- GASSY: G A S S Y -> but A is eliminated.
- LUSUS: not a word.
- PULPS: P U L P S -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:S -> fourth is P, not S. We need fourth to be S.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

The word is: position1, position2, position3, position4=S, position5.

So for ""PULPS"": position1=P, position2=U, position3=L, position4=P, position5=S -> so position4 is P, not S. So that doesn't work.

We need position4 to be S.

So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

Examples of such words:
- FOCUS: F O C U S -> positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:S -> position4 is U, not S.
- BASIS: B A S I S -> position4 is I, not S.

I need to think of words where the fourth letter is S.

Like:
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:S -> but T and R are eliminated.
- PRESS: P R E S S -> R and E eliminated.
- CROSS: C and R and O eliminated.
- FLOSS: F L O S S -> O eliminated.
- BLESS: B L E S S -> E eliminated.
- GLASS: G L A S S -> A eliminated.
- CLASS: C and A eliminated.

With available letters, what about:
- PLUSH: P L U S H -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> yes! Fourth is S.
- Plus, P, L, U, H are all new letters, and S is in the correct position.

Is ""PLUSH"" a valid word? Yes, meaning rich and luxurious.

Another one: ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> but S is in first and fourth, and we know S is in fourth, but if we put S in first, it might be confusing. Also, we are not sure if S is in first or not. But we can do that, but it might be better to avoid S in other positions to test new letters.

In ""PLUSH"", we have no S in other positions, so we test P, L, U, H, and confirm S in fourth.

Another word: ""FLUBS"": F L U B S -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:B, 5:S -> fourth is B, not S.

""FLUSH"": F L U S H -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> same as PLUSH but with F.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""BLUSH"": B L U S H -> but B, L, U, S, H.

Or ""SLUMP"": S L U M P -> but M is eliminated.

M is eliminated from guess 2.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

""PLUSH"": P, L, U, S, H
""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H
""BLUSH"": B, L, U, S, H

All are valid.

We can also consider words with Y, like ""SLUSHY"" but that's 6 letters.

Or ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> but has double S, and we are testing G, U, Y, but S is repeated.

To maximize new letters, ""PLUSH"" or ""FLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"" are good because they use four new letters and S in the correct position.

We can choose any of them. Let's pick ""FLUSH"" because F is a common letter.

But we also need to consider that U might be the vowel.

Another word: ""JUJUS"" - not common, and J is rare.

Or ""PUDUS"" - not common.

So I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.

But let's see if we can cover more letters. ""FLUSH"" has F, L, U, S, H.

We could use a word with different letters, like including D or G or P.

For example, ""PUDGY"" but P U D G Y -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:Y -> fourth is G, not S.

We need fourth to be S.

Another word: ""BUDAS"" - not a word.

""FUSED"" - E eliminated.

I think ""FLUSH"" is fine.

But we have ""PLUSH"" as well. Or ""SLUSH"" but S in first might be redundant if we are not testing it, but we know S is in fourth, so if we put S in first and it's not in the word, we get x, but we know it is in fourth, so it might be a waste. But if the word has two S's, we might get feedback.

However, to avoid confusion and test more new letters, it's better to not repeat S.

So ""FLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"".

Let's choose ""FLUSH"".

But we have to consider that we are on the third guess, and we have only 6 guesses total.

Another idea: we could use a word that has U in a different position to test if U is in the word and where.

In ""FLUSH"", U is in position 3.

Similarly, in ""PLUSH"", U is in position 3.

We don't know if U is in the word or not. We haven't tested U yet, but it's a common vowel.

So let's go with ""FLUSH"".

So guess: FLUSH

Feedback will tell us about F, L, U, S (which we know is correct), and H.

S is fixed, so we'll get feedback on the others.

We can also consider ""BUYLS"" - not a word.

I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **CRANE** had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated).
- **MOIST** had only S correct and in position 4 (M, O, I, T eliminated, and S must be in the 4th position of the secret word).

The secret word has the form: `_ _ _ S _`, and the eliminated letters are **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T**. The remaining available letters include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y, and U is the only untested vowel.

For the next guess:
- **S must be in the 4th position** to leverage the known correct placement.
- The guess should avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., F, L, U, H, P) to maximize information.
- A word like **FLUSH** fits well: it places S correctly in position 4, uses four new common letters (F, L, U, H), and avoids repeats. This will efficiently test for the presence of U (a key vowel) and other consonants.

<guess>FLUSH</guess>",FLUSH,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) -> so the secret word contains none of these.
2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)

From the second guess, we know:
- S is in the word and in the correct position. Since it was the fourth letter in ""MOIST"", that means the fourth letter of the secret word is S.
- M, O, I, T are absent. So we can add these to the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T

We also know the fourth letter is S.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ S _

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes S in the fourth position (since we know it's correct and we want to use that to our advantage)
- Avoids all eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T
- Uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters among these: L, D, U, P, F, G, H, B, Y

We should try to cover as many of these as possible.

We also note that we have no vowels left except U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). So the word must contain U or sometimes Y as a vowel? But Y can be a vowel or consonant.

However, note that the secret word must have at least one vowel (or Y). The vowels we have left are U and sometimes Y (if used as a vowel). But we also have W (as in 'cwm') but that's rare. So likely the word has U or Y.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word that has S in the fourth position and uses new letters.

Possible words:

We need words of the form: _ _ _ S _

With the available letters.

Let's think of words that end with S? But it's the fourth letter, so the word could be like: X X X S X

Examples:
- FOCUS -> but O and C are eliminated.
- BONUS -> O and N eliminated.
- FUSED -> E and D? But E is eliminated.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

What about ""PULPS""? Let's check:
P, U, L, P, S -> but we have two P's? And the fourth letter is S, good. But we have eliminated letters? P is not eliminated, U, L, S (we know S is in, but we can use it again? Actually, we know S is in the word, but we can use it in the guess to test other positions? However, in this case, we know the fourth is S, so we should keep S in the fourth position to avoid wasting a spot.

But in the guess, we can put S only in the fourth position because if we put it elsewhere and it's not in the word (but we know it is in the fourth) then we might get confusing feedback. So best to keep S in the fourth position.

So the guess must have S in the fourth position.

Now, we need to choose the other four letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

We also want to test as many new letters as possible, so avoid repeating letters if possible.

Let's list possible words:

- BULBS? -> B, U, L, B, S -> but B repeated and the last letter is S? No, the fourth is S, so the word is _ _ _ S _, so the last letter is the fifth.

""BULBS"" would be B U L B S -> so fourth is B? No, positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:B, 5:S -> but we need fourth to be S, so that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, S, letter5.

So for example:
- FUSSY? But we have S repeated and Y. But F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be S, which it is, but the third is also S. But we don't know if the word has multiple S's. However, we are trying to avoid repeats to test more letters.

But we know S is in the fourth position, but there might be another S? We don't know.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters if possible.

What words have S in the fourth position and use available letters?

Let's think:
- ...S. 

Examples:
- PLUS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- We need 5-letter words.

Possible words:
- PULUS? Not a word.
- FUSEL? But E is eliminated.
- GUSSY? G U S S Y -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but S repeated and we don't know if there is a third S? Also, G and Y are new.

But we have two S's, which might not be efficient.

- BUSKY? B U S K Y -> 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> but the fourth letter is K, not S. We need the fourth to be S.

So the word must have the structure: ? ? ? S ?

So the third letter cannot be S if we want to avoid repetition? But it can be.

Let's search for words ending with ""S"" plus one letter? No, the fourth is S, so the last part is ""S?"".

Common endings: ""S"" followed by a letter, like ""ST"" but T is eliminated, ""SE"" E eliminated, ""SS"" but that would be S in fourth and fifth, ""SH"" H is available, etc.

Available endings: S + B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.

But we need the whole word.

Let's list some words:
- FUSSY: F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we have S in third and fourth. We know fourth is S, but third might be S or not. Also, F, U, Y are new.
- GASSY: G A S S Y -> but A is eliminated.
- LUSUS: not a word.
- PULPS: P U L P S -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:S -> fourth is P, not S. We need fourth to be S.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

The word is: position1, position2, position3, position4=S, position5.

So for ""PULPS"": position1=P, position2=U, position3=L, position4=P, position5=S -> so position4 is P, not S. So that doesn't work.

We need position4 to be S.

So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

Examples of such words:
- FOCUS: F O C U S -> positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:S -> position4 is U, not S.
- BASIS: B A S I S -> position4 is I, not S.

I need to think of words where the fourth letter is S.

Like:
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:S -> but T and R are eliminated.
- PRESS: P R E S S -> R and E eliminated.
- CROSS: C and R and O eliminated.
- FLOSS: F L O S S -> O eliminated.
- BLESS: B L E S S -> E eliminated.
- GLASS: G L A S S -> A eliminated.
- CLASS: C and A eliminated.

With available letters, what about:
- PLUSH: P L U S H -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> yes! Fourth is S.
- Plus, P, L, U, H are all new letters, and S is in the correct position.

Is ""PLUSH"" a valid word? Yes, meaning rich and luxurious.

Another one: ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> but S is in first and fourth, and we know S is in fourth, but if we put S in first, it might be confusing. Also, we are not sure if S is in first or not. But we can do that, but it might be better to avoid S in other positions to test new letters.

In ""PLUSH"", we have no S in other positions, so we test P, L, U, H, and confirm S in fourth.

Another word: ""FLUBS"": F L U B S -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:B, 5:S -> fourth is B, not S.

""FLUSH"": F L U S H -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> same as PLUSH but with F.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""BLUSH"": B L U S H -> but B, L, U, S, H.

Or ""SLUMP"": S L U M P -> but M is eliminated.

M is eliminated from guess 2.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

""PLUSH"": P, L, U, S, H
""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H
""BLUSH"": B, L, U, S, H

All are valid.

We can also consider words with Y, like ""SLUSHY"" but that's 6 letters.

Or ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> but has double S, and we are testing G, U, Y, but S is repeated.

To maximize new letters, ""PLUSH"" or ""FLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"" are good because they use four new letters and S in the correct position.

We can choose any of them. Let's pick ""FLUSH"" because F is a common letter.

But we also need to consider that U might be the vowel.

Another word: ""JUJUS"" - not common, and J is rare.

Or ""PUDUS"" - not common.

So I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.

But let's see if we can cover more letters. ""FLUSH"" has F, L, U, S, H.

We could use a word with different letters, like including D or G or P.

For example, ""PUDGY"" but P U D G Y -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:Y -> fourth is G, not S.

We need fourth to be S.

Another word: ""BUDAS"" - not a word.

""FUSED"" - E eliminated.

I think ""FLUSH"" is fine.

But we have ""PLUSH"" as well. Or ""SLUSH"" but S in first might be redundant if we are not testing it, but we know S is in fourth, so if we put S in first and it's not in the word, we get x, but we know it is in fourth, so it might be a waste. But if the word has two S's, we might get feedback.

However, to avoid confusion and test more new letters, it's better to not repeat S.

So ""FLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"".

Let's choose ""FLUSH"".

But we have to consider that we are on the third guess, and we have only 6 guesses total.

Another idea: we could use a word that has U in a different position to test if U is in the word and where.

In ""FLUSH"", U is in position 3.

Similarly, in ""PLUSH"", U is in position 3.

We don't know if U is in the word or not. We haven't tested U yet, but it's a common vowel.

So let's go with ""FLUSH"".

So guess: FLUSH

Feedback will tell us about F, L, U, S (which we know is correct), and H.

S is fixed, so we'll get feedback on the others.

We can also consider ""BUYLS"" - not a word.

I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **CRANE** had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated).
- **MOIST** had only S correct and in position 4 (M, O, I, T eliminated, and S must be in the 4th position of the secret word).

The secret word has the form: `_ _ _ S _`, and the eliminated letters are **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T**. The remaining available letters include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y, and U is the only untested vowel.

For the next guess:
- **S must be in the 4th position** to leverage the known correct placement.
- The guess should avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., F, L, U, H, P) to maximize information.
- A word like **FLUSH** fits well: it places S correctly in position 4, uses four new common letters (F, L, U, H), and avoids repeats. This will efficiently test for the presence of U (a key vowel) and other consonants.",Guess 3: FLUSH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) U(-) S(✓) H(-),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the start of the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good initial guess should cover a variety of common letters to maximize the information we get from the feedback.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
 Words that include many common letters are often used as first guesses.

 Popular starting words include: 
   - CRANE
   - SLATE
   - ROAST
   - SALET

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N) and covers five distinct letters.

 So, my first guess: CRANE

 We'll see the feedback and then base the next guess on that.For the first guess, I need a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information from the feedback. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are strong openers because they cover frequently used letters. I'll choose **CRANE** since it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R), and all letters are distinct, helping identify potential matches efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This is quite informative because it eliminates these five common letters.

 Now, we need to choose a second guess that avoids these letters and uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We should avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Common letters not yet tried: 
   Vowels: O, U, I (since A and E are out)
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We want a word that uses as many common letters as possible from the remaining set.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, P, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SPLIT"" or ""MOUTH"" or ""PUDGY"", but let's aim for a word with high-frequency letters.

 Consider: 
   S, T, L are very common. Also, O and U for vowels.

 Since we have no vowels from the first set, we need to include vowels that are still possible: O, U, I.

 Possible words:
   ""SOUTH"" - includes S, O, U, T, H (all common)
   ""PIOUS"" - includes P, I, O, U, S
   ""BUOYS"" - but B and Y are less common

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""OUIJA"" - but that has J which is rare and only 4 letters? No, OUIJA is 5 letters: O, U, I, J, A. But A is already eliminated. So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""OUIJA"" is invalid because of A and also J is rare.

 Let's try to form a word without the eliminated letters.

 How about ""MOIST""? 
   M, O, I, S, T - all are new and common.

 Or ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so we cannot use E. Also, we have eliminated R, A, N, C.

 Another good option: ""PLUMB"" but that has B and M, and U. But we might want to avoid rare letters.

 After eliminating C, R, A, N, E, the most common letters left are: S, T, O, L, I, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.

 We can use a word that covers multiple of these.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: 
   M, O, I, S, T - all are common and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" has G, H, O, U, L - but G and H are less common than S and T.

 Another one: ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P.

 But ""MOIST"" has the advantage of including a vowel (O and I) and common consonants.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So, second guess: MOIST

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. For the next guess, I need a word that avoids these letters and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

I should prioritize:
- High-frequency consonants like S, T, L, M, D, P
- Untested vowels (O, U, I)
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E)

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters: M, O, I, S, T
- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)
- Maximizes coverage of frequent letters not yet tested

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) -> so the secret word contains none of these.
2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)

From the second guess, we know:
- S is in the word and in the correct position. Since it was the fourth letter in ""MOIST"", that means the fourth letter of the secret word is S.
- M, O, I, T are absent. So we can add these to the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T

We also know the fourth letter is S.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ S _

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes S in the fourth position (since we know it's correct and we want to use that to our advantage)
- Avoids all eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T
- Uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters among these: L, D, U, P, F, G, H, B, Y

We should try to cover as many of these as possible.

We also note that we have no vowels left except U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). So the word must contain U or sometimes Y as a vowel? But Y can be a vowel or consonant.

However, note that the secret word must have at least one vowel (or Y). The vowels we have left are U and sometimes Y (if used as a vowel). But we also have W (as in 'cwm') but that's rare. So likely the word has U or Y.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word that has S in the fourth position and uses new letters.

Possible words:

We need words of the form: _ _ _ S _

With the available letters.

Let's think of words that end with S? But it's the fourth letter, so the word could be like: X X X S X

Examples:
- FOCUS -> but O and C are eliminated.
- BONUS -> O and N eliminated.
- FUSED -> E and D? But E is eliminated.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

What about ""PULPS""? Let's check:
P, U, L, P, S -> but we have two P's? And the fourth letter is S, good. But we have eliminated letters? P is not eliminated, U, L, S (we know S is in, but we can use it again? Actually, we know S is in the word, but we can use it in the guess to test other positions? However, in this case, we know the fourth is S, so we should keep S in the fourth position to avoid wasting a spot.

But in the guess, we can put S only in the fourth position because if we put it elsewhere and it's not in the word (but we know it is in the fourth) then we might get confusing feedback. So best to keep S in the fourth position.

So the guess must have S in the fourth position.

Now, we need to choose the other four letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

We also want to test as many new letters as possible, so avoid repeating letters if possible.

Let's list possible words:

- BULBS? -> B, U, L, B, S -> but B repeated and the last letter is S? No, the fourth is S, so the word is _ _ _ S _, so the last letter is the fifth.

""BULBS"" would be B U L B S -> so fourth is B? No, positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:B, 5:S -> but we need fourth to be S, so that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, S, letter5.

So for example:
- FUSSY? But we have S repeated and Y. But F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be S, which it is, but the third is also S. But we don't know if the word has multiple S's. However, we are trying to avoid repeats to test more letters.

But we know S is in the fourth position, but there might be another S? We don't know.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters if possible.

What words have S in the fourth position and use available letters?

Let's think:
- ...S. 

Examples:
- PLUS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
- We need 5-letter words.

Possible words:
- PULUS? Not a word.
- FUSEL? But E is eliminated.
- GUSSY? G U S S Y -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but S repeated and we don't know if there is a third S? Also, G and Y are new.

But we have two S's, which might not be efficient.

- BUSKY? B U S K Y -> 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y -> but the fourth letter is K, not S. We need the fourth to be S.

So the word must have the structure: ? ? ? S ?

So the third letter cannot be S if we want to avoid repetition? But it can be.

Let's search for words ending with ""S"" plus one letter? No, the fourth is S, so the last part is ""S?"".

Common endings: ""S"" followed by a letter, like ""ST"" but T is eliminated, ""SE"" E eliminated, ""SS"" but that would be S in fourth and fifth, ""SH"" H is available, etc.

Available endings: S + B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.

But we need the whole word.

Let's list some words:
- FUSSY: F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we have S in third and fourth. We know fourth is S, but third might be S or not. Also, F, U, Y are new.
- GASSY: G A S S Y -> but A is eliminated.
- LUSUS: not a word.
- PULPS: P U L P S -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:S -> fourth is P, not S. We need fourth to be S.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

The word is: position1, position2, position3, position4=S, position5.

So for ""PULPS"": position1=P, position2=U, position3=L, position4=P, position5=S -> so position4 is P, not S. So that doesn't work.

We need position4 to be S.

So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

Examples of such words:
- FOCUS: F O C U S -> positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:S -> position4 is U, not S.
- BASIS: B A S I S -> position4 is I, not S.

I need to think of words where the fourth letter is S.

Like:
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:S -> but T and R are eliminated.
- PRESS: P R E S S -> R and E eliminated.
- CROSS: C and R and O eliminated.
- FLOSS: F L O S S -> O eliminated.
- BLESS: B L E S S -> E eliminated.
- GLASS: G L A S S -> A eliminated.
- CLASS: C and A eliminated.

With available letters, what about:
- PLUSH: P L U S H -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> yes! Fourth is S.
- Plus, P, L, U, H are all new letters, and S is in the correct position.

Is ""PLUSH"" a valid word? Yes, meaning rich and luxurious.

Another one: ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> but S is in first and fourth, and we know S is in fourth, but if we put S in first, it might be confusing. Also, we are not sure if S is in first or not. But we can do that, but it might be better to avoid S in other positions to test new letters.

In ""PLUSH"", we have no S in other positions, so we test P, L, U, H, and confirm S in fourth.

Another word: ""FLUBS"": F L U B S -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:B, 5:S -> fourth is B, not S.

""FLUSH"": F L U S H -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> same as PLUSH but with F.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""BLUSH"": B L U S H -> but B, L, U, S, H.

Or ""SLUMP"": S L U M P -> but M is eliminated.

M is eliminated from guess 2.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

""PLUSH"": P, L, U, S, H
""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H
""BLUSH"": B, L, U, S, H

All are valid.

We can also consider words with Y, like ""SLUSHY"" but that's 6 letters.

Or ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> but has double S, and we are testing G, U, Y, but S is repeated.

To maximize new letters, ""PLUSH"" or ""FLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"" are good because they use four new letters and S in the correct position.

We can choose any of them. Let's pick ""FLUSH"" because F is a common letter.

But we also need to consider that U might be the vowel.

Another word: ""JUJUS"" - not common, and J is rare.

Or ""PUDUS"" - not common.

So I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.

But let's see if we can cover more letters. ""FLUSH"" has F, L, U, S, H.

We could use a word with different letters, like including D or G or P.

For example, ""PUDGY"" but P U D G Y -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:Y -> fourth is G, not S.

We need fourth to be S.

Another word: ""BUDAS"" - not a word.

""FUSED"" - E eliminated.

I think ""FLUSH"" is fine.

But we have ""PLUSH"" as well. Or ""SLUSH"" but S in first might be redundant if we are not testing it, but we know S is in fourth, so if we put S in first and it's not in the word, we get x, but we know it is in fourth, so it might be a waste. But if the word has two S's, we might get feedback.

However, to avoid confusion and test more new letters, it's better to not repeat S.

So ""FLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"".

Let's choose ""FLUSH"".

But we have to consider that we are on the third guess, and we have only 6 guesses total.

Another idea: we could use a word that has U in a different position to test if U is in the word and where.

In ""FLUSH"", U is in position 3.

Similarly, in ""PLUSH"", U is in position 3.

We don't know if U is in the word or not. We haven't tested U yet, but it's a common vowel.

So let's go with ""FLUSH"".

So guess: FLUSH

Feedback will tell us about F, L, U, S (which we know is correct), and H.

S is fixed, so we'll get feedback on the others.

We can also consider ""BUYLS"" - not a word.

I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **CRANE** had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated).
- **MOIST** had only S correct and in position 4 (M, O, I, T eliminated, and S must be in the 4th position of the secret word).

The secret word has the form: `_ _ _ S _`, and the eliminated letters are **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T**. The remaining available letters include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y, and U is the only untested vowel.

For the next guess:
- **S must be in the 4th position** to leverage the known correct placement.
- The guess should avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., F, L, U, H, P) to maximize information.
- A word like **FLUSH** fits well: it places S correctly in position 4, uses four new common letters (F, L, U, H), and avoids repeats. This will efficiently test for the presence of U (a key vowel) and other consonants.

No, the fourth is S, so the last part is ""S?"".\n\nCommon endings: ""S"" followed by a letter, like ""ST"" but T is eliminated, ""SE"" E eliminated, ""SS"" but that would be S in fourth and fifth, ""SH"" H is available, etc.\n\nAvailable endings: S + B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut we need the whole word.\n\nLet\'s list some words:\n- FUSSY: F U S S Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> but we have S in third and fourth. We know fourth is S, but third might be S or not. Also, F, U, Y are new.\n- GASSY: G A S S Y -> but A is eliminated.\n- LUSUS: not a word.\n- PULPS: P U L P S -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:S -> fourth is P, not S. We need fourth to be S.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the positions.\n\nThe word is: position1, position2, position3, position4=S, position5.\n\nSo for ""PULPS"": position1=P, position2=U, position3=L, position4=P, position5=S -> so position4 is P, not S. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need position4 to be S.\n\nSo the word must have the fourth letter as S.\n\nExamples of such words:\n- FOCUS: F O C U S -> positions: 1:F, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:S -> position4 is U, not S.\n- BASIS: B A S I S -> position4 is I, not S.\n\nI need to think of words where the fourth letter is S.\n\nLike:\n- TRUSS: T R U S S -> 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:S -> but T and R are eliminated.\n- PRESS: P R E S S -> R and E eliminated.\n- CROSS: C and R and O eliminated.\n- FLOSS: F L O S S -> O eliminated.\n- BLESS: B L E S S -> E eliminated.\n- GLASS: G L A S S -> A eliminated.\n- CLASS: C and A eliminated.\n\nWith available letters, what about:\n- PLUSH: P L U S H -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> yes! Fourth is S.\n- Plus, P, L, U, H are all new letters, and S is in the correct position.\n\nIs ""PLUSH"" a valid word? Yes, meaning rich and luxurious.\n\nAnother one: ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> but S is in first and fourth, and we know S is in fourth, but if we put S in first, it might be confusing. Also, we are not sure if S is in first or not. But we can do that, but it might be better to avoid S in other positions to test new letters.\n\nIn ""PLUSH"", we have no S in other positions, so we test P, L, U, H, and confirm S in fourth.\n\nAnother word: ""FLUBS"": F L U B S -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:B, 5:S -> fourth is B, not S.\n\n""FLUSH"": F L U S H -> 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> same as PLUSH but with F.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLUSH"": B L U S H -> but B, L, U, S, H.\n\nOr ""SLUMP"": S L U M P -> but M is eliminated.\n\nM is eliminated from guess 2.\n\nSo available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y\n\n""PLUSH"": P, L, U, S, H\n""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H\n""BLUSH"": B, L, U, S, H\n\nAll are valid.\n\nWe can also consider words with Y, like ""SLUSHY"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nOr ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> but has double S, and we are testing G, U, Y, but S is repeated.\n\nTo maximize new letters, ""PLUSH"" or ""FLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"" are good because they use four new letters and S in the correct position.\n\nWe can choose any of them. Let\'s pick ""FLUSH"" because F is a common letter.\n\nBut we also need to consider that U might be the vowel.\n\nAnother word: ""JUJUS"" - not common, and J is rare.\n\nOr ""PUDUS"" - not common.\n\nSo I think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can cover more letters. ""FLUSH"" has F, L, U, S, H.\n\nWe could use a word with different letters, like including D or G or P.\n\nFor example, ""PUDGY"" but P U D G Y -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:Y -> fourth is G, not S.\n\nWe need fourth to be S.\n\nAnother word: ""BUDAS"" - not a word.\n\n""FUSED"" - E eliminated.\n\nI think ""FLUSH"" is fine.\n\nBut we have ""PLUSH"" as well. Or ""SLUSH"" but S in first might be redundant if we are not testing it, but we know S is in fourth, so if we put S in first and it\'s not in the word, we get x, but we know it is in fourth, so it might be a waste. But if the word has two S\'s, we might get feedback.\n\nHowever, to avoid confusion and test more new letters, it\'s better to not repeat S.\n\nSo ""FLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"" or ""BLUSH"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""FLUSH"".\n\nBut we have to consider that we are on the third guess, and we have only 6 guesses total.\n\nAnother idea: we could use a word that has U in a different position to test if U is in the word and where.\n\nIn ""FLUSH"", U is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PLUSH"", U is in position 3.\n\nWe don\'t know if U is in the word or not. We haven\'t tested U yet, but it\'s a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""FLUSH"".\n\nSo guess: FLUSH\n\nFeedback will tell us about F, L, U, S (which we know is correct), and H.\n\nS is fixed, so we\'ll get feedback on the others.\n\nWe can also consider ""BUYLS"" - not a word.\n\nI think ""FLUSH"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **CRANE** had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated).\n- **MOIST** had only S correct and in position 4 (M, O, I, T eliminated, and S must be in the 4th position of the secret word).\n\nThe secret word has the form: `_ _ _ S _`, and the eliminated letters are **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T**. The remaining available letters include common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y, and U is the only untested vowel.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- **S must be in the 4th position** to leverage the known correct placement.\n- The guess should avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., F, L, U, H, P) to maximize information.\n- A word like **FLUSH** fits well: it places S correctly in position 4, uses four new common letters (F, L, U, H), and avoids repeats. This will efficiently test for the presence of U (a key vowel) and other consonants.\n\n<guess>FLUSH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLUSH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) U(-) S(✓) H(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated)
2. MOIST: only S is correct and in the correct position (4th), so M, O, I, T eliminated. Secret word: _ _ _ S _
3. FLUSH: 
   - F(x) -> absent, so F eliminated
   - L(x) -> absent, so L eliminated
   - U(-) -> present but wrong position (so U is in the word, but not in position 3)
   - S(✓) -> correct and in position 4 (already known)
   - H(-) -> present but wrong position (so H is in the word, but not in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ _ S _
- It contains U and H, but U is not in position 3 and H is not in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, L
- Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and we know U and H are in the word.

Since U and H are present but in wrong positions, we need to place them in the word.

Possible positions for U: it cannot be in position 3 (from FLUSH), and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.

Similarly, H cannot be in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But position 3 is still open, so H could be in position 3? But we don't know yet.

Also, we have two letters that must be included: U and H.

We need to form a word that:
- Has S in position 4
- Includes U and H (each exactly once? or possibly more? but we don't know, so we assume at least one each)
- Avoids eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,F,L

Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

But note: H and U are already known to be in the word, so we can use them, but we are trying to find their positions.

We should also test other new letters to get more information.

The word must have at least three letters: two of which are U and H, and the third is S (fixed at position 4), and two more.

Since we have two known letters (U and H) to place, and we know S is fixed, we have to assign U and H to two of the three remaining positions (1,2,5) but note that H cannot be in 5 (from FLUSH feedback: H was in position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me check.

In FLUSH: 
  Position 1: F (absent)
  Position 2: L (absent)
  Position 3: U (present but wrong position) -> so U is not in 3
  Position 4: S (correct)
  Position 5: H (present but wrong position) -> so H is not in 5

Therefore, H cannot be in position 5, and U cannot be in position 3.

So for the secret word, positions:
1: can be U, H, or a new letter
2: can be U, H, or a new letter
3: can be H (since U cannot be here) or a new letter (but not U)
4: S (fixed)
5: can be U (since H cannot be here) or a new letter (but not H)

So the possibilities for U: positions 1, 2, or 5.
For H: positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and also introduces new letters.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,F,L

Available: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, and H (but H is already in the word, so we can use it, but we are testing its position).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters left: D, G, P, B, Y, W, etc.

We also note that the word must have a vowel. The only vowel left is U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). So U must be the vowel in the word. Therefore, U is definitely in the word, which we already know.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

We need a word: [pos1][pos2][pos3]S[pos5]

With U and H in the word, and not in the forbidden positions.

Possible words:

- If U is in position 1: then the word starts with U, then we have _ _ S _ , and H must be in position 2 or 3 (since not 5). For example: U _ H S _ ? But what words? UGH? not 5 letters.

  - ""UGH"" is 3 letters. We need 5.

  - ""USUAL"" but U in position1, S in position2? But we need S in position4. Not matching.

  - ""USHER"" but E and R eliminated.

  - ""USHED"" E eliminated.

  - Not many common words.

- If U is in position 2: then the word is _ U _ S _ 

  And H can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But H cannot be in position 5, so H in position 1 or 3.

  Examples:
    - If H in position 1: H U _ S _
      - ""HUSKY"" -> H U S K Y -> but S is in position 3, not 4. We need S in position 4.
      - ""HUMUS"" -> H U M U S -> M eliminated, and S in position 5, not 4.
      - ""HUTCH"" -> H U T C H -> T and C eliminated.

    - If H in position 3: _ U H S _
      - ""GUH"" not 5 letters.
      - ""BUHLS"" not a word.
      - ""DUCHY"" -> D U C H Y -> C eliminated.
      - ""PUSHY"" -> P U S H Y -> but S is in position 3, not 4.

  This is difficult.

- If U is in position 5: then the word is _ _ _ S U

  And H can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

  Examples:
    - ""BPSHU"" not a word.
    - ""DASHU"" not a word.
    - ""GYPSY"" -> G Y P S Y -> S in position 4, and Y is available. But no U? We need U in position 5. This has Y in position 5.

  We need the fifth letter to be U.

  So words ending with ""SU"": like ""OASIS"" but O and A eliminated.

  ""BASIS"" A eliminated.

  ""VERSUS"" E and R eliminated.

  ""FOCUS"" O and C eliminated.

  ""SUCCU"" not a word.

  ""SUDSU"" not a word.

  How about ""PUDUS""? Not common, but it's an animal. P U D U S -> but that's 5 letters: positions 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:U, 5:S? No, we need position 4 to be S and position 5 to be U.

  So the word must end with ""SU""? But that's not common. Words ending with SU are rare.

  Alternatively, words like ""THUMBSUP"" too long.

  I think I need to look for words that have S in position 4 and U in position 5.

  For example, ""BANTU"" is 5 letters but S not in 4th.

  ""MENSU"" not a word.

  ""VODOU"" not a word.

  ""BAYOU"" -> B A Y O U -> A and O eliminated.

  ""SNAFU"" -> S N A F U -> S in position 1, not 4.

  This is challenging.

Another possibility: U in position 1 and H in position 2: U H _ S _

But what can be in position 3? And position 5?

For example, ""UH"" is not a word, but 5-letter words starting with UH are rare.

""UHLAN"" -> U H L A N -> L and A and N eliminated.

Not possible.

U in position 1 and H in position 3: U _ H S _

Like ""UPPISH"" but that's 6 letters.

""UPH"" not 5.

""USHED"" E eliminated.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have more than one U or H? But we don't know.

From FLUSH, we have U and H present, but we don't know if they appear multiple times.

But to keep it simple, let's assume one each for now.

Given the difficulty, let's try to use a word that has U in position 5 and H in position 1 or 2 or 3.

For example, with U in position 5: _ _ _ S U

And H in position 1: H _ _ S U

Words: 
- ""HASSU"" not a word.
- ""HUSHU"" not a word.
- ""HYPOSU"" not 5.

With H in position 2: _ H _ S U
- ""AHISU"" not a word.
- ""PHYSU"" not a word.

With H in position 3: _ _ H S U
- ""BAHSU"" not a word.
- ""DAHSU"" not a word.
- ""GAHSU"" not a word.

This is not working.

Perhaps U in position 2 and H in position 1: H U _ S _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Position 3 cannot be U (since U is in 2) and cannot be eliminated letter.

Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y

And position 5: similarly.

For example, ""HUSKY"" -> H U S K Y -> but S is in position 3, not 4. We need position 4 to be S.

""HUDUD"" not common.

""HUMPY"" M eliminated.

Another idea: U in position 2 and H in position 3: _ U H S _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

For example, ""GUH"" not 5 letters.

""BUHLS"" not a word.

""DUCHY"" -> D U C H Y -> C eliminated.

""PUSHY"" -> P U S H Y -> S in position 3, not 4.

We need position 4 to be S, so in this pattern, position 4 is S, so the word is _ U H S _

So for example, ""P U H S ?"" -> what can be the first and last letters?

""Puh"" is not a word, and adding S and then a letter: ""Puhs"" is not a word.

""Buh"" not a word.

Perhaps ""VUHS"" not a word.

I think we need to consider that the word might have U in position 5 and H in position 2 or 3.

Let's list all possible words that have S in position 4 and use only available letters and include U and H.

Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, and H.

But H and U are already in the word, so we must include them.

So the word must contain at least U and H, and S in position 4.

Possible words:

- ""PUDUS"" - a type of deer. P U D U S -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:U, 5:S -> but position 4 is U, not S. And position 5 is S, not U. We need position 4 to be S.

- ""HUSSY"" -> H U S S Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> position 4 is S, good. And it has H and U. Also, Y is available.

  But we have S in position 3 and 4. We know S is in position 4, but position 3 might also be S? We don't know.

  Also, ""HUSSY"" is a valid word.

  Let's check the letters: H, U, S, S, Y.

  Eliminated letters: we have S, which is allowed because we know it's in the word, but we are testing if there is another S.

  Also, H and U are already known to be in the word.

  But in this word, H is in position 1, U in position 2, S in position 3 and 4, Y in position 5.

  Feedback for position 3: if it's S, and if the secret word has S only in position 4, then position 3 would be marked as absent or present? If the secret word has only one S, then position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word in that position, but since there's only one S and it's in position 4, position 3 S would be extra.

  But if the secret word has two S's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position or correct? If position 3 is also S, then it would be correct if the secret word has S in position 3.

  But we don't know.

  However, we can use this to test.

  Also, we are testing Y in position 5.

  But we know from FLUSH that H is not in position 5, but in ""HUSSY"", H is in position 1, so that's fine.

  U is in position 2, which is allowed (not position 3).

  So ""HUSSY"" could be a candidate.

  But it has two S's, which might not be ideal for information, but it's a possibility.

- ""BUSHY"" -> B U S H Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> position 4 is H, not S. Not good.

- ""PUSHY"" -> P U S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.

- ""GUSHY"" -> G U S H Y -> position 4 is H.

- ""DASHY"" -> D A S H Y -> A eliminated.

- ""JUDAS"" -> J U D A S -> A eliminated.

- ""WUSHU"" -> W U S H U -> positions: 1:W, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:U -> position 4 is H, not S.

- ""BUSH"" is 4 letters.

Another word: ""SUDDS"" -> S U D D S -> position 1:S, not 4.

I think ""HUSSY"" is a possibility, but let's see if there are better words.

Another idea: ""SHUSH"" -> S H U S H -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> position 4 is S, good. It has H and U.

But it has two S's and two H's.

And position 1 is S, which we don't know if it's in the word or not, but we know S is in position 4, so position 1 might be another S or not.

But in this case, we are testing S in position 1 and 4, and H in position 2 and 5, and U in position 3.

But from FLUSH, U cannot be in position 3, but in ""SHUSH"", U is in position 3, which is the same as in FLUSH, and in FLUSH it was marked as present but wrong position, so it should not be in position 3. So if we put U in position 3 again, it will be wrong again, so it's a waste.

So ""SHUSH"" is not good because U is in position 3, which is forbidden.

Similarly, any word with U in position 3 is not allowed.

So back to ""HUSSY"": U is in position 2, which is allowed, and H in position 1, which is allowed.

Position 3 is S, which we don't know.

Another word: ""PUSSY"" -> P U S S Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> position 4 is S, good. It has U and P and Y.

But again, S in position 3.

Or ""BUSKS"" -> B U S K S -> position 4 is K, not S.

""BUSES"" E eliminated.

""DUSTS"" D U S T S -> T eliminated.

""GUSSY"" -> G U S S Y -> same as above.

""JUSGS"" not a word.

Perhaps ""WHUPS"" -> W H U P S -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:U, 4:P, 5:S -> position 4 is P, not S.

Not good.

""YUKSY"" not a word.

I think we have to go with a word like ""HUSSY"" or ""PUSSY"".

But let's think of words with U in position 5.

For example, ""BEGUN"" E eliminated.

"" BUGJU"" not a word.

"" DRUGS"" D R U G S -> R eliminated.

"" PLUGS"" P L U G S -> L eliminated.

"" SUGAR"" S U G A R -> A and R eliminated.

"" SWUNG"" S W U N G -> N eliminated.

"" VAGUe E eliminated.

It's very hard.

Another possibility: ""USQUE"" not common, and U in position 1.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have Y as a vowel, but we already have U.

Or maybe the word is ""SYNCH"" but N and C eliminated.

I think we have to use a word that has S in position 4 and includes U and H, even if it has repeated letters.

So let's choose ""HUSSY"".

But in ""HUSSY"", we have:
- H in position 1: we will see if it's correct or not.
- U in position 2: correct or not.
- S in position 3: will be feedback if it's in the word or not.
- S in position 4: correct.
- Y in position 5: will be feedback.

And we know U and H are in the word, so if H in position 1 is correct, we get a check, else if it's present but wrong position, we get a dash, etc.

Similarly for U.

Also, if position 3 S is absent, it means there is only one S, in position 4.

If it's present, then there are two S's.

So it gives information.

Similarly, Y is new.

So let's go with ""HUSSY"".

But is ""HUSSY"" allowed? Yes, it's a word.

Another option: ""PUSSY"" with P.

But P is also a common letter.

We could choose ""PUSSY"" to test P.

But ""HUSSY"" tests H in position 1 and U in position 2, which are both possible positions.

So I think ""HUSSY"" is a reasonable guess.

So guess: HUSSY

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has H in position 1, then we get H(✓), else if H is not in 1 but in the word, we get H(-), etc.

Similarly for U.

And for S in position 3, if it's not in the word, we get S(x), which would mean only one S in position 4.

If it's in the word, we get S( something).

So it's informative.

Therefore, I'll go with ""HUSSY"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). These letters are eliminated.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**: Only S is correct and in position 4 (✓). M, O, I, T are absent (x) and eliminated. The secret word must have S in the 4th position: `_ _ _ S _`.
   - **Guess 3 (FLUSH)**:
     - F and L are absent (x), so F and L are eliminated.
     - U is present but in the wrong position (-), so U is in the secret word but not in position 3.
     - S is correct in position 4 (✓), confirming the pattern.
     - H is present but in the wrong position (-), so H is in the secret word but not in position 5.
   
   **Summary**:
   - Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ S _`
   - Confirmed letters in the word: **U** and **H** (both must appear, but U ≠ position 3, H ≠ position 5).
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, L (cannot appear).
   - Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y (and U/H are in the word but positions unknown).

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **U** can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (not 3, per FLUSH feedback).
   - **H** can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 5, per FLUSH feedback).
   - **S** is fixed in position 4.
   - The secret word must include U and H, and U is the only remaining vowel (A, E, I, O eliminated).
   - The guess should prioritize:
     - Testing possible positions for U and H.
     - Covering new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, D, G, P, Y) to maximize information.
     - Avoiding eliminated letters and repeating known positions (e.g., S in position 4 is fixed, so it can be reused but should not be moved).

3. **Brainstorming Possible Words**:
   - Words must fit `_ _ _ S _` and include U and H, with U not in position 3 and H not in position 5.
   - Options considered:
     - **HUSSY**: Tests H in position 1, U in position 2, S in position 3 (new test), S in position 4 (fixed), and Y in position 5. This efficiently checks common positions for H and U while introducing Y. It also tests if S appears elsewhere (position 3).
     - Alternatives like PUSSY or BUSHY were rejected (PUSSY has S in position 3 but doesn't test H; BUSHY has S in position 3 and H in position 4, conflicting with fixed S in position 4).
   - Why **HUSSY**?
     - Covers positions: H (position 1), U (position 2), S (position 3, new test), S (position 4, fixed), Y (position 5).
     - Tests if H belongs in position 1, U in position 2, or if S is duplicated.
     - Uses new letters (Y) and avoids eliminated letters.
     - If S in position 3 is absent (x), it confirms only one S (in position 4). If present (-/✓), it reveals more about S duplicates.

4. **Expected Information Gain**:
   - Feedback on H (position 1) and U (position 2) will help narrow their positions.
   - Feedback on S (position 3) will indicate if S is duplicated.
   - Feedback on Y (position 5) tests a new vowel-like letter.
   - This guess will significantly reduce possibilities for the next guess, especially with only 3 tries left.

<guess>HUSSY</guess>",HUSSY,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated)
2. MOIST: only S is correct and in the correct position (4th), so M, O, I, T eliminated. Secret word: _ _ _ S _
3. FLUSH: 
   - F(x) -> absent, so F eliminated
   - L(x) -> absent, so L eliminated
   - U(-) -> present but wrong position (so U is in the word, but not in position 3)
   - S(✓) -> correct and in position 4 (already known)
   - H(-) -> present but wrong position (so H is in the word, but not in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ _ S _
- It contains U and H, but U is not in position 3 and H is not in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, L
- Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and we know U and H are in the word.

Since U and H are present but in wrong positions, we need to place them in the word.

Possible positions for U: it cannot be in position 3 (from FLUSH), and it must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.

Similarly, H cannot be in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But position 3 is still open, so H could be in position 3? But we don't know yet.

Also, we have two letters that must be included: U and H.

We need to form a word that:
- Has S in position 4
- Includes U and H (each exactly once? or possibly more? but we don't know, so we assume at least one each)
- Avoids eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,F,L

Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

But note: H and U are already known to be in the word, so we can use them, but we are trying to find their positions.

We should also test other new letters to get more information.

The word must have at least three letters: two of which are U and H, and the third is S (fixed at position 4), and two more.

Since we have two known letters (U and H) to place, and we know S is fixed, we have to assign U and H to two of the three remaining positions (1,2,5) but note that H cannot be in 5 (from FLUSH feedback: H was in position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me check.

In FLUSH: 
  Position 1: F (absent)
  Position 2: L (absent)
  Position 3: U (present but wrong position) -> so U is not in 3
  Position 4: S (correct)
  Position 5: H (present but wrong position) -> so H is not in 5

Therefore, H cannot be in position 5, and U cannot be in position 3.

So for the secret word, positions:
1: can be U, H, or a new letter
2: can be U, H, or a new letter
3: can be H (since U cannot be here) or a new letter (but not U)
4: S (fixed)
5: can be U (since H cannot be here) or a new letter (but not H)

So the possibilities for U: positions 1, 2, or 5.
For H: positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and also introduces new letters.

We have to avoid eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,F,L

Available: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, and H (but H is already in the word, so we can use it, but we are testing its position).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters left: D, G, P, B, Y, W, etc.

We also note that the word must have a vowel. The only vowel left is U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). So U must be the vowel in the word. Therefore, U is definitely in the word, which we already know.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

We need a word: [pos1][pos2][pos3]S[pos5]

With U and H in the word, and not in the forbidden positions.

Possible words:

- If U is in position 1: then the word starts with U, then we have _ _ S _ , and H must be in position 2 or 3 (since not 5). For example: U _ H S _ ? But what words? UGH? not 5 letters.

  - ""UGH"" is 3 letters. We need 5.

  - ""USUAL"" but U in position1, S in position2? But we need S in position4. Not matching.

  - ""USHER"" but E and R eliminated.

  - ""USHED"" E eliminated.

  - Not many common words.

- If U is in position 2: then the word is _ U _ S _ 

  And H can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But H cannot be in position 5, so H in position 1 or 3.

  Examples:
    - If H in position 1: H U _ S _
      - ""HUSKY"" -> H U S K Y -> but S is in position 3, not 4. We need S in position 4.
      - ""HUMUS"" -> H U M U S -> M eliminated, and S in position 5, not 4.
      - ""HUTCH"" -> H U T C H -> T and C eliminated.

    - If H in position 3: _ U H S _
      - ""GUH"" not 5 letters.
      - ""BUHLS"" not a word.
      - ""DUCHY"" -> D U C H Y -> C eliminated.
      - ""PUSHY"" -> P U S H Y -> but S is in position 3, not 4.

  This is difficult.

- If U is in position 5: then the word is _ _ _ S U

  And H can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

  Examples:
    - ""BPSHU"" not a word.
    - ""DASHU"" not a word.
    - ""GYPSY"" -> G Y P S Y -> S in position 4, and Y is available. But no U? We need U in position 5. This has Y in position 5.

  We need the fifth letter to be U.

  So words ending with ""SU"": like ""OASIS"" but O and A eliminated.

  ""BASIS"" A eliminated.

  ""VERSUS"" E and R eliminated.

  ""FOCUS"" O and C eliminated.

  ""SUCCU"" not a word.

  ""SUDSU"" not a word.

  How about ""PUDUS""? Not common, but it's an animal. P U D U S -> but that's 5 letters: positions 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:U, 5:S? No, we need position 4 to be S and position 5 to be U.

  So the word must end with ""SU""? But that's not common. Words ending with SU are rare.

  Alternatively, words like ""THUMBSUP"" too long.

  I think I need to look for words that have S in position 4 and U in position 5.

  For example, ""BANTU"" is 5 letters but S not in 4th.

  ""MENSU"" not a word.

  ""VODOU"" not a word.

  ""BAYOU"" -> B A Y O U -> A and O eliminated.

  ""SNAFU"" -> S N A F U -> S in position 1, not 4.

  This is challenging.

Another possibility: U in position 1 and H in position 2: U H _ S _

But what can be in position 3? And position 5?

For example, ""UH"" is not a word, but 5-letter words starting with UH are rare.

""UHLAN"" -> U H L A N -> L and A and N eliminated.

Not possible.

U in position 1 and H in position 3: U _ H S _

Like ""UPPISH"" but that's 6 letters.

""UPH"" not 5.

""USHED"" E eliminated.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have more than one U or H? But we don't know.

From FLUSH, we have U and H present, but we don't know if they appear multiple times.

But to keep it simple, let's assume one each for now.

Given the difficulty, let's try to use a word that has U in position 5 and H in position 1 or 2 or 3.

For example, with U in position 5: _ _ _ S U

And H in position 1: H _ _ S U

Words: 
- ""HASSU"" not a word.
- ""HUSHU"" not a word.
- ""HYPOSU"" not 5.

With H in position 2: _ H _ S U
- ""AHISU"" not a word.
- ""PHYSU"" not a word.

With H in position 3: _ _ H S U
- ""BAHSU"" not a word.
- ""DAHSU"" not a word.
- ""GAHSU"" not a word.

This is not working.

Perhaps U in position 2 and H in position 1: H U _ S _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Position 3 cannot be U (since U is in 2) and cannot be eliminated letter.

Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y

And position 5: similarly.

For example, ""HUSKY"" -> H U S K Y -> but S is in position 3, not 4. We need position 4 to be S.

""HUDUD"" not common.

""HUMPY"" M eliminated.

Another idea: U in position 2 and H in position 3: _ U H S _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

For example, ""GUH"" not 5 letters.

""BUHLS"" not a word.

""DUCHY"" -> D U C H Y -> C eliminated.

""PUSHY"" -> P U S H Y -> S in position 3, not 4.

We need position 4 to be S, so in this pattern, position 4 is S, so the word is _ U H S _

So for example, ""P U H S ?"" -> what can be the first and last letters?

""Puh"" is not a word, and adding S and then a letter: ""Puhs"" is not a word.

""Buh"" not a word.

Perhaps ""VUHS"" not a word.

I think we need to consider that the word might have U in position 5 and H in position 2 or 3.

Let's list all possible words that have S in position 4 and use only available letters and include U and H.

Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, and H.

But H and U are already in the word, so we must include them.

So the word must contain at least U and H, and S in position 4.

Possible words:

- ""PUDUS"" - a type of deer. P U D U S -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:D, 4:U, 5:S -> but position 4 is U, not S. And position 5 is S, not U. We need position 4 to be S.

- ""HUSSY"" -> H U S S Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> position 4 is S, good. And it has H and U. Also, Y is available.

  But we have S in position 3 and 4. We know S is in position 4, but position 3 might also be S? We don't know.

  Also, ""HUSSY"" is a valid word.

  Let's check the letters: H, U, S, S, Y.

  Eliminated letters: we have S, which is allowed because we know it's in the word, but we are testing if there is another S.

  Also, H and U are already known to be in the word.

  But in this word, H is in position 1, U in position 2, S in position 3 and 4, Y in position 5.

  Feedback for position 3: if it's S, and if the secret word has S only in position 4, then position 3 would be marked as absent or present? If the secret word has only one S, then position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word in that position, but since there's only one S and it's in position 4, position 3 S would be extra.

  But if the secret word has two S's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position or correct? If position 3 is also S, then it would be correct if the secret word has S in position 3.

  But we don't know.

  However, we can use this to test.

  Also, we are testing Y in position 5.

  But we know from FLUSH that H is not in position 5, but in ""HUSSY"", H is in position 1, so that's fine.

  U is in position 2, which is allowed (not position 3).

  So ""HUSSY"" could be a candidate.

  But it has two S's, which might not be ideal for information, but it's a possibility.

- ""BUSHY"" -> B U S H Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> position 4 is H, not S. Not good.

- ""PUSHY"" -> P U S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.

- ""GUSHY"" -> G U S H Y -> position 4 is H.

- ""DASHY"" -> D A S H Y -> A eliminated.

- ""JUDAS"" -> J U D A S -> A eliminated.

- ""WUSHU"" -> W U S H U -> positions: 1:W, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:U -> position 4 is H, not S.

- ""BUSH"" is 4 letters.

Another word: ""SUDDS"" -> S U D D S -> position 1:S, not 4.

I think ""HUSSY"" is a possibility, but let's see if there are better words.

Another idea: ""SHUSH"" -> S H U S H -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H -> position 4 is S, good. It has H and U.

But it has two S's and two H's.

And position 1 is S, which we don't know if it's in the word or not, but we know S is in position 4, so position 1 might be another S or not.

But in this case, we are testing S in position 1 and 4, and H in position 2 and 5, and U in position 3.

But from FLUSH, U cannot be in position 3, but in ""SHUSH"", U is in position 3, which is the same as in FLUSH, and in FLUSH it was marked as present but wrong position, so it should not be in position 3. So if we put U in position 3 again, it will be wrong again, so it's a waste.

So ""SHUSH"" is not good because U is in position 3, which is forbidden.

Similarly, any word with U in position 3 is not allowed.

So back to ""HUSSY"": U is in position 2, which is allowed, and H in position 1, which is allowed.

Position 3 is S, which we don't know.

Another word: ""PUSSY"" -> P U S S Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> position 4 is S, good. It has U and P and Y.

But again, S in position 3.

Or ""BUSKS"" -> B U S K S -> position 4 is K, not S.

""BUSES"" E eliminated.

""DUSTS"" D U S T S -> T eliminated.

""GUSSY"" -> G U S S Y -> same as above.

""JUSGS"" not a word.

Perhaps ""WHUPS"" -> W H U P S -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:U, 4:P, 5:S -> position 4 is P, not S.

Not good.

""YUKSY"" not a word.

I think we have to go with a word like ""HUSSY"" or ""PUSSY"".

But let's think of words with U in position 5.

For example, ""BEGUN"" E eliminated.

"" BUGJU"" not a word.

"" DRUGS"" D R U G S -> R eliminated.

"" PLUGS"" P L U G S -> L eliminated.

"" SUGAR"" S U G A R -> A and R eliminated.

"" SWUNG"" S W U N G -> N eliminated.

"" VAGUe E eliminated.

It's very hard.

Another possibility: ""USQUE"" not common, and U in position 1.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have Y as a vowel, but we already have U.

Or maybe the word is ""SYNCH"" but N and C eliminated.

I think we have to use a word that has S in position 4 and includes U and H, even if it has repeated letters.

So let's choose ""HUSSY"".

But in ""HUSSY"", we have:
- H in position 1: we will see if it's correct or not.
- U in position 2: correct or not.
- S in position 3: will be feedback if it's in the word or not.
- S in position 4: correct.
- Y in position 5: will be feedback.

And we know U and H are in the word, so if H in position 1 is correct, we get a check, else if it's present but wrong position, we get a dash, etc.

Similarly for U.

Also, if position 3 S is absent, it means there is only one S, in position 4.

If it's present, then there are two S's.

So it gives information.

Similarly, Y is new.

So let's go with ""HUSSY"".

But is ""HUSSY"" allowed? Yes, it's a word.

Another option: ""PUSSY"" with P.

But P is also a common letter.

We could choose ""PUSSY"" to test P.

But ""HUSSY"" tests H in position 1 and U in position 2, which are both possible positions.

So I think ""HUSSY"" is a reasonable guess.

So guess: HUSSY

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has H in position 1, then we get H(✓), else if H is not in 1 but in the word, we get H(-), etc.

Similarly for U.

And for S in position 3, if it's not in the word, we get S(x), which would mean only one S in position 4.

If it's in the word, we get S( something).

So it's informative.

Therefore, I'll go with ""HUSSY"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). These letters are eliminated.
   - **Guess 2 (MOIST)**: Only S is correct and in position 4 (✓). M, O, I, T are absent (x) and eliminated. The secret word must have S in the 4th position: `_ _ _ S _`.
   - **Guess 3 (FLUSH)**:
     - F and L are absent (x), so F and L are eliminated.
     - U is present but in the wrong position (-), so U is in the secret word but not in position 3.
     - S is correct in position 4 (✓), confirming the pattern.
     - H is present but in the wrong position (-), so H is in the secret word but not in position 5.
   
   **Summary**:
   - Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ S _`
   - Confirmed letters in the word: **U** and **H** (both must appear, but U ≠ position 3, H ≠ position 5).
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, L (cannot appear).
   - Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y (and U/H are in the word but positions unknown).

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **U** can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (not 3, per FLUSH feedback).
   - **H** can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 5, per FLUSH feedback).
   - **S** is fixed in position 4.
   - The secret word must include U and H, and U is the only remaining vowel (A, E, I, O eliminated).
   - The guess should prioritize:
     - Testing possible positions for U and H.
     - Covering new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, D, G, P, Y) to maximize information.
     - Avoiding eliminated letters and repeating known positions (e.g., S in position 4 is fixed, so it can be reused but should not be moved).

3. **Brainstorming Possible Words**:
   - Words must fit `_ _ _ S _` and include U and H, with U not in position 3 and H not in position 5.
   - Options considered:
     - **HUSSY**: Tests H in position 1, U in position 2, S in position 3 (new test), S in position 4 (fixed), and Y in position 5. This efficiently checks common positions for H and U while introducing Y. It also tests if S appears elsewhere (position 3).
     - Alternatives like PUSSY or BUSHY were rejected (PUSSY has S in position 3 but doesn't test H; BUSHY has S in position 3 and H in position 4, conflicting with fixed S in position 4).
   - Why **HUSSY**?
     - Covers positions: H (position 1), U (position 2), S (position 3, new test), S (position 4, fixed), Y (position 5).
     - Tests if H belongs in position 1, U in position 2, or if S is duplicated.
     - Uses new letters (Y) and avoids eliminated letters.
     - If S in position 3 is absent (x), it confirms only one S (in position 4). If present (-/✓), it reveals more about S duplicates.

4. **Expected Information Gain**:
   - Feedback on H (position 1) and U (position 2) will help narrow their positions.
   - Feedback on S (position 3) will indicate if S is duplicated.
   - Feedback on Y (position 5) tests a new vowel-like letter.
   - This guess will significantly reduce possibilities for the next guess, especially with only 3 tries left.",Guess 4: HUSSY -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
