We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is present but not in the third position (marked with '-', so it's in the word but wrong position).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions we guessed (so C is not at position 1, and A is not at position 3).
- The secret word does NOT contain R, N, E.

Additionally, since C and A are in the word but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively, they must appear in other positions.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Uses the known present letters (C and A) in positions different from the first guess.
- Avoids the absent letters (R, N, E).
- Includes other common letters to test.

Since C was not in position 1 and A not in position 3, they could be in positions 2,4,5 (for C) and positions 1,2,4,5 (for A) but avoiding the known absent positions.

Possible positions:
- C: can be in 2,4,5 (since position 1 is not correct)
- A: can be in 1,2,4,5 (since position 3 is not correct)

But note, the feedback does not tell us which positions they are in, only that they are present and not in the positions we guessed.

We also know the secret word does not contain R, N, E, so we must avoid those.

For the next guess, we should try a word that contains C and A, and includes new common letters to test, while placing C and A in positions we haven't tried for them.

Common letters: after vowels A, E (but E is absent, so we don't use E), we can try other vowels: I, O, U, and consonants like L, T, S, etc.

But note: we must consider the positions.

Also, we don't know the exact positions of C and A, so we can try placing them in different positions.

Possible strategy: 
- We can try a word that has C in the second position and A in the fourth, for example, or other combinations.

Let me think of words that have the letters C and A, without R, N, E.

Some words: 
- PLACE: has P, L, A, C, E -> but E is absent, so cannot use because E is in the word.
- BASIC: has B, A, S, I, C -> no E, R, N? Actually, doesn't have R, N, E.

Check the letters: BASIC: B, A, S, I, C -> none of R, N, E.

Also, positions: 
- We want to test C not in position 1: in BASIC, C is in position 5? Let's see: 
  B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), C (5). 
But remember, in our feedback, A was present but not in position 3. In BASIC, A is in position 2 which is a new position, so that's okay. And C is in position 5, which is different from position 1. So this word might be suitable.

But note: we also need to consider that the feedback told us C is in the word (so we should include it) and A is in the word (so we include it). And BASIC does that.

Another option: CLASS? But that has S repeated? Also, CLASS has S at the end? And we don't know about S yet. But note, CLASS: C (1), L (2), A (3), S (4), S (5). However, we have A in position 3, but in the first guess we had A in position 3 and it was marked present but wrong position. Actually, the feedback for the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked with '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback doesn't prohibit that? Wait, no: the secret word does not have A in position 3, so we know A is not at position 3. Therefore, we should not put A at position 3 in our next guess because we already know that position is wrong. Similarly, we know C is not at position 1.

Therefore, in CLASS, we are putting C at position 1? We shouldn't because we know C is not at position 1. And A at position 3? Also we know it's not at position 3. So CLASS is not a good choice.

Therefore, BASIC: 
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, so we can test here)
- Position 3: S (new letter)
- Position 4: I (new vowel)
- Position 5: C (C is at a new position, not position 1)

This seems acceptable.

Alternative word: COAST? But that has O (which we don't know about) and S, T. But it also has A in position 3? We can't put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. Also, C is at position 1? We know it's not at position 1. So COAST is invalid because we are repeating known wrong positions.

But note: we cannot use O because we don't know if it's absent or not? Actually, we can use any letter except R, N, E. But we must avoid known absent letters.

Wait, feedback for the first guess told us R, N, E are absent. So we must avoid them. O is not yet tested, so it's okay.

But putting C at 1 and A at 3 in COAST? We know both positions are incorrect, so we shouldn't. Therefore, we must choose a word that puts C and A in positions other than 1 for C and other than 3 for A.

In BASIC, A is at position 2 (not 3) and C is at position 5 (not 1). So that's good.

Other words: AUDIO? But that doesn't have C. We know C is present so we must include C to gather more information about its position and to use the known present letter.

We have two known present letters: C and A. So we should include both to get more feedback.

Another word: CLAIM? But CLAIM has C at position 1? We can't do that because we know C is not at position 1. Also, A at position 3? But A is not at position 3. So CLAIM is bad for positions.

Another: MUSIC? That has M, U, S, I, C -> positions: M (1), U (2), S (3), I (4), C (5). And A is missing. But we must include A because it is present. We know A is in the word so we should include it to get position information.

So BASIC seems to be a good candidate.

Alternatively: PATIO? But that has no C. We must have C? Actually, we don't absolutely have to include C and A in every guess? But if we don't, we don't get information about their positions. Since we know they are present, including them helps us find their positions faster.

Therefore, I think BASIC is a good choice because:
- Includes C and A (in new positions: A at 2, C at 5)
- Avoids R, N, E
- Tests new letters: B, S, I

So I'll go with BASIC as the second guess.

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- **R**: Absent (marked 'x')
- **A**: Present in the word, but not in position 3 (marked '-')
- **N**: Absent (marked 'x')

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word contains C and A**, but **not** in positions 1 or 3 (respectively).
2. **Secret word does NOT contain R, N, or E**.
3. Therefore, the next guess:
   - Must include **C** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
   - Must avoid R, N, E.
   - Should place C in a new position (not 1) and A in a new position (not 3).
   - Ideally tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, L) for efficiency.

After considering possible words (e.g., ""basic"" fits all criteria):
- **BASIC**: Places A at position 2 (new), C at position 5 (new position), includes S and I (untested letters), and excludes R/N/E.

- Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, so we can test here)
- Position 3: S (new letter)
- Position 4: I (new vowel)
- Position 5: C (C is at a new position, not position 1)

This seems acceptable.

Alternative word: COAST? But that has O (which we don't know about) and S, T. But it also has A in position 3? We can't put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. Also, C is at position 1? We know it's not at position 1. So COAST is invalid because we are repeating known wrong positions.

But note: we cannot use O because we don't know if it's absent or not? Actually, we can use any letter except R, N, E. But we must avoid known absent letters.

Wait, feedback for the first guess told us R, N, E are absent. So we must avoid them. O is not yet tested, so it's okay.

But putting C at 1 and A at 3 in COAST? We know both positions are incorrect, so we shouldn't. Therefore, we must choose a word that puts C and A in positions other than 1 for C and other than 3 for A.

In BASIC, A is at position 2 (not 3) and C is at position 5 (not 1). So that's good.

Other words: AUDIO? But that doesn't have C. We know C is present so we must include C to gather more information about its position and to use the known present letter.

We have two known present letters: C and A. So we should include both to get more feedback.

Another word: CLAIM? But CLAIM has C at position 1? We can't do that because we know C is not at position 1. Also, A at position 3? But A is not at position 3. So CLAIM is bad for positions.

Another: MUSIC? That has M, U, S, I, C -> positions: M (1), U (2), S (3), I (4), C (5). And A is missing. But we must include A because it is present. We know A is in the word so we should include it to get position information.

So BASIC seems to be a good candidate.

Alternatively: PATIO? But that has no C. We must have C? Actually, we don't absolutely have to include C and A in every guess? But if we don't, we don't get information about their positions. Since we know they are present, including them helps us find their positions faster.

Therefore, I think BASIC is a good choice because:
- Includes C and A (in new positions: A at 2, C at 5)
- Avoids R, N, E
- Tests new letters: B, S, I

So I'll go with BASIC as the second guess.

<guess>basic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C**: Present in the word, but not in position 1 (marked '-')
- **R**: Absent (marked 'x')
- **A**: Present in the word, but not in position 3 (marked '-')
- **N**: Absent (marked 'x')
- **E**: Absent (marked 'x')

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word contains C and A**, but **not** in positions 1 or 3 (respectively).
2. **Secret word does NOT contain R, N, or E**.
3. Therefore, the next guess:
   - Must include **C** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
   - Must avoid R, N, E.
   - Should place C in a new position (not 1) and A in a new position (not 3).
   - Ideally tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, L) for efficiency.

After considering possible words (e.g., ""basic"" fits all criteria):
- **BASIC**: Places A at position 2 (new), C at position 5 (new position), includes S and I (untested letters), and excludes R/N/E.

Actually, we can, because the feedback doesn\'t prohibit that? Wait, no: the secret word does not have A in position 3, so we know A is not at position 3.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: crane -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Second guess: basic -> B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-)

Analysis of feedback:

From first guess:
- C is in the word but not at position 1.
- R is absent.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is absent.
- E is absent.

From second guess:
- B is absent (so not in word).
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (since it's marked '-').
- S is absent.
- I is absent.
- C is in the word but not at position 5 (marked '-').

So, we know:
Present letters: C and A (but we still don't know their correct positions).
Absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.

Also, we have positional constraints for C and A:
- C is not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 5 (from second guess).
- A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess).

Since the word is 5 letters, possible positions for C: positions 2, 3, or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).
Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).

But note: C and A are both in the word, so they must occupy two of these positions.

We need to guess a word that has:
- Both C and A.
- Avoids the known absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.
- Places C in position 2,3, or 4 and A in position 1,4, or 5. But note: if we put A at 4, we can't have C at 4 since same position? Actually, they can't be in same position? No, each letter occupies one position. So we need to avoid putting both in the same position unless we know it's the same letter? But they are different letters.

So, we should try a word where A is at position 1, 4, or 5 and C is at 2,3, or 4, but not both trying to be at 4? Actually, position 4 could be either A or C, but only one can be there.

We also need to use new letters to test for presence. Known absent: B, R, N, E, S, I.

So remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should prioritize common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, M, P, etc.

Now, we must include C and A. Let's try to find words that meet the criteria.

Possible placements:

Option 1: A at position 1.
Then C must be at 2,3, or 4.

For example:
- Word starting with A: and having C in positions 2,3, or 4.

Examples: 
- Could be ""ACTOR""? But we must avoid absent letters. ACTOR has A, C, T, O, R -> R is absent (from first guess), so cannot because R is in it and is absent.
- ""ALOFT"" has L, O, F, T -> but we need C? Must include C. ALOFT doesn't have C.
- ""ATTIC"" has T and I -> I is absent (from second guess), so cannot.

What about ""APTLY""? Doesn't have C.

We need a word starting with A and having C in 2,3, or4, and avoiding R,N,E,B,S,I.

Another idea: ""ACTED"" -> but E is absent? E is absent so can't. Also D? But we don't know about D. However, ACTED: A(1), C(2), T(3), E(4) -> but E is absent. So no.

Perhaps with A at 1 and C at 3? Like ""ATTIC"": A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4) -> I is absent? Second guess showed I absent. Also, C is at position 3? ATTIC has C? No, ATTIC: A,T,T,I,C? Wait positions: 1-A, 2-T, 3-T, 4-I, 5-C? Then it has two Ts? But ignore that for now. However, I is absent and C is at 5? But in our word we are trying C at 3? Not matching.

Perhaps we should use a word list? Since we don't have one, we think of common words.

Option: A at position 4? Or position 5?

Since C can't be at 1 or 5, and A can't be at 2 or 3, we could try A at position 5.

For example, words ending with A and with C in 2,3,4.

Like: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> but positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4)? Then A at 4? Also, we have two L's? But let's see: We need to make sure the letters are valid. But L is not yet tested? L is not in absent list.

LOCAL: L (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> A at 4, C at 3. Then we avoid absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes, contains L,O,C,A. So that might be a word.

But is LOCAL valid? Yes, and it fits.

Another word: maybe ""FOCAL"" which is similar? F,O,C,A,L -> F is not tested.

But FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5) -> A at 4, C at 3.

We can also try A at position 1.

Words: ""ACTOR"" not allowed (R absent), ""AGAPE"" has E? E absent. ""AXIOM"" has I and O? But I is absent, so cannot.

""ABOUT"" has B? B absent, so no.

""ADOLF"" not valid English.

""AFTER"" has E and R? Both absent, so cannot.

So maybe A at 4 or 5 is easier.

Consider A at position 5.

Then the word has to have A at end, and C in positions 2,3,4.

Example words: ""TORCA""? Not common. ""MAGIC"" has G,I,C -> I absent? Second guess showed I absent. ""TOPIC"" has I? Also absent? ""MUSIC"" has S and I? Both absent? S and I are absent from second guess.

What about ""PHOCA""? Not common.

Maybe ""CLOFA"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANIA"" has N and I? Absent.

So it's challenging.

But note: we have ""LOCAL"" which is valid: L(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)? But wait, double L? A at 4.

We could also do ""TACIT"" but has I? Absent.

Another word: ""CAPUT"" has C at 1? We can't because C not at 1? Also, A at 2? Second guess showed A not at 2? Feedback for basic: A(-) at position 2, meaning A present but not at position 2. So we cannot put A at 2.

But in CAPUT, if we do: C(1),A(2),P,U,T. But position 1 C not allowed? And position 2 A not allowed. So invalid.

Therefore, A at 1 or 4 or 5.

We also have the possibility of A at position 4? Or 5.

But LOCAL seems acceptable.

A at position 4: another word ""OPTIC"" has O,P,T,I,C -> I absent? So can't.

""TOPIC"" same issue.

Therefore, LOCAL: 
- Letters: L, O, C, A, L? But word ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A -> positions:1=L,2=O,3=C,4=A,5=L? Wait, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L, so it has two L's? But that might be acceptable if L is repeated.

But the word ""LOCAL"" ends with L, not A? Wait, I think I confused: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? I think I meant a different word.

Actually, the word ""FOCAL"": F-O-C-A-L. That ends with L, and A is at position 4.

Alternatively, words ending in A: 
- For example, ""COMET"" but E absent? No.
""TOUCA"" not word.
""DONNA"" has N? Absent.

Another: ""LOTTA"" not common.

Perhaps ""OPERA""? But has E and R? Both absent.

I think ""FOCAL"" might be good: 
F(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). 
But positions: 
- A at position 4? That is allowed because A wasn't at position 3 or 2 before? But we haven't tried position 4 for A.
- C at position 3? We haven't tried position 3 for C? Previously: C was at 1 and 5, both wrong, so position 3 is new.

Also, letters: F, O, L, C, A? FOCAL: F,O,C,A,L? So letters: F,O,C,A,L.

All letters: C and A are included. F,O,L: not in the absent list? Absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I. So F,O,L are untested.

So FOCAL might be a good guess.

Another possibility: we also have other common letters? T, O, P, etc.

Word ""CLAPT""? Not common.

Perhaps ""CHAFT"" not word.

So I think ""FOCAL"" is suitable.

But what about double letters? Don't think the secret word has double letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, FOCAL has all distinct letters? F,O,C,A,L? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try a word with T: like ""TRACT"" but R and T? R absent? R is absent.

""CLAMP"": has L,A,M,P? and C? Positions: if we make A at 4: C at 1? But C cannot be at position 1. So if CLAMP: C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). But A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 from first guess. So invalid.

We can't have A at position 3.

So for a word like ""CLAMP"", it puts A at 3 and C at 1, both disallowed.

Therefore, we need to avoid that.

Another word: ""PADRE"" has R and E? Absent.

Perhaps ""CAULK"" has C at 1? Not allowed.

I think FOCAL is a good candidate.

But note: in FOCAL, A is at position 4? And C at position 3.

We are trying to find the correct positions.

Another word: ""LOCAL"": L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). But repeated L? It's acceptable? ""LOCAL"" is spelled L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L? I think it's L-O-C-A-L? I'm considering: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, I think I'm wrong; LOCAL is four letters? No, LOCAL is 5 letters: L-O-C-A-L, but it has L twice? And ends with L? And A at 4? Perhaps yes, but it might be rejected? Actually, LOCAL is a word? Yes, meaning either of the hip or a local anesthetic? I think it's an adjective.

In any case, a better alternative might be ""VOCAL"": V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). That avoids repetition and we haven't tested V.

But we don't know V status? Okay.

But VOCAL has the same positions as FOCAL for C and A: C at 3, A at 4.

FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)
VOCAL: V(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)

We need a word that has C and A in allowed positions.

But VOCAL avoids absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes.

So VOCAL is also an option.

Which one to choose? Both test O, L, and either F or V.

Using V might be less common? But VOCAL is a common word.

To maximize new letter coverage? Both are equivalent.

But note: in VOCAL, V is rare? Perhaps use FOCAL.

But I think both are fine. Let's go with VOCAL? Or FOCAL? F is more common than V? But no particular preference.

Perhaps a word that puts A at position 5? But then C must be at 2,3,4.

Word: ""MONAC"": Not word.

""DINKA"" has N? Absent.

""TOUCA"" not word.

Therefore, I think VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable.

Also, note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to choose a guess that can resolve positions.

But since VOCAL and FOCAL place C at 3 and A at 4, if the secret word has that, we'll get correct positions? But if not, we get feedback.

Also, we might test letters that might be present? O and L.

In the absence of better ideas.

But what about a word that places A at position 5? Or C at 2?

Another possibility: word with A at 1: for example, ""ABCAA"" not word.

""AFOUL""? Has F,O,U,L -> but no C? Must include C.

So we must have a word with both.

Perhaps ""CATLY"" not word.

I think VOCAL is fine.

But wait: in VOCAL, for C and A: we are putting C at position 3 and A at position 4.

But we don't know if they are at such positions? But that's exactly what we are testing.

Alternatively, we could make C at position 4 and A at position 1? For example, ""A C at end"" word.

Word: ""CHAOS"" has C at position 4? and A at position 2? But A not at position 2? So if we do ""CHAOS"": C(1)? Not allowed? Positions: CHAOS: C(1), H(2), A(3), O(4), S(5). Problems: 
- C at position 1? Disallowed? Disallowed because we know C not at 1.
- A at position 3? Disallowed because A not at 3.
So invalid.

Therefore, I think a word like VOCAL is best.

But let's also think: perhaps a word that tests more vowels? We know only A is present? Others absent? But we don't know. In fact, we have absent I, E? Y might be considered.

Common words: ""COMA"" is 4 letters? Too short.

""TACKY"" has T,A,C,K,Y: positions: T(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). Now, A at 2? But we know A not at position 2 (from guess 2?). Yes, guess 2: basic had A at 2 marked '-', meaning A present but not at position 2? So any word putting A at position 2 would get the same feedback? We know A is not at 2, so we shouldn't put it there? Correct, we know A is not at 2, so we must avoid position 2 for A.

Similarly, position 3 for A is avoided? So TACKY has A at 2? But that position is disallowed? So cannot.

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at 1,4,5 and C at 2,3,4.

Another word: ""PATCH"" has C at 3? P(1),A(2),T(3),C(4),H(5). But A at position 2? Disallowed? Because we know A not at 2? So if we use PATCH, we put A at 2? Not good? Actually, yes, we shouldn't put A at position 2 because we know it's wrong.

So PATCH: A at 2 not allowed? And also, PATCH: it has A and C? But A at 2? Cannot.

Therefore, I conclude VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable?

Perhaps: ""ALICO"": Not word.

We can also do: ""COALA""? Not common? But COALA is not a word? COALA is misspelling? Coala is an animal? But spelling is koala, which is K-O-A-L-A? So K(1),O(2),A(3),L(4),A(5) but no C? And also, K not tested.

But we need C? The word must have C? Because C is present? So cannot use koala.

Therefore, after consideration, I'll go with VOCAL as it is a common word.

Another word: ""LOCUM"" has U,M? But C at 3? L(1),O(2),C(3),U(4),M(5). But missing A? We must include A? Because A is present? So we must have A? Otherwise we don't test A position? We know A is present, so to rule out positions? We don't have to? But if we omit A, we might not get full feedback? But the guess must be valid English word? So we can guess a word without A? But we know A is in the word? So to avoid bad words? Actually, we can use a word without A to test other letters? But that might be inefficient since A is known present? We should include it.

So VOCAL: includes C and A in allowed positions.

Yes.

So I will guess VOCAL.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  This means:
  - C and A are present in the secret word, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
  - R, N, E are absent.

- **Guess 2: basic → B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  This means:
  - B, S, I are absent.
  - A is present but not in position 2.
  - C is present but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**: Only C and A are present (based on both guesses).  
  - **C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (per feedback). Possible positions: 2, 3, or 4.
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, B, S, I (must avoid these).  
- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common letters like O, L, T, M, P, F, V, etc., to gain new information.  
- **Goal**: Test possible positions for C and A using untested letters, narrowing down the solution.  

### Thought Process:
1. **Must include both C and A** (known present letters) in the guess to expedite position discovery.
2. **Avoid all absent letters** (R, N, E, B, S, I).  
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - Place A in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2 or 3).  
   - Place C in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1 or 5).  
   - Avoid overlap (e.g., both cannot be in position 4 unless confirmed).  
4. **Word Selection**:
   - A at position 1: Leads to words like ""ALOFT"" (no C) or ""ABOUT"" (B absent) – unworkable.  
   - A at position 5 or 4: Works with C in other allowed positions.  
   - Ideal word: Tests new common consonants or vowels (e.g., L, O, V, F).  
   - **Chose ""VOCAL""**:  
     - V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) → A at 4 (not tried), C at 3 (not tried).  
     - Uses untrusted letters (V, O, L) – common enough to reveal new information.  
5. **Why ""VOCAL""?**  
   - Validates positions for C (position 3) and A (position 4).  
   - Tests V, O, L efficiently; avoids absents.  
   - If incorrect, feedback will pinpoint errors and reduce possibilities (e.g., C/A positions or other letters).

<guess>vocal</guess>",vocal,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: crane -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Second guess: basic -> B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-)

Analysis of feedback:

From first guess:
- C is in the word but not at position 1.
- R is absent.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is absent.
- E is absent.

From second guess:
- B is absent (so not in word).
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (since it's marked '-').
- S is absent.
- I is absent.
- C is in the word but not at position 5 (marked '-').

So, we know:
Present letters: C and A (but we still don't know their correct positions).
Absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.

Also, we have positional constraints for C and A:
- C is not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 5 (from second guess).
- A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess).

Since the word is 5 letters, possible positions for C: positions 2, 3, or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).
Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).

But note: C and A are both in the word, so they must occupy two of these positions.

We need to guess a word that has:
- Both C and A.
- Avoids the known absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.
- Places C in position 2,3, or 4 and A in position 1,4, or 5. But note: if we put A at 4, we can't have C at 4 since same position? Actually, they can't be in same position? No, each letter occupies one position. So we need to avoid putting both in the same position unless we know it's the same letter? But they are different letters.

So, we should try a word where A is at position 1, 4, or 5 and C is at 2,3, or 4, but not both trying to be at 4? Actually, position 4 could be either A or C, but only one can be there.

We also need to use new letters to test for presence. Known absent: B, R, N, E, S, I.

So remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should prioritize common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, M, P, etc.

Now, we must include C and A. Let's try to find words that meet the criteria.

Possible placements:

Option 1: A at position 1.
Then C must be at 2,3, or 4.

For example:
- Word starting with A: and having C in positions 2,3, or 4.

Examples: 
- Could be ""ACTOR""? But we must avoid absent letters. ACTOR has A, C, T, O, R -> R is absent (from first guess), so cannot because R is in it and is absent.
- ""ALOFT"" has L, O, F, T -> but we need C? Must include C. ALOFT doesn't have C.
- ""ATTIC"" has T and I -> I is absent (from second guess), so cannot.

What about ""APTLY""? Doesn't have C.

We need a word starting with A and having C in 2,3, or4, and avoiding R,N,E,B,S,I.

Another idea: ""ACTED"" -> but E is absent? E is absent so can't. Also D? But we don't know about D. However, ACTED: A(1), C(2), T(3), E(4) -> but E is absent. So no.

Perhaps with A at 1 and C at 3? Like ""ATTIC"": A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4) -> I is absent? Second guess showed I absent. Also, C is at position 3? ATTIC has C? No, ATTIC: A,T,T,I,C? Wait positions: 1-A, 2-T, 3-T, 4-I, 5-C? Then it has two Ts? But ignore that for now. However, I is absent and C is at 5? But in our word we are trying C at 3? Not matching.

Perhaps we should use a word list? Since we don't have one, we think of common words.

Option: A at position 4? Or position 5?

Since C can't be at 1 or 5, and A can't be at 2 or 3, we could try A at position 5.

For example, words ending with A and with C in 2,3,4.

Like: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> but positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4)? Then A at 4? Also, we have two L's? But let's see: We need to make sure the letters are valid. But L is not yet tested? L is not in absent list.

LOCAL: L (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> A at 4, C at 3. Then we avoid absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes, contains L,O,C,A. So that might be a word.

But is LOCAL valid? Yes, and it fits.

Another word: maybe ""FOCAL"" which is similar? F,O,C,A,L -> F is not tested.

But FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5) -> A at 4, C at 3.

We can also try A at position 1.

Words: ""ACTOR"" not allowed (R absent), ""AGAPE"" has E? E absent. ""AXIOM"" has I and O? But I is absent, so cannot.

""ABOUT"" has B? B absent, so no.

""ADOLF"" not valid English.

""AFTER"" has E and R? Both absent, so cannot.

So maybe A at 4 or 5 is easier.

Consider A at position 5.

Then the word has to have A at end, and C in positions 2,3,4.

Example words: ""TORCA""? Not common. ""MAGIC"" has G,I,C -> I absent? Second guess showed I absent. ""TOPIC"" has I? Also absent? ""MUSIC"" has S and I? Both absent? S and I are absent from second guess.

What about ""PHOCA""? Not common.

Maybe ""CLOFA"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANIA"" has N and I? Absent.

So it's challenging.

But note: we have ""LOCAL"" which is valid: L(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)? But wait, double L? A at 4.

We could also do ""TACIT"" but has I? Absent.

Another word: ""CAPUT"" has C at 1? We can't because C not at 1? Also, A at 2? Second guess showed A not at 2? Feedback for basic: A(-) at position 2, meaning A present but not at position 2. So we cannot put A at 2.

But in CAPUT, if we do: C(1),A(2),P,U,T. But position 1 C not allowed? And position 2 A not allowed. So invalid.

Therefore, A at 1 or 4 or 5.

We also have the possibility of A at position 4? Or 5.

But LOCAL seems acceptable.

A at position 4: another word ""OPTIC"" has O,P,T,I,C -> I absent? So can't.

""TOPIC"" same issue.

Therefore, LOCAL: 
- Letters: L, O, C, A, L? But word ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A -> positions:1=L,2=O,3=C,4=A,5=L? Wait, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L, so it has two L's? But that might be acceptable if L is repeated.

But the word ""LOCAL"" ends with L, not A? Wait, I think I confused: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? I think I meant a different word.

Actually, the word ""FOCAL"": F-O-C-A-L. That ends with L, and A is at position 4.

Alternatively, words ending in A: 
- For example, ""COMET"" but E absent? No.
""TOUCA"" not word.
""DONNA"" has N? Absent.

Another: ""LOTTA"" not common.

Perhaps ""OPERA""? But has E and R? Both absent.

I think ""FOCAL"" might be good: 
F(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). 
But positions: 
- A at position 4? That is allowed because A wasn't at position 3 or 2 before? But we haven't tried position 4 for A.
- C at position 3? We haven't tried position 3 for C? Previously: C was at 1 and 5, both wrong, so position 3 is new.

Also, letters: F, O, L, C, A? FOCAL: F,O,C,A,L? So letters: F,O,C,A,L.

All letters: C and A are included. F,O,L: not in the absent list? Absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I. So F,O,L are untested.

So FOCAL might be a good guess.

Another possibility: we also have other common letters? T, O, P, etc.

Word ""CLAPT""? Not common.

Perhaps ""CHAFT"" not word.

So I think ""FOCAL"" is suitable.

But what about double letters? Don't think the secret word has double letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, FOCAL has all distinct letters? F,O,C,A,L? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try a word with T: like ""TRACT"" but R and T? R absent? R is absent.

""CLAMP"": has L,A,M,P? and C? Positions: if we make A at 4: C at 1? But C cannot be at position 1. So if CLAMP: C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). But A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 from first guess. So invalid.

We can't have A at position 3.

So for a word like ""CLAMP"", it puts A at 3 and C at 1, both disallowed.

Therefore, we need to avoid that.

Another word: ""PADRE"" has R and E? Absent.

Perhaps ""CAULK"" has C at 1? Not allowed.

I think FOCAL is a good candidate.

But note: in FOCAL, A is at position 4? And C at position 3.

We are trying to find the correct positions.

Another word: ""LOCAL"": L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). But repeated L? It's acceptable? ""LOCAL"" is spelled L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L? I think it's L-O-C-A-L? I'm considering: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, I think I'm wrong; LOCAL is four letters? No, LOCAL is 5 letters: L-O-C-A-L, but it has L twice? And ends with L? And A at 4? Perhaps yes, but it might be rejected? Actually, LOCAL is a word? Yes, meaning either of the hip or a local anesthetic? I think it's an adjective.

In any case, a better alternative might be ""VOCAL"": V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). That avoids repetition and we haven't tested V.

But we don't know V status? Okay.

But VOCAL has the same positions as FOCAL for C and A: C at 3, A at 4.

FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)
VOCAL: V(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)

We need a word that has C and A in allowed positions.

But VOCAL avoids absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes.

So VOCAL is also an option.

Which one to choose? Both test O, L, and either F or V.

Using V might be less common? But VOCAL is a common word.

To maximize new letter coverage? Both are equivalent.

But note: in VOCAL, V is rare? Perhaps use FOCAL.

But I think both are fine. Let's go with VOCAL? Or FOCAL? F is more common than V? But no particular preference.

Perhaps a word that puts A at position 5? But then C must be at 2,3,4.

Word: ""MONAC"": Not word.

""DINKA"" has N? Absent.

""TOUCA"" not word.

Therefore, I think VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable.

Also, note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to choose a guess that can resolve positions.

But since VOCAL and FOCAL place C at 3 and A at 4, if the secret word has that, we'll get correct positions? But if not, we get feedback.

Also, we might test letters that might be present? O and L.

In the absence of better ideas.

But what about a word that places A at position 5? Or C at 2?

Another possibility: word with A at 1: for example, ""ABCAA"" not word.

""AFOUL""? Has F,O,U,L -> but no C? Must include C.

So we must have a word with both.

Perhaps ""CATLY"" not word.

I think VOCAL is fine.

But wait: in VOCAL, for C and A: we are putting C at position 3 and A at position 4.

But we don't know if they are at such positions? But that's exactly what we are testing.

Alternatively, we could make C at position 4 and A at position 1? For example, ""A C at end"" word.

Word: ""CHAOS"" has C at position 4? and A at position 2? But A not at position 2? So if we do ""CHAOS"": C(1)? Not allowed? Positions: CHAOS: C(1), H(2), A(3), O(4), S(5). Problems: 
- C at position 1? Disallowed? Disallowed because we know C not at 1.
- A at position 3? Disallowed because A not at 3.
So invalid.

Therefore, I think a word like VOCAL is best.

But let's also think: perhaps a word that tests more vowels? We know only A is present? Others absent? But we don't know. In fact, we have absent I, E? Y might be considered.

Common words: ""COMA"" is 4 letters? Too short.

""TACKY"" has T,A,C,K,Y: positions: T(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). Now, A at 2? But we know A not at position 2 (from guess 2?). Yes, guess 2: basic had A at 2 marked '-', meaning A present but not at position 2? So any word putting A at position 2 would get the same feedback? We know A is not at 2, so we shouldn't put it there? Correct, we know A is not at 2, so we must avoid position 2 for A.

Similarly, position 3 for A is avoided? So TACKY has A at 2? But that position is disallowed? So cannot.

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at 1,4,5 and C at 2,3,4.

Another word: ""PATCH"" has C at 3? P(1),A(2),T(3),C(4),H(5). But A at position 2? Disallowed? Because we know A not at 2? So if we use PATCH, we put A at 2? Not good? Actually, yes, we shouldn't put A at position 2 because we know it's wrong.

So PATCH: A at 2 not allowed? And also, PATCH: it has A and C? But A at 2? Cannot.

Therefore, I conclude VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable?

Perhaps: ""ALICO"": Not word.

We can also do: ""COALA""? Not common? But COALA is not a word? COALA is misspelling? Coala is an animal? But spelling is koala, which is K-O-A-L-A? So K(1),O(2),A(3),L(4),A(5) but no C? And also, K not tested.

But we need C? The word must have C? Because C is present? So cannot use koala.

Therefore, after consideration, I'll go with VOCAL as it is a common word.

Another word: ""LOCUM"" has U,M? But C at 3? L(1),O(2),C(3),U(4),M(5). But missing A? We must include A? Because A is present? So we must have A? Otherwise we don't test A position? We know A is present, so to rule out positions? We don't have to? But if we omit A, we might not get full feedback? But the guess must be valid English word? So we can guess a word without A? But we know A is in the word? So to avoid bad words? Actually, we can use a word without A to test other letters? But that might be inefficient since A is known present? We should include it.

So VOCAL: includes C and A in allowed positions.

Yes.

So I will guess VOCAL.Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  This means:
  - C and A are present in the secret word, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
  - R, N, E are absent.

- **Guess 2: basic → B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  This means:
  - B, S, I are absent.
  - A is present but not in position 2.
  - C is present but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**: Only C and A are present (based on both guesses).  
  - **C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (per feedback). Possible positions: 2, 3, or 4.
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, B, S, I (must avoid these).  
- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common letters like O, L, T, M, P, F, V, etc., to gain new information.  
- **Goal**: Test possible positions for C and A using untested letters, narrowing down the solution.

4. **Word Selection**:
   - A at position 1: Leads to words like ""ALOFT"" (no C) or ""ABOUT"" (B absent) – unworkable.  
   - A at position 5 or 4: Works with C in other allowed positions.  
   - Ideal word: Tests new common consonants or vowels (e.g., L, O, V, F).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,LOCAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is present but not in the third position (marked with '-', so it's in the word but wrong position).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions we guessed (so C is not at position 1, and A is not at position 3).
- The secret word does NOT contain R, N, E.

Additionally, since C and A are in the word but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively, they must appear in other positions.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Uses the known present letters (C and A) in positions different from the first guess.
- Avoids the absent letters (R, N, E).
- Includes other common letters to test.

Since C was not in position 1 and A not in position 3, they could be in positions 2,4,5 (for C) and positions 1,2,4,5 (for A) but avoiding the known absent positions.

Possible positions:
- C: can be in 2,4,5 (since position 1 is not correct)
- A: can be in 1,2,4,5 (since position 3 is not correct)

But note, the feedback does not tell us which positions they are in, only that they are present and not in the positions we guessed.

We also know the secret word does not contain R, N, E, so we must avoid those.

For the next guess, we should try a word that contains C and A, and includes new common letters to test, while placing C and A in positions we haven't tried for them.

Common letters: after vowels A, E (but E is absent, so we don't use E), we can try other vowels: I, O, U, and consonants like L, T, S, etc.

But note: we must consider the positions.

Also, we don't know the exact positions of C and A, so we can try placing them in different positions.

Possible strategy: 
- We can try a word that has C in the second position and A in the fourth, for example, or other combinations.

Let me think of words that have the letters C and A, without R, N, E.

Some words: 
- PLACE: has P, L, A, C, E -> but E is absent, so cannot use because E is in the word.
- BASIC: has B, A, S, I, C -> no E, R, N? Actually, doesn't have R, N, E.

Check the letters: BASIC: B, A, S, I, C -> none of R, N, E.

Also, positions: 
- We want to test C not in position 1: in BASIC, C is in position 5? Let's see: 
  B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), C (5). 
But remember, in our feedback, A was present but not in position 3. In BASIC, A is in position 2 which is a new position, so that's okay. And C is in position 5, which is different from position 1. So this word might be suitable.

But note: we also need to consider that the feedback told us C is in the word (so we should include it) and A is in the word (so we include it). And BASIC does that.

Another option: CLASS? But that has S repeated? Also, CLASS has S at the end? And we don't know about S yet. But note, CLASS: C (1), L (2), A (3), S (4), S (5). However, we have A in position 3, but in the first guess we had A in position 3 and it was marked present but wrong position. Actually, the feedback for the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked with '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback doesn't prohibit that? Wait, no: the secret word does not have A in position 3, so we know A is not at position 3. Therefore, we should not put A at position 3 in our next guess because we already know that position is wrong. Similarly, we know C is not at position 1.

Therefore, in CLASS, we are putting C at position 1? We shouldn't because we know C is not at position 1. And A at position 3? Also we know it's not at position 3. So CLASS is not a good choice.

Therefore, BASIC: 
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, so we can test here)
- Position 3: S (new letter)
- Position 4: I (new vowel)
- Position 5: C (C is at a new position, not position 1)

This seems acceptable.

Alternative word: COAST? But that has O (which we don't know about) and S, T. But it also has A in position 3? We can't put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. Also, C is at position 1? We know it's not at position 1. So COAST is invalid because we are repeating known wrong positions.

But note: we cannot use O because we don't know if it's absent or not? Actually, we can use any letter except R, N, E. But we must avoid known absent letters.

Wait, feedback for the first guess told us R, N, E are absent. So we must avoid them. O is not yet tested, so it's okay.

But putting C at 1 and A at 3 in COAST? We know both positions are incorrect, so we shouldn't. Therefore, we must choose a word that puts C and A in positions other than 1 for C and other than 3 for A.

In BASIC, A is at position 2 (not 3) and C is at position 5 (not 1). So that's good.

Other words: AUDIO? But that doesn't have C. We know C is present so we must include C to gather more information about its position and to use the known present letter.

We have two known present letters: C and A. So we should include both to get more feedback.

Another word: CLAIM? But CLAIM has C at position 1? We can't do that because we know C is not at position 1. Also, A at position 3? But A is not at position 3. So CLAIM is bad for positions.

Another: MUSIC? That has M, U, S, I, C -> positions: M (1), U (2), S (3), I (4), C (5). And A is missing. But we must include A because it is present. We know A is in the word so we should include it to get position information.

So BASIC seems to be a good candidate.

Alternatively: PATIO? But that has no C. We must have C? Actually, we don't absolutely have to include C and A in every guess? But if we don't, we don't get information about their positions. Since we know they are present, including them helps us find their positions faster.

Therefore, I think BASIC is a good choice because:
- Includes C and A (in new positions: A at 2, C at 5)
- Avoids R, N, E
- Tests new letters: B, S, I

So I'll go with BASIC as the second guess.

<guess>basic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C**: Present in the word, but not in position 1 (marked '-')
- **R**: Absent (marked 'x')
- **A**: Present in the word, but not in position 3 (marked '-')
- **N**: Absent (marked 'x')
- **E**: Absent (marked 'x')

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word contains C and A**, but **not** in positions 1 or 3 (respectively).
2. **Secret word does NOT contain R, N, or E**.
3. Therefore, the next guess:
   - Must include **C** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
   - Must avoid R, N, E.
   - Should place C in a new position (not 1) and A in a new position (not 3).
   - Ideally tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, L) for efficiency.

After considering possible words (e.g., ""basic"" fits all criteria):
- **BASIC**: Places A at position 2 (new), C at position 5 (new position), includes S and I (untested letters), and excludes R/N/E.

<guess>basic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: basic -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: crane -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Second guess: basic -> B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-)

Analysis of feedback:

From first guess:
- C is in the word but not at position 1.
- R is absent.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is absent.
- E is absent.

From second guess:
- B is absent (so not in word).
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (since it's marked '-').
- S is absent.
- I is absent.
- C is in the word but not at position 5 (marked '-').

So, we know:
Present letters: C and A (but we still don't know their correct positions).
Absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.

Also, we have positional constraints for C and A:
- C is not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 5 (from second guess).
- A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess).

Since the word is 5 letters, possible positions for C: positions 2, 3, or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).
Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).

But note: C and A are both in the word, so they must occupy two of these positions.

We need to guess a word that has:
- Both C and A.
- Avoids the known absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.
- Places C in position 2,3, or 4 and A in position 1,4, or 5. But note: if we put A at 4, we can't have C at 4 since same position? Actually, they can't be in same position? No, each letter occupies one position. So we need to avoid putting both in the same position unless we know it's the same letter? But they are different letters.

So, we should try a word where A is at position 1, 4, or 5 and C is at 2,3, or 4, but not both trying to be at 4? Actually, position 4 could be either A or C, but only one can be there.

We also need to use new letters to test for presence. Known absent: B, R, N, E, S, I.

So remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should prioritize common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, M, P, etc.

Now, we must include C and A. Let's try to find words that meet the criteria.

Possible placements:

Option 1: A at position 1.
Then C must be at 2,3, or 4.

For example:
- Word starting with A: and having C in positions 2,3, or 4.

Examples: 
- Could be ""ACTOR""? But we must avoid absent letters. ACTOR has A, C, T, O, R -> R is absent (from first guess), so cannot because R is in it and is absent.
- ""ALOFT"" has L, O, F, T -> but we need C? Must include C. ALOFT doesn't have C.
- ""ATTIC"" has T and I -> I is absent (from second guess), so cannot.

What about ""APTLY""? Doesn't have C.

We need a word starting with A and having C in 2,3, or4, and avoiding R,N,E,B,S,I.

Another idea: ""ACTED"" -> but E is absent? E is absent so can't. Also D? But we don't know about D. However, ACTED: A(1), C(2), T(3), E(4) -> but E is absent. So no.

Perhaps with A at 1 and C at 3? Like ""ATTIC"": A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4) -> I is absent? Second guess showed I absent. Also, C is at position 3? ATTIC has C? No, ATTIC: A,T,T,I,C? Wait positions: 1-A, 2-T, 3-T, 4-I, 5-C? Then it has two Ts? But ignore that for now. However, I is absent and C is at 5? But in our word we are trying C at 3? Not matching.

Perhaps we should use a word list? Since we don't have one, we think of common words.

Option: A at position 4? Or position 5?

Since C can't be at 1 or 5, and A can't be at 2 or 3, we could try A at position 5.

For example, words ending with A and with C in 2,3,4.

Like: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> but positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4)? Then A at 4? Also, we have two L's? But let's see: We need to make sure the letters are valid. But L is not yet tested? L is not in absent list.

LOCAL: L (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> A at 4, C at 3. Then we avoid absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes, contains L,O,C,A. So that might be a word.

But is LOCAL valid? Yes, and it fits.

Another word: maybe ""FOCAL"" which is similar? F,O,C,A,L -> F is not tested.

But FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5) -> A at 4, C at 3.

We can also try A at position 1.

Words: ""ACTOR"" not allowed (R absent), ""AGAPE"" has E? E absent. ""AXIOM"" has I and O? But I is absent, so cannot.

""ABOUT"" has B? B absent, so no.

""ADOLF"" not valid English.

""AFTER"" has E and R? Both absent, so cannot.

So maybe A at 4 or 5 is easier.

Consider A at position 5.

Then the word has to have A at end, and C in positions 2,3,4.

Example words: ""TORCA""? Not common. ""MAGIC"" has G,I,C -> I absent? Second guess showed I absent. ""TOPIC"" has I? Also absent? ""MUSIC"" has S and I? Both absent? S and I are absent from second guess.

What about ""PHOCA""? Not common.

Maybe ""CLOFA"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANIA"" has N and I? Absent.

So it's challenging.

But note: we have ""LOCAL"" which is valid: L(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)? But wait, double L? A at 4.

We could also do ""TACIT"" but has I? Absent.

Another word: ""CAPUT"" has C at 1? We can't because C not at 1? Also, A at 2? Second guess showed A not at 2? Feedback for basic: A(-) at position 2, meaning A present but not at position 2. So we cannot put A at 2.

But in CAPUT, if we do: C(1),A(2),P,U,T. But position 1 C not allowed? And position 2 A not allowed. So invalid.

Therefore, A at 1 or 4 or 5.

We also have the possibility of A at position 4? Or 5.

But LOCAL seems acceptable.

A at position 4: another word ""OPTIC"" has O,P,T,I,C -> I absent? So can't.

""TOPIC"" same issue.

Therefore, LOCAL: 
- Letters: L, O, C, A, L? But word ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A -> positions:1=L,2=O,3=C,4=A,5=L? Wait, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L, so it has two L's? But that might be acceptable if L is repeated.

But the word ""LOCAL"" ends with L, not A? Wait, I think I confused: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? I think I meant a different word.

Actually, the word ""FOCAL"": F-O-C-A-L. That ends with L, and A is at position 4.

Alternatively, words ending in A: 
- For example, ""COMET"" but E absent? No.
""TOUCA"" not word.
""DONNA"" has N? Absent.

Another: ""LOTTA"" not common.

Perhaps ""OPERA""? But has E and R? Both absent.

I think ""FOCAL"" might be good: 
F(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). 
But positions: 
- A at position 4? That is allowed because A wasn't at position 3 or 2 before? But we haven't tried position 4 for A.
- C at position 3? We haven't tried position 3 for C? Previously: C was at 1 and 5, both wrong, so position 3 is new.

Also, letters: F, O, L, C, A? FOCAL: F,O,C,A,L? So letters: F,O,C,A,L.

All letters: C and A are included. F,O,L: not in the absent list? Absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I. So F,O,L are untested.

So FOCAL might be a good guess.

Another possibility: we also have other common letters? T, O, P, etc.

Word ""CLAPT""? Not common.

Perhaps ""CHAFT"" not word.

So I think ""FOCAL"" is suitable.

But what about double letters? Don't think the secret word has double letters? We don't know, but it's possible. However, FOCAL has all distinct letters? F,O,C,A,L? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try a word with T: like ""TRACT"" but R and T? R absent? R is absent.

""CLAMP"": has L,A,M,P? and C? Positions: if we make A at 4: C at 1? But C cannot be at position 1. So if CLAMP: C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). But A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 from first guess. So invalid.

We can't have A at position 3.

So for a word like ""CLAMP"", it puts A at 3 and C at 1, both disallowed.

Therefore, we need to avoid that.

Another word: ""PADRE"" has R and E? Absent.

Perhaps ""CAULK"" has C at 1? Not allowed.

I think FOCAL is a good candidate.

But note: in FOCAL, A is at position 4? And C at position 3.

We are trying to find the correct positions.

Another word: ""LOCAL"": L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). But repeated L? It's acceptable? ""LOCAL"" is spelled L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L? I think it's L-O-C-A-L? I'm considering: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, I think I'm wrong; LOCAL is four letters? No, LOCAL is 5 letters: L-O-C-A-L, but it has L twice? And ends with L? And A at 4? Perhaps yes, but it might be rejected? Actually, LOCAL is a word? Yes, meaning either of the hip or a local anesthetic? I think it's an adjective.

In any case, a better alternative might be ""VOCAL"": V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). That avoids repetition and we haven't tested V.

But we don't know V status? Okay.

But VOCAL has the same positions as FOCAL for C and A: C at 3, A at 4.

FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)
VOCAL: V(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)

We need a word that has C and A in allowed positions.

But VOCAL avoids absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes.

So VOCAL is also an option.

Which one to choose? Both test O, L, and either F or V.

Using V might be less common? But VOCAL is a common word.

To maximize new letter coverage? Both are equivalent.

But note: in VOCAL, V is rare? Perhaps use FOCAL.

But I think both are fine. Let's go with VOCAL? Or FOCAL? F is more common than V? But no particular preference.

Perhaps a word that puts A at position 5? But then C must be at 2,3,4.

Word: ""MONAC"": Not word.

""DINKA"" has N? Absent.

""TOUCA"" not word.

Therefore, I think VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable.

Also, note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to choose a guess that can resolve positions.

But since VOCAL and FOCAL place C at 3 and A at 4, if the secret word has that, we'll get correct positions? But if not, we get feedback.

Also, we might test letters that might be present? O and L.

In the absence of better ideas.

But what about a word that places A at position 5? Or C at 2?

Another possibility: word with A at 1: for example, ""ABCAA"" not word.

""AFOUL""? Has F,O,U,L -> but no C? Must include C.

So we must have a word with both.

Perhaps ""CATLY"" not word.

I think VOCAL is fine.

But wait: in VOCAL, for C and A: we are putting C at position 3 and A at position 4.

But we don't know if they are at such positions? But that's exactly what we are testing.

Alternatively, we could make C at position 4 and A at position 1? For example, ""A C at end"" word.

Word: ""CHAOS"" has C at position 4? and A at position 2? But A not at position 2? So if we do ""CHAOS"": C(1)? Not allowed? Positions: CHAOS: C(1), H(2), A(3), O(4), S(5). Problems: 
- C at position 1? Disallowed? Disallowed because we know C not at 1.
- A at position 3? Disallowed because A not at 3.
So invalid.

Therefore, I think a word like VOCAL is best.

But let's also think: perhaps a word that tests more vowels? We know only A is present? Others absent? But we don't know. In fact, we have absent I, E? Y might be considered.

Common words: ""COMA"" is 4 letters? Too short.

""TACKY"" has T,A,C,K,Y: positions: T(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). Now, A at 2? But we know A not at position 2 (from guess 2?). Yes, guess 2: basic had A at 2 marked '-', meaning A present but not at position 2? So any word putting A at position 2 would get the same feedback? We know A is not at 2, so we shouldn't put it there? Correct, we know A is not at 2, so we must avoid position 2 for A.

Similarly, position 3 for A is avoided? So TACKY has A at 2? But that position is disallowed? So cannot.

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at 1,4,5 and C at 2,3,4.

Another word: ""PATCH"" has C at 3? P(1),A(2),T(3),C(4),H(5). But A at position 2? Disallowed? Because we know A not at 2? So if we use PATCH, we put A at 2? Not good? Actually, yes, we shouldn't put A at position 2 because we know it's wrong.

So PATCH: A at 2 not allowed? And also, PATCH: it has A and C? But A at 2? Cannot.

Therefore, I conclude VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable?

Perhaps: ""ALICO"": Not word.

We can also do: ""COALA""? Not common? But COALA is not a word? COALA is misspelling? Coala is an animal? But spelling is koala, which is K-O-A-L-A? So K(1),O(2),A(3),L(4),A(5) but no C? And also, K not tested.

But we need C? The word must have C? Because C is present? So cannot use koala.

Therefore, after consideration, I'll go with VOCAL as it is a common word.

Another word: ""LOCUM"" has U,M? But C at 3? L(1),O(2),C(3),U(4),M(5). But missing A? We must include A? Because A is present? So we must have A? Otherwise we don't test A position? We know A is present, so to rule out positions? We don't have to? But if we omit A, we might not get full feedback? But the guess must be valid English word? So we can guess a word without A? But we know A is in the word? So to avoid bad words? Actually, we can use a word without A to test other letters? But that might be inefficient since A is known present? We should include it.

So VOCAL: includes C and A in allowed positions.

Yes.

So I will guess VOCAL.Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  This means:
  - C and A are present in the secret word, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
  - R, N, E are absent.

- **Guess 2: basic → B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  This means:
  - B, S, I are absent.
  - A is present but not in position 2.
  - C is present but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**: Only C and A are present (based on both guesses).  
  - **C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (per feedback). Possible positions: 2, 3, or 4.
  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, B, S, I (must avoid these).  
- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common letters like O, L, T, M, P, F, V, etc., to gain new information.  
- **Goal**: Test possible positions for C and A using untested letters, narrowing down the solution.  

### Thought Process:
1. **Must include both C and A** (known present letters) in the guess to expedite position discovery.
2. **Avoid all absent letters** (R, N, E, B, S, I).  
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - Place A in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2 or 3).  
   - Place C in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1 or 5).  
   - Avoid overlap (e.g., both cannot be in position 4 unless confirmed).  
4. **Word Selection**:
   - A at position 1: Leads to words like ""ALOFT"" (no C) or ""ABOUT"" (B absent) – unworkable.  
   - A at position 5 or 4: Works with C in other allowed positions.  
   - Ideal word: Tests new common consonants or vowels (e.g., L, O, V, F).  
   - **Chose ""VOCAL""**:  
     - V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) → A at 4 (not tried), C at 3 (not tried).  
     - Uses untrusted letters (V, O, L) – common enough to reveal new information.  
5. **Why ""VOCAL""?**  
   - Validates positions for C (position 3) and A (position 4).  
   - Tests V, O, L efficiently; avoids absents.  
   - If incorrect, feedback will pinpoint errors and reduce possibilities (e.g., C/A positions or other letters).

So CLASS is not a good choice.\n\nTherefore, BASIC: \n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, so we can test here)\n- Position 3: S (new letter)\n- Position 4: I (new vowel)\n- Position 5: C (C is at a new position, not position 1)\n\nThis seems acceptable.\n\nAlternative word: COAST? But that has O (which we don\'t know about) and S, T. But it also has A in position 3? We can\'t put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there. Also, C is at position 1? We know it\'s not at position 1. So COAST is invalid because we are repeating known wrong positions.\n\nBut note: we cannot use O because we don\'t know if it\'s absent or not? Actually, we can use any letter except R, N, E. But we must avoid known absent letters.\n\nWait, feedback for the first guess told us R, N, E are absent. So we must avoid them. O is not yet tested, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut putting C at 1 and A at 3 in COAST? We know both positions are incorrect, so we shouldn\'t. Therefore, we must choose a word that puts C and A in positions other than 1 for C and other than 3 for A.\n\nIn BASIC, A is at position 2 (not 3) and C is at position 5 (not 1). So that\'s good.\n\nOther words: AUDIO? But that doesn\'t have C. We know C is present so we must include C to gather more information about its position and to use the known present letter.\n\nWe have two known present letters: C and A. So we should include both to get more feedback.\n\nAnother word: CLAIM? But CLAIM has C at position 1? We can\'t do that because we know C is not at position 1. Also, A at position 3? But A is not at position 3. So CLAIM is bad for positions.\n\nAnother: MUSIC? That has M, U, S, I, C -> positions: M (1), U (2), S (3), I (4), C (5). And A is missing. But we must include A because it is present. We know A is in the word so we should include it to get position information.\n\nSo BASIC seems to be a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively: PATIO? But that has no C. We must have C? Actually, we don\'t absolutely have to include C and A in every guess? But if we don\'t, we don\'t get information about their positions. Since we know they are present, including them helps us find their positions faster.\n\nTherefore, I think BASIC is a good choice because:\n- Includes C and A (in new positions: A at 2, C at 5)\n- Avoids R, N, E\n- Tests new letters: B, S, I\n\nSo I\'ll go with BASIC as the second guess.\n\n<guess>basic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C**: Present in the word, but not in position 1 (marked \'-\')\n- **R**: Absent (marked \'x\')\n- **A**: Present in the word, but not in position 3 (marked \'-\')\n- **N**: Absent (marked \'x\')\n- **E**: Absent (marked \'x\')\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Secret word contains C and A**, but **not** in positions 1 or 3 (respectively).\n2. **Secret word does NOT contain R, N, or E**.\n3. Therefore, the next guess:\n   - Must include **C** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).\n   - Must avoid R, N, E.\n   - Should place C in a new position (not 1) and A in a new position (not 3).\n   - Ideally tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, L) for efficiency.\n\nAfter considering possible words (e.g., ""basic"" fits all criteria):\n- **BASIC**: Places A at position 2 (new), C at position 5 (new position), includes S and I (untested letters), and excludes R/N/E.\n\n<guess>basic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: basic -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nSecond guess: basic -> B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-)\n\nAnalysis of feedback:\n\nFrom first guess:\n- C is in the word but not at position 1.\n- R is absent.\n- A is in the word but not at position 3.\n- N is absent.\n- E is absent.\n\nFrom second guess:\n- B is absent (so not in word).\n- A is in the word but not at position 2 (since it\'s marked \'-\').\n- S is absent.\n- I is absent.\n- C is in the word but not at position 5 (marked \'-\').\n\nSo, we know:\nPresent letters: C and A (but we still don\'t know their correct positions).\nAbsent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.\n\nAlso, we have positional constraints for C and A:\n- C is not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 5 (from second guess).\n- A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess).\n\nSince the word is 5 letters, possible positions for C: positions 2, 3, or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).\nPossible positions for A: positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).\n\nBut note: C and A are both in the word, so they must occupy two of these positions.\n\nWe need to guess a word that has:\n- Both C and A.\n- Avoids the known absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I.\n- Places C in position 2,3, or 4 and A in position 1,4, or 5. But note: if we put A at 4, we can\'t have C at 4 since same position? Actually, they can\'t be in same position? No, each letter occupies one position. So we need to avoid putting both in the same position unless we know it\'s the same letter? But they are different letters.\n\nSo, we should try a word where A is at position 1, 4, or 5 and C is at 2,3, or 4, but not both trying to be at 4? Actually, position 4 could be either A or C, but only one can be there.\n\nWe also need to use new letters to test for presence. Known absent: B, R, N, E, S, I.\n\nSo remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should prioritize common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, L, M, P, etc.\n\nNow, we must include C and A. Let\'s try to find words that meet the criteria.\n\nPossible placements:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1.\nThen C must be at 2,3, or 4.\n\nFor example:\n- Word starting with A: and having C in positions 2,3, or 4.\n\nExamples: \n- Could be ""ACTOR""? But we must avoid absent letters. ACTOR has A, C, T, O, R -> R is absent (from first guess), so cannot because R is in it and is absent.\n- ""ALOFT"" has L, O, F, T -> but we need C? Must include C. ALOFT doesn\'t have C.\n- ""ATTIC"" has T and I -> I is absent (from second guess), so cannot.\n\nWhat about ""APTLY""? Doesn\'t have C.\n\nWe need a word starting with A and having C in 2,3, or4, and avoiding R,N,E,B,S,I.\n\nAnother idea: ""ACTED"" -> but E is absent? E is absent so can\'t. Also D? But we don\'t know about D. However, ACTED: A(1), C(2), T(3), E(4) -> but E is absent. So no.\n\nPerhaps with A at 1 and C at 3? Like ""ATTIC"": A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4) -> I is absent? Second guess showed I absent. Also, C is at position 3? ATTIC has C? No, ATTIC: A,T,T,I,C? Wait positions: 1-A, 2-T, 3-T, 4-I, 5-C? Then it has two Ts? But ignore that for now. However, I is absent and C is at 5? But in our word we are trying C at 3? Not matching.\n\nPerhaps we should use a word list? Since we don\'t have one, we think of common words.\n\nOption: A at position 4? Or position 5?\n\nSince C can\'t be at 1 or 5, and A can\'t be at 2 or 3, we could try A at position 5.\n\nFor example, words ending with A and with C in 2,3,4.\n\nLike: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> but positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4)? Then A at 4? Also, we have two L\'s? But let\'s see: We need to make sure the letters are valid. But L is not yet tested? L is not in absent list.\n\nLOCAL: L (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> A at 4, C at 3. Then we avoid absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes, contains L,O,C,A. So that might be a word.\n\nBut is LOCAL valid? Yes, and it fits.\n\nAnother word: maybe ""FOCAL"" which is similar? F,O,C,A,L -> F is not tested.\n\nBut FOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5) -> A at 4, C at 3.\n\nWe can also try A at position 1.\n\nWords: ""ACTOR"" not allowed (R absent), ""AGAPE"" has E? E absent. ""AXIOM"" has I and O? But I is absent, so cannot.\n\n""ABOUT"" has B? B absent, so no.\n\n""ADOLF"" not valid English.\n\n""AFTER"" has E and R? Both absent, so cannot.\n\nSo maybe A at 4 or 5 is easier.\n\nConsider A at position 5.\n\nThen the word has to have A at end, and C in positions 2,3,4.\n\nExample words: ""TORCA""? Not common. ""MAGIC"" has G,I,C -> I absent? Second guess showed I absent. ""TOPIC"" has I? Also absent? ""MUSIC"" has S and I? Both absent? S and I are absent from second guess.\n\nWhat about ""PHOCA""? Not common.\n\nMaybe ""CLOFA"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""MANIA"" has N and I? Absent.\n\nSo it\'s challenging.\n\nBut note: we have ""LOCAL"" which is valid: L(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)? But wait, double L? A at 4.\n\nWe could also do ""TACIT"" but has I? Absent.\n\nAnother word: ""CAPUT"" has C at 1? We can\'t because C not at 1? Also, A at 2? Second guess showed A not at 2? Feedback for basic: A(-) at position 2, meaning A present but not at position 2. So we cannot put A at 2.\n\nBut in CAPUT, if we do: C(1),A(2),P,U,T. But position 1 C not allowed? And position 2 A not allowed. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, A at 1 or 4 or 5.\n\nWe also have the possibility of A at position 4? Or 5.\n\nBut LOCAL seems acceptable.\n\nA at position 4: another word ""OPTIC"" has O,P,T,I,C -> I absent? So can\'t.\n\n""TOPIC"" same issue.\n\nTherefore, LOCAL: \n- Letters: L, O, C, A, L? But word ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A -> positions:1=L,2=O,3=C,4=A,5=L? Wait, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L, so it has two L\'s? But that might be acceptable if L is repeated.\n\nBut the word ""LOCAL"" ends with L, not A? Wait, I think I confused: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? I think I meant a different word.\n\nActually, the word ""FOCAL"": F-O-C-A-L. That ends with L, and A is at position 4.\n\nAlternatively, words ending in A: \n- For example, ""COMET"" but E absent? No.\n""TOUCA"" not word.\n""DONNA"" has N? Absent.\n\nAnother: ""LOTTA"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""OPERA""? But has E and R? Both absent.\n\nI think ""FOCAL"" might be good: \nF(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). \nBut positions: \n- A at position 4? That is allowed because A wasn\'t at position 3 or 2 before? But we haven\'t tried position 4 for A.\n- C at position 3? We haven\'t tried position 3 for C? Previously: C was at 1 and 5, both wrong, so position 3 is new.\n\nAlso, letters: F, O, L, C, A? FOCAL: F,O,C,A,L? So letters: F,O,C,A,L.\n\nAll letters: C and A are included. F,O,L: not in the absent list? Absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I. So F,O,L are untested.\n\nSo FOCAL might be a good guess.\n\nAnother possibility: we also have other common letters? T, O, P, etc.\n\nWord ""CLAPT""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""CHAFT"" not word.\n\nSo I think ""FOCAL"" is suitable.\n\nBut what about double letters? Don\'t think the secret word has double letters? We don\'t know, but it\'s possible. However, FOCAL has all distinct letters? F,O,C,A,L? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word with T: like ""TRACT"" but R and T? R absent? R is absent.\n\n""CLAMP"": has L,A,M,P? and C? Positions: if we make A at 4: C at 1? But C cannot be at position 1. So if CLAMP: C(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). But A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 from first guess. So invalid.\n\nWe can\'t have A at position 3.\n\nSo for a word like ""CLAMP"", it puts A at 3 and C at 1, both disallowed.\n\nTherefore, we need to avoid that.\n\nAnother word: ""PADRE"" has R and E? Absent.\n\nPerhaps ""CAULK"" has C at 1? Not allowed.\n\nI think FOCAL is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: in FOCAL, A is at position 4? And C at position 3.\n\nWe are trying to find the correct positions.\n\nAnother word: ""LOCAL"": L(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). But repeated L? It\'s acceptable? ""LOCAL"" is spelled L-O-C-A-L? Actually, no: LOCAL is spelled L-O-C-A-L? I think it\'s L-O-C-A-L? I\'m considering: LOCAL is L-O-C-A-L? Actually, I think I\'m wrong; LOCAL is four letters? No, LOCAL is 5 letters: L-O-C-A-L, but it has L twice? And ends with L? And A at 4? Perhaps yes, but it might be rejected? Actually, LOCAL is a word? Yes, meaning either of the hip or a local anesthetic? I think it\'s an adjective.\n\nIn any case, a better alternative might be ""VOCAL"": V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5). That avoids repetition and we haven\'t tested V.\n\nBut we don\'t know V status? Okay.\n\nBut VOCAL has the same positions as FOCAL for C and A: C at 3, A at 4.\n\nFOCAL: F(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)\nVOCAL: V(1),O(2),C(3),A(4),L(5)\n\nWe need a word that has C and A in allowed positions.\n\nBut VOCAL avoids absent letters: R,N,E,B,S,I? Yes.\n\nSo VOCAL is also an option.\n\nWhich one to choose? Both test O, L, and either F or V.\n\nUsing V might be less common? But VOCAL is a common word.\n\nTo maximize new letter coverage? Both are equivalent.\n\nBut note: in VOCAL, V is rare? Perhaps use FOCAL.\n\nBut I think both are fine. Let\'s go with VOCAL? Or FOCAL? F is more common than V? But no particular preference.\n\nPerhaps a word that puts A at position 5? But then C must be at 2,3,4.\n\nWord: ""MONAC"": Not word.\n\n""DINKA"" has N? Absent.\n\n""TOUCA"" not word.\n\nTherefore, I think VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable.\n\nAlso, note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to choose a guess that can resolve positions.\n\nBut since VOCAL and FOCAL place C at 3 and A at 4, if the secret word has that, we\'ll get correct positions? But if not, we get feedback.\n\nAlso, we might test letters that might be present? O and L.\n\nIn the absence of better ideas.\n\nBut what about a word that places A at position 5? Or C at 2?\n\nAnother possibility: word with A at 1: for example, ""ABCAA"" not word.\n\n""AFOUL""? Has F,O,U,L -> but no C? Must include C.\n\nSo we must have a word with both.\n\nPerhaps ""CATLY"" not word.\n\nI think VOCAL is fine.\n\nBut wait: in VOCAL, for C and A: we are putting C at position 3 and A at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if they are at such positions? But that\'s exactly what we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we could make C at position 4 and A at position 1? For example, ""A C at end"" word.\n\nWord: ""CHAOS"" has C at position 4? and A at position 2? But A not at position 2? So if we do ""CHAOS"": C(1)? Not allowed? Positions: CHAOS: C(1), H(2), A(3), O(4), S(5). Problems: \n- C at position 1? Disallowed? Disallowed because we know C not at 1.\n- A at position 3? Disallowed because A not at 3.\nSo invalid.\n\nTherefore, I think a word like VOCAL is best.\n\nBut let\'s also think: perhaps a word that tests more vowels? We know only A is present? Others absent? But we don\'t know. In fact, we have absent I, E? Y might be considered.\n\nCommon words: ""COMA"" is 4 letters? Too short.\n\n""TACKY"" has T,A,C,K,Y: positions: T(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). Now, A at 2? But we know A not at position 2 (from guess 2?). Yes, guess 2: basic had A at 2 marked \'-\', meaning A present but not at position 2? So any word putting A at position 2 would get the same feedback? We know A is not at 2, so we shouldn\'t put it there? Correct, we know A is not at 2, so we must avoid position 2 for A.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 for A is avoided? So TACKY has A at 2? But that position is disallowed? So cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word where A is at 1,4,5 and C at 2,3,4.\n\nAnother word: ""PATCH"" has C at 3? P(1),A(2),T(3),C(4),H(5). But A at position 2? Disallowed? Because we know A not at 2? So if we use PATCH, we put A at 2? Not good? Actually, yes, we shouldn\'t put A at position 2 because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo PATCH: A at 2 not allowed? And also, PATCH: it has A and C? But A at 2? Cannot.\n\nTherefore, I conclude VOCAL or FOCAL are acceptable?\n\nPerhaps: ""ALICO"": Not word.\n\nWe can also do: ""COALA""? Not common? But COALA is not a word? COALA is misspelling? Coala is an animal? But spelling is koala, which is K-O-A-L-A? So K(1),O(2),A(3),L(4),A(5) but no C? And also, K not tested.\n\nBut we need C? The word must have C? Because C is present? So cannot use koala.\n\nTherefore, after consideration, I\'ll go with VOCAL as it is a common word.\n\nAnother word: ""LOCUM"" has U,M? But C at 3? L(1),O(2),C(3),U(4),M(5). But missing A? We must include A? Because A is present? So we must have A? Otherwise we don\'t test A position? We know A is present, so to rule out positions? We don\'t have to? But if we omit A, we might not get full feedback? But the guess must be valid English word? So we can guess a word without A? But we know A is in the word? So to avoid bad words? Actually, we can use a word without A to test other letters? But that might be inefficient since A is known present? We should include it.\n\nSo VOCAL: includes C and A in allowed positions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I will guess VOCAL.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n  This means:\n  - C and A are present in the secret word, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.\n  - R, N, E are absent.\n\n- **Guess 2: basic → B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)**  \n  This means:\n  - B, S, I are absent.\n  - A is present but not in position 2.\n  - C is present but not in position 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed Letters**: Only C and A are present (based on both guesses).  \n  - **C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (per feedback). Possible positions: 2, 3, or 4.\n  - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Absent Letters**: R, N, E, B, S, I (must avoid these).  \n- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common letters like O, L, T, M, P, F, V, etc., to gain new information.  \n- **Goal**: Test possible positions for C and A using untested letters, narrowing down the solution.  \n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Must include both C and A** (known present letters) in the guess to expedite position discovery.\n2. **Avoid all absent letters** (R, N, E, B, S, I).  \n3. **Position Constraints**:\n   - Place A in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2 or 3).  \n   - Place C in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1 or 5).  \n   - Avoid overlap (e.g., both cannot be in position 4 unless confirmed).  \n4. **Word Selection**:\n   - A at position 1: Leads to words like ""ALOFT"" (no C) or ""ABOUT"" (B absent) – unworkable.  \n   - A at position 5 or 4: Works with C in other allowed positions.  \n   - Ideal word: Tests new common consonants or vowels (e.g., L, O, V, F).  \n   - **Chose ""VOCAL""**:  \n     - V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) → A at 4 (not tried), C at 3 (not tried).  \n     - Uses untrusted letters (V, O, L) – common enough to reveal new information.  \n5. **Why ""VOCAL""?**  \n   - Validates positions for C (position 3) and A (position 4).  \n   - Tests V, O, L efficiently; avoids absents.  \n   - If incorrect, feedback will pinpoint errors and reduce possibilities (e.g., C/A positions or other letters).\n\n<guess>vocal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: basic -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)\nGuess 3: vocal -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from Guess 3: vocal -> V(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)
This means:
- V is absent in the word (x for V at position 1)
- O is correct at position 2 (✓)
- C is correct at position 3 (✓)
- A is correct at position 4 (✓)
- L is correct at position 5 (✓)

From Guess 2: basic -> B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-)
We already incorporated that A and C are present, and now we know their exact positions from Guess 3: position 4 for A and position 3 for C. Also from Guess 2, we knew A not at position 2 and C not at position 5.

Similarly, Guess 1: crane -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) told us C and A are present but not at their guessed positions (C not at 1, A not at 3).

Now, combining:
- The secret word has O at position 2, C at position 3, A at position 4, L at position 5. 
And V is absent, so we should avoid V.

So we know 4 positions: 
Position 2: O
Position 3: C
Position 4: A
Position 5: L

Only position 1 is unknown.

Also, we know the entire word must consist of the letters O, C, A, L at positions 2-5, and an unknown letter at position 1.

But we also know the word has no V (from this guess), and from previous guesses absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I, V.

Also, from Guess 1, we had C(-) at position 1? But now we know the only unknown is position 1? And we know position 1 cannot be C? Because from first guess, C was marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 1? But we now have C at position 3, which is confirmed.

So what can be at position 1?

It must be a letter not in the absent list.

Absent list: R, N, E, B, S, I, V? Also, from guesses? Let's get all absent.

From Guess 1: R, N, E absent.
From Guess 2: B, S, I absent.
From Guess 3: V absent.

So absent: B, E, N, R, S, I, V.

Present? We know O, C, A, L are present? And at their positions.

We also know that from Guess 1: C was present and A was present, which we have accounted for.

So the only missing information: position 1, which must be a letter not absent? What letters are possible for position 1?

English letters: A-Z minus absent letters.

Absent: B, E, I, N, R, S, V? And also, we have O, C, A, L in the word? So they are present? But position 1 could be any letter that isn't absent? But likely a consonant? But we don't know.

We know position 1 cannot be a letter that would duplicate? But the word could have duplicate letters? But in this case, the known positions are distinct? So it might not have duplicates.

But what are possible letters?

Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Absent letters: B, E, R, N, S, I, V? And E? Yes.

But C, A, O, L are in the word? So position 1 should not be any of the absent letters.

Also, note: O, C, A, L are already placed? So position 1 must be a different letter? Not necessarily? It could be one of these? For example, if there are duplicates? Like the word would be ""LOCAL"" but that has L at position 1 and 5? And we guessed VOCAL? VOCAL has VOCAL, and we got L correct at position 5? So if we meant LOCAL? Actually, VOCAL was our guess? But we got feedback: O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓) at positions 2,3,4,5. So the secret word has O,C,A,L exactly at those positions? And since L is at position 5? If position 1 were L? It would make the word ""LOCAL""? This is possible? Let me see:

In VOCAL guess: 
- We guessed V O C A L? Positions: V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5)
- Feedback: V(x) -> so position 1 was not V, and O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓) -> so positions 2,3,4,5 are correct: O, C, A, L.

Therefore, the secret word is _ , O, C, A, L? So the word must be ?OCAL, where ? is such that the entire word is valid.

Now, we know ? must not be an absent letter? And absent: B, E, N, R, S, I, V? Also, we know from Guess 1: we guessed C at position 1? It was marked '-' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1? We also have C at position 3, so that's fine? The secret word has C at position 3? But position 1 should not be C? But we have no constraint against it? No: the feedback from first guess: C(-) at position 1 means that the secret word does not have C at position 1? Therefore, position 1 cannot be C? Because if it were C, in the first guess ""CRANE"" would have had C at position 1 marked ✓, not it was marked '-'.

Therefore, position 1 cannot be C? So ? cannot be C.

Similarly, other possibilities:

We must find a word of the form XOCAL, where X is a letter not absent? And X cannot be C?

And the entire word must contain only letters? With O,C,A,L fixed.

So what are possible words that end with OCAL? Like LOCAL? Yes, LOCAL? But we know the word ends with OCAL? So possible words:

- Words like LOCAL? Or other?

In English, common words: 
- LOCAL
- FOCAL? But FOCAL? But in VOCAL we tested V? And it was absent? But LOCAL? L is already at position 5? But in LOCAL, position 1 is L? Position 5 is L? That is possible.

Another: VOCAL? But we guessed VOCAL which would be V O C A L? But V was given x? So not VOCAL? Other? Like ROCAL? But R is absent? Not possible? SOCAL? Too proper? But S absent? DOCAL? Not a word? Probably only LOCAL?

Perhaps other? Like: 
- YOCAL? not word?
- HOCAL? not common? 
- MOCAL? not word?
- TOCAL? not word?

In standard English, the main word is ""local""? Or ""focal""? But FOCAL: F O C A L? And F wasn't tested? In Vocab? F was not absent? But in VOCAL guess we tried V? Not F? So we don't know about F? But for LOCAL:

LOCAL: L O C A L -> positions:1=L,2=O,3=C,4=A,5=L? And we know:
- Position 2: O must be O? And it is.
- Position 3: C? It is C.
- Position 4: A? It is A.
- Position 5: L? It is L.

Now, for position 1: L? We haven't explicitly tested L before? But L is a new letter? Absent letters: B, E, R, N, S, I, V? L is not in that list? Therefore, possible.

But in the feedback for Guess 3, V was absent? That says nothing about L? The L at position 5 was correct? Which was guessed.

But does the first guess give any constraint on L? No? Because when we guessed crane, all other letters? Crane had C,R,A,N,E? And we got R(x), N(x), E(x)? L wasn't involved.

Second guess: basic had B,A,S,I,C? Letters: B,A,S,I,C? Got B(x), S(x), I(x)? L not involved.

So L has not been guessed? So LOCAL is a valid possibility? And it matches all constraints? Also, position 1: L? But we know position 1 cannot be C? But L is different.

Moreover, let's verify with feedback:

First guess: crane was C R A N E -> secret word LOCAL? 
- Position 1: C guessed, secret has L? L not C? and L is not absent? But in secret LOCAL? Position 1: L vs guessed C: not C? So symbol should be either '-' if L was present elsewhere? But LOCAL has L? Actually, L is at positions 1 and 5? So the letter L is present? And L was guessed? Where? In crane, the letters: C,R,A,N,E? No L? So all letters: C,R,A,N,E? Secret LOCAL? So C is in secret? at position 3? R not present? A is at position 4? N not present? E not present? So first guess: 
Position 1: guessed C, actual L? L not in {C,R,A,N,E}? So should be 'x'? But feedback was C(-)? Meaning ? It was '-'? Why?

Clash: 
Actual secret word let's assume LOCAL.
First guess: crane -> positions:
1: C vs L -> L != C? And L is in the word? At positions 1 and 5? But when we guessed C at position 1? Since L != C? and C is present? But at position 3? So C should be marked as present but wrong position? '-'? Because C is in the word? In secret LOCAL? Letter C is at position 3? That matches: C at position 3? Then position 1: guessed letter C? The secret has L? L != C? But C exists at position 3? So for position 1: since C is not L, but C is in the word? Not at position 1? So '-'? Meaning present? Wrong position? Which is what we got: C(-).

Similarly, A: guessed at position 3? Secret has A at position 4? So A present? Not at position 3? So '-'? Feedback: A(-)

R: absent? 'x'
N: absent? 'x'
E: absent? 'x'

All match.

Now Guess 2: basic -> B,A,S,I,C? Secret LOCAL?
Position 1: B vs L? B absent? So 'x'? Feedback: B(x)
Position 2: A vs O? A not in? Wait: A is in the word? At position 4? But position 2: guessed A? Secret? O? O != A? And A present? So not correct, but present? '-'? Feedback: A(-)? Yes.
Position 3: S vs C? S absent? 'x'? Feedback: S(x)
Position 4: I vs A? I absent? 'x'? Feedback: I(x)
Position 5: C vs L? C present? Not at position 5? '-'? Feedback: C(-)? Yes.

Guess 3: vocal -> V O C A L? Secret LOCAL?
Position 1: V vs L? V absent? 'x'? Feedback: V(x)
Position 2: O vs O? same? '✓'? O(✓)
Position 3: C vs C? same? '✓'? C(✓)
Position 4: A vs A? same? '✓'? A(✓)
Position 5: L vs L? same? '✓'? L(✓)? But secret position 5 is L? Yes.

So LOCAL? Feedback matches.

But are there other words? Form XOCAL?

Like DOCAL? Not word? FOCAL? F O C A L? But then position 1 F? We tried V? No? We tried V? F not absent? So possible? But VOCAL we guessed? And got V absent? That doesn't preclude F? Because they are different letters.

But in VOCAL? We tested V? and V was absent? So secret word cannot have V? But FOCAL? Has F? So F might be present? But FOCAL: F O C A, L? Feedback if secret is LOCAL? For VOCAL guess? We got all positions correct? But if secret is LOCAL? Then VOCAL guess: 
Position 1: V vs L -> L != V? And V not in word? So 'x'
Position 2-5: correct? O,C,A,L? And secret LOCAL? So O,C,A,L at positions 2,3,4,5? So matches.

But FOCAL: F O C A L? Is valid? And would be distinct? So possible?

But with Guess 3: VOCAL gave position 2-5 correct, so secret must be XOCAL? And we need to find possible X? With constraints.

Now, X must not be absent? And absent letters: B,E,R,N,S,I,V? Also cannot be C? Because in crane guess? Position 1 C? Secret word must not have C at position 1? So X != C.

Possible letters? From alphabet minus absent? And minus C? We have:

Letters: A,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,W,X,Y,Z

But O,C,A,L are in positions 2-5? So for position 1? It can be one of the above? But must form a valid word.

Words ending with OCAL? 

- Common: LOCAL? L is in the list? 
- FOCAL? F is not absent? So possible? 
- DOCAL? Not word? 
- YOCAL? Not? 
- HOCAL? Not? 
- TOCAL? Not?
- MOCAL? Not?

Also: VOCAL was guessed? V absent? So not VOCAL? But FOCAL: F? 
FOCAL: F O C A L? Valid English word? Yes.

Similarly, LOCAL: L O C A L? Valid? Yes.

If ""CAL"" in ending? Also ""DECAL"" but DECAL? D E C A L? E absent? Not allowed? Also 5 letters? DECAL? D-E-C-A-L? But E absent? So DECAL cannot? Because E is absent? Absent letters include E? From Guess 1? E absent.

Possible words: LOCAL or FOCAL?

How about other words? Like:

- SOCAL? But S absent? Not? 
- ROCKAL? Not 5 letters? 
- BOCAL? B absent? No? 
- Probably only FOCAL and LOCAL?

In first guess: we guessed crane? If secret is FOCAL? 
Position 1: C vs F? C in word? Not at position 1? '-'?
Position 2: R vs O? R absent? 'x'
Position 3: A vs C? Secret position 3 is C? But guessed A? So A present? Not at position 3? '-'? Because A at position 4? 
Position 4: N vs A? Secret position 4 is A? So N != A? And N absent? 'x'
Position 5: E vs L? E absent? 'x'

Feedback? We got: C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) -> matches.

Guess 2: basic? For FOCAL secret?
Position 1: B vs F? B absent? 'x'
Position 2: A vs O? O != A? And A present? At position 4? So A not at position 2? '-'?
Position 3: S? vs C? S absent? 'x'
Position 4: I? vs A? I absent? 'x'
Position 5: C? vs L? C present? Not at position 5? '-'?
Feedback: B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-) -> matches.

Guess 3: VOCAL? V O C A L? 
Position 1: V vs F? V != F? And V not in word? So V absent? 'x'
Position 2-5: O C A L? Correct? But secret FOCAL has O,C,A,L? At positions 2,3,4,5? So O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓)? Correct? So feedback: V(x), O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓) -> same as before.

Therefore, both LOCAL and FOCAL are possible? Because the feedback so far matches both?

Then we must distinguish? Which letter is at position 1? F or L?

We have limited guesses? We need to choose a word that includes possibly? But we know positions 2-5? So we can guess either? Then we find.

Possible for next guess? We can guess ""local"" to test? Because if we guess LOCAL? Then:
If secret is LOCAL, we get all five correct? 
If secret is FOCAL? Then LOCAL? Position 1: L vs F? L absent? Because FOCAL has no L? L is only at position 5? But FOCAL has L? Yes? Positions? F O C A L? So L at position 5? When we guess LOCAL: 
Position 1: L vs F? L != F? And L is in the word? At position 5? So should be marked '-'? Meaning present but not at position 1? So:
Feedback for LOCAL guess? If secret is FOCAL? 
Position 1: L? Secret F? Since L != F? but L is in word? At position 5? So '-'?
Position 2: O? ✓
Position 3: C? ✓
Position 4: A? ✓
Position 5: L? ✓? Because both have L? So ✓?
But wait: secret position 5 is L? We guessed LOCAL position 5 is L? So same? ✓? Positions 2-5 all match? Then position 1? Would be? '-' as above? So feedback would be: L(-), O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓)? With L at position 1 marked '-'? Because L is in the word? But at position 5? Not position 1? 
Similarly for secret LOCAL? We guessed LOCAL? All correct? ✓✓✓✓✓?

Therefore, we can guess LOCAL? And see? We know position 2-5 are correct? So if we guess LOCAL? We know positions 2-5 are correct? Only position 1 might be wrong? But the word has L? So it could be LOCAL or FOCAL? 

But FOCAL: position 1 is F? If we guess LOCAL? And secret is FOCAL? Then we mark position 1 L? With '-'? But we know the positions 2-5 are correct? So we would get L(-) plus four checks? Meaning we know position 1 is not L? Then we might guess F? But we have more tries? Since it's fourth guess? 

We could guess a word that tests position 1? For example, include F? But we don't know? But common? 

Since both are possible? Let's choose one? To save a guess? 

We can guess ""local"" because if it works? We win? If not? Then we know it must be FOCAL? 

Better? Guess LOCAL now? So:

<guess>local</guess> 

In thought: but we must output one? 

Alternatively: is there another possibility? We listed LOCAL and FOCAL? Are there others? 

For example: TOCAL? Not word? Or YOCAL? Not? Probably not? So likely only those two. 

So I'll guess LOCAL? 

But what if the word is LOCAL? We win? 

If not? Next guess we do FOCAL? 

But we have to make a guess now? So guess LOCAL?
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  Revealed: C and A are present (positions unknown), R/N/E absent.
- **Guess 2: basic → B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  Revealed: A not in position 2, C not in position 5, B/S/I absent.
- **Guess 3: vocal → V(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)**  
  Confirmed O, C, A, L in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. V absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word matches `_ O C A L` for positions 2–5.
2. Position 1 is the only unknown.
3. Position 1:
   - Cannot be **C** (per Guess 1 feedback: C not in position 1).
   - Cannot be any absent letter: **B, E, R, N, S, I, V** (from all feedback).
4. Possible words fitting `?OCAL`:
   - **LOCAL**: Valid English word (e.g., ""local community"").
   - **FOCAL**: Valid English word (e.g., ""focal point"").
5. Since both `LOCAL` and `FOCAL` align with all constraints, prioritize **LOCAL** to test position 1 (L):
   - If `LOCAL` is correct → All positions match.
   - If `LOCAL` is incorrect, feedback will confirm L’s status at position 1, leaving `FOCAL` as the solution.

### Why Guess ""LOCAL""?
- Tests position 1 with L efficiently.
- Resolves all unknowns → If wrong, ""FOCAL"" must be correct (next guess).
- Uses turn 4/6 wisely.

<guess>local</guess>",local,"We are given feedback from Guess 3: vocal -> V(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)
This means:
- V is absent in the word (x for V at position 1)
- O is correct at position 2 (✓)
- C is correct at position 3 (✓)
- A is correct at position 4 (✓)
- L is correct at position 5 (✓)

From Guess 2: basic -> B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-)
We already incorporated that A and C are present, and now we know their exact positions from Guess 3: position 4 for A and position 3 for C. Also from Guess 2, we knew A not at position 2 and C not at position 5.

Similarly, Guess 1: crane -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) told us C and A are present but not at their guessed positions (C not at 1, A not at 3).

Now, combining:
- The secret word has O at position 2, C at position 3, A at position 4, L at position 5. 
And V is absent, so we should avoid V.

So we know 4 positions: 
Position 2: O
Position 3: C
Position 4: A
Position 5: L

Only position 1 is unknown.

Also, we know the entire word must consist of the letters O, C, A, L at positions 2-5, and an unknown letter at position 1.

But we also know the word has no V (from this guess), and from previous guesses absent letters: R, N, E, B, S, I, V.

Also, from Guess 1, we had C(-) at position 1? But now we know the only unknown is position 1? And we know position 1 cannot be C? Because from first guess, C was marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 1? But we now have C at position 3, which is confirmed.

So what can be at position 1?

It must be a letter not in the absent list.

Absent list: R, N, E, B, S, I, V? Also, from guesses? Let's get all absent.

From Guess 1: R, N, E absent.
From Guess 2: B, S, I absent.
From Guess 3: V absent.

So absent: B, E, N, R, S, I, V.

Present? We know O, C, A, L are present? And at their positions.

We also know that from Guess 1: C was present and A was present, which we have accounted for.

So the only missing information: position 1, which must be a letter not absent? What letters are possible for position 1?

English letters: A-Z minus absent letters.

Absent: B, E, I, N, R, S, V? And also, we have O, C, A, L in the word? So they are present? But position 1 could be any letter that isn't absent? But likely a consonant? But we don't know.

We know position 1 cannot be a letter that would duplicate? But the word could have duplicate letters? But in this case, the known positions are distinct? So it might not have duplicates.

But what are possible letters?

Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Absent letters: B, E, R, N, S, I, V? And E? Yes.

But C, A, O, L are in the word? So position 1 should not be any of the absent letters.

Also, note: O, C, A, L are already placed? So position 1 must be a different letter? Not necessarily? It could be one of these? For example, if there are duplicates? Like the word would be ""LOCAL"" but that has L at position 1 and 5? And we guessed VOCAL? VOCAL has VOCAL, and we got L correct at position 5? So if we meant LOCAL? Actually, VOCAL was our guess? But we got feedback: O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓) at positions 2,3,4,5. So the secret word has O,C,A,L exactly at those positions? And since L is at position 5? If position 1 were L? It would make the word ""LOCAL""? This is possible? Let me see:

In VOCAL guess: 
- We guessed V O C A L? Positions: V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5)
- Feedback: V(x) -> so position 1 was not V, and O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓) -> so positions 2,3,4,5 are correct: O, C, A, L.

Therefore, the secret word is _ , O, C, A, L? So the word must be ?OCAL, where ? is such that the entire word is valid.

Now, we know ? must not be an absent letter? And absent: B, E, N, R, S, I, V? Also, we know from Guess 1: we guessed C at position 1? It was marked '-' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1? We also have C at position 3, so that's fine? The secret word has C at position 3? But position 1 should not be C? But we have no constraint against it? No: the feedback from first guess: C(-) at position 1 means that the secret word does not have C at position 1? Therefore, position 1 cannot be C? Because if it were C, in the first guess ""CRANE"" would have had C at position 1 marked ✓, not it was marked '-'.

Therefore, position 1 cannot be C? So ? cannot be C.

Similarly, other possibilities:

We must find a word of the form XOCAL, where X is a letter not absent? And X cannot be C?

And the entire word must contain only letters? With O,C,A,L fixed.

So what are possible words that end with OCAL? Like LOCAL? Yes, LOCAL? But we know the word ends with OCAL? So possible words:

- Words like LOCAL? Or other?

In English, common words: 
- LOCAL
- FOCAL? But FOCAL? But in VOCAL we tested V? And it was absent? But LOCAL? L is already at position 5? But in LOCAL, position 1 is L? Position 5 is L? That is possible.

Another: VOCAL? But we guessed VOCAL which would be V O C A L? But V was given x? So not VOCAL? Other? Like ROCAL? But R is absent? Not possible? SOCAL? Too proper? But S absent? DOCAL? Not a word? Probably only LOCAL?

Perhaps other? Like: 
- YOCAL? not word?
- HOCAL? not common? 
- MOCAL? not word?
- TOCAL? not word?

In standard English, the main word is ""local""? Or ""focal""? But FOCAL: F O C A L? And F wasn't tested? In Vocab? F was not absent? But in VOCAL guess we tried V? Not F? So we don't know about F? But for LOCAL:

LOCAL: L O C A L -> positions:1=L,2=O,3=C,4=A,5=L? And we know:
- Position 2: O must be O? And it is.
- Position 3: C? It is C.
- Position 4: A? It is A.
- Position 5: L? It is L.

Now, for position 1: L? We haven't explicitly tested L before? But L is a new letter? Absent letters: B, E, R, N, S, I, V? L is not in that list? Therefore, possible.

But in the feedback for Guess 3, V was absent? That says nothing about L? The L at position 5 was correct? Which was guessed.

But does the first guess give any constraint on L? No? Because when we guessed crane, all other letters? Crane had C,R,A,N,E? And we got R(x), N(x), E(x)? L wasn't involved.

Second guess: basic had B,A,S,I,C? Letters: B,A,S,I,C? Got B(x), S(x), I(x)? L not involved.

So L has not been guessed? So LOCAL is a valid possibility? And it matches all constraints? Also, position 1: L? But we know position 1 cannot be C? But L is different.

Moreover, let's verify with feedback:

First guess: crane was C R A N E -> secret word LOCAL? 
- Position 1: C guessed, secret has L? L not C? and L is not absent? But in secret LOCAL? Position 1: L vs guessed C: not C? So symbol should be either '-' if L was present elsewhere? But LOCAL has L? Actually, L is at positions 1 and 5? So the letter L is present? And L was guessed? Where? In crane, the letters: C,R,A,N,E? No L? So all letters: C,R,A,N,E? Secret LOCAL? So C is in secret? at position 3? R not present? A is at position 4? N not present? E not present? So first guess: 
Position 1: guessed C, actual L? L not in {C,R,A,N,E}? So should be 'x'? But feedback was C(-)? Meaning ? It was '-'? Why?

Clash: 
Actual secret word let's assume LOCAL.
First guess: crane -> positions:
1: C vs L -> L != C? And L is in the word? At positions 1 and 5? But when we guessed C at position 1? Since L != C? and C is present? But at position 3? So C should be marked as present but wrong position? '-'? Because C is in the word? In secret LOCAL? Letter C is at position 3? That matches: C at position 3? Then position 1: guessed letter C? The secret has L? L != C? But C exists at position 3? So for position 1: since C is not L, but C is in the word? Not at position 1? So '-'? Meaning present? Wrong position? Which is what we got: C(-).

Similarly, A: guessed at position 3? Secret has A at position 4? So A present? Not at position 3? So '-'? Feedback: A(-)

R: absent? 'x'
N: absent? 'x'
E: absent? 'x'

All match.

Now Guess 2: basic -> B,A,S,I,C? Secret LOCAL?
Position 1: B vs L? B absent? So 'x'? Feedback: B(x)
Position 2: A vs O? A not in? Wait: A is in the word? At position 4? But position 2: guessed A? Secret? O? O != A? And A present? So not correct, but present? '-'? Feedback: A(-)? Yes.
Position 3: S vs C? S absent? 'x'? Feedback: S(x)
Position 4: I vs A? I absent? 'x'? Feedback: I(x)
Position 5: C vs L? C present? Not at position 5? '-'? Feedback: C(-)? Yes.

Guess 3: vocal -> V O C A L? Secret LOCAL?
Position 1: V vs L? V absent? 'x'? Feedback: V(x)
Position 2: O vs O? same? '✓'? O(✓)
Position 3: C vs C? same? '✓'? C(✓)
Position 4: A vs A? same? '✓'? A(✓)
Position 5: L vs L? same? '✓'? L(✓)? But secret position 5 is L? Yes.

So LOCAL? Feedback matches.

But are there other words? Form XOCAL?

Like DOCAL? Not word? FOCAL? F O C A L? But then position 1 F? We tried V? No? We tried V? F not absent? So possible? But VOCAL we guessed? And got V absent? That doesn't preclude F? Because they are different letters.

But in VOCAL? We tested V? and V was absent? So secret word cannot have V? But FOCAL? Has F? So F might be present? But FOCAL: F O C A, L? Feedback if secret is LOCAL? For VOCAL guess? We got all positions correct? But if secret is LOCAL? Then VOCAL guess: 
Position 1: V vs L -> L != V? And V not in word? So 'x'
Position 2-5: correct? O,C,A,L? And secret LOCAL? So O,C,A,L at positions 2,3,4,5? So matches.

But FOCAL: F O C A L? Is valid? And would be distinct? So possible?

But with Guess 3: VOCAL gave position 2-5 correct, so secret must be XOCAL? And we need to find possible X? With constraints.

Now, X must not be absent? And absent letters: B,E,R,N,S,I,V? Also cannot be C? Because in crane guess? Position 1 C? Secret word must not have C at position 1? So X != C.

Possible letters? From alphabet minus absent? And minus C? We have:

Letters: A,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,W,X,Y,Z

But O,C,A,L are in positions 2-5? So for position 1? It can be one of the above? But must form a valid word.

Words ending with OCAL? 

- Common: LOCAL? L is in the list? 
- FOCAL? F is not absent? So possible? 
- DOCAL? Not word? 
- YOCAL? Not? 
- HOCAL? Not? 
- TOCAL? Not?
- MOCAL? Not?

Also: VOCAL was guessed? V absent? So not VOCAL? But FOCAL: F? 
FOCAL: F O C A L? Valid English word? Yes.

Similarly, LOCAL: L O C A L? Valid? Yes.

If ""CAL"" in ending? Also ""DECAL"" but DECAL? D E C A L? E absent? Not allowed? Also 5 letters? DECAL? D-E-C-A-L? But E absent? So DECAL cannot? Because E is absent? Absent letters include E? From Guess 1? E absent.

Possible words: LOCAL or FOCAL?

How about other words? Like:

- SOCAL? But S absent? Not? 
- ROCKAL? Not 5 letters? 
- BOCAL? B absent? No? 
- Probably only FOCAL and LOCAL?

In first guess: we guessed crane? If secret is FOCAL? 
Position 1: C vs F? C in word? Not at position 1? '-'?
Position 2: R vs O? R absent? 'x'
Position 3: A vs C? Secret position 3 is C? But guessed A? So A present? Not at position 3? '-'? Because A at position 4? 
Position 4: N vs A? Secret position 4 is A? So N != A? And N absent? 'x'
Position 5: E vs L? E absent? 'x'

Feedback? We got: C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) -> matches.

Guess 2: basic? For FOCAL secret?
Position 1: B vs F? B absent? 'x'
Position 2: A vs O? O != A? And A present? At position 4? So A not at position 2? '-'?
Position 3: S? vs C? S absent? 'x'
Position 4: I? vs A? I absent? 'x'
Position 5: C? vs L? C present? Not at position 5? '-'?
Feedback: B(x), A(-), S(x), I(x), C(-) -> matches.

Guess 3: VOCAL? V O C A L? 
Position 1: V vs F? V != F? And V not in word? So V absent? 'x'
Position 2-5: O C A L? Correct? But secret FOCAL has O,C,A,L? At positions 2,3,4,5? So O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓)? Correct? So feedback: V(x), O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓) -> same as before.

Therefore, both LOCAL and FOCAL are possible? Because the feedback so far matches both?

Then we must distinguish? Which letter is at position 1? F or L?

We have limited guesses? We need to choose a word that includes possibly? But we know positions 2-5? So we can guess either? Then we find.

Possible for next guess? We can guess ""local"" to test? Because if we guess LOCAL? Then:
If secret is LOCAL, we get all five correct? 
If secret is FOCAL? Then LOCAL? Position 1: L vs F? L absent? Because FOCAL has no L? L is only at position 5? But FOCAL has L? Yes? Positions? F O C A L? So L at position 5? When we guess LOCAL: 
Position 1: L vs F? L != F? And L is in the word? At position 5? So should be marked '-'? Meaning present but not at position 1? So:
Feedback for LOCAL guess? If secret is FOCAL? 
Position 1: L? Secret F? Since L != F? but L is in word? At position 5? So '-'?
Position 2: O? ✓
Position 3: C? ✓
Position 4: A? ✓
Position 5: L? ✓? Because both have L? So ✓?
But wait: secret position 5 is L? We guessed LOCAL position 5 is L? So same? ✓? Positions 2-5 all match? Then position 1? Would be? '-' as above? So feedback would be: L(-), O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓)? With L at position 1 marked '-'? Because L is in the word? But at position 5? Not position 1? 
Similarly for secret LOCAL? We guessed LOCAL? All correct? ✓✓✓✓✓?

Therefore, we can guess LOCAL? And see? We know position 2-5 are correct? So if we guess LOCAL? We know positions 2-5 are correct? Only position 1 might be wrong? But the word has L? So it could be LOCAL or FOCAL? 

But FOCAL: position 1 is F? If we guess LOCAL? And secret is FOCAL? Then we mark position 1 L? With '-'? But we know the positions 2-5 are correct? So we would get L(-) plus four checks? Meaning we know position 1 is not L? Then we might guess F? But we have more tries? Since it's fourth guess? 

We could guess a word that tests position 1? For example, include F? But we don't know? But common? 

Since both are possible? Let's choose one? To save a guess? 

We can guess ""local"" because if it works? We win? If not? Then we know it must be FOCAL? 

Better? Guess LOCAL now? So:

<guess>local</guess> 

In thought: but we must output one? 

Alternatively: is there another possibility? We listed LOCAL and FOCAL? Are there others? 

For example: TOCAL? Not word? Or YOCAL? Not? Probably not? So likely only those two. 

So I'll guess LOCAL? 

But what if the word is LOCAL? We win? 

If not? Next guess we do FOCAL? 

But we have to make a guess now? So guess LOCAL?Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  Revealed: C and A are present (positions unknown), R/N/E absent.
- **Guess 2: basic → B(x) A(-) S(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  Revealed: A not in position 2, C not in position 5, B/S/I absent.
- **Guess 3: vocal → V(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)**  
  Confirmed O, C, A, L in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. V absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word matches `_ O C A L` for positions 2–5.
2. Position 1 is the only unknown.
3. Position 1:
   - Cannot be **C** (per Guess 1 feedback: C not in position 1).
   - Cannot be any absent letter: **B, E, R, N, S, I, V** (from all feedback).
4. Possible words fitting `?OCAL`:
   - **LOCAL**: Valid English word (e.g., ""local community"").
   - **FOCAL**: Valid English word (e.g., ""focal point"").
5. Since both `LOCAL` and `FOCAL` align with all constraints, prioritize **LOCAL** to test position 1 (L):
   - If `LOCAL` is correct → All positions match.
   - If `LOCAL` is incorrect, feedback will confirm L’s status at position 1, leaving `FOCAL` as the solution.

### Why Guess ""LOCAL""?
- Tests position 1 with L efficiently.
- Resolves all unknowns → If wrong, ""FOCAL"" must be correct (next guess).
- Uses turn 4/6 wisely.",Guess 4: local -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
