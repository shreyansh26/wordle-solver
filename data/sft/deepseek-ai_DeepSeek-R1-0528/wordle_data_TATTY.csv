We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, we must avoid using them again.

 We also note that the secret word has the letter A, but not in the third position.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that has A and other common letters.

 Since A is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. For example, we can try A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We also have common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in a position other than third.
 - Uses new letters that we haven't tried (so avoid C, R, N, E) and also avoid the ones we know are absent.

 We know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new, but note: we must avoid E and R? Actually, E and R are absent, so we cannot use them. ""AFTER"" has E and R -> invalid because we know they are not in the word).

 We must avoid E and R. So ""ABOUT"": 
   A (first), B, O, U, T -> all new letters? But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

 However, we also note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: We know A is in the word, so we can try to put A in the second position? Or fourth? 

 Let's think of common words without the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E). We also note that we have not tried S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have the letter D to test.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. So let's avoid repeating A until we know more.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" (meaning a braid) -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position for A? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 3) was wrong, but A might be in the third position in the secret word? 

 Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an A, but not at position 3. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""PLAIT"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before and we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 We can try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ALBUM"" (but has U and M, and we don't know about them). But note: we also have to avoid R, C, N, E.

 Another word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
   A is in the third position? We want to avoid third? Actually, we can put A in a different position. In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. So that's the same as before? We know A is not at position 3, so we should not put it there.

 We can rearrange: How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A (second position), S, T, A (fifth). 
   But note: we have two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A in the second and fifth positions. The feedback only said A is in the word (at least one) but not at position 3. So it could be at 2 or 5.

 However, we are also testing P, S, T.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""PASTA"" doesn't contain any of these.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N (which we know is absent) -> invalid because N is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A.

 We must include A.

 Let me try to list words with A in a position other than 3 and without C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Words with A at position 1:
   ALIST (A, L, I, S, T) -> but is it a word? Actually, ""ALIST"" is not common. How about ""ALOFT"" (A, L, O, F, T) -> valid? Yes.

 Words with A at position 2:
   PLATE -> but has E (absent) -> invalid.
   BLAND -> has N (absent) -> invalid.
   FLASK -> has S and K, but also we don't know about F, L, S, K. And A is at position 2? Actually, F-L-A-S-K: A is at position 3 -> avoid? We want position 2? Actually, in ""FLASK"", A is at position 3 -> so that's the same as before? We must avoid.

 How about ""TASTY"": 
   T, A (second), S, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T, S, Y. Also, A is at position 2 -> good.

 But ""TASTY"" has two T's. We don't know if the word has T or two T's.

 Another word: ""BAILS"" (B, A, I, L, S) -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   We don't have many common words. Example: ""OPALS"" (O, P, A, L, S) -> A at position 3? Actually, O-P-A-L-S: A is at position 3 -> avoid.

 How about ""FOCAL""? F-O-C-A-L -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""DOGMA"": D-O-G-M-A -> A at position 5? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G, 4:M, 5:A -> so A at position 5. And no forbidden letters? D, O, G, M, A -> no C, R, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> but Z is uncommon and we have two Z's.

 After considering, let's choose between:
   ""ALOFT"" (A at 1) -> A, L, O, F, T
   ""TASTY"" (A at 2) -> T, A, S, T, Y (but two T's, which might not be efficient)
   ""BAILS"" (A at 2) -> B, A, I, L, S
   ""DOGMA"" (A at 5) -> D, O, G, M, A

 We want to maximize new letters and avoid repetition.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a good candidate: 
   It has A in position 2 (which is new), and letters B, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, ""ALOFT"" has A in position 1 and L, O, F, T.

 Since we know A is in the word, and we are trying to find its position, putting A in a new position (like 1 or 2) is good.

 Let me choose ""BAILS"". 

 But note: we are not forced to put A in a specific position, but we know it's not at 3. So by putting it at 2, we can check if that's the correct position.

 If we get a ✓ for A in position 2, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x', that would be impossible because we know A is in the word.

 Actually, we cannot get an 'x' for A because we know it's in the word. So we expect either ✓ or -.

 So let's go with ""BAILS"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? Then we might get two marks. But we don't know. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters to get clearer feedback.

 ""BAILS"" has distinct letters: B, A, I, L, S -> all distinct. That's good.

 So I choose ""BAILS"".

 However, let me check if ""BAILS"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of bail, meaning a bucket or to remove water).

 Alternatively, we can use ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't want to repeat. So ""BAILS"" is better.

 Another option: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid.

 Let me also consider ""AUDIO"" -> but we know U? We don't, but it has A at position 1 and U, D, I, O. But we also avoid R, C, N, E -> okay. But we don't have any common consonants? And we are testing two vowels (A and I, O, U). Maybe not as efficient.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a solid choice.

 So next guess: ""BAILS""

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in the third position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" in a position other than the third (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, S, L, I, T, O) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

Selected ""BAILS"" because:
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, we must avoid using them again.

 We also note that the secret word has the letter A, but not in the third position.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that has A and other common letters.

 Since A is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. For example, we can try A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We also have common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in a position other than third.
 - Uses new letters that we haven't tried (so avoid C, R, N, E) and also avoid the ones we know are absent.

 We know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new, but note: we must avoid E and R? Actually, E and R are absent, so we cannot use them. ""AFTER"" has E and R -> invalid because we know they are not in the word).

 We must avoid E and R. So ""ABOUT"": 
   A (first), B, O, U, T -> all new letters? But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

 However, we also note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: We know A is in the word, so we can try to put A in the second position? Or fourth? 

 Let's think of common words without the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E). We also note that we have not tried S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have the letter D to test.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. So let's avoid repeating A until we know more.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" (meaning a braid) -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position for A? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 3) was wrong, but A might be in the third position in the secret word? 

 Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an A, but not at position 3. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""PLAIT"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before and we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 We can try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ALBUM"" (but has U and M, and we don't know about them). But note: we also have to avoid R, C, N, E.

 Another word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
   A is in the third position? We want to avoid third? Actually, we can put A in a different position. In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. So that's the same as before? We know A is not at position 3, so we should not put it there.

 We can rearrange: How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A (second position), S, T, A (fifth). 
   But note: we have two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A in the second and fifth positions. The feedback only said A is in the word (at least one) but not at position 3. So it could be at 2 or 5.

 However, we are also testing P, S, T.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""PASTA"" doesn't contain any of these.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N (which we know is absent) -> invalid because N is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A.

 We must include A.

 Let me try to list words with A in a position other than 3 and without C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Words with A at position 1:
   ALIST (A, L, I, S, T) -> but is it a word? Actually, ""ALIST"" is not common. How about ""ALOFT"" (A, L, O, F, T) -> valid? Yes.

 Words with A at position 2:
   PLATE -> but has E (absent) -> invalid.
   BLAND -> has N (absent) -> invalid.
   FLASK -> has S and K, but also we don't know about F, L, S, K. And A is at position 2? Actually, F-L-A-S-K: A is at position 3 -> avoid? We want position 2? Actually, in ""FLASK"", A is at position 3 -> so that's the same as before? We must avoid.

 How about ""TASTY"": 
   T, A (second), S, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T, S, Y. Also, A is at position 2 -> good.

 But ""TASTY"" has two T's. We don't know if the word has T or two T's.

 Another word: ""BAILS"" (B, A, I, L, S) -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   We don't have many common words. Example: ""OPALS"" (O, P, A, L, S) -> A at position 3? Actually, O-P-A-L-S: A is at position 3 -> avoid.

 How about ""FOCAL""? F-O-C-A-L -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""DOGMA"": D-O-G-M-A -> A at position 5? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G, 4:M, 5:A -> so A at position 5. And no forbidden letters? D, O, G, M, A -> no C, R, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> but Z is uncommon and we have two Z's.

 After considering, let's choose between:
   ""ALOFT"" (A at 1) -> A, L, O, F, T
   ""TASTY"" (A at 2) -> T, A, S, T, Y (but two T's, which might not be efficient)
   ""BAILS"" (A at 2) -> B, A, I, L, S
   ""DOGMA"" (A at 5) -> D, O, G, M, A

 We want to maximize new letters and avoid repetition.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a good candidate: 
   It has A in position 2 (which is new), and letters B, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, ""ALOFT"" has A in position 1 and L, O, F, T.

 Since we know A is in the word, and we are trying to find its position, putting A in a new position (like 1 or 2) is good.

 Let me choose ""BAILS"". 

 But note: we are not forced to put A in a specific position, but we know it's not at 3. So by putting it at 2, we can check if that's the correct position.

 If we get a ✓ for A in position 2, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x', that would be impossible because we know A is in the word.

 Actually, we cannot get an 'x' for A because we know it's in the word. So we expect either ✓ or -.

 So let's go with ""BAILS"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? Then we might get two marks. But we don't know. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters to get clearer feedback.

 ""BAILS"" has distinct letters: B, A, I, L, S -> all distinct. That's good.

 So I choose ""BAILS"".

 However, let me check if ""BAILS"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of bail, meaning a bucket or to remove water).

 Alternatively, we can use ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't want to repeat. So ""BAILS"" is better.

 Another option: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid.

 Let me also consider ""AUDIO"" -> but we know U? We don't, but it has A at position 1 and U, D, I, O. But we also avoid R, C, N, E -> okay. But we don't have any common consonants? And we are testing two vowels (A and I, O, U). Maybe not as efficient.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a solid choice.

 So next guess: ""BAILS""

<guess>bails</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in the third position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" in a position other than the third (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, S, L, I, T, O) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

Selected ""BAILS"" because:
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate ""A"" and test four new letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
  A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: bails
Feedback: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
Meaning:
  B, I, L, S are not in the word at all.
  A is in the word AND in the correct position, which is position 2 (since in ""bails"", A is the second letter).

So now we know:
- A is definitely the second letter of the secret word.
- The following letters are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S. (From guess1: C,R,N,E; from guess2: B,I,L,S)

Since A is fixed at position 2, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.

We have 6 tries left, but we want to make a guess that uses common letters not yet tested and fits the pattern.

Available letters: We have vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The secret word: second letter is A, and we know the word must contain only letters from the available set and include A at position 2.

We need to choose a word that has A at the second position and uses only letters not excluded.

Moreover, we don't know the other positions, so we should test new letters.

What is still possible? The word could be, for example, ""FAVOR"", but we haven't tried F, V, O, R? Wait, R is excluded (from first guess). R is not in the word. Similarly, S and E are out.

We must avoid letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S.

So possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to use common letters: T, O, P, M, D, etc.

Let's think of common words that have A in the second position and use letters from the available set.

Examples:
- ""PANDA"" but P is available? But A is at position 2? P-A-N-D-A: but N is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.
- ""TALON"" but L is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MAKER"" but R is excluded -> invalid.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to form words:
- First letter? Can be D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, etc.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar.

Possible words:
- ""PAPAL"" but L is excluded -> no.
- ""DADDY"" has D, A (at 2), D, D, Y? But we don't know about D and Y. But word? ""DADDY"" is valid, but has repeated D. And positions: D (1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5). But we don't have information on D and Y. However, we can try.

But we want to test multiple new letters. So words with distinct letters are better for information.

Another word: ""HAPPY"" but H, P, P, Y? Has repeated P. Also, A at 2? H-A-P-P-Y? But third letter P, then P again? Not distinct.

Let's try common words:
- ""TANGY"": T-A-N-G-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.
- ""JAZZY"": J-A-Z-Z-Y? J and Z are uncommon? And repeated Z.
- ""QUACK"": Q-U-A-C-K? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F? But we have A at 3? Q-U-A? Position 3? We need A at 2? Actually, Q-U-A: A is at position 3 -> not position 2.

We need A at position 2.

Another: ""GAUDY"": G-A-U-D-Y? Letters: G, U, D, Y. All new. Yes.

Similarly, ""DAWNS"" -> but S and N are excluded -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> but L is excluded -> invalid.

""HAVOC"": H-A-V-O-C? C is excluded -> invalid.

""KAPUT"": K-A-P-U-T? Letters: K, P, U, T. All available? K, P, U, T are not excluded. Yes. Word: kaput meaning broken or finished.

""MAUVE"": M-A-U-V-E? But E is excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y? Repeated D? But P, D, Y available? And A at 2. Valid word? Yes, meaning a rice field.

But we have repeated D. Not ideal.

Another: ""PATIO"": P-A-T-I-O? But I is excluded (from guess2) -> invalid.

""PLATE"": P-A-L-A-T? But L is excluded and E is excluded? Wait, ""PLATE"" has E? And L. Both excluded -> invalid.

""TOADY"": T-O-A-D-Y? But A is at position 3? Actually, T-O-A: A at position 3 -> not 2.

We need first letter then A, so the pattern: [letter]A[three letters]

So: ""GAUDY"" (G-A-U-D-Y) -> letters G,U,D,Y. But D and Y? We don't know. And U is a vowel.

""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T? L is excluded -> invalid.

""YACHT"": Y-A-C-H-T? C is excluded -> invalid.

""WACKY"": W-A-C-K-Y? C is excluded -> invalid.

So harder? How about ""OAKUM"": O-A-K-U-M? All letters? O, A, K, U, M. And O is first letter? We don't know about O, K, U, M. And A at position 2? Yes. And word: ""oakum"" (a fiber used in shipbuilding). Valid.

But uncommon word? Maybe.

More common: ""MANOR"": M-A-N-O-R? N and R excluded -> invalid.

""GAMUT"": G-A-M-U-T? G, M, U, T. All available? Yes. Word: gamut meaning range. Yes.

So ""GAMUT"": G in position 1, A at 2, M at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

All letters distinct: G, M, U, T are new.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H-A-B-I-T? But B and I are excluded -> invalid.

""RAINY"": R is excluded -> invalid.

""VAUNT"": V-A-U-N-T? N excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""DAYLY""? Not really a word.

""DATUM"": D-A-T-U-M? M and U? Yes? But T at position 3. Word: datum, plural data? But as a guess, sometimes accepted? But it's 5 letters: D-A-T-U-M. Valid.

But ""DATUM"" has two T? No, D,A,T,U,M.

But in terms of commonality, ""GAMUT"" might be better.

Also: ""FAQIR"": F-A-Q-I-R? I and R excluded -> invalid.

I think ""GAMUT"" is acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PATCH"": C excluded -> no.

Let me think of words that are common: ""PARTY"": R excluded -> no.

So let's go with ""GAMUT"".

Another common word: ""TAFFY""? T-A-F-F-Y? Repeated F? And F and Y. But A at 2.

But repeated F -> less information.

I think ""GAMUT"" is good because distinct letters.

But we have U which is a vowel? We already know vowels: A is present. We might need to test other vowels? U and O? But in ""GAMUT"", we are testing O? No, it has U.

Alternatively, we can test O? In a word.

How about ""GATOR"": G-A-T-O-R? R excluded -> invalid.

""MATZO"": M-A-T-Z-O? Z and O? But if we want to test Z? Less common.

Perhaps ""OUTDO"" but A must be at position 2 -> doesn't fit.

So I'll go with ""GAMUT"".

But note: we are only allowed valid words. ""GAMUT"" is valid.

Another word: ""DAVIT"": D-A-V-I-T? I excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems best.

Let me summarize:
- We know: secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Excluded letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S
- So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
- ""GAMUT"": uses G, A (known at pos2), M, U, T. And A is fixed so we are testing G at pos1, M at pos3, U at pos4, T at pos5.

If we get feedback:
- G: could be correct (✓), present but wrong position (-), or absent (x) -> but we'll see.

Similarly for M, U, T.

This guess also helps cover more ground.

So guess: GAMUT

Let me double-check: 
Position: G in 1, A in 2 (we know it must be correct), M in 3, U in 4, T in 5.
Expected feedback on A is ✓ for position 2, for the others we don't know.

And the word is 5 letters and valid.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: ""GAMUT""
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → A is in the word but not in position 3 (C, R, N, E are absent).
- **Guess 2: bails** → A is correct and in position 2 (B, I, L, S are absent).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`.
2. **Excluded letters** (not in the word): B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.
3. **Remaining letters** to test: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
- Must start with a letter not excluded (e.g., G, T, M, D, P) and include **A** at position 2.
- Prioritize common letters and distinct positions to maximize information.
- Potential words: ""GAMUT"" (tests G, M, U, T), ""DAVIT"" (invalid, I excluded), ""TAFFY"" (repeated F, less informative).
- **Selected ""GAMUT""** because:
  - Fits the pattern `G A M U T`, testing four new distinct letters (G, M, U, T).
  - Common letters covered: G, M, T.
  - If incorrect, feedback will narrow down position/s for other letters.

<guess>gamut</guess>",gamut,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
  A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: bails
Feedback: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
Meaning:
  B, I, L, S are not in the word at all.
  A is in the word AND in the correct position, which is position 2 (since in ""bails"", A is the second letter).

So now we know:
- A is definitely the second letter of the secret word.
- The following letters are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S. (From guess1: C,R,N,E; from guess2: B,I,L,S)

Since A is fixed at position 2, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.

We have 6 tries left, but we want to make a guess that uses common letters not yet tested and fits the pattern.

Available letters: We have vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The secret word: second letter is A, and we know the word must contain only letters from the available set and include A at position 2.

We need to choose a word that has A at the second position and uses only letters not excluded.

Moreover, we don't know the other positions, so we should test new letters.

What is still possible? The word could be, for example, ""FAVOR"", but we haven't tried F, V, O, R? Wait, R is excluded (from first guess). R is not in the word. Similarly, S and E are out.

We must avoid letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S.

So possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to use common letters: T, O, P, M, D, etc.

Let's think of common words that have A in the second position and use letters from the available set.

Examples:
- ""PANDA"" but P is available? But A is at position 2? P-A-N-D-A: but N is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.
- ""TALON"" but L is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MAKER"" but R is excluded -> invalid.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to form words:
- First letter? Can be D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, etc.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar.

Possible words:
- ""PAPAL"" but L is excluded -> no.
- ""DADDY"" has D, A (at 2), D, D, Y? But we don't know about D and Y. But word? ""DADDY"" is valid, but has repeated D. And positions: D (1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5). But we don't have information on D and Y. However, we can try.

But we want to test multiple new letters. So words with distinct letters are better for information.

Another word: ""HAPPY"" but H, P, P, Y? Has repeated P. Also, A at 2? H-A-P-P-Y? But third letter P, then P again? Not distinct.

Let's try common words:
- ""TANGY"": T-A-N-G-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.
- ""JAZZY"": J-A-Z-Z-Y? J and Z are uncommon? And repeated Z.
- ""QUACK"": Q-U-A-C-K? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F? But we have A at 3? Q-U-A? Position 3? We need A at 2? Actually, Q-U-A: A is at position 3 -> not position 2.

We need A at position 2.

Another: ""GAUDY"": G-A-U-D-Y? Letters: G, U, D, Y. All new. Yes.

Similarly, ""DAWNS"" -> but S and N are excluded -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> but L is excluded -> invalid.

""HAVOC"": H-A-V-O-C? C is excluded -> invalid.

""KAPUT"": K-A-P-U-T? Letters: K, P, U, T. All available? K, P, U, T are not excluded. Yes. Word: kaput meaning broken or finished.

""MAUVE"": M-A-U-V-E? But E is excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y? Repeated D? But P, D, Y available? And A at 2. Valid word? Yes, meaning a rice field.

But we have repeated D. Not ideal.

Another: ""PATIO"": P-A-T-I-O? But I is excluded (from guess2) -> invalid.

""PLATE"": P-A-L-A-T? But L is excluded and E is excluded? Wait, ""PLATE"" has E? And L. Both excluded -> invalid.

""TOADY"": T-O-A-D-Y? But A is at position 3? Actually, T-O-A: A at position 3 -> not 2.

We need first letter then A, so the pattern: [letter]A[three letters]

So: ""GAUDY"" (G-A-U-D-Y) -> letters G,U,D,Y. But D and Y? We don't know. And U is a vowel.

""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T? L is excluded -> invalid.

""YACHT"": Y-A-C-H-T? C is excluded -> invalid.

""WACKY"": W-A-C-K-Y? C is excluded -> invalid.

So harder? How about ""OAKUM"": O-A-K-U-M? All letters? O, A, K, U, M. And O is first letter? We don't know about O, K, U, M. And A at position 2? Yes. And word: ""oakum"" (a fiber used in shipbuilding). Valid.

But uncommon word? Maybe.

More common: ""MANOR"": M-A-N-O-R? N and R excluded -> invalid.

""GAMUT"": G-A-M-U-T? G, M, U, T. All available? Yes. Word: gamut meaning range. Yes.

So ""GAMUT"": G in position 1, A at 2, M at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

All letters distinct: G, M, U, T are new.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H-A-B-I-T? But B and I are excluded -> invalid.

""RAINY"": R is excluded -> invalid.

""VAUNT"": V-A-U-N-T? N excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""DAYLY""? Not really a word.

""DATUM"": D-A-T-U-M? M and U? Yes? But T at position 3. Word: datum, plural data? But as a guess, sometimes accepted? But it's 5 letters: D-A-T-U-M. Valid.

But ""DATUM"" has two T? No, D,A,T,U,M.

But in terms of commonality, ""GAMUT"" might be better.

Also: ""FAQIR"": F-A-Q-I-R? I and R excluded -> invalid.

I think ""GAMUT"" is acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PATCH"": C excluded -> no.

Let me think of words that are common: ""PARTY"": R excluded -> no.

So let's go with ""GAMUT"".

Another common word: ""TAFFY""? T-A-F-F-Y? Repeated F? And F and Y. But A at 2.

But repeated F -> less information.

I think ""GAMUT"" is good because distinct letters.

But we have U which is a vowel? We already know vowels: A is present. We might need to test other vowels? U and O? But in ""GAMUT"", we are testing O? No, it has U.

Alternatively, we can test O? In a word.

How about ""GATOR"": G-A-T-O-R? R excluded -> invalid.

""MATZO"": M-A-T-Z-O? Z and O? But if we want to test Z? Less common.

Perhaps ""OUTDO"" but A must be at position 2 -> doesn't fit.

So I'll go with ""GAMUT"".

But note: we are only allowed valid words. ""GAMUT"" is valid.

Another word: ""DAVIT"": D-A-V-I-T? I excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems best.

Let me summarize:
- We know: secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Excluded letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S
- So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
- ""GAMUT"": uses G, A (known at pos2), M, U, T. And A is fixed so we are testing G at pos1, M at pos3, U at pos4, T at pos5.

If we get feedback:
- G: could be correct (✓), present but wrong position (-), or absent (x) -> but we'll see.

Similarly for M, U, T.

This guess also helps cover more ground.

So guess: GAMUT

Let me double-check: 
Position: G in 1, A in 2 (we know it must be correct), M in 3, U in 4, T in 5.
Expected feedback on A is ✓ for position 2, for the others we don't know.

And the word is 5 letters and valid.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: ""GAMUT""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,TATTY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, we must avoid using them again.

 We also note that the secret word has the letter A, but not in the third position.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that has A and other common letters.

 Since A is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. For example, we can try A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We also have common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in a position other than third.
 - Uses new letters that we haven't tried (so avoid C, R, N, E) and also avoid the ones we know are absent.

 We know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new, but note: we must avoid E and R? Actually, E and R are absent, so we cannot use them. ""AFTER"" has E and R -> invalid because we know they are not in the word).

 We must avoid E and R. So ""ABOUT"": 
   A (first), B, O, U, T -> all new letters? But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

 However, we also note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: We know A is in the word, so we can try to put A in the second position? Or fourth? 

 Let's think of common words without the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E). We also note that we have not tried S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have the letter D to test.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. So let's avoid repeating A until we know more.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" (meaning a braid) -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position for A? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 3) was wrong, but A might be in the third position in the secret word? 

 Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an A, but not at position 3. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""PLAIT"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before and we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 We can try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ALBUM"" (but has U and M, and we don't know about them). But note: we also have to avoid R, C, N, E.

 Another word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
   A is in the third position? We want to avoid third? Actually, we can put A in a different position. In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. So that's the same as before? We know A is not at position 3, so we should not put it there.

 We can rearrange: How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A (second position), S, T, A (fifth). 
   But note: we have two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A in the second and fifth positions. The feedback only said A is in the word (at least one) but not at position 3. So it could be at 2 or 5.

 However, we are also testing P, S, T.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""PASTA"" doesn't contain any of these.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N (which we know is absent) -> invalid because N is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A.

 We must include A.

 Let me try to list words with A in a position other than 3 and without C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Words with A at position 1:
   ALIST (A, L, I, S, T) -> but is it a word? Actually, ""ALIST"" is not common. How about ""ALOFT"" (A, L, O, F, T) -> valid? Yes.

 Words with A at position 2:
   PLATE -> but has E (absent) -> invalid.
   BLAND -> has N (absent) -> invalid.
   FLASK -> has S and K, but also we don't know about F, L, S, K. And A is at position 2? Actually, F-L-A-S-K: A is at position 3 -> avoid? We want position 2? Actually, in ""FLASK"", A is at position 3 -> so that's the same as before? We must avoid.

 How about ""TASTY"": 
   T, A (second), S, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T, S, Y. Also, A is at position 2 -> good.

 But ""TASTY"" has two T's. We don't know if the word has T or two T's.

 Another word: ""BAILS"" (B, A, I, L, S) -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   We don't have many common words. Example: ""OPALS"" (O, P, A, L, S) -> A at position 3? Actually, O-P-A-L-S: A is at position 3 -> avoid.

 How about ""FOCAL""? F-O-C-A-L -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""DOGMA"": D-O-G-M-A -> A at position 5? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G, 4:M, 5:A -> so A at position 5. And no forbidden letters? D, O, G, M, A -> no C, R, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> but Z is uncommon and we have two Z's.

 After considering, let's choose between:
   ""ALOFT"" (A at 1) -> A, L, O, F, T
   ""TASTY"" (A at 2) -> T, A, S, T, Y (but two T's, which might not be efficient)
   ""BAILS"" (A at 2) -> B, A, I, L, S
   ""DOGMA"" (A at 5) -> D, O, G, M, A

 We want to maximize new letters and avoid repetition.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a good candidate: 
   It has A in position 2 (which is new), and letters B, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, ""ALOFT"" has A in position 1 and L, O, F, T.

 Since we know A is in the word, and we are trying to find its position, putting A in a new position (like 1 or 2) is good.

 Let me choose ""BAILS"". 

 But note: we are not forced to put A in a specific position, but we know it's not at 3. So by putting it at 2, we can check if that's the correct position.

 If we get a ✓ for A in position 2, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x', that would be impossible because we know A is in the word.

 Actually, we cannot get an 'x' for A because we know it's in the word. So we expect either ✓ or -.

 So let's go with ""BAILS"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? Then we might get two marks. But we don't know. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters to get clearer feedback.

 ""BAILS"" has distinct letters: B, A, I, L, S -> all distinct. That's good.

 So I choose ""BAILS"".

 However, let me check if ""BAILS"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of bail, meaning a bucket or to remove water).

 Alternatively, we can use ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't want to repeat. So ""BAILS"" is better.

 Another option: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid.

 Let me also consider ""AUDIO"" -> but we know U? We don't, but it has A at position 1 and U, D, I, O. But we also avoid R, C, N, E -> okay. But we don't have any common consonants? And we are testing two vowels (A and I, O, U). Maybe not as efficient.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a solid choice.

 So next guess: ""BAILS""

<guess>bails</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in the third position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" in a position other than the third (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, S, L, I, T, O) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

Selected ""BAILS"" because:
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate ""A"" and test four new letters.

Available letters: We have vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The secret word: second letter is A, and we know the word must contain only letters from the available set and include A at position 2.

We need to choose a word that has A at the second position and uses only letters not excluded.

Moreover, we don't know the other positions, so we should test new letters.

What is still possible? The word could be, for example, ""FAVOR"", but we haven't tried F, V, O, R? Wait, R is excluded (from first guess). R is not in the word. Similarly, S and E are out.

We must avoid letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S.

So possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to use common letters: T, O, P, M, D, etc.

Let's think of common words that have A in the second position and use letters from the available set.

Examples:
- ""PANDA"" but P is available? But A is at position 2? P-A-N-D-A: but N is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.
- ""TALON"" but L is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MAKER"" but R is excluded -> invalid.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to form words:
- First letter? Can be D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, etc.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar.

Possible words:
- ""PAPAL"" but L is excluded -> no.
- ""DADDY"" has D, A (at 2), D, D, Y? But we don't know about D and Y. But word? ""DADDY"" is valid, but has repeated D. And positions: D (1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5). But we don't have information on D and Y. However, we can try.

But we want to test multiple new letters. So words with distinct letters are better for information.

Another word: ""HAPPY"" but H, P, P, Y? Has repeated P. Also, A at 2? H-A-P-P-Y? But third letter P, then P again? Not distinct.

Let's try common words:
- ""TANGY"": T-A-N-G-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.
- ""JAZZY"": J-A-Z-Z-Y? J and Z are uncommon? And repeated Z.
- ""QUACK"": Q-U-A-C-K? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F? But we have A at 3? Q-U-A? Position 3? We need A at 2? Actually, Q-U-A: A is at position 3 -> not position 2.

We need A at position 2.

Another: ""GAUDY"": G-A-U-D-Y? Letters: G, U, D, Y. All new. Yes.

Similarly, ""DAWNS"" -> but S and N are excluded -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> but L is excluded -> invalid.

""HAVOC"": H-A-V-O-C? C is excluded -> invalid.

""KAPUT"": K-A-P-U-T? Letters: K, P, U, T. All available? K, P, U, T are not excluded. Yes. Word: kaput meaning broken or finished.

""MAUVE"": M-A-U-V-E? But E is excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y? Repeated D? But P, D, Y available? And A at 2. Valid word? Yes, meaning a rice field.

But we have repeated D. Not ideal.

Another: ""PATIO"": P-A-T-I-O? But I is excluded (from guess2) -> invalid.

""PLATE"": P-A-L-A-T? But L is excluded and E is excluded? Wait, ""PLATE"" has E? And L. Both excluded -> invalid.

""TOADY"": T-O-A-D-Y? But A is at position 3? Actually, T-O-A: A at position 3 -> not 2.

We need first letter then A, so the pattern: [letter]A[three letters]

So: ""GAUDY"" (G-A-U-D-Y) -> letters G,U,D,Y. But D and Y? We don't know. And U is a vowel.

""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T? L is excluded -> invalid.

""YACHT"": Y-A-C-H-T? C is excluded -> invalid.

""WACKY"": W-A-C-K-Y? C is excluded -> invalid.

So harder? How about ""OAKUM"": O-A-K-U-M? All letters? O, A, K, U, M. And O is first letter? We don't know about O, K, U, M. And A at position 2? Yes. And word: ""oakum"" (a fiber used in shipbuilding). Valid.

But uncommon word? Maybe.

More common: ""MANOR"": M-A-N-O-R? N and R excluded -> invalid.

""GAMUT"": G-A-M-U-T? G, M, U, T. All available? Yes. Word: gamut meaning range. Yes.

So ""GAMUT"": G in position 1, A at 2, M at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

All letters distinct: G, M, U, T are new.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H-A-B-I-T? But B and I are excluded -> invalid.

""RAINY"": R is excluded -> invalid.

""VAUNT"": V-A-U-N-T? N excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""DAYLY""? Not really a word.

""DATUM"": D-A-T-U-M? M and U? Yes? But T at position 3. Word: datum, plural data? But as a guess, sometimes accepted? But it's 5 letters: D-A-T-U-M. Valid.

But ""DATUM"" has two T? No, D,A,T,U,M.

But in terms of commonality, ""GAMUT"" might be better.

Also: ""FAQIR"": F-A-Q-I-R? I and R excluded -> invalid.

I think ""GAMUT"" is acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PATCH"": C excluded -> no.

Let me think of words that are common: ""PARTY"": R excluded -> no.

So let's go with ""GAMUT"".

Another common word: ""TAFFY""? T-A-F-F-Y? Repeated F? And F and Y. But A at 2.

But repeated F -> less information.

I think ""GAMUT"" is good because distinct letters.

But we have U which is a vowel? We already know vowels: A is present. We might need to test other vowels? U and O? But in ""GAMUT"", we are testing O? No, it has U.

Alternatively, we can test O? In a word.

How about ""GATOR"": G-A-T-O-R? R excluded -> invalid.

""MATZO"": M-A-T-Z-O? Z and O? But if we want to test Z? Less common.

Perhaps ""OUTDO"" but A must be at position 2 -> doesn't fit.

So I'll go with ""GAMUT"".

But note: we are only allowed valid words. ""GAMUT"" is valid.

Another word: ""DAVIT"": D-A-V-I-T? I excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems best.

Let me summarize:
- We know: secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Excluded letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S
- So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
- ""GAMUT"": uses G, A (known at pos2), M, U, T. And A is fixed so we are testing G at pos1, M at pos3, U at pos4, T at pos5.

If we get feedback:
- G: could be correct (✓), present but wrong position (-), or absent (x) -> but we'll see.

Similarly for M, U, T.

This guess also helps cover more ground.

So guess: GAMUT

Let me double-check: 
Position: G in 1, A in 2 (we know it must be correct), M in 3, U in 4, T in 5.
Expected feedback on A is ✓ for position 2, for the others we don't know.

And the word is 5 letters and valid.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: ""GAMUT""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → A is in the word but not in position 3 (C, R, N, E are absent).
- **Guess 2: bails** → A is correct and in position 2 (B, I, L, S are absent).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`.
2. **Excluded letters** (not in the word): B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.
3. **Remaining letters** to test: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
- Must start with a letter not excluded (e.g., G, T, M, D, P) and include **A** at position 2.
- Prioritize common letters and distinct positions to maximize information.
- Potential words: ""GAMUT"" (tests G, M, U, T), ""DAVIT"" (invalid, I excluded), ""TAFFY"" (repeated F, less informative).
- **Selected ""GAMUT""** because:
  - Fits the pattern `G A M U T`, testing four new distinct letters (G, M, U, T).
  - Common letters covered: G, M, T.
  - If incorrect, feedback will narrow down position/s for other letters.

Includes the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word) and in a different position than the third.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.\n 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has A and other common letters.\n\n Since A is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. For example, we can try A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.\n\n Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We also have common consonants like T, S, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that:\n - Has A in a position other than third.\n - Uses new letters that we haven\'t tried (so avoid C, R, N, E) and also avoid the ones we know are absent.\n\n We know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E.\n\n Possible words: \n   We can try words with A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new, but note: we must avoid E and R? Actually, E and R are absent, so we cannot use them. ""AFTER"" has E and R -> invalid because we know they are not in the word).\n\n We must avoid E and R. So ""ABOUT"": \n   A (first), B, O, U, T -> all new letters? But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\n However, we also note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Another idea: We know A is in the word, so we can try to put A in the second position? Or fourth? \n\n Let\'s think of common words without the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E). We also note that we have not tried S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have the letter D to test.\n\n However, we want to maximize new letters. So let\'s avoid repeating A until we know more.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" (meaning a braid) -> but we don\'t know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position for A? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 3) was wrong, but A might be in the third position in the secret word? \n\n Wait, no: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an A, but not at position 3. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n So in ""PLAIT"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n We can try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ALBUM"" (but has U and M, and we don\'t know about them). But note: we also have to avoid R, C, N, E.\n\n Another word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. \n   A is in the third position? We want to avoid third? Actually, we can put A in a different position. In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. So that\'s the same as before? We know A is not at position 3, so we should not put it there.\n\n We can rearrange: How about ""PASTA""? \n   P, A (second position), S, T, A (fifth). \n   But note: we have two A\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are using A in the second and fifth positions. The feedback only said A is in the word (at least one) but not at position 3. So it could be at 2 or 5.\n\n However, we are also testing P, S, T.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""PASTA"" doesn\'t contain any of these.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N (which we know is absent) -> invalid because N is not in the word.\n\n Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A.\n\n We must include A.\n\n Let me try to list words with A in a position other than 3 and without C, R, N, E.\n\n Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n Words with A at position 1:\n   ALIST (A, L, I, S, T) -> but is it a word? Actually, ""ALIST"" is not common. How about ""ALOFT"" (A, L, O, F, T) -> valid? Yes.\n\n Words with A at position 2:\n   PLATE -> but has E (absent) -> invalid.\n   BLAND -> has N (absent) -> invalid.\n   FLASK -> has S and K, but also we don\'t know about F, L, S, K. And A is at position 2? Actually, F-L-A-S-K: A is at position 3 -> avoid? We want position 2? Actually, in ""FLASK"", A is at position 3 -> so that\'s the same as before? We must avoid.\n\n How about ""TASTY"": \n   T, A (second), S, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know about T, S, Y. Also, A is at position 2 -> good.\n\n But ""TASTY"" has two T\'s. We don\'t know if the word has T or two T\'s.\n\n Another word: ""BAILS"" (B, A, I, L, S) -> A at position 2.\n\n Words with A at position 4:\n   We don\'t have many common words. Example: ""OPALS"" (O, P, A, L, S) -> A at position 3? Actually, O-P-A-L-S: A is at position 3 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""FOCAL""? F-O-C-A-L -> but C is absent -> invalid.\n\n How about ""DOGMA"": D-O-G-M-A -> A at position 5? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G, 4:M, 5:A -> so A at position 5. And no forbidden letters? D, O, G, M, A -> no C, R, N, E. So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> but Z is uncommon and we have two Z\'s.\n\n After considering, let\'s choose between:\n   ""ALOFT"" (A at 1) -> A, L, O, F, T\n   ""TASTY"" (A at 2) -> T, A, S, T, Y (but two T\'s, which might not be efficient)\n   ""BAILS"" (A at 2) -> B, A, I, L, S\n   ""DOGMA"" (A at 5) -> D, O, G, M, A\n\n We want to maximize new letters and avoid repetition.\n\n Also, we want to cover more common letters. The letters we haven\'t tried and are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""BAILS"" is a good candidate: \n   It has A in position 2 (which is new), and letters B, I, L, S.\n\n Alternatively, ""ALOFT"" has A in position 1 and L, O, F, T.\n\n Since we know A is in the word, and we are trying to find its position, putting A in a new position (like 1 or 2) is good.\n\n Let me choose ""BAILS"". \n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in a specific position, but we know it\'s not at 3. So by putting it at 2, we can check if that\'s the correct position.\n\n If we get a ✓ for A in position 2, then we know. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,4, or5). If we get an \'x\', that would be impossible because we know A is in the word.\n\n Actually, we cannot get an \'x\' for A because we know it\'s in the word. So we expect either ✓ or -.\n\n So let\'s go with ""BAILS"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has two A\'s? Then we might get two marks. But we don\'t know. So it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters to get clearer feedback.\n\n ""BAILS"" has distinct letters: B, A, I, L, S -> all distinct. That\'s good.\n\n So I choose ""BAILS"".\n\n However, let me check if ""BAILS"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of bail, meaning a bucket or to remove water).\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SALAD"" but that has two A\'s and we don\'t want to repeat. So ""BAILS"" is better.\n\n Another option: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid.\n\n Let me also consider ""AUDIO"" -> but we know U? We don\'t, but it has A at position 1 and U, D, I, O. But we also avoid R, C, N, E -> okay. But we don\'t have any common consonants? And we are testing two vowels (A and I, O, U). Maybe not as efficient.\n\n I think ""BAILS"" is a solid choice.\n\n So next guess: ""BAILS""\n\n<guess>bails</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in the third position (indicated by ""-"").\n- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (indicated by ""x"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include ""A"" in a position other than the third (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""E"".\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, S, L, I, T, O) to maximize information.\n- Choose a word with distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.\n\nSelected ""BAILS"" because:\n- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: B, I, L, S.\n- All letters are distinct.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n\nThis guess will help locate ""A"" and test four new letters.\n\n<guess>bails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: bails -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane\nFeedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning: \n  C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n  A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nGuess 2: bails\nFeedback: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)\nMeaning:\n  B, I, L, S are not in the word at all.\n  A is in the word AND in the correct position, which is position 2 (since in ""bails"", A is the second letter).\n\nSo now we know:\n- A is definitely the second letter of the secret word.\n- The following letters are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.

Yes.\n\nSo ""GAMUT"": G in position 1, A at 2, M at 3, U at 4, T at 5.\n\nAll letters distinct: G, M, U, T are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""HABIT"": H-A-B-I-T? But B and I are excluded -> invalid.\n\n""RAINY"": R is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""VAUNT"": V-A-U-N-T? N excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo ""GAMUT"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother option: ""DAYLY""? Not really a word.\n\n""DATUM"": D-A-T-U-M? M and U? Yes? But T at position 3. Word: datum, plural data? But as a guess, sometimes accepted? But it\'s 5 letters: D-A-T-U-M. Valid.\n\nBut ""DATUM"" has two T? No, D,A,T,U,M.\n\nBut in terms of commonality, ""GAMUT"" might be better.\n\nAlso: ""FAQIR"": F-A-Q-I-R? I and R excluded -> invalid.\n\nI think ""GAMUT"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we can also consider ""PATCH"": C excluded -> no.\n\nLet me think of words that are common: ""PARTY"": R excluded -> no.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""GAMUT"".\n\nAnother common word: ""TAFFY""? T-A-F-F-Y? Repeated F? And F and Y. But A at 2.\n\nBut repeated F -> less information.\n\nI think ""GAMUT"" is good because distinct letters.\n\nBut we have U which is a vowel? We already know vowels: A is present. We might need to test other vowels? U and O? But in ""GAMUT"", we are testing O? No, it has U.\n\nAlternatively, we can test O? In a word.\n\nHow about ""GATOR"": G-A-T-O-R? R excluded -> invalid.\n\n""MATZO"": M-A-T-Z-O? Z and O? But if we want to test Z? Less common.\n\nPerhaps ""OUTDO"" but A must be at position 2 -> doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GAMUT"".\n\nBut note: we are only allowed valid words. ""GAMUT"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""DAVIT"": D-A-V-I-T? I excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo ""GAMUT"" seems best.\n\nLet me summarize:\n- We know: secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _\n- Excluded letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S\n- So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n- ""GAMUT"": uses G, A (known at pos2), M, U, T. And A is fixed so we are testing G at pos1, M at pos3, U at pos4, T at pos5.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- G: could be correct (✓), present but wrong position (-), or absent (x) -> but we\'ll see.\n\nSimilarly for M, U, T.\n\nThis guess also helps cover more ground.\n\nSo guess: GAMUT\n\nLet me double-check: \nPosition: G in 1, A in 2 (we know it must be correct), M in 3, U in 4, T in 5.\nExpected feedback on A is ✓ for position 2, for the others we don\'t know.\n\nAnd the word is 5 letters and valid.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""GAMUT""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → A is in the word but not in position 3 (C, R, N, E are absent).\n- **Guess 2: bails** → A is correct and in position 2 (B, I, L, S are absent).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`.\n2. **Excluded letters** (not in the word): B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.\n3. **Remaining letters** to test: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Must start with a letter not excluded (e.g., G, T, M, D, P) and include **A** at position 2.\n- Prioritize common letters and distinct positions to maximize information.\n- Potential words: ""GAMUT"" (tests G, M, U, T), ""DAVIT"" (invalid, I excluded), ""TAFFY"" (repeated F, less informative).\n- **Selected ""GAMUT""** because:\n  - Fits the pattern `G A M U T`, testing four new distinct letters (G, M, U, T).\n  - Common letters covered: G, M, T.\n  - If incorrect, feedback will narrow down position/s for other letters.\n\n<guess>gamut</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: bails -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: gamut -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""gamut"" -> G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)

Recall:
- We already knew A is the second letter (from guess 2), so A(✓) confirms that again.
- New information:
  - G: x → not in the word at all.
  - M: x → not in the word at all.
  - U: x → not in the word at all.
  - T: - → T is in the word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

So now we know:

Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _ 

Excluded letters (added from this guess): G, M, U (plus previous: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S). Total excluded: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U.

Remaining available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (note: T is now known to be in the word, but not at position 5).

Also, note T is present somewhere, but not in position 5.

Therefore, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A).

We have the pattern: the secret word has letters: [position1] A [position3] [position4] [position5]

With T being in one of position1, 3, or 4.

But not in position5 (given by T(-) in ""gamut"" which had T at position5).

The word contains at least T and A.

We also have no information about other letters.

Now, excluded letters: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U. So we avoid these.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and T (which we now know is in the word).

For our next guess, we must:

1. Have A at position 2 (fixed).
2 Include T in either position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be at 5).
3. Use other available letters for the remaining positions.

We want to test T in a different position and also test new letters.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: then word starts with T, then A.
- Position 3: then pattern: _ A T _ _
- Position 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _

We also need to fill the other positions with available letters to form a valid word.

Since we have few remaining letters that are common, and we have only 3 positions to fill (except the fixed A), we can try to cover as many as possible.

Also, we have 3 guesses left? We started with 6 tries: guess1,2,3 used, so 3 left? Actually, guess1 was first, guess2 second, guess3 third, so this is fourth guess.

We have time to test.

Let me try to think of words that fit.

If T is in position 1:

Words starting with T: T A _ _ _

Must be valid English word, and the next three letters from available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Examples: 
- ""TAXED"" but E excluded → invalid.
- ""TAKEN"" N excluded → invalid.
- ""TAPIR"" R excluded → invalid.
- ""TAFIA""? Meaning a rum? Letters: T,A,F,I,A? But I excluded? ""TAFIA"" has I at position 4? I is excluded → invalid.
- ""TABBY"" B excluded → invalid.
- ""TAFFY"" F at position 3, F at4? Repeated F? But F available. But word ""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y → but we have Y. Is it valid? Yes. And we don't know about F and Y. Also, T is at1? Which we are testing? Actually, we already know T is in the word, so we care more about its position and other letters.

But ""TAFFY"" has T at1 and A at2 (known), F at3, F at4, Y at5. But we don't know about F and Y.

Alternatively, if T is at4: pattern _ A _ T _

Or T at3: _ A T _ _

Let me consider common words:

First, with T at1: ""TARDY""? But R excluded → invalid.
""TALKY"" L excluded → invalid.
""TACKY"" C excluded → invalid.
So few options. ""TAWNY"" N excluded? Wait, no N: T,A,W,N,Y? N excluded → invalid.
""TAFFY"" as above: T,A,F,F,Y → valid? Yes. Available letters? F,Y available. But repeated F? We might get less information.

But we can test F and Y.

Also, T is at position 1, which we are testing: if T is at pos1, then we might get ✓ in position1? But we already know T is in the word, so if it's at1, we get ✓; if not, we get - or x? But we know T is in the word, so x is impossible. We could get: T(✓) if correct, T(-) if T is in the word but not at1.

Similarly, for other positions.

Now, with T at3: pattern _ A T _ _

Available letters: must choose a first letter from available (not excluded, and not A,T? But A,T already).

Available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (T is already placed, wait no: the first position is any available letter. Then A at2, T at3, then two other letters.

For example: ""PATIO"" but I,O? I excluded → invalid.
""PARTY"" R excluded → invalid.
""MATTE"" M,E excluded → invalid.
""OATEN"" N excluded → invalid.
""FAVOR"" R excluded → invalid.
""HAYST"" not word.

""JATHA"" not common? But J,A,T,H,A? But A repeated? And H? ""JATHA"" not standard English.

Possible words: ""PASTE"" S,E excluded → invalid.

I'm struggling.

With T at4: pattern _ A _ T _

Examples: ""CANTY"" C,N excluded → invalid.
""HASTY"" S excluded → invalid.
""FAKTY"" not word.
""PAYTM"" not English.
""DATA"" is 4 letters.

""QAIT""? Not 5 letters.

""WAIFT"" W,A,I,F,T? I excluded → invalid.

Hard to find.

Perhaps T is not at1 or at3? Let's consider another position? Only 1,3,4 possible for T.

Another idea: we tested T at5 and got ""-"", so T must be in 1,3, or4.

Now, let me list all possible words that fit in the remaining letter set.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and T which we know is in the word.

But T is already known to be in, so we must include T at one of the open positions.

Pattern: let the word be W1, A, W3, W4, W5.

With W1, W3, W4, W5 each from available letters.

But T appears exactly once? Not necessarily, but so far we have no duplication.

Given that, and the complexity, perhaps we can try a word that places T at position 3 or 4 to test it.

For example, let's put T at position 3: so pattern _ A T _ _

We need to fill the first letter and the last two letters from available letters.

Possible: 
First letter: F, H, K, O, P, Q, V, W, Y? Etc.

Then the last two: any from available.

But must form a common word.

Example: with O: ""OATHY"" not word.
""PATHO"" not standard.
""WATAP"" not common.
""YETRA"" E excluded.

How about ""PATIO""? Invalid due to I excluded? I think no word with common letters.

Put T at position 4: _ A _ T _

Pattern: W1, A, W3, T, W5.

W1 and W3 and W5 from available.

Examples: 
- ""XENIA"" but X,A,E,N,I? Multiple excluded → invalid.
- ""WAIFS"" I,S excluded? S excluded → invalid.
- ""Hants""? N and S excluded? Not valid.
- ""DAYNT""? Not word.

""VAPID"" V,A,P,I,D? I excluded → invalid.

I'm not finding common words.

Perhaps T at position 1: ""TAPAS"" S excluded → invalid.

""TAJES"" J,A,T,E,S? E and S excluded → invalid.

We might need to use less common letters.

Since we must include T, how about a word like ""THUJA"" but H,U,J? U excluded? From guess3, U is out. And H available? But U is excluded, so ""THUJA"" has U -> invalid.

 ""KOFTE"" O,K,F,T,E? E excluded -> invalid.

""PAVAN"" P,A,V,A,N? N excluded -> invalid.

Let me think differently. We have available vowels: O and Y? Sometimes as vowel.

Consider words ending with T? But we know T can't be at5? In secret word, T is not at5, but in our next guess we can put T at5 again? No, we can, but it would be redundant since we know it's not there? Actually, in guess3 we put T at5 and got ""-"" meaning T is in the word but not at that position. So we shouldn't put T at5 in new guesses? It's not forbidden, but it would give us information only if the position is correct or not. But we already know it's not at5, so it will always be ""-"" or something? If we put T at5 again, it would give ""-"" again unless the word has two T's? But we don't know.

However, to conserve guesses, we might avoid positions we know are incorrect.

So avoid position5 for T.

So T must be at1,3, or4.

Perhaps we can try T at position1.

Word: T A _ _ _

With last three from available: F, H, J, K, O, P, D, etc.

Common words: none because many combinations don't exist.

""TABLA"" B,L excluded -> invalid.
""TAPAS"" P,A,S excluded? S excluded -> invalid.
""TAXOL""? Not common.

How about ""TAXED""? E excluded -> invalid.

""TAKHI"" K,H,I? I excluded -> invalid.

""TAKO"" only 4 letters.

Perhaps use a word with Y: ""TAGGY"" G excluded? G is excluded -> invalid from guess3.

G is excluded.

""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y? F and Y are available. Word valid? Yes, meaning a candy. And T at position1.

Positions: T at1 (which we are testing), A at2 (fixed), F at3, F at4, Y at5.

This word:
- Tests T at position1: if T is at1, then ✓; if not, then we get - meaning T in word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4).
- Tests F twice (but we don't care about duplication).
- Tests Y at5? We can see.

If feedback for T is ✓, then T is first letter, and F,F,Y are not known or partially present? But F is new.

But we are sacrificing information by repeating F.

Nonetheless, it's a valid word.

Other options: ""TAPIS"" S excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""TAFFY"" is a possible guess.

Similarly, if we put T at position4: pattern ... _ A _ T _

With available letters: e.g., ""RAFTY"" R excluded -> invalid.

""QAFT"" not word.

""Kajal"" not standard spelling.

Hard to find words.

The only feasible one is ""TAFFY"" with T at position1.

So I choose that.

But let's confirm excluded letters: from guess1 and 2 and 3, we have a large exclusion set.

We can also consider putting T at position3.

For example, ""FAKIR"" F,A,K,I,R? I excluded -> no.
""HATOR"" H,A,T,O,R? R excluded -> invalid.

""OATHS"" O,A,T,H,S? S excluded -> invalid.

""PATHS"" S excluded -> invalid.

""YATHA"" Y,A,T,H,A? Then A at position5? But A is already at2, but the word might have two A's? Possible. Word: ""yatha"" not common.

"" DATAL"" D,A,T,A,L? L excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""TAFFY"" is the best we can do.

So next guess: ""TAFFY""

We expect some feedback.

If T is at1, then T becomes ✓, A is ✓ (fixed), and then F and Y will get feedback.

If T is not at1, then T will get ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4), and A ✓, then F and Y: possibly x or -.

So it gives us information.

Also, note that we haven't tested F or Y before.

Therefore, guess ""TAFFY"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

1. **Pattern Constraint**: The secret word has `_ A _ _ _` with `A` fixed at position 2.
2. **Letter Insights**: 
   - `T` is in the word but not at position 5 (feedback from ""gamut"").
   - `G`, `M`, `U` are confirmed absent, adding to previous exclusions (B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S).
   - **All excluded letters**: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
   - **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **T's Position**: Must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5).
   - To maximize information, test `T` at position 1 in this guess.

**Selected ""TAFFY"" because**:
- Places `T` at position 1 (tests if this is correct).
- Retains `A` at position 2 (known).
- Uses new available letters: `F` and `Y`, with `F` repeated to test frequency.
- Word is valid and covers key possibilities:
  - If `T` position 1 is correct → instantly useful.
  - If not → `T` must be at positions 3 or 4 (useful constraint).

<guess>taffy</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Revealed ""A"" is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (bails)**: Confirmed ""A"" is in position 2 (✓), eliminating B, I, L, S.
- **Guess 3 (gamut)**: Confirmed ""A"" in position 2 again (✓), eliminated G, M, U, and showed ""T"" is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Constraints:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
2. **Included letters**: A (fixed at pos 2) and T (must be in pos 1, 3, or 4).
3. **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
4. **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test if ""T"" is in position 1 since it cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- Use ""F"" and ""Y"" (new, high-frequency letters) to gather maximum information.
- Avoid excluded letters and prioritize common words.

Selected **""TAFFY""** because:
- Puts ""T"" at position 1 to test its potential correct placement.
- Retains ""A"" at position 2.
- Introduces ""F"" (positions 3 and 4) and ""Y"" (position 5). 
- Though ""F"" repeats, the word is valid and efficiently tests three new letters (T, F, Y) within constraints.

If ""T"" is correct at position 1, feedback will confirm it instantly and provide info on F/Y. If not, ""T"" must be in positions 3 or 4 for future guesses.

<guess>taffy</guess>",taffy,"We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""gamut"" -> G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)

Recall:
- We already knew A is the second letter (from guess 2), so A(✓) confirms that again.
- New information:
  - G: x → not in the word at all.
  - M: x → not in the word at all.
  - U: x → not in the word at all.
  - T: - → T is in the word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

So now we know:

Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _ 

Excluded letters (added from this guess): G, M, U (plus previous: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S). Total excluded: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U.

Remaining available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (note: T is now known to be in the word, but not at position 5).

Also, note T is present somewhere, but not in position 5.

Therefore, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A).

We have the pattern: the secret word has letters: [position1] A [position3] [position4] [position5]

With T being in one of position1, 3, or 4.

But not in position5 (given by T(-) in ""gamut"" which had T at position5).

The word contains at least T and A.

We also have no information about other letters.

Now, excluded letters: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U. So we avoid these.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and T (which we now know is in the word).

For our next guess, we must:

1. Have A at position 2 (fixed).
2 Include T in either position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be at 5).
3. Use other available letters for the remaining positions.

We want to test T in a different position and also test new letters.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: then word starts with T, then A.
- Position 3: then pattern: _ A T _ _
- Position 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _

We also need to fill the other positions with available letters to form a valid word.

Since we have few remaining letters that are common, and we have only 3 positions to fill (except the fixed A), we can try to cover as many as possible.

Also, we have 3 guesses left? We started with 6 tries: guess1,2,3 used, so 3 left? Actually, guess1 was first, guess2 second, guess3 third, so this is fourth guess.

We have time to test.

Let me try to think of words that fit.

If T is in position 1:

Words starting with T: T A _ _ _

Must be valid English word, and the next three letters from available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Examples: 
- ""TAXED"" but E excluded → invalid.
- ""TAKEN"" N excluded → invalid.
- ""TAPIR"" R excluded → invalid.
- ""TAFIA""? Meaning a rum? Letters: T,A,F,I,A? But I excluded? ""TAFIA"" has I at position 4? I is excluded → invalid.
- ""TABBY"" B excluded → invalid.
- ""TAFFY"" F at position 3, F at4? Repeated F? But F available. But word ""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y → but we have Y. Is it valid? Yes. And we don't know about F and Y. Also, T is at1? Which we are testing? Actually, we already know T is in the word, so we care more about its position and other letters.

But ""TAFFY"" has T at1 and A at2 (known), F at3, F at4, Y at5. But we don't know about F and Y.

Alternatively, if T is at4: pattern _ A _ T _

Or T at3: _ A T _ _

Let me consider common words:

First, with T at1: ""TARDY""? But R excluded → invalid.
""TALKY"" L excluded → invalid.
""TACKY"" C excluded → invalid.
So few options. ""TAWNY"" N excluded? Wait, no N: T,A,W,N,Y? N excluded → invalid.
""TAFFY"" as above: T,A,F,F,Y → valid? Yes. Available letters? F,Y available. But repeated F? We might get less information.

But we can test F and Y.

Also, T is at position 1, which we are testing: if T is at pos1, then we might get ✓ in position1? But we already know T is in the word, so if it's at1, we get ✓; if not, we get - or x? But we know T is in the word, so x is impossible. We could get: T(✓) if correct, T(-) if T is in the word but not at1.

Similarly, for other positions.

Now, with T at3: pattern _ A T _ _

Available letters: must choose a first letter from available (not excluded, and not A,T? But A,T already).

Available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (T is already placed, wait no: the first position is any available letter. Then A at2, T at3, then two other letters.

For example: ""PATIO"" but I,O? I excluded → invalid.
""PARTY"" R excluded → invalid.
""MATTE"" M,E excluded → invalid.
""OATEN"" N excluded → invalid.
""FAVOR"" R excluded → invalid.
""HAYST"" not word.

""JATHA"" not common? But J,A,T,H,A? But A repeated? And H? ""JATHA"" not standard English.

Possible words: ""PASTE"" S,E excluded → invalid.

I'm struggling.

With T at4: pattern _ A _ T _

Examples: ""CANTY"" C,N excluded → invalid.
""HASTY"" S excluded → invalid.
""FAKTY"" not word.
""PAYTM"" not English.
""DATA"" is 4 letters.

""QAIT""? Not 5 letters.

""WAIFT"" W,A,I,F,T? I excluded → invalid.

Hard to find.

Perhaps T is not at1 or at3? Let's consider another position? Only 1,3,4 possible for T.

Another idea: we tested T at5 and got ""-"", so T must be in 1,3, or4.

Now, let me list all possible words that fit in the remaining letter set.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and T which we know is in the word.

But T is already known to be in, so we must include T at one of the open positions.

Pattern: let the word be W1, A, W3, W4, W5.

With W1, W3, W4, W5 each from available letters.

But T appears exactly once? Not necessarily, but so far we have no duplication.

Given that, and the complexity, perhaps we can try a word that places T at position 3 or 4 to test it.

For example, let's put T at position 3: so pattern _ A T _ _

We need to fill the first letter and the last two letters from available letters.

Possible: 
First letter: F, H, K, O, P, Q, V, W, Y? Etc.

Then the last two: any from available.

But must form a common word.

Example: with O: ""OATHY"" not word.
""PATHO"" not standard.
""WATAP"" not common.
""YETRA"" E excluded.

How about ""PATIO""? Invalid due to I excluded? I think no word with common letters.

Put T at position 4: _ A _ T _

Pattern: W1, A, W3, T, W5.

W1 and W3 and W5 from available.

Examples: 
- ""XENIA"" but X,A,E,N,I? Multiple excluded → invalid.
- ""WAIFS"" I,S excluded? S excluded → invalid.
- ""Hants""? N and S excluded? Not valid.
- ""DAYNT""? Not word.

""VAPID"" V,A,P,I,D? I excluded → invalid.

I'm not finding common words.

Perhaps T at position 1: ""TAPAS"" S excluded → invalid.

""TAJES"" J,A,T,E,S? E and S excluded → invalid.

We might need to use less common letters.

Since we must include T, how about a word like ""THUJA"" but H,U,J? U excluded? From guess3, U is out. And H available? But U is excluded, so ""THUJA"" has U -> invalid.

 ""KOFTE"" O,K,F,T,E? E excluded -> invalid.

""PAVAN"" P,A,V,A,N? N excluded -> invalid.

Let me think differently. We have available vowels: O and Y? Sometimes as vowel.

Consider words ending with T? But we know T can't be at5? In secret word, T is not at5, but in our next guess we can put T at5 again? No, we can, but it would be redundant since we know it's not there? Actually, in guess3 we put T at5 and got ""-"" meaning T is in the word but not at that position. So we shouldn't put T at5 in new guesses? It's not forbidden, but it would give us information only if the position is correct or not. But we already know it's not at5, so it will always be ""-"" or something? If we put T at5 again, it would give ""-"" again unless the word has two T's? But we don't know.

However, to conserve guesses, we might avoid positions we know are incorrect.

So avoid position5 for T.

So T must be at1,3, or4.

Perhaps we can try T at position1.

Word: T A _ _ _

With last three from available: F, H, J, K, O, P, D, etc.

Common words: none because many combinations don't exist.

""TABLA"" B,L excluded -> invalid.
""TAPAS"" P,A,S excluded? S excluded -> invalid.
""TAXOL""? Not common.

How about ""TAXED""? E excluded -> invalid.

""TAKHI"" K,H,I? I excluded -> invalid.

""TAKO"" only 4 letters.

Perhaps use a word with Y: ""TAGGY"" G excluded? G is excluded -> invalid from guess3.

G is excluded.

""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y? F and Y are available. Word valid? Yes, meaning a candy. And T at position1.

Positions: T at1 (which we are testing), A at2 (fixed), F at3, F at4, Y at5.

This word:
- Tests T at position1: if T is at1, then ✓; if not, then we get - meaning T in word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4).
- Tests F twice (but we don't care about duplication).
- Tests Y at5? We can see.

If feedback for T is ✓, then T is first letter, and F,F,Y are not known or partially present? But F is new.

But we are sacrificing information by repeating F.

Nonetheless, it's a valid word.

Other options: ""TAPIS"" S excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""TAFFY"" is a possible guess.

Similarly, if we put T at position4: pattern ... _ A _ T _

With available letters: e.g., ""RAFTY"" R excluded -> invalid.

""QAFT"" not word.

""Kajal"" not standard spelling.

Hard to find words.

The only feasible one is ""TAFFY"" with T at position1.

So I choose that.

But let's confirm excluded letters: from guess1 and 2 and 3, we have a large exclusion set.

We can also consider putting T at position3.

For example, ""FAKIR"" F,A,K,I,R? I excluded -> no.
""HATOR"" H,A,T,O,R? R excluded -> invalid.

""OATHS"" O,A,T,H,S? S excluded -> invalid.

""PATHS"" S excluded -> invalid.

""YATHA"" Y,A,T,H,A? Then A at position5? But A is already at2, but the word might have two A's? Possible. Word: ""yatha"" not common.

"" DATAL"" D,A,T,A,L? L excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""TAFFY"" is the best we can do.

So next guess: ""TAFFY""

We expect some feedback.

If T is at1, then T becomes ✓, A is ✓ (fixed), and then F and Y will get feedback.

If T is not at1, then T will get ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4), and A ✓, then F and Y: possibly x or -.

So it gives us information.

Also, note that we haven't tested F or Y before.

Therefore, guess ""TAFFY"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

1. **Pattern Constraint**: The secret word has `_ A _ _ _` with `A` fixed at position 2.
2. **Letter Insights**: 
   - `T` is in the word but not at position 5 (feedback from ""gamut"").
   - `G`, `M`, `U` are confirmed absent, adding to previous exclusions (B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S).
   - **All excluded letters**: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
   - **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **T's Position**: Must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5).
   - To maximize information, test `T` at position 1 in this guess.

**Selected ""TAFFY"" because**:
- Places `T` at position 1 (tests if this is correct).
- Retains `A` at position 2 (known).
- Uses new available letters: `F` and `Y`, with `F` repeated to test frequency.
- Word is valid and covers key possibilities:
  - If `T` position 1 is correct → instantly useful.
  - If not → `T` must be at positions 3 or 4 (useful constraint).

<guess>taffy</guess>After reviewing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Revealed ""A"" is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (bails)**: Confirmed ""A"" is in position 2 (✓), eliminating B, I, L, S.
- **Guess 3 (gamut)**: Confirmed ""A"" in position 2 again (✓), eliminated G, M, U, and showed ""T"" is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Constraints:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
2. **Included letters**: A (fixed at pos 2) and T (must be in pos 1, 3, or 4).
3. **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
4. **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test if ""T"" is in position 1 since it cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- Use ""F"" and ""Y"" (new, high-frequency letters) to gather maximum information.
- Avoid excluded letters and prioritize common words.

Selected **""TAFFY""** because:
- Puts ""T"" at position 1 to test its potential correct placement.
- Retains ""A"" at position 2.
- Introduces ""F"" (positions 3 and 4) and ""Y"" (position 5). 
- Though ""F"" repeats, the word is valid and efficiently tests three new letters (T, F, Y) within constraints.

If ""T"" is correct at position 1, feedback will confirm it instantly and provide info on F/Y. If not, ""T"" must be in positions 3 or 4 for future guesses.",Guess 4: taffy -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) F(x) F(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,TATTY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, we must avoid using them again.

 We also note that the secret word has the letter A, but not in the third position.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position than the third.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that has A and other common letters.

 Since A is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. For example, we can try A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We also have common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in a position other than third.
 - Uses new letters that we haven't tried (so avoid C, R, N, E) and also avoid the ones we know are absent.

 We know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new, but note: we must avoid E and R? Actually, E and R are absent, so we cannot use them. ""AFTER"" has E and R -> invalid because we know they are not in the word).

 We must avoid E and R. So ""ABOUT"": 
   A (first), B, O, U, T -> all new letters? But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

 However, we also note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: We know A is in the word, so we can try to put A in the second position? Or fourth? 

 Let's think of common words without the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E). We also note that we have not tried S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have the letter D to test.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. So let's avoid repeating A until we know more.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" (meaning a braid) -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position for A? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 3) was wrong, but A might be in the third position in the secret word? 

 Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an A, but not at position 3. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""PLAIT"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before and we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 We can try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ALBUM"" (but has U and M, and we don't know about them). But note: we also have to avoid R, C, N, E.

 Another word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. 
   A is in the third position? We want to avoid third? Actually, we can put A in a different position. In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. So that's the same as before? We know A is not at position 3, so we should not put it there.

 We can rearrange: How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A (second position), S, T, A (fifth). 
   But note: we have two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A in the second and fifth positions. The feedback only said A is in the word (at least one) but not at position 3. So it could be at 2 or 5.

 However, we are also testing P, S, T.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""PASTA"" doesn't contain any of these.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N (which we know is absent) -> invalid because N is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A.

 We must include A.

 Let me try to list words with A in a position other than 3 and without C, R, N, E.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 Words with A at position 1:
   ALIST (A, L, I, S, T) -> but is it a word? Actually, ""ALIST"" is not common. How about ""ALOFT"" (A, L, O, F, T) -> valid? Yes.

 Words with A at position 2:
   PLATE -> but has E (absent) -> invalid.
   BLAND -> has N (absent) -> invalid.
   FLASK -> has S and K, but also we don't know about F, L, S, K. And A is at position 2? Actually, F-L-A-S-K: A is at position 3 -> avoid? We want position 2? Actually, in ""FLASK"", A is at position 3 -> so that's the same as before? We must avoid.

 How about ""TASTY"": 
   T, A (second), S, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know about T, S, Y. Also, A is at position 2 -> good.

 But ""TASTY"" has two T's. We don't know if the word has T or two T's.

 Another word: ""BAILS"" (B, A, I, L, S) -> A at position 2.

 Words with A at position 4:
   We don't have many common words. Example: ""OPALS"" (O, P, A, L, S) -> A at position 3? Actually, O-P-A-L-S: A is at position 3 -> avoid.

 How about ""FOCAL""? F-O-C-A-L -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""DOGMA"": D-O-G-M-A -> A at position 5? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G, 4:M, 5:A -> so A at position 5. And no forbidden letters? D, O, G, M, A -> no C, R, N, E. So that's acceptable.

 Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> but Z is uncommon and we have two Z's.

 After considering, let's choose between:
   ""ALOFT"" (A at 1) -> A, L, O, F, T
   ""TASTY"" (A at 2) -> T, A, S, T, Y (but two T's, which might not be efficient)
   ""BAILS"" (A at 2) -> B, A, I, L, S
   ""DOGMA"" (A at 5) -> D, O, G, M, A

 We want to maximize new letters and avoid repetition.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a good candidate: 
   It has A in position 2 (which is new), and letters B, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, ""ALOFT"" has A in position 1 and L, O, F, T.

 Since we know A is in the word, and we are trying to find its position, putting A in a new position (like 1 or 2) is good.

 Let me choose ""BAILS"". 

 But note: we are not forced to put A in a specific position, but we know it's not at 3. So by putting it at 2, we can check if that's the correct position.

 If we get a ✓ for A in position 2, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x', that would be impossible because we know A is in the word.

 Actually, we cannot get an 'x' for A because we know it's in the word. So we expect either ✓ or -.

 So let's go with ""BAILS"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? Then we might get two marks. But we don't know. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters to get clearer feedback.

 ""BAILS"" has distinct letters: B, A, I, L, S -> all distinct. That's good.

 So I choose ""BAILS"".

 However, let me check if ""BAILS"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of bail, meaning a bucket or to remove water).

 Alternatively, we can use ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't want to repeat. So ""BAILS"" is better.

 Another option: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid.

 Let me also consider ""AUDIO"" -> but we know U? We don't, but it has A at position 1 and U, D, I, O. But we also avoid R, C, N, E -> okay. But we don't have any common consonants? And we are testing two vowels (A and I, O, U). Maybe not as efficient.

 I think ""BAILS"" is a solid choice.

 So next guess: ""BAILS""

<guess>bails</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in the third position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include ""A"" in a position other than the third (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""E"".
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, S, L, I, T, O) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

Selected ""BAILS"" because:
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate ""A"" and test four new letters.

<guess>bails</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: bails -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
  A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: bails
Feedback: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
Meaning:
  B, I, L, S are not in the word at all.
  A is in the word AND in the correct position, which is position 2 (since in ""bails"", A is the second letter).

So now we know:
- A is definitely the second letter of the secret word.
- The following letters are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S. (From guess1: C,R,N,E; from guess2: B,I,L,S)

Since A is fixed at position 2, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.

We have 6 tries left, but we want to make a guess that uses common letters not yet tested and fits the pattern.

Available letters: We have vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The secret word: second letter is A, and we know the word must contain only letters from the available set and include A at position 2.

We need to choose a word that has A at the second position and uses only letters not excluded.

Moreover, we don't know the other positions, so we should test new letters.

What is still possible? The word could be, for example, ""FAVOR"", but we haven't tried F, V, O, R? Wait, R is excluded (from first guess). R is not in the word. Similarly, S and E are out.

We must avoid letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S.

So possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to use common letters: T, O, P, M, D, etc.

Let's think of common words that have A in the second position and use letters from the available set.

Examples:
- ""PANDA"" but P is available? But A is at position 2? P-A-N-D-A: but N is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.
- ""TALON"" but L is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MAKER"" but R is excluded -> invalid.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to form words:
- First letter? Can be D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, etc.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar.

Possible words:
- ""PAPAL"" but L is excluded -> no.
- ""DADDY"" has D, A (at 2), D, D, Y? But we don't know about D and Y. But word? ""DADDY"" is valid, but has repeated D. And positions: D (1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5). But we don't have information on D and Y. However, we can try.

But we want to test multiple new letters. So words with distinct letters are better for information.

Another word: ""HAPPY"" but H, P, P, Y? Has repeated P. Also, A at 2? H-A-P-P-Y? But third letter P, then P again? Not distinct.

Let's try common words:
- ""TANGY"": T-A-N-G-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.
- ""JAZZY"": J-A-Z-Z-Y? J and Z are uncommon? And repeated Z.
- ""QUACK"": Q-U-A-C-K? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F? But we have A at 3? Q-U-A? Position 3? We need A at 2? Actually, Q-U-A: A is at position 3 -> not position 2.

We need A at position 2.

Another: ""GAUDY"": G-A-U-D-Y? Letters: G, U, D, Y. All new. Yes.

Similarly, ""DAWNS"" -> but S and N are excluded -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> but L is excluded -> invalid.

""HAVOC"": H-A-V-O-C? C is excluded -> invalid.

""KAPUT"": K-A-P-U-T? Letters: K, P, U, T. All available? K, P, U, T are not excluded. Yes. Word: kaput meaning broken or finished.

""MAUVE"": M-A-U-V-E? But E is excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y? Repeated D? But P, D, Y available? And A at 2. Valid word? Yes, meaning a rice field.

But we have repeated D. Not ideal.

Another: ""PATIO"": P-A-T-I-O? But I is excluded (from guess2) -> invalid.

""PLATE"": P-A-L-A-T? But L is excluded and E is excluded? Wait, ""PLATE"" has E? And L. Both excluded -> invalid.

""TOADY"": T-O-A-D-Y? But A is at position 3? Actually, T-O-A: A at position 3 -> not 2.

We need first letter then A, so the pattern: [letter]A[three letters]

So: ""GAUDY"" (G-A-U-D-Y) -> letters G,U,D,Y. But D and Y? We don't know. And U is a vowel.

""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T? L is excluded -> invalid.

""YACHT"": Y-A-C-H-T? C is excluded -> invalid.

""WACKY"": W-A-C-K-Y? C is excluded -> invalid.

So harder? How about ""OAKUM"": O-A-K-U-M? All letters? O, A, K, U, M. And O is first letter? We don't know about O, K, U, M. And A at position 2? Yes. And word: ""oakum"" (a fiber used in shipbuilding). Valid.

But uncommon word? Maybe.

More common: ""MANOR"": M-A-N-O-R? N and R excluded -> invalid.

""GAMUT"": G-A-M-U-T? G, M, U, T. All available? Yes. Word: gamut meaning range. Yes.

So ""GAMUT"": G in position 1, A at 2, M at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

All letters distinct: G, M, U, T are new.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H-A-B-I-T? But B and I are excluded -> invalid.

""RAINY"": R is excluded -> invalid.

""VAUNT"": V-A-U-N-T? N excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""DAYLY""? Not really a word.

""DATUM"": D-A-T-U-M? M and U? Yes? But T at position 3. Word: datum, plural data? But as a guess, sometimes accepted? But it's 5 letters: D-A-T-U-M. Valid.

But ""DATUM"" has two T? No, D,A,T,U,M.

But in terms of commonality, ""GAMUT"" might be better.

Also: ""FAQIR"": F-A-Q-I-R? I and R excluded -> invalid.

I think ""GAMUT"" is acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PATCH"": C excluded -> no.

Let me think of words that are common: ""PARTY"": R excluded -> no.

So let's go with ""GAMUT"".

Another common word: ""TAFFY""? T-A-F-F-Y? Repeated F? And F and Y. But A at 2.

But repeated F -> less information.

I think ""GAMUT"" is good because distinct letters.

But we have U which is a vowel? We already know vowels: A is present. We might need to test other vowels? U and O? But in ""GAMUT"", we are testing O? No, it has U.

Alternatively, we can test O? In a word.

How about ""GATOR"": G-A-T-O-R? R excluded -> invalid.

""MATZO"": M-A-T-Z-O? Z and O? But if we want to test Z? Less common.

Perhaps ""OUTDO"" but A must be at position 2 -> doesn't fit.

So I'll go with ""GAMUT"".

But note: we are only allowed valid words. ""GAMUT"" is valid.

Another word: ""DAVIT"": D-A-V-I-T? I excluded -> invalid.

So ""GAMUT"" seems best.

Let me summarize:
- We know: secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Excluded letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S
- So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
- ""GAMUT"": uses G, A (known at pos2), M, U, T. And A is fixed so we are testing G at pos1, M at pos3, U at pos4, T at pos5.

If we get feedback:
- G: could be correct (✓), present but wrong position (-), or absent (x) -> but we'll see.

Similarly for M, U, T.

This guess also helps cover more ground.

So guess: GAMUT

Let me double-check: 
Position: G in 1, A in 2 (we know it must be correct), M in 3, U in 4, T in 5.
Expected feedback on A is ✓ for position 2, for the others we don't know.

And the word is 5 letters and valid.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: ""GAMUT""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → A is in the word but not in position 3 (C, R, N, E are absent).
- **Guess 2: bails** → A is correct and in position 2 (B, I, L, S are absent).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`.
2. **Excluded letters** (not in the word): B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.
3. **Remaining letters** to test: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
- Must start with a letter not excluded (e.g., G, T, M, D, P) and include **A** at position 2.
- Prioritize common letters and distinct positions to maximize information.
- Potential words: ""GAMUT"" (tests G, M, U, T), ""DAVIT"" (invalid, I excluded), ""TAFFY"" (repeated F, less informative).
- **Selected ""GAMUT""** because:
  - Fits the pattern `G A M U T`, testing four new distinct letters (G, M, U, T).
  - Common letters covered: G, M, T.
  - If incorrect, feedback will narrow down position/s for other letters.

<guess>gamut</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: bails -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
Guess 3: gamut -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""gamut"" -> G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)

Recall:
- We already knew A is the second letter (from guess 2), so A(✓) confirms that again.
- New information:
  - G: x → not in the word at all.
  - M: x → not in the word at all.
  - U: x → not in the word at all.
  - T: - → T is in the word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

So now we know:

Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _ 

Excluded letters (added from this guess): G, M, U (plus previous: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S). Total excluded: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U.

Remaining available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (note: T is now known to be in the word, but not at position 5).

Also, note T is present somewhere, but not in position 5.

Therefore, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A).

We have the pattern: the secret word has letters: [position1] A [position3] [position4] [position5]

With T being in one of position1, 3, or 4.

But not in position5 (given by T(-) in ""gamut"" which had T at position5).

The word contains at least T and A.

We also have no information about other letters.

Now, excluded letters: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U. So we avoid these.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and T (which we now know is in the word).

For our next guess, we must:

1. Have A at position 2 (fixed).
2 Include T in either position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be at 5).
3. Use other available letters for the remaining positions.

We want to test T in a different position and also test new letters.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: then word starts with T, then A.
- Position 3: then pattern: _ A T _ _
- Position 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _

We also need to fill the other positions with available letters to form a valid word.

Since we have few remaining letters that are common, and we have only 3 positions to fill (except the fixed A), we can try to cover as many as possible.

Also, we have 3 guesses left? We started with 6 tries: guess1,2,3 used, so 3 left? Actually, guess1 was first, guess2 second, guess3 third, so this is fourth guess.

We have time to test.

Let me try to think of words that fit.

If T is in position 1:

Words starting with T: T A _ _ _

Must be valid English word, and the next three letters from available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Examples: 
- ""TAXED"" but E excluded → invalid.
- ""TAKEN"" N excluded → invalid.
- ""TAPIR"" R excluded → invalid.
- ""TAFIA""? Meaning a rum? Letters: T,A,F,I,A? But I excluded? ""TAFIA"" has I at position 4? I is excluded → invalid.
- ""TABBY"" B excluded → invalid.
- ""TAFFY"" F at position 3, F at4? Repeated F? But F available. But word ""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y → but we have Y. Is it valid? Yes. And we don't know about F and Y. Also, T is at1? Which we are testing? Actually, we already know T is in the word, so we care more about its position and other letters.

But ""TAFFY"" has T at1 and A at2 (known), F at3, F at4, Y at5. But we don't know about F and Y.

Alternatively, if T is at4: pattern _ A _ T _

Or T at3: _ A T _ _

Let me consider common words:

First, with T at1: ""TARDY""? But R excluded → invalid.
""TALKY"" L excluded → invalid.
""TACKY"" C excluded → invalid.
So few options. ""TAWNY"" N excluded? Wait, no N: T,A,W,N,Y? N excluded → invalid.
""TAFFY"" as above: T,A,F,F,Y → valid? Yes. Available letters? F,Y available. But repeated F? We might get less information.

But we can test F and Y.

Also, T is at position 1, which we are testing: if T is at pos1, then we might get ✓ in position1? But we already know T is in the word, so if it's at1, we get ✓; if not, we get - or x? But we know T is in the word, so x is impossible. We could get: T(✓) if correct, T(-) if T is in the word but not at1.

Similarly, for other positions.

Now, with T at3: pattern _ A T _ _

Available letters: must choose a first letter from available (not excluded, and not A,T? But A,T already).

Available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (T is already placed, wait no: the first position is any available letter. Then A at2, T at3, then two other letters.

For example: ""PATIO"" but I,O? I excluded → invalid.
""PARTY"" R excluded → invalid.
""MATTE"" M,E excluded → invalid.
""OATEN"" N excluded → invalid.
""FAVOR"" R excluded → invalid.
""HAYST"" not word.

""JATHA"" not common? But J,A,T,H,A? But A repeated? And H? ""JATHA"" not standard English.

Possible words: ""PASTE"" S,E excluded → invalid.

I'm struggling.

With T at4: pattern _ A _ T _

Examples: ""CANTY"" C,N excluded → invalid.
""HASTY"" S excluded → invalid.
""FAKTY"" not word.
""PAYTM"" not English.
""DATA"" is 4 letters.

""QAIT""? Not 5 letters.

""WAIFT"" W,A,I,F,T? I excluded → invalid.

Hard to find.

Perhaps T is not at1 or at3? Let's consider another position? Only 1,3,4 possible for T.

Another idea: we tested T at5 and got ""-"", so T must be in 1,3, or4.

Now, let me list all possible words that fit in the remaining letter set.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and T which we know is in the word.

But T is already known to be in, so we must include T at one of the open positions.

Pattern: let the word be W1, A, W3, W4, W5.

With W1, W3, W4, W5 each from available letters.

But T appears exactly once? Not necessarily, but so far we have no duplication.

Given that, and the complexity, perhaps we can try a word that places T at position 3 or 4 to test it.

For example, let's put T at position 3: so pattern _ A T _ _

We need to fill the first letter and the last two letters from available letters.

Possible: 
First letter: F, H, K, O, P, Q, V, W, Y? Etc.

Then the last two: any from available.

But must form a common word.

Example: with O: ""OATHY"" not word.
""PATHO"" not standard.
""WATAP"" not common.
""YETRA"" E excluded.

How about ""PATIO""? Invalid due to I excluded? I think no word with common letters.

Put T at position 4: _ A _ T _

Pattern: W1, A, W3, T, W5.

W1 and W3 and W5 from available.

Examples: 
- ""XENIA"" but X,A,E,N,I? Multiple excluded → invalid.
- ""WAIFS"" I,S excluded? S excluded → invalid.
- ""Hants""? N and S excluded? Not valid.
- ""DAYNT""? Not word.

""VAPID"" V,A,P,I,D? I excluded → invalid.

I'm not finding common words.

Perhaps T at position 1: ""TAPAS"" S excluded → invalid.

""TAJES"" J,A,T,E,S? E and S excluded → invalid.

We might need to use less common letters.

Since we must include T, how about a word like ""THUJA"" but H,U,J? U excluded? From guess3, U is out. And H available? But U is excluded, so ""THUJA"" has U -> invalid.

 ""KOFTE"" O,K,F,T,E? E excluded -> invalid.

""PAVAN"" P,A,V,A,N? N excluded -> invalid.

Let me think differently. We have available vowels: O and Y? Sometimes as vowel.

Consider words ending with T? But we know T can't be at5? In secret word, T is not at5, but in our next guess we can put T at5 again? No, we can, but it would be redundant since we know it's not there? Actually, in guess3 we put T at5 and got ""-"" meaning T is in the word but not at that position. So we shouldn't put T at5 in new guesses? It's not forbidden, but it would give us information only if the position is correct or not. But we already know it's not at5, so it will always be ""-"" or something? If we put T at5 again, it would give ""-"" again unless the word has two T's? But we don't know.

However, to conserve guesses, we might avoid positions we know are incorrect.

So avoid position5 for T.

So T must be at1,3, or4.

Perhaps we can try T at position1.

Word: T A _ _ _

With last three from available: F, H, J, K, O, P, D, etc.

Common words: none because many combinations don't exist.

""TABLA"" B,L excluded -> invalid.
""TAPAS"" P,A,S excluded? S excluded -> invalid.
""TAXOL""? Not common.

How about ""TAXED""? E excluded -> invalid.

""TAKHI"" K,H,I? I excluded -> invalid.

""TAKO"" only 4 letters.

Perhaps use a word with Y: ""TAGGY"" G excluded? G is excluded -> invalid from guess3.

G is excluded.

""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y? F and Y are available. Word valid? Yes, meaning a candy. And T at position1.

Positions: T at1 (which we are testing), A at2 (fixed), F at3, F at4, Y at5.

This word:
- Tests T at position1: if T is at1, then ✓; if not, then we get - meaning T in word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4).
- Tests F twice (but we don't care about duplication).
- Tests Y at5? We can see.

If feedback for T is ✓, then T is first letter, and F,F,Y are not known or partially present? But F is new.

But we are sacrificing information by repeating F.

Nonetheless, it's a valid word.

Other options: ""TAPIS"" S excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""TAFFY"" is a possible guess.

Similarly, if we put T at position4: pattern ... _ A _ T _

With available letters: e.g., ""RAFTY"" R excluded -> invalid.

""QAFT"" not word.

""Kajal"" not standard spelling.

Hard to find words.

The only feasible one is ""TAFFY"" with T at position1.

So I choose that.

But let's confirm excluded letters: from guess1 and 2 and 3, we have a large exclusion set.

We can also consider putting T at position3.

For example, ""FAKIR"" F,A,K,I,R? I excluded -> no.
""HATOR"" H,A,T,O,R? R excluded -> invalid.

""OATHS"" O,A,T,H,S? S excluded -> invalid.

""PATHS"" S excluded -> invalid.

""YATHA"" Y,A,T,H,A? Then A at position5? But A is already at2, but the word might have two A's? Possible. Word: ""yatha"" not common.

"" DATAL"" D,A,T,A,L? L excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""TAFFY"" is the best we can do.

So next guess: ""TAFFY""

We expect some feedback.

If T is at1, then T becomes ✓, A is ✓ (fixed), and then F and Y will get feedback.

If T is not at1, then T will get ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4), and A ✓, then F and Y: possibly x or -.

So it gives us information.

Also, note that we haven't tested F or Y before.

Therefore, guess ""TAFFY"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

1. **Pattern Constraint**: The secret word has `_ A _ _ _` with `A` fixed at position 2.
2. **Letter Insights**: 
   - `T` is in the word but not at position 5 (feedback from ""gamut"").
   - `G`, `M`, `U` are confirmed absent, adding to previous exclusions (B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S).
   - **All excluded letters**: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
   - **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **T's Position**: Must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (not 2 or 5).
   - To maximize information, test `T` at position 1 in this guess.

**Selected ""TAFFY"" because**:
- Places `T` at position 1 (tests if this is correct).
- Retains `A` at position 2 (known).
- Uses new available letters: `F` and `Y`, with `F` repeated to test frequency.
- Word is valid and covers key possibilities:
  - If `T` position 1 is correct → instantly useful.
  - If not → `T` must be at positions 3 or 4 (useful constraint).

<guess>taffy</guess>After reviewing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Revealed ""A"" is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (bails)**: Confirmed ""A"" is in position 2 (✓), eliminating B, I, L, S.
- **Guess 3 (gamut)**: Confirmed ""A"" in position 2 again (✓), eliminated G, M, U, and showed ""T"" is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Constraints:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
2. **Included letters**: A (fixed at pos 2) and T (must be in pos 1, 3, or 4).
3. **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
4. **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test if ""T"" is in position 1 since it cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- Use ""F"" and ""Y"" (new, high-frequency letters) to gather maximum information.
- Avoid excluded letters and prioritize common words.

Selected **""TAFFY""** because:
- Puts ""T"" at position 1 to test its potential correct placement.
- Retains ""A"" at position 2.
- Introduces ""F"" (positions 3 and 4) and ""Y"" (position 5). 
- Though ""F"" repeats, the word is valid and efficiently tests three new letters (T, F, Y) within constraints.

If ""T"" is correct at position 1, feedback will confirm it instantly and provide info on F/Y. If not, ""T"" must be in positions 3 or 4 for future guesses.

Actually, E and R are absent, so we cannot use them. ""AFTER"" has E and R -> invalid because we know they are not in the word).\n\n We must avoid E and R. So ""ABOUT"": \n   A (first), B, O, U, T -> all new letters? But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\n However, we also note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Another idea: We know A is in the word, so we can try to put A in the second position? Or fourth? \n\n Let\'s think of common words without the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E). We also note that we have not tried S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have the letter D to test.\n\n However, we want to maximize new letters. So let\'s avoid repeating A until we know more.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" (meaning a braid) -> but we don\'t know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position for A? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 3) was wrong, but A might be in the third position in the secret word? \n\n Wait, no: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an A, but not at position 3. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n So in ""PLAIT"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n We can try a word with A in the first position: e.g., ""ALBUM"" (but has U and M, and we don\'t know about them). But note: we also have to avoid R, C, N, E.\n\n Another word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. \n   A is in the third position? We want to avoid third? Actually, we can put A in a different position. In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. So that\'s the same as before? We know A is not at position 3, so we should not put it there.\n\n We can rearrange: How about ""PASTA""? \n   P, A (second position), S, T, A (fifth). \n   But note: we have two A\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are using A in the second and fifth positions. The feedback only said A is in the word (at least one) but not at position 3. So it could be at 2 or 5.\n\n However, we are also testing P, S, T.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""PASTA"" doesn\'t contain any of these.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N (which we know is absent) -> invalid because N is not in the word.\n\n Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A.\n\n We must include A.\n\n Let me try to list words with A in a position other than 3 and without C, R, N, E.\n\n Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n Words with A at position 1:\n   ALIST (A, L, I, S, T) -> but is it a word? Actually, ""ALIST"" is not common. How about ""ALOFT"" (A, L, O, F, T) -> valid? Yes.\n\n Words with A at position 2:\n   PLATE -> but has E (absent) -> invalid.\n   BLAND -> has N (absent) -> invalid.\n   FLASK -> has S and K, but also we don\'t know about F, L, S, K. And A is at position 2? Actually, F-L-A-S-K: A is at position 3 -> avoid? We want position 2? Actually, in ""FLASK"", A is at position 3 -> so that\'s the same as before? We must avoid.\n\n How about ""TASTY"": \n   T, A (second), S, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know about T, S, Y. Also, A is at position 2 -> good.\n\n But ""TASTY"" has two T\'s. We don\'t know if the word has T or two T\'s.\n\n Another word: ""BAILS"" (B, A, I, L, S) -> A at position 2.\n\n Words with A at position 4:\n   We don\'t have many common words. Example: ""OPALS"" (O, P, A, L, S) -> A at position 3? Actually, O-P-A-L-S: A is at position 3 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""FOCAL""? F-O-C-A-L -> but C is absent -> invalid.\n\n How about ""DOGMA"": D-O-G-M-A -> A at position 5? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G, 4:M, 5:A -> so A at position 5. And no forbidden letters? D, O, G, M, A -> no C, R, N, E. So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> but Z is uncommon and we have two Z\'s.\n\n After considering, let\'s choose between:\n   ""ALOFT"" (A at 1) -> A, L, O, F, T\n   ""TASTY"" (A at 2) -> T, A, S, T, Y (but two T\'s, which might not be efficient)\n   ""BAILS"" (A at 2) -> B, A, I, L, S\n   ""DOGMA"" (A at 5) -> D, O, G, M, A\n\n We want to maximize new letters and avoid repetition.\n\n Also, we want to cover more common letters. The letters we haven\'t tried and are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""BAILS"" is a good candidate: \n   It has A in position 2 (which is new), and letters B, I, L, S.\n\n Alternatively, ""ALOFT"" has A in position 1 and L, O, F, T.\n\n Since we know A is in the word, and we are trying to find its position, putting A in a new position (like 1 or 2) is good.\n\n Let me choose ""BAILS"". \n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in a specific position, but we know it\'s not at 3. So by putting it at 2, we can check if that\'s the correct position.\n\n If we get a ✓ for A in position 2, then we know. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,4, or5). If we get an \'x\', that would be impossible because we know A is in the word.\n\n Actually, we cannot get an \'x\' for A because we know it\'s in the word. So we expect either ✓ or -.\n\n So let\'s go with ""BAILS"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has two A\'s? Then we might get two marks. But we don\'t know. So it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters to get clearer feedback.\n\n ""BAILS"" has distinct letters: B, A, I, L, S -> all distinct. That\'s good.\n\n So I choose ""BAILS"".\n\n However, let me check if ""BAILS"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of bail, meaning a bucket or to remove water).\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SALAD"" but that has two A\'s and we don\'t want to repeat. So ""BAILS"" is better.\n\n Another option: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid.\n\n Let me also consider ""AUDIO"" -> but we know U? We don\'t, but it has A at position 1 and U, D, I, O. But we also avoid R, C, N, E -> okay. But we don\'t have any common consonants? And we are testing two vowels (A and I, O, U). Maybe not as efficient.\n\n I think ""BAILS"" is a solid choice.\n\n So next guess: ""BAILS""\n\n<guess>bails</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in the third position (indicated by ""-"").\n- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (indicated by ""x"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include ""A"" in a position other than the third (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""E"".\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, S, L, I, T, O) to maximize information.\n- Choose a word with distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.\n\nSelected ""BAILS"" because:\n- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: B, I, L, S.\n- All letters are distinct.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n\nThis guess will help locate ""A"" and test four new letters.\n\n<guess>bails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: bails -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane\nFeedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning: \n  C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n  A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nGuess 2: bails\nFeedback: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)\nMeaning:\n  B, I, L, S are not in the word at all.\n  A is in the word AND in the correct position, which is position 2 (since in ""bails"", A is the second letter).\n\nSo now we know:\n- A is definitely the second letter of the secret word.\n- The following letters are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S. (From guess1: C,R,N,E; from guess2: B,I,L,S)\n\nSince A is fixed at position 2, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.\n\nWe have 6 tries left, but we want to make a guess that uses common letters not yet tested and fits the pattern.\n\nAvailable letters: We have vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe secret word: second letter is A, and we know the word must contain only letters from the available set and include A at position 2.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has A at the second position and uses only letters not excluded.\n\nMoreover, we don\'t know the other positions, so we should test new letters.\n\nWhat is still possible? The word could be, for example, ""FAVOR"", but we haven\'t tried F, V, O, R? Wait, R is excluded (from first guess). R is not in the word. Similarly, S and E are out.\n\nWe must avoid letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S.\n\nSo possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to use common letters: T, O, P, M, D, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that have A in the second position and use letters from the available set.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PANDA"" but P is available? But A is at position 2? P-A-N-D-A: but N is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.\n- ""TALON"" but L is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""MAKER"" but R is excluded -> invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n- First letter? Can be D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, etc.\n- Third, fourth, fifth: similar.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PAPAL"" but L is excluded -> no.\n- ""DADDY"" has D, A (at 2), D, D, Y? But we don\'t know about D and Y. But word? ""DADDY"" is valid, but has repeated D. And positions: D (1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5). But we don\'t have information on D and Y. However, we can try.\n\nBut we want to test multiple new letters. So words with distinct letters are better for information.\n\nAnother word: ""HAPPY"" but H, P, P, Y? Has repeated P. Also, A at 2? H-A-P-P-Y? But third letter P, then P again? Not distinct.\n\nLet\'s try common words:\n- ""TANGY"": T-A-N-G-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""JAZZY"": J-A-Z-Z-Y? J and Z are uncommon? And repeated Z.\n- ""QUACK"": Q-U-A-C-K? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F? But we have A at 3? Q-U-A? Position 3? We need A at 2? Actually, Q-U-A: A is at position 3 -> not position 2.\n\nWe need A at position 2.\n\nAnother: ""GAUDY"": G-A-U-D-Y? Letters: G, U, D, Y. All new. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAWNS"" -> but S and N are excluded -> invalid.\n\n""FAULT"" -> but L is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""HAVOC"": H-A-V-O-C? C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""KAPUT"": K-A-P-U-T? Letters: K, P, U, T. All available? K, P, U, T are not excluded. Yes. Word: kaput meaning broken or finished.\n\n""MAUVE"": M-A-U-V-E? But E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y? Repeated D? But P, D, Y available? And A at 2. Valid word? Yes, meaning a rice field.\n\nBut we have repeated D. Not ideal.\n\nAnother: ""PATIO"": P-A-T-I-O? But I is excluded (from guess2) -> invalid.\n\n""PLATE"": P-A-L-A-T? But L is excluded and E is excluded? Wait, ""PLATE"" has E? And L. Both excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TOADY"": T-O-A-D-Y? But A is at position 3? Actually, T-O-A: A at position 3 -> not 2.\n\nWe need first letter then A, so the pattern: [letter]A[three letters]\n\nSo: ""GAUDY"" (G-A-U-D-Y) -> letters G,U,D,Y. But D and Y? We don\'t know. And U is a vowel.\n\n""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y? N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T? L is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YACHT"": Y-A-C-H-T? C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""WACKY"": W-A-C-K-Y? C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo harder? How about ""OAKUM"": O-A-K-U-M? All letters? O, A, K, U, M. And O is first letter? We don\'t know about O, K, U, M. And A at position 2? Yes. And word: ""oakum"" (a fiber used in shipbuilding). Valid.\n\nBut uncommon word? Maybe.\n\nMore common: ""MANOR"": M-A-N-O-R? N and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n""GAMUT"": G-A-M-U-T? G, M, U, T. All available? Yes. Word: gamut meaning range. Yes.\n\nSo ""GAMUT"": G in position 1, A at 2, M at 3, U at 4, T at 5.\n\nAll letters distinct: G, M, U, T are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""HABIT"": H-A-B-I-T? But B and I are excluded -> invalid.\n\n""RAINY"": R is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""VAUNT"": V-A-U-N-T? N excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo ""GAMUT"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother option: ""DAYLY""? Not really a word.\n\n""DATUM"": D-A-T-U-M? M and U? Yes? But T at position 3. Word: datum, plural data? But as a guess, sometimes accepted? But it\'s 5 letters: D-A-T-U-M. Valid.\n\nBut ""DATUM"" has two T? No, D,A,T,U,M.\n\nBut in terms of commonality, ""GAMUT"" might be better.\n\nAlso: ""FAQIR"": F-A-Q-I-R? I and R excluded -> invalid.\n\nI think ""GAMUT"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we can also consider ""PATCH"": C excluded -> no.\n\nLet me think of words that are common: ""PARTY"": R excluded -> no.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""GAMUT"".\n\nAnother common word: ""TAFFY""? T-A-F-F-Y? Repeated F? And F and Y. But A at 2.\n\nBut repeated F -> less information.\n\nI think ""GAMUT"" is good because distinct letters.\n\nBut we have U which is a vowel? We already know vowels: A is present. We might need to test other vowels? U and O? But in ""GAMUT"", we are testing O? No, it has U.\n\nAlternatively, we can test O? In a word.\n\nHow about ""GATOR"": G-A-T-O-R? R excluded -> invalid.\n\n""MATZO"": M-A-T-Z-O? Z and O? But if we want to test Z? Less common.\n\nPerhaps ""OUTDO"" but A must be at position 2 -> doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GAMUT"".\n\nBut note: we are only allowed valid words. ""GAMUT"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""DAVIT"": D-A-V-I-T? I excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo ""GAMUT"" seems best.\n\nLet me summarize:\n- We know: secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _\n- Excluded letters: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S\n- So available: D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n- ""GAMUT"": uses G, A (known at pos2), M, U, T. And A is fixed so we are testing G at pos1, M at pos3, U at pos4, T at pos5.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- G: could be correct (✓), present but wrong position (-), or absent (x) -> but we\'ll see.\n\nSimilarly for M, U, T.\n\nThis guess also helps cover more ground.\n\nSo guess: GAMUT\n\nLet me double-check: \nPosition: G in 1, A in 2 (we know it must be correct), M in 3, U in 4, T in 5.\nExpected feedback on A is ✓ for position 2, for the others we don\'t know.\n\nAnd the word is 5 letters and valid.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""GAMUT""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → A is in the word but not in position 3 (C, R, N, E are absent).\n- **Guess 2: bails** → A is correct and in position 2 (B, I, L, S are absent).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`.\n2. **Excluded letters** (not in the word): B, C, E, I, L, N, R, S.\n3. **Remaining letters** to test: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Must start with a letter not excluded (e.g., G, T, M, D, P) and include **A** at position 2.\n- Prioritize common letters and distinct positions to maximize information.\n- Potential words: ""GAMUT"" (tests G, M, U, T), ""DAVIT"" (invalid, I excluded), ""TAFFY"" (repeated F, less informative).\n- **Selected ""GAMUT""** because:\n  - Fits the pattern `G A M U T`, testing four new distinct letters (G, M, U, T).\n  - Common letters covered: G, M, T.\n  - If incorrect, feedback will narrow down position/s for other letters.\n\n<guess>gamut</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: bails -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: gamut -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""gamut"" -> G(x) A(✓) M(x) U(x) T(-)\n\nRecall:\n- We already knew A is the second letter (from guess 2), so A(✓) confirms that again.\n- New information:\n  - G: x → not in the word at all.\n  - M: x → not in the word at all.\n  - U: x → not in the word at all.\n  - T: - → T is in the word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).\n\nSo now we know:\n\nSecret word pattern: _ A _ _ _ \n\nExcluded letters (added from this guess): G, M, U (plus previous: B,C,E,I,L,N,R,S). Total excluded: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U.\n\nRemaining available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (note: T is now known to be in the word, but not at position 5).\n\nAlso, note T is present somewhere, but not in position 5.\n\nTherefore, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A).\n\nWe have the pattern: the secret word has letters: [position1] A [position3] [position4] [position5]\n\nWith T being in one of position1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut not in position5 (given by T(-) in ""gamut"" which had T at position5).\n\nThe word contains at least T and A.\n\nWe also have no information about other letters.\n\nNow, excluded letters: B,C,E,G,I,L,M,N,R,S,U. So we avoid these.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and T (which we now know is in the word).\n\nFor our next guess, we must:\n\n1. Have A at position 2 (fixed).\n2 Include T in either position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can\'t be at 5).\n3. Use other available letters for the remaining positions.\n\nWe want to test T in a different position and also test new letters.\n\nPossible positions for T:\n- Position 1: then word starts with T, then A.\n- Position 3: then pattern: _ A T _ _\n- Position 4: then pattern: _ A _ T _\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with available letters to form a valid word.\n\nSince we have few remaining letters that are common, and we have only 3 positions to fill (except the fixed A), we can try to cover as many as possible.\n\nAlso, we have 3 guesses left? We started with 6 tries: guess1,2,3 used, so 3 left? Actually, guess1 was first, guess2 second, guess3 third, so this is fourth guess.\n\nWe have time to test.\n\nLet me try to think of words that fit.\n\nIf T is in position 1:\n\nWords starting with T: T A _ _ _\n\nMust be valid English word, and the next three letters from available: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nExamples: \n- ""TAXED"" but E excluded → invalid.\n- ""TAKEN"" N excluded → invalid.\n- ""TAPIR"" R excluded → invalid.\n- ""TAFIA""? Meaning a rum? Letters: T,A,F,I,A? But I excluded? ""TAFIA"" has I at position 4? I is excluded → invalid.\n- ""TABBY"" B excluded → invalid.\n- ""TAFFY"" F at position 3, F at4? Repeated F? But F available. But word ""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y → but we have Y. Is it valid? Yes. And we don\'t know about F and Y. Also, T is at1? Which we are testing? Actually, we already know T is in the word, so we care more about its position and other letters.\n\nBut ""TAFFY"" has T at1 and A at2 (known), F at3, F at4, Y at5. But we don\'t know about F and Y.\n\nAlternatively, if T is at4: pattern _ A _ T _\n\nOr T at3: _ A T _ _\n\nLet me consider common words:\n\nFirst, with T at1: ""TARDY""? But R excluded → invalid.\n""TALKY"" L excluded → invalid.\n""TACKY"" C excluded → invalid.\nSo few options. ""TAWNY"" N excluded? Wait, no N: T,A,W,N,Y? N excluded → invalid.\n""TAFFY"" as above: T,A,F,F,Y → valid? Yes. Available letters? F,Y available. But repeated F? We might get less information.\n\nBut we can test F and Y.\n\nAlso, T is at position 1, which we are testing: if T is at pos1, then we might get ✓ in position1? But we already know T is in the word, so if it\'s at1, we get ✓; if not, we get - or x? But we know T is in the word, so x is impossible. We could get: T(✓) if correct, T(-) if T is in the word but not at1.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nNow, with T at3: pattern _ A T _ _\n\nAvailable letters: must choose a first letter from available (not excluded, and not A,T? But A,T already).\n\nAvailable: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (T is already placed, wait no: the first position is any available letter. Then A at2, T at3, then two other letters.\n\nFor example: ""PATIO"" but I,O? I excluded → invalid.\n""PARTY"" R excluded → invalid.\n""MATTE"" M,E excluded → invalid.\n""OATEN"" N excluded → invalid.\n""FAVOR"" R excluded → invalid.\n""HAYST"" not word.\n\n""JATHA"" not common? But J,A,T,H,A? But A repeated? And H? ""JATHA"" not standard English.\n\nPossible words: ""PASTE"" S,E excluded → invalid.\n\nI\'m struggling.\n\nWith T at4: pattern _ A _ T _\n\nExamples: ""CANTY"" C,N excluded → invalid.\n""HASTY"" S excluded → invalid.\n""FAKTY"" not word.\n""PAYTM"" not English.\n""DATA"" is 4 letters.\n\n""QAIT""? Not 5 letters.\n\n""WAIFT"" W,A,I,F,T? I excluded → invalid.\n\nHard to find.\n\nPerhaps T is not at1 or at3? Let\'s consider another position? Only 1,3,4 possible for T.\n\nAnother idea: we tested T at5 and got ""-"", so T must be in 1,3, or4.\n\nNow, let me list all possible words that fit in the remaining letter set.\n\nAvailable letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and T which we know is in the word.\n\nBut T is already known to be in, so we must include T at one of the open positions.\n\nPattern: let the word be W1, A, W3, W4, W5.\n\nWith W1, W3, W4, W5 each from available letters.\n\nBut T appears exactly once? Not necessarily, but so far we have no duplication.\n\nGiven that, and the complexity, perhaps we can try a word that places T at position 3 or 4 to test it.\n\nFor example, let\'s put T at position 3: so pattern _ A T _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first letter and the last two letters from available letters.\n\nPossible: \nFirst letter: F, H, K, O, P, Q, V, W, Y? Etc.\n\nThen the last two: any from available.\n\nBut must form a common word.\n\nExample: with O: ""OATHY"" not word.\n""PATHO"" not standard.\n""WATAP"" not common.\n""YETRA"" E excluded.\n\nHow about ""PATIO""? Invalid due to I excluded? I think no word with common letters.\n\nPut T at position 4: _ A _ T _\n\nPattern: W1, A, W3, T, W5.\n\nW1 and W3 and W5 from available.\n\nExamples: \n- ""XENIA"" but X,A,E,N,I? Multiple excluded → invalid.\n- ""WAIFS"" I,S excluded? S excluded → invalid.\n- ""Hants""? N and S excluded? Not valid.\n- ""DAYNT""? Not word.\n\n""VAPID"" V,A,P,I,D? I excluded → invalid.\n\nI\'m not finding common words.\n\nPerhaps T at position 1: ""TAPAS"" S excluded → invalid.\n\n""TAJES"" J,A,T,E,S? E and S excluded → invalid.\n\nWe might need to use less common letters.\n\nSince we must include T, how about a word like ""THUJA"" but H,U,J? U excluded? From guess3, U is out. And H available? But U is excluded, so ""THUJA"" has U -> invalid.\n\n ""KOFTE"" O,K,F,T,E? E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""PAVAN"" P,A,V,A,N? N excluded -> invalid.\n\nLet me think differently. We have available vowels: O and Y? Sometimes as vowel.\n\nConsider words ending with T? But we know T can\'t be at5? In secret word, T is not at5, but in our next guess we can put T at5 again? No, we can, but it would be redundant since we know it\'s not there? Actually, in guess3 we put T at5 and got ""-"" meaning T is in the word but not at that position. So we shouldn\'t put T at5 in new guesses? It\'s not forbidden, but it would give us information only if the position is correct or not. But we already know it\'s not at5, so it will always be ""-"" or something? If we put T at5 again, it would give ""-"" again unless the word has two T\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, to conserve guesses, we might avoid positions we know are incorrect.\n\nSo avoid position5 for T.\n\nSo T must be at1,3, or4.\n\nPerhaps we can try T at position1.\n\nWord: T A _ _ _\n\nWith last three from available: F, H, J, K, O, P, D, etc.\n\nCommon words: none because many combinations don\'t exist.\n\n""TABLA"" B,L excluded -> invalid.\n""TAPAS"" P,A,S excluded? S excluded -> invalid.\n""TAXOL""? Not common.\n\nHow about ""TAXED""? E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TAKHI"" K,H,I? I excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TAKO"" only 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps use a word with Y: ""TAGGY"" G excluded? G is excluded -> invalid from guess3.\n\nG is excluded.\n\n""TAFFY"": T,A,F,F,Y? F and Y are available. Word valid? Yes, meaning a candy. And T at position1.\n\nPositions: T at1 (which we are testing), A at2 (fixed), F at3, F at4, Y at5.\n\nThis word:\n- Tests T at position1: if T is at1, then ✓; if not, then we get - meaning T in word but not at1 (so must be at3 or4).\n- Tests F twice (but we don\'t care about duplication).\n- Tests Y at5? We can see.\n\nIf feedback for T is ✓, then T is first letter, and F,F,Y are not known or partially present? But F is new.\n\nBut we are sacrificing information by repeating F.\n\nNonetheless, it\'s a valid word.\n\nOther options: ""TAPIS"" S excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo I think ""TAFFY"" is a possible guess.\n\nSimilarly, if we put T at position4: pattern ... _ A _ T _\n\nWith available letters: e.g., ""RAFTY"" R excluded -> invalid.\n\n""QAFT"" not word.\n\n""Kajal"" not standard spelling.\n\nHard to find words.\n\nThe only feasible one is ""TAFFY"" with T at position1.\n\nSo I choose that.\n\nBut let\'s confirm excluded letters: from guess1 and 2 and 3, we have a large exclusion set.\n\nWe can also consider putting T at position3.\n\nFor example, ""FAKIR"" F,A,K,I,R? I excluded -> no.\n""HATOR"" H,A,T,O,R? R excluded -> invalid.\n\n""OATHS"" O,A,T,H,S? S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""PATHS"" S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YATHA"" Y,A,T,H,A? Then A at position5?

We have the feedback for Guess 4: ""taffy"" -> T(✓) A(✓) F(x) F(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- T is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ✓).
- A is correct and in position 2 (as we already knew, confirmed again).
- F is not in the word at all (both F's got x, so F is absent).
- Y is correct and in position 5 (we placed Y at position 5 and got ✓).

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with T, then A, and ends with Y. So the pattern is: T A _ _ Y
- The third and fourth letters are missing, and we know F is not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we have a list of excluded letters: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, and now F.

So total excluded: B, C, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.

Available letters: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Note: T, A, Y are already placed, so we don't need to test them again, but they are fixed.)

The secret word is T A _ _ Y

We need to fill the third and fourth positions with two letters from the available set: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We have two positions to guess, and we have 11 letters available. But we can form a word that uses two of these.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- T A _ _ Y

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""TASTY"": but S is excluded (from guess2) and T is already at start? Also, S is excluded. Invalid.
- ""TANGY"": N excluded -> invalid.
- ""TARDY"": R excluded -> invalid.
- ""TAPDY"" not a word.

We need to use available letters.

Let's list possible words:
- ""TABBY"": B excluded -> invalid.
- ""TACKY"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""TALKY"": L excluded -> invalid.
- ""TAMMY"": M excluded -> invalid.
- ""TANNY"": N excluded -> invalid.
- ""TARZY"" not a word.
- ""TAWNY"": N excluded -> invalid.
- ""TAFFY"" we already tried, and F is excluded.

Now, with available letters: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""TAKOY"" not a word.
- ""TAXOY"" not a word.
- ""TAVOY"" not a word.
- ""TAHOY"" not a word.
- ""TAJOY"" not a word.
- ""TAPOY"" not a word.

How about ""TAWPY""? Not a word.

""JAPAN"" doesn't fit pattern.

Perhaps ""TAKHY"" not word.

I think we need to consider more common words.

Another idea: ""DAILY"" but D,A,I,L,Y? I and L excluded -> invalid.

Perhaps we missed a word.

What about ""TIDDY""? Not pattern.

The word must start with T, then A, then two letters, then Y.

So: T A ? ? Y

With ? and ? from available letters.

Possible combinations:
- T A D _ Y: e.g., ""TADPY"" not word, ""TADHY"" not word.
- T A H _ Y: ""TAHHY"" not word, ""TAHOY"" not word.
- T A J _ Y: ""TAJAY"" not word, ""TAJKY"" not word.
- T A K _ Y: ""TAKKY"" not word, ""TAKOY"" not word.
- T A O _ Y: ""TAODY"" not word, ""TAOXY"" not word.
- T A P _ Y: ""TAPHY"" not word, ""TAPKY"" not word, ""TAPPY"" -> but P is available? ""TAPPY"" is a word? Meaning? Not common. Or ""TAPIR"" but R excluded and not ending with Y.

""TAPIR"" is T,A,P,I,R -> but I and R excluded, and not ending with Y.

How about ""TAPIS"" S excluded.

Another: ""TAVY"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""TAWNY"" is the only common one but N excluded.

I think we might have to use a word that is less common.

For example, ""TAXOL"" is a chemical, but not common word. Or ""TAXON"" N excluded.

""TAXOR"" R excluded.

""TAXED"" E excluded.

""TAXIS"" S excluded.

""TAXUS"" S excluded.

""TAXER"" R excluded.

All not valid.

Perhaps ""JAZZY"" but J,A,Z,Z,Y? Pattern is T A _ _ Y, so must start with T.

We need T at start.

Another possibility: ""TAHKY"" not word.

""TAKHI"" K,H,I? I excluded -> invalid.

""TAKIN"" N excluded -> invalid.

""TALCY"" L excluded -> invalid.

""TALKY"" L excluded.

""TALLY"" L excluded.

""TALON"" N excluded.

""TAMED"" E excluded.

""TAMIS"" S excluded.

None work.

Perhaps we consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, we have T, A, Y fixed, and two middle letters.

But we have no indication of duplicates so far.

Another idea: ""TAWPY"" not word.

""TAWSE"" S,E excluded.

""TAXED"" E excluded.

I think we need to look for words that are valid but less common.

For example, ""TAJES"" not word.

""TAKHI"" not allowed.

""TAWTS"" not word.

""TAXIS"" S excluded.

""TAXON"" N excluded.

""TAXOR"" R excluded.

""TAXUS"" S excluded.

""TAYRA"" R excluded.

None of these work.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""DAISY"" but D,A,I,S,Y? I and S excluded -> invalid.

""PAVAN"" not pattern.

Another thought: maybe ""HAPPY"" but H,A,P,P,Y? Pattern not T A _ _ Y.

We need to start with T and end with Y.

Perhaps ""JAZZY"" is not starting with T.

I think there might be a mistake. Let's list all 5-letter words starting with TA and ending with Y.

From common English words:
- TAKHY not common.
- TANSY: T,A,N,S,Y? N and S excluded -> invalid.
- TARDY: R excluded -> invalid.
- TARRY: R excluded -> invalid.
- TATTY: T,A,T,T,Y? But T is repeated, and we have T at position1 and also at position3 and4? But we know T is at position1, so if there is another T, it might be possible. But in ""TATTY"", we have T at1, A at2, T at3, T at4, Y at5. But we have excluded letters: N,R,S, etc. But T is not excluded, obviously. But in this case, we would have T at1 and T at3 and T at4? But the secret word has T at1 and Y at5, and A at2, so the middle two could be anything.

But ""TATTY"" has T at3 and T at4, which are new positions for T? But we already know T is in the word, and we have it at1, so if there are more T's, it's possible.

But in the feedback for ""taffy"", we had T at1 correct, and Y at5 correct, and F at3 and4 absent. So the secret word has T at1, A at2, Y at5, and the third and fourth are not F, and not any of the excluded letters.

So for ""TATTY"", the third and fourth letters are T and T. But T is not excluded, so it's possible.

But is ""TATTY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning shabby or cheap.

And it uses only T,A,Y and T,T, which are not excluded.

But we have T at position3 and4, which we haven't tested.

Also, in the available letters, T is not excluded, so it can be used.

But we have already used T in position1, and we know it's there, so using T in other positions is fine.

Similarly, in the secret word, if it has T at3 or4, it would be fine.

So ""TATTY"" could be a candidate for the secret word.

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess ""TATTY"".

But let's see if it fits the feedback.

If the secret word is ""TATTY"", then in guess4 ""taffy"": 
- T at1: correct position -> ✓
- A at2: correct -> ✓
- F at3: not in word -> x (correct, since third letter is T, not F)
- F at4: not in word -> x (correct, fourth letter is T, not F)
- Y at5: correct -> ✓

So it matches.

But is ""TATTY"" the only possibility? No, there could be others.

For example, ""TACKY"" but C excluded.

""TAPPY"" P,P? Is ""TAPPY"" a word? It might be informal, but let's see.

""TAPPY"": not commonly used, but it can mean resembling or pertaining to a tap.

But C is not excluded? C is excluded from guess1.

Available letters include P.

""TAPPY"": T,A,P,P,Y.

If we guess ""TAPPY"", and the secret word is ""TATTY"", then feedback would be:
- T: ✓
- A: ✓
- P: x (since third letter is T, not P)
- P: x (fourth letter is T, not P)
- Y: ✓

So we would know that the third and fourth letters are not P, and not F, etc.

But we want to guess a word that could be the secret word or at least narrow down.

Since we have few options, we can guess ""TATTY"" directly.

But are there other words?

For example, ""TABBY"" B excluded.

""TAFFY"" we tried and F is excluded.

""TAGGY"" G excluded.

""TAKKY"" not word.

""TALLY"" L excluded.

""TAMMY"" M excluded.

""TANNY"" N excluded.

""TAPIR"" R excluded.

""TARRE"" R excluded.

""TARTY"" R excluded.

""TASPY"" S excluded.

""TATOU"" U excluded.

""TAWNY"" N excluded.

""TAFFY"" is out.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and available letters is ""TATTY"".

""TAWPY"" not word.

""TAXMY"" not word.

""TAZIA"" not ending with Y.

I think ""TATTY"" is the most plausible.

Perhaps ""JAZZY"" but not starting with T.

So I will guess ""TATTY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T A T T Y.

And it is a valid English word.

Therefore, next guess: ""TATTY""Based on the feedback:

- **Pattern**: Secret word is `T A _ _ Y` (T at 1, A at 2, Y at 5).
- **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
- **Available letters for positions 3 and 4**: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly T, since it's already in the word but could repeat).

### Analysis:
- Common words like ""TACKY"", ""TARDY"", ""TAWNY"" are invalid due to excluded letters.
- ""TAFFY"" was already guessed and ruled out (F absent).
- **""TATTY""** is a valid word (meaning shabby or cheap) that fits:
  - `T` at position 1 (known), `A` at 2 (known), `T` at 3 and 4 (new positions), `Y` at 5 (known).
- No other common words fit the pattern with available letters.

### Conclusion:
""TATTY"" is the most plausible guess given the constraints. If correct, it will solve the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on the repeated `T` will help narrow down further.

<guess>tatty</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Word Pattern**:  
   - Feedback from Guess 4 (""taffy"") confirms:  
     - **T(✓)**: `T` is correct and in position 1.  
     - **A(✓)**: `A` is correct and in position 2 (already known).  
     - **F(x)**: `F` is absent (both instances).  
     - **Y(✓)**: `Y` is correct and in position 5.  
   - Thus, the secret word is `T A _ _ Y`.  
   - Positions 3 and 4 are unknown.

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback:  
     - Guess 1: C, R, N, E absent.  
     - Guess 2: B, I, L, S absent.  
     - Guess 3: G, M, U absent.  
     - Guess 4: F absent.  
   - **Total excluded**: B, C, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.  
   - **Available letters for positions 3–4**: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and `T`, which is already in the word but could repeat).

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:  
   - The word must start with `T`, end with `Y`, and have `A` in position 2.  
   - Common words like ""TACKY"" (C excluded), ""TARDY"" (R excluded), or ""TAWNY"" (N excluded) are invalid.  
   - ""TAFFY"" was already guessed and ruled out (F absent).  
   - **""TATTY""** is a valid English word (meaning shabby or worn out) that fits:  
     - `T` at position 1 (known),  
     - `A` at position 2 (known),  
     - `T` at positions 3 and 4 (testing for `T` repeats),  
     - `Y` at position 5 (known).  
   - No other common words fit the pattern with available letters (e.g., ""TAPPY"" is obscure, ""TAXOY"" is invalid).

4. **Why ""TATTY""?**  
   - Tests if `T` repeats in positions 3–4 (plausible since `T` is already confirmed).  
   - Uses no excluded letters.  
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on `T` in positions 3–4 will pinpoint the solution.

<guess>tatty</guess>",tatty,"We have the feedback for Guess 4: ""taffy"" -> T(✓) A(✓) F(x) F(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- T is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ✓).
- A is correct and in position 2 (as we already knew, confirmed again).
- F is not in the word at all (both F's got x, so F is absent).
- Y is correct and in position 5 (we placed Y at position 5 and got ✓).

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with T, then A, and ends with Y. So the pattern is: T A _ _ Y
- The third and fourth letters are missing, and we know F is not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we have a list of excluded letters: B, C, E, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, and now F.

So total excluded: B, C, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.

Available letters: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Note: T, A, Y are already placed, so we don't need to test them again, but they are fixed.)

The secret word is T A _ _ Y

We need to fill the third and fourth positions with two letters from the available set: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We have two positions to guess, and we have 11 letters available. But we can form a word that uses two of these.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- T A _ _ Y

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""TASTY"": but S is excluded (from guess2) and T is already at start? Also, S is excluded. Invalid.
- ""TANGY"": N excluded -> invalid.
- ""TARDY"": R excluded -> invalid.
- ""TAPDY"" not a word.

- ""TAMMY"": M excluded -> invalid.
- ""TANNY"": N excluded -> invalid.
- ""TARZY"" not a word.
- ""TAWNY"": N excluded -> invalid.
- ""TAFFY"" we already tried, and F is excluded.

Now, with available letters: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""TAKOY"" not a word.
- ""TAXOY"" not a word.
- ""TAVOY"" not a word.

""TANNY"" N excluded.

""TAPIR"" R excluded.

""TARRE"" R excluded.

""TARTY"" R excluded.

""TASPY"" S excluded.

""TATOU"" U excluded.

""TAWNY"" N excluded.

""TAFFY"" is out.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and available letters is ""TATTY"".

""TAWPY"" not word.

""TAXMY"" not word.

""TAZIA"" not ending with Y.

I think ""TATTY"" is the most plausible.

Perhaps ""JAZZY"" but not starting with T.

So I will guess ""TATTY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T A T T Y.

And it is a valid English word.

Therefore, next guess: ""TATTY""Based on the feedback:

- **Pattern**: Secret word is `T A _ _ Y` (T at 1, A at 2, Y at 5).
- **Excluded letters**: B, C, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.
- **Available letters for positions 3 and 4**: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly T, since it's already in the word but could repeat).

### Analysis:
- Common words like ""TACKY"", ""TARDY"", ""TAWNY"" are invalid due to excluded letters.
- ""TAFFY"" was already guessed and ruled out (F absent).
- **""TATTY""** is a valid word (meaning shabby or cheap) that fits:
  - `T` at position 1 (known), `A` at 2 (known), `T` at 3 and 4 (new positions), `Y` at 5 (known).
- No other common words fit the pattern with available letters.

### Conclusion:
""TATTY"" is the most plausible guess given the constraints. If correct, it will solve the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on the repeated `T` will help narrow down further.

<guess>tatty</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Word Pattern**:  
   - Feedback from Guess 4 (""taffy"") confirms:  
     - **T(✓)**: `T` is correct and in position 1.  
     - **A(✓)**: `A` is correct and in position 2 (already known).  
     - **F(x)**: `F` is absent (both instances).  
     - **Y(✓)**: `Y` is correct and in position 5.  
   - Thus, the secret word is `T A _ _ Y`.  
   - Positions 3 and 4 are unknown.

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback:  
     - Guess 1: C, R, N, E absent.  
     - Guess 2: B, I, L, S absent.  
     - Guess 3: G, M, U absent.  
     - Guess 4: F absent.  
   - **Total excluded**: B, C, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, R, S, U.  
   - **Available letters for positions 3–4**: D, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and `T`, which is already in the word but could repeat).

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:  
   - The word must start with `T`, end with `Y`, and have `A` in position 2.  
   - Common words like ""TACKY"" (C excluded), ""TARDY"" (R excluded), or ""TAWNY"" (N excluded) are invalid.  
   - ""TAFFY"" was already guessed and ruled out (F absent).  
   - **""TATTY""** is a valid English word (meaning shabby or worn out) that fits:  
     - `T` at position 1 (known),  
     - `A` at position 2 (known),  
     - `T` at positions 3 and 4 (testing for `T` repeats),  
     - `Y` at position 5 (known).  
   - No other common words fit the pattern with available letters (e.g., ""TAPPY"" is obscure, ""TAXOY"" is invalid).

4. **Why ""TATTY""?**  
   - Tests if `T` repeats in positions 3–4 (plausible since `T` is already confirmed).  
   - Uses no excluded letters.  
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on `T` in positions 3–4 will pinpoint the solution.",Guess 5: tatty -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
