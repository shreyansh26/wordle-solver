We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since we don't have any information, a good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters. 
Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has common letters and covers a lot.

But note that the problem says: valid 5-letter English word.

I recall that ""SLATE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might also be good.

However, for the sake of beginning, I'll choose ""SLATE"".

So the first guess will be ""SLATE"".

Therefore, we return:

I am starting the Wordle-like game without prior information. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. Ideal starting words often include frequent letters like vowels (A, E, I, O) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A balanced choice is ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, L, T).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It covers positions broadly (S in first position, E in last).

This will help me gather feedback efficiently to deduce the secret word in subsequent guesses.

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"": S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - Only 'A' is in the correct position. So the secret word has 'A' as the third letter (since A is the third letter in ""slate"").
   - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all (since they are marked as 'x').

 Therefore, we know:
   - The third letter of the secret word is 'A'.
   - The secret word does not contain S, L, T, E.

 Since we have one letter fixed (A in position 3), and we know four letters that are not in the word (S, L, T, E), we can choose a second guess that:
   - Has 'A' in the third position.
   - Avoids the letters S, L, T, E.
   - Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

 Let me think of common English letters that we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, X, Y, etc.

 We have 6 positions to fill: _ _ A _ _

 We should aim for a word that has:
   - Letters that haven't been ruled out and are common.
   - Distinct letters where possible to maximize information.

 Words to consider: The word must have 'A' in the middle. Some examples:

   - ""CRAWL"" -> but avoid L (we know L is not in the word) and W might be uncommon? Also, L is ruled out.
   - ""BRAIN"" -> B, R, A, I, N: avoids S,L,T,E. Has common letters: B, R, I, N. And A in third position.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A is correct and in position, but also that the other letters are not present. So we must exclude S,L,T,E.

 Another word: ""CHAMP"" -> but has M and P, and avoids bad letters? Also, A in third? C H A M P -> third letter is A. But M and P are less common? 

 Also note: We don't know if the word has double letters? But we can assume not for now.

 Let's try to list words that have A in the third position and don't contain S,L,T,E.

 Some possibilities:
   - ""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> but note: third letter is actually G? Because positions: 1:O, 2:R, 3:G -> so no, not A in third? Wait, in ""ORGAN"" the third letter is G? We need the third letter to be A.

 Let me recall: In ""slate"", positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E.

 So we need a word where the third letter is A. Examples of words with A as the third letter:

   - ""TRAIN"" -> but has T (which we know is not in the word) -> so invalid because T is excluded.
   - ""BRAIN"": as I thought earlier -> B R A I N -> third letter is A. Letters: B, R, A, I, N. None of B,R,I,N are excluded? We haven't ruled out any of these.

   So ""BRAIN"" seems like a good candidate.

   But what about other words? 

   - ""CRANE"": has E (which is excluded) and the third letter is A? Wait: C R A N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A -> third is A, but E is at the end and we know E is not in the word.

   Alternatively: 
   - ""CHAMP"" -> C H A M P: third letter is A. But H, M, P are possible? However, CHAMP is a word.

   But ""BRAIN"" is more common? And we are covering R in position 2? Also, we get to see if B is in the word? 

   Another word: ""GRAIN"": G R A I N -> also avoids extra letters. But G isn't as common as B? 

   However, note we need to avoid S,L,T,E. ""BRAIN"" does that.

 Another common word: ""DRAIN"" -> D R A I N. Similarly, avoids excluded letters.

 But let me think about the most common consonants: R is very common. We haven't tested R, so placing R in the second position might be good? Also, testing I and N.

 Since we don't have any other constraints, let's go with ""BRAIN"". Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't use R in case it's not in the word? But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Given the constraints, ""BRAIN"" seems reasonable.

 Therefore, second guess: ""BRAIN""

 Format: <guess>brain</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback for ""slate"":
- Only the letter 'A' is correct and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- Letters S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word must:
- Have 'A' as the 3rd letter: \_ \_ A \_ \_
- **Exclude** the letters S, L, T, and E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Prioritize words with 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Use new, common letters to gather more information (e.g., consonants like B, R, N or vowels like I, O).
- Avoid repeating excluded letters.

A strong candidate is **""BRAIN""**:
- Puts 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Tests new high-frequency letters: B, R, I, N.

Has common letters: B, R, I, N. And A in third position.\n\n However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A is correct and in position, but also that the other letters are not present. So we must exclude S,L,T,E.\n\n Another word: ""CHAMP"" -> but has M and P, and avoids bad letters? Also, A in third? C H A M P -> third letter is A. But M and P are less common? \n\n Also note: We don\'t know if the word has double letters?

Because positions: 1:O, 2:R, 3:G -> so no, not A in third? Wait, in ""ORGAN"" the third letter is G? We need the third letter to be A.\n\n Let me recall: In ""slate"", positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E.\n\n So we need a word where the third letter is A. Examples of words with A as the third letter:\n\n   - ""TRAIN"" -> but has T (which we know is not in the word) -> so invalid because T is excluded.\n   - ""BRAIN"": as I thought earlier -> B R A I N -> third letter is A. Letters: B, R, A, I, N. None of B,R,I,N are excluded? We haven\'t ruled out any of these.\n\n   So ""BRAIN"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n   But what about other words? \n\n   - ""CRANE"": has E (which is excluded) and the third letter is A? Wait: C R A N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A -> third is A, but E is at the end and we know E is not in the word.\n\n   Alternatively: \n   - ""CHAMP"" -> C H A M P: third letter is A. But H, M, P are possible? However, CHAMP is a word.\n\n   But ""BRAIN"" is more common? And we are covering R in position 2? Also, we get to see if B is in the word? \n\n   Another word: ""GRAIN"": G R A I N -> also avoids extra letters. But G isn\'t as common as B? \n\n   However, note we need to avoid S,L,T,E. ""BRAIN"" does that.\n\n Another common word: ""DRAIN"" -> D R A I N. Similarly, avoids excluded letters.\n\n But let me think about the most common consonants: R is very common. We haven\'t tested R, so placing R in the second position might be good? Also, testing I and N.\n\n Since we don\'t have any other constraints, let\'s go with ""BRAIN"". Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t use R in case it\'s not in the word?

We are given two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: ""slate"" -> S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(x)
Second guess: ""brain"" -> B(x), R(✓), A(✓), I(x), N(x)

From the feedback:

1. For ""slate"":
   - A is correct and in the correct position (third letter). So the secret word has A as the third letter: _ _ A _ _
   - S, L, T, E are not in the word at all. So the secret word does not contain S, L, T, or E.

2. For ""brain"":
   - R is correct and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R A _ _
   - A is still correct and in position (third letter), as we knew.
   - B, I, N are not in the word. Since B is marked as 'x', and I and N are 'x', so the secret word does not contain B, I, or N.

Combining the information from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word is of the form: _ R A _ _
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, B, I, N. Therefore, we should avoid these letters.

We need to find a 5-letter English word that starts with an unknown letter, then 'R', then 'A', then two more letters. The constraints on the letters we can use:

Available letters: given we avoid S,L,T,E,B,I,N, we must choose from the remaining alphabet.

The remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have two letters to find: the first letter and the last two letters? Actually, the positions:

Position 1: unknown letter (from available set)
Position 4: unknown letter (from available set)
Position 5: unknown letter (from available set)

But note: we don't know if there are repeated letters? However, from the words guessed, we haven't seen repeats yet.

We need a word: [letter not in {S,L,T,E,B,I,N}] R A [two more letters not in that set] 

Let's list possible words that match the pattern: _ R A _ _

We can try to think of common words:

Examples:
- ""CRAFT"" -> but has F? And T is excluded? We know T is excluded, so if ""craft"" has T and T is excluded -> invalid.
- ""GRAND"" -> R is fixed, A is fixed; position1: G, position4: N? But N is excluded? We know from guess2 that N is not in the word -> so invalid.
- ""CRANE"" -> E is excluded -> invalid.

What about:
- ""DRAFT"" -> has T -> excluded -> no.
- ""GRAPE"" -> has E -> excluded -> no.

We need to avoid: S,L,T,E,B,I,N.

So what words are possible?

Let me try:

- ""CRAWL"" -> but L is excluded -> no.
- ""CRAZE"" -> E excluded -> no.

Maybe less common words? We might need to use the available letters.

Options for the last two positions: from the available letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, the first position: same set.

Possible words:

- ""TRACK"" -> but T is excluded -> no.

Wait, what about ""FRAME""? But M? And E excluded? E is excluded -> no.

Another idea: ""GRAPE"" -> G R A P E -> but E excluded -> invalid.

What about ""CRAMP""? C R A M P -> letters: C, M, P. Are these allowed? Yes, they are not excluded.

But is it a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""CHARM"": C R A M? Wait, positions: C H A R M -> no, because the second letter is H, but we need second letter to be R. In our word the second letter is R? 

""CHARM"": positions: 1: C, 2: H -> that's not R. We need the second letter to be R.

So we require the word to be: ? R A ? ?

So: first letter in {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}; fourth and fifth similarly.

Let me list some words:

- ""DRAGON"" -> too long? 5-letter? No, ""DRAGON"" is 6 letters. Not valid.

How about:

- ""CRACK"" -> C R A C K -> but double C? And note: position4: C, position5: K. But C is used twice? We don't know if the word allows repetition? But we can check.

But ""CRACK"" is a word? Yes, however it has two C's? And K? It's 5 letters: C-R-A-C-K -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:C, 5:K.

Is that acceptable? We don't have any rule against repeated letters? But in Wordle, repeated letters are allowed? However, in our feedback we haven't encountered any.

But we must note: the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

Alternatively, without repetition: 

Let me think:

- ""CRAFT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.
- ""DRAFT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.
- ""GRASP"" -> S excluded -> invalid.
- ""WRAP"" -> too short? We need 5 letters -> ""WRAPT"" maybe? But T excluded -> invalid.

Perhaps: 

- ""CRUMB"" -> but has B? B is excluded -> invalid.
- ""CRAMP"" -> C R A M P -> yes! No excluded letters? Letters: C, R, A, M, P. C, M, P are not excluded? R and A we know are in but M and P we haven't tested.

Is that a word? Yes: cramp (muscle contraction).

Another: ""CHARM"" -> no, because second letter must be R, so it's position2 that is fixed? Wait no, the word must have the second letter as R? Which ""CHARM"" has H as second? So no.

But ""CRAZE"" -> E excluded -> no.

""FRAY"" not 5 letters.

""ORATE"" -> O R A T E -> T excluded -> invalid.

""URBAN"" -> has B and N -> excluded -> invalid.

So back to ""CRAMP"": C R A M P.

But note: we are guessing so far with distinct letters? However, it's not necessary? We can guess words with repeated letters? But in this case, ""CRAMP"" is distinct? C,R,A,M,P are all distinct? Also, it avoids excluded letters: let's check: not S, L, T, E, B, I, or N.

So it's valid.

Another possibility: ""CRABS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

""CRANK"" -> N excluded -> invalid.

""TRAMP"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

So ""CRAMP"" seems a candidate.

Also, ""DRAWL"" -> L excluded -> invalid.

So perhaps ""CRAMP"" and ""CRAWL"" (invalid) but we have few options.

Another word: ""GRAM"" is 4 letters? So not.

""TRAWL"" -> T and L excluded.

So I think ""CRAMP"" is a solid guess.

Alternatively, we can consider ""GRAPE"" but E excluded -> no.

Or ""CRATE"" -> T excluded -> no.

So let's go with ""CRAMP"" as the third guess.

But note: we are testing common letters: C, M, P.

Also, note that the word pattern is: ? R A ? ? -> and with CRAMP: positions: C (1), R (2), A (3), M (4), P (5).

This will give us feedback on C, M, P? And whether any are in the word? And if so, correct position? Since position 1,4,5 are new.

Therefore, we return:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since we don't have any information, a good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters. 
Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has common letters and covers a lot.

But note that the problem says: valid 5-letter English word.

I recall that ""SLATE"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might also be good.

However, for the sake of beginning, I'll choose ""SLATE"".

So the first guess will be ""SLATE"".

Therefore, we return:

<guess>slate</guess>I am starting the Wordle-like game without prior information. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. Ideal starting words often include frequent letters like vowels (A, E, I, O) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A balanced choice is ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, L, T).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It covers positions broadly (S in first position, E in last).

This will help me gather feedback efficiently to deduce the secret word in subsequent guesses.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""slate"": S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - Only 'A' is in the correct position. So the secret word has 'A' as the third letter (since A is the third letter in ""slate"").
   - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all (since they are marked as 'x').

 Therefore, we know:
   - The third letter of the secret word is 'A'.
   - The secret word does not contain S, L, T, E.

 Since we have one letter fixed (A in position 3), and we know four letters that are not in the word (S, L, T, E), we can choose a second guess that:
   - Has 'A' in the third position.
   - Avoids the letters S, L, T, E.
   - Introduces new common letters to gather more information.

 Let me think of common English letters that we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, X, Y, etc.

 We have 6 positions to fill: _ _ A _ _

 We should aim for a word that has:
   - Letters that haven't been ruled out and are common.
   - Distinct letters where possible to maximize information.

 Words to consider: The word must have 'A' in the middle. Some examples:

   - ""CRAWL"" -> but avoid L (we know L is not in the word) and W might be uncommon? Also, L is ruled out.
   - ""BRAIN"" -> B, R, A, I, N: avoids S,L,T,E. Has common letters: B, R, I, N. And A in third position.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A is correct and in position, but also that the other letters are not present. So we must exclude S,L,T,E.

 Another word: ""CHAMP"" -> but has M and P, and avoids bad letters? Also, A in third? C H A M P -> third letter is A. But M and P are less common? 

 Also note: We don't know if the word has double letters? But we can assume not for now.

 Let's try to list words that have A in the third position and don't contain S,L,T,E.

 Some possibilities:
   - ""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> but note: third letter is actually G? Because positions: 1:O, 2:R, 3:G -> so no, not A in third? Wait, in ""ORGAN"" the third letter is G? We need the third letter to be A.

 Let me recall: In ""slate"", positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E.

 So we need a word where the third letter is A. Examples of words with A as the third letter:

   - ""TRAIN"" -> but has T (which we know is not in the word) -> so invalid because T is excluded.
   - ""BRAIN"": as I thought earlier -> B R A I N -> third letter is A. Letters: B, R, A, I, N. None of B,R,I,N are excluded? We haven't ruled out any of these.

   So ""BRAIN"" seems like a good candidate.

   But what about other words? 

   - ""CRANE"": has E (which is excluded) and the third letter is A? Wait: C R A N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A -> third is A, but E is at the end and we know E is not in the word.

   Alternatively: 
   - ""CHAMP"" -> C H A M P: third letter is A. But H, M, P are possible? However, CHAMP is a word.

   But ""BRAIN"" is more common? And we are covering R in position 2? Also, we get to see if B is in the word? 

   Another word: ""GRAIN"": G R A I N -> also avoids extra letters. But G isn't as common as B? 

   However, note we need to avoid S,L,T,E. ""BRAIN"" does that.

 Another common word: ""DRAIN"" -> D R A I N. Similarly, avoids excluded letters.

 But let me think about the most common consonants: R is very common. We haven't tested R, so placing R in the second position might be good? Also, testing I and N.

 Since we don't have any other constraints, let's go with ""BRAIN"". Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't use R in case it's not in the word? But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Given the constraints, ""BRAIN"" seems reasonable.

 Therefore, second guess: ""BRAIN""

 Format: <guess>brain</guess>Based on the feedback for ""slate"":
- Only the letter 'A' is correct and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- Letters S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word must:
- Have 'A' as the 3rd letter: \_ \_ A \_ \_
- **Exclude** the letters S, L, T, and E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Prioritize words with 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Use new, common letters to gather more information (e.g., consonants like B, R, N or vowels like I, O).
- Avoid repeating excluded letters.

A strong candidate is **""BRAIN""**:
- Puts 'A' in the 3rd position.
- Tests new high-frequency letters: B, R, I, N.
- Avoids S, L, T, E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brain -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: ""slate"" -> S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(x)
Second guess: ""brain"" -> B(x), R(✓), A(✓), I(x), N(x)

From the feedback:

1. For ""slate"":
   - A is correct and in the correct position (third letter). So the secret word has A as the third letter: _ _ A _ _
   - S, L, T, E are not in the word at all. So the secret word does not contain S, L, T, or E.

2. For ""brain"":
   - R is correct and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has R as the second letter: _ R A _ _
   - A is still correct and in position (third letter), as we knew.
   - B, I, N are not in the word. Since B is marked as 'x', and I and N are 'x', so the secret word does not contain B, I, or N.

Combining the information from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word is of the form: _ R A _ _
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, B, I, N. Therefore, we should avoid these letters.

We need to find a 5-letter English word that starts with an unknown letter, then 'R', then 'A', then two more letters. The constraints on the letters we can use:

Available letters: given we avoid S,L,T,E,B,I,N, we must choose from the remaining alphabet.

The remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have two letters to find: the first letter and the last two letters? Actually, the positions:

Position 1: unknown letter (from available set)
Position 4: unknown letter (from available set)
Position 5: unknown letter (from available set)

But note: we don't know if there are repeated letters? However, from the words guessed, we haven't seen repeats yet.

We need a word: [letter not in {S,L,T,E,B,I,N}] R A [two more letters not in that set] 

Let's list possible words that match the pattern: _ R A _ _

We can try to think of common words:

Examples:
- ""CRAFT"" -> but has F? And T is excluded? We know T is excluded, so if ""craft"" has T and T is excluded -> invalid.
- ""GRAND"" -> R is fixed, A is fixed; position1: G, position4: N? But N is excluded? We know from guess2 that N is not in the word -> so invalid.
- ""CRANE"" -> E is excluded -> invalid.

What about:
- ""DRAFT"" -> has T -> excluded -> no.
- ""GRAPE"" -> has E -> excluded -> no.

We need to avoid: S,L,T,E,B,I,N.

So what words are possible?

Let me try:

- ""CRAWL"" -> but L is excluded -> no.
- ""CRAZE"" -> E excluded -> no.

Maybe less common words? We might need to use the available letters.

Options for the last two positions: from the available letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, the first position: same set.

Possible words:

- ""TRACK"" -> but T is excluded -> no.

Wait, what about ""FRAME""? But M? And E excluded? E is excluded -> no.

Another idea: ""GRAPE"" -> G R A P E -> but E excluded -> invalid.

What about ""CRAMP""? C R A M P -> letters: C, M, P. Are these allowed? Yes, they are not excluded.

But is it a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""CHARM"": C R A M? Wait, positions: C H A R M -> no, because the second letter is H, but we need second letter to be R. In our word the second letter is R? 

""CHARM"": positions: 1: C, 2: H -> that's not R. We need the second letter to be R.

So we require the word to be: ? R A ? ?

So: first letter in {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}; fourth and fifth similarly.

Let me list some words:

- ""DRAGON"" -> too long? 5-letter? No, ""DRAGON"" is 6 letters. Not valid.

How about:

- ""CRACK"" -> C R A C K -> but double C? And note: position4: C, position5: K. But C is used twice? We don't know if the word allows repetition? But we can check.

But ""CRACK"" is a word? Yes, however it has two C's? And K? It's 5 letters: C-R-A-C-K -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:C, 5:K.

Is that acceptable? We don't have any rule against repeated letters? But in Wordle, repeated letters are allowed? However, in our feedback we haven't encountered any.

But we must note: the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

Alternatively, without repetition: 

Let me think:

- ""CRAFT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.
- ""DRAFT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.
- ""GRASP"" -> S excluded -> invalid.
- ""WRAP"" -> too short? We need 5 letters -> ""WRAPT"" maybe? But T excluded -> invalid.

Perhaps: 

- ""CRUMB"" -> but has B? B is excluded -> invalid.
- ""CRAMP"" -> C R A M P -> yes! No excluded letters? Letters: C, R, A, M, P. C, M, P are not excluded? R and A we know are in but M and P we haven't tested.

Is that a word? Yes: cramp (muscle contraction).

Another: ""CHARM"" -> no, because second letter must be R, so it's position2 that is fixed? Wait no, the word must have the second letter as R? Which ""CHARM"" has H as second? So no.

But ""CRAZE"" -> E excluded -> no.

""FRAY"" not 5 letters.

""ORATE"" -> O R A T E -> T excluded -> invalid.

""URBAN"" -> has B and N -> excluded -> invalid.

So back to ""CRAMP"": C R A M P.

But note: we are guessing so far with distinct letters? However, it's not necessary? We can guess words with repeated letters? But in this case, ""CRAMP"" is distinct? C,R,A,M,P are all distinct? Also, it avoids excluded letters: let's check: not S, L, T, E, B, I, or N.

So it's valid.

Another possibility: ""CRABS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

""CRANK"" -> N excluded -> invalid.

""TRAMP"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

So ""CRAMP"" seems a candidate.

Also, ""DRAWL"" -> L excluded -> invalid.

So perhaps ""CRAMP"" and ""CRAWL"" (invalid) but we have few options.

Another word: ""GRAM"" is 4 letters? So not.

""TRAWL"" -> T and L excluded.

So I think ""CRAMP"" is a solid guess.

Alternatively, we can consider ""GRAPE"" but E excluded -> no.

Or ""CRATE"" -> T excluded -> no.

So let's go with ""CRAMP"" as the third guess.

But note: we are testing common letters: C, M, P.

Also, note that the word pattern is: ? R A ? ? -> and with CRAMP: positions: C (1), R (2), A (3), M (4), P (5).

This will give us feedback on C, M, P? And whether any are in the word? And if so, correct position? Since position 1,4,5 are new.

Therefore, we return:

<guess>cramp</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""slate""** → Feedback: S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(x)  
  This indicates:
  - A is in the 3rd position (correct, fixed).
  - S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.
  - Secret word pattern: \_ \_ A \_ \_

- **Guess 2: ""brain""** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), A(✓), I(x), N(x)  
  This adds:
  - R is in the 2nd position (correct, fixed).
  - B, I, N are **not** in the secret word.
  - Updated pattern: \_ R A \_ \_

**Inferences**:
- Secret word format: [Letter 1] ""R"" ""A"" [Letter 4] [Letter 5].
- Excluded letters (not in word): S, L, T, E, B, I, N.
- Possible letters for positions 1,4,5: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc. (any letter not excluded).

**Strategy for Guess 3**:
- Focus on words fitting \_ R A \_ \_ with unused, common letters.
- Prioritize testing frequent consonants (e.g., C, M, P, D, G) to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters (S,L,T,E,B,I,N) and word patterns inconsistent with feedback.

A strong candidate is **""CRAMP""**:
- Fits the pattern: C (position 1) R (position 2) A (position 3) M (position 4) P (position 5).
- Tests new letters: C, M, P (all common and informative).
- Valid English word, adhering to rules.

Yes: cramp (muscle contraction).\n\nAnother: ""CHARM"" -> no, because second letter must be R, so it\'s position2 that is fixed? Wait no, the word must have the second letter as R? Which ""CHARM"" has H as second? So no.\n\nBut ""CRAZE"" -> E excluded -> no.\n\n""FRAY"" not 5 letters.\n\n""ORATE"" -> O R A T E -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n""URBAN"" -> has B and N -> excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo back to ""CRAMP"": C R A M P.\n\nBut note: we are guessing so far with distinct letters? However, it\'s not necessary? We can guess words with repeated letters? But in this case, ""CRAMP"" is distinct? C,R,A,M,P are all distinct? Also, it avoids excluded letters: let\'s check: not S, L, T, E, B, I, or N.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CRABS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""CRANK"" -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TRAMP"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo ""CRAMP"" seems a candidate.\n\nAlso, ""DRAWL"" -> L excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps ""CRAMP"" and ""CRAWL"" (invalid) but we have few options.\n\nAnother word: ""GRAM"" is 4 letters? So not.\n\n""TRAWL"" -> T and L excluded.\n\nSo I think ""CRAMP"" is a solid guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider ""GRAPE"" but E excluded -> no.\n\nOr ""CRATE"" -> T excluded -> no.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CRAMP"" as the third guess.\n\nBut note: we are testing common letters: C, M, P.\n\nAlso, note that the word pattern is: ?

We are given the feedback for guess 3: ""cramp"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(✓) M(✓) P(x)
This tells us:
- C is not in the word at all (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- M is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter). This is new information.
- P is not in the word at all (x).

Therefore, we now know the secret word has:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: M
And the first letter and last letter are unknown.
Pattern: ? R A M ?

Also, from previous guesses, we have excluded letters: S,L,T,E,B,I,N,C,P.

We know the secret word does not contain: S, L, T, E, B, I, N, C, P.

This leaves us with available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note that we didn't have any feedback suggesting repeated letters? However, since we are getting position specific feedback, we assume no repetition for now? Wait, but possible? But we haven't encountered any double letters yet? And the pattern ? R A M ? - no indication of doubles? But cannot rule out.

However, from the fixed pattern: positions 2,3,4 are R, A, M. So we need to fill position 1 and 5.

Now, what English words have the form: ? R A M ?

Let me think of common words:

- ""DRAMA"" - has D, A? Let's see: 
  - D in position1, R in2, A in3, M in4, A in5? But we have A in position5? Also, the word ""DRAMA"" has two A's? And we know A is in the word (from first guess) but only fixed at position3.

But note: if the secret word is ""DRAMA"", then:
- For guess2: ""brain"" - B (x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) - correct? And I and N are not in the word? In ""drama"", no I or N? So okay.
- For guess3: ""cramp"" - C(x) R(✓) A(✓) M(✓) P(x) - correct? P is not in ""drama""? And C is not? So okay.

But wait, we haven't guessed any double A? So it's possible? And we haven't got feedback about extra A? That's because we didn't have a second A in any guess? But in the secret word? We have to see.

However, we previously excluded E? And note: in ""DRAMA"", letter D? Is D excluded? No, we haven't excluded D? It's still possible.

But what about the first letter? We must double-check: the pattern is ? R A M ? -> so for ""DRAMA"": D, R, A, M, A -> so position5 is A.

But in the feedback for guess1: ""slate"" had A(✓) at position3? That doesn't affect A appearing elsewhere? Unless? In Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and we guess it only once? Then the feedback might not indicate the extra repetition? But here, from the feedback, we know that A is at position3? But what about another A? We haven't been told about it? Because we haven't guessed a word with A at position5? So it might be possible?

But we also have to consider: in the second guess, ""brain"" had A at position3? And feedback A(✓). So the secret word has an A at position3? But it might have another A? That is possible? Because the feedback for ""brain"" doesn't say anything about other A's? And in this case, position5 A in the secret word? We didn't have any guess that had A at position5? So we wouldn't know? So it's possible.

But let's look at the feedback: for guess3: ""cramp"" had A at position3? Which is correct? And M at position4? Correct? But if the secret word is ""DRAMA"", then position5 is A? Which we haven't guessed? So in guess3, P at position5? Which is not in the word? So marked as x? Correct.

But also: in the secret word, there is an A at position5? We haven't tested that position? So we need to test for a word that has the correct pattern and then see.

Wait, but we now know: the secret word is: first letter? R A M last letter? And we know that position5 is an unknown letter? And we don't know if it can be A? Because position3 is A? So two A's are possible? For example, words like ""drama"" are common? Also, ""llama"" but L is excluded? We had L excluded? So ""llama"" has L? Not allowed? So ""drama"" is possible.

But let's see: what other words? 

Another word: ""GRAM"" is 4 letters? No? Or ""GRAMA"" - not a word? 

""FRAME"" -> E excluded? And also F? But in ""frame"", positions: F R A M E -> but we have E excluded? So invalid? Because E is not allowed? And we know E is excluded.

Another: ""ORAMA"" ? Wait, is that a word? Not in English.

""CRAMS"" -> S excluded -> invalid? And also C and P excluded? Oh C is excluded? So we cannot use C? Since from guess3: C is not in the word.

Similarly, P is excluded? So P cannot be in position5? Or anywhere? Because of P(x) in guess3.

From the feedback, C was guessed in position1? And marked x? So C is not in the word? And P at position5? Marked x? Not in the word? So exclude C and P.

Therefore, available letters for position1 and 5: D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But now, the word must be of the form: ? R A M ? 

Possibilities:

- ""DRAM"": too short? Not 5 letters? No? ""DRAM"" is 4.
- ""DRAMS"": S excluded -> invalid.
- ""FRAME"": E excluded -> invalid.
- ""GRAMS"": S excluded -> invalid.
- ""CRAM"" is 4 letters.

What about: ""DREAM""? No, E excluded? And also positions: D R E A M -> third letter is E? We need third letter A? So not.

Wait: we need third letter A? Our word must be: [1]RA[M][5] -> as above.

I think ""drama"" is the only common word that fits? Are there others?

""GRAMO""? Not a word.

So perhaps ""drama""? But let's double-check:

- Pattern: D R A M A -> positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> yes.

Letters: D, R, A, M, A? Excluded: S,L,T,E,B,I,N,C,P? Notice D, R, A, M? R and A and M are known? D is new? And A repeated? But we haven't tested multiple A? But it's a valid English word.

Alternatively, are there any other words? 

- ""WRAM"" not 5 letters.

Or ""KRAM""? Not a word.

""GRAMY""? Not common? Or ""ORAMA"" not English.

So I think ""drama"" is a candidate? But note: we haven't guessed A at position5? Also, we haven't excluded D? So it's possible? Alternatively, we can choose a word that has different letter at position1 and position5 to test? But we have limited tries? Since we only have 6 tries? And we are on guess3? Wait, no: we are making the fourth guess? We have two guesses after this? But we should try to solve it.

But consider: if we guess ""drama"", then if it's correct? We win? Else, we get feedback? So that seems efficient? Because it matches the known pattern: R A M fixed? And positions? And known letters? So let me list:

Letters known: R, A, M? But A is fixed? And R fixed? M fixed? Then position1 is D? And position5 is A? But we know A is in the word? And if there is another A? Then it's possible? But we haven't tested A at position5? So feedback for ""drama"" would tell us? 

We can also consider? Since we have a specific pattern? What other word? 

How about ""HARAM""? H A R A M -> no? Because positions must be: 1: H, 2: A? But we need position2 to be R? So no? Because R is fixed at position2? So the word must start with ? then R at second? So first letter any? Then R at second? Then A at third? Then M at fourth? Then last letter?

So ""drama"" seems the only common word? I think?

Another possibility: ""GRAM"" is not 5? ""GRAMA"" is not a word? Or ""TRAMS"", S excluded and T excluded? And T is excluded? So no?

Therefore, we should guess ""drama"".

But note: We have excluded C and P? And D is still possible? So let's go with ""drama"".

Therefore, guess4: ""drama""

Output: <guess>drama</guess>?

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""slate""** → A is in the 3rd position (✓), and S, L, T, E are excluded (x).
- **Guess 2: ""brain""** → R is in the 2nd position (✓), A is in the 3rd position (✓), and B, I, N are excluded (x).

The only common English word matching this pattern is **""DRAMA""**:
- Positions: D (1), R (2), A (3), M (4), A (5).
- Letters tested: D (new), and a second A (which has not been tested in position 5 before, but A is already confirmed at position 3).
- Validates constraints: No excluded letters used.

Guessing ""DRAMA"" tests position 1 (D), position 5 (A), and confirms if there is a second A (allowed by Wordle rules).
