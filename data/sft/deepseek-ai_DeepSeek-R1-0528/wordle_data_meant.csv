We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

First, the previous feedback was for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(-).

Breaking that down:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so A is the second letter? No, let's check the positions.

""crane"" is five letters: C-R-A-N-E
Positions:
1. C: x (not in word)
2. R: x (not in word)
3. A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A
4. N: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is N
5. E: - (in word but wrong position) → so E is somewhere else, not in position 5.

Therefore:
- The secret word has A as the third letter and N as the fourth letter.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C and R are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must have the form: _ _ A N _
And it contains E, but not at the end. Since positions are 1-based: letter 3 is A, letter 4 is N, and E is in the word but not position 5.

Possible positions for E: it could be position 1 or 2, since position 5 is ruled out by the feedback.

Now, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that fits this information.

Constraints:
- Contains E (because E is in the word, just not in position 5)
- Does not contain C or R (since they are marked 'x', not present)
- Third letter must be A
- Fourth letter must be N

So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _

And E must be in position 1 or 2, because if it were in position 1 or 2, it would be wrong position since A and N are fixed in 3 and 4, and E can't be 5.

Position 5 is the last one, and E was in position 5 and marked '-', meaning E is in the word but position 5 is incorrect, so E must be in position 1 or 2 in the secret word.

For example, the secret word could be like ""E _ A N _"" or ""_ E A N _"", but since E is not in position 5, and positions 3 and 4 are fixed.

Now, I need to think of valid 5-letter words that fit: ? ? A N ?

And contain E in either first or second position.

Also, must not have C or R.

Let me list possible words.

First, with E in position 1: E ? A N ?

What can be in position 2? It has to be a letter, not C or R, and forming a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""BEAN"" – but ""BEAN"" is 4 letters, need 5-letter word. ""BEANS"" but that's 5 letters ending with S, but position 5 is ?, not necessarily S.

""BEANS"" would be positions: B-E-A-N-S

But in our case, pattern is _ _ A N _, so for ""BEANS"": position 1=B, 2=E, 3=A, 4=N, 5=S.

But E is in position 2, which might be wrong position? Feedback for E in ""crane"" was position 5 marked '-', meaning E is in word but not position 5, so position 2 could be possible if it's not correct.

In ""BEANS"", E is position 2, which is not position 5, so it could be valid. But let's see if it fits the A and N positions.

In ""BEANS"", position 3=A and position 4=N, perfect.

But C and R not present, good.

E is present, and in position 2.

Now, with E in position 1: E ? A N ?

Possible words:
- ""DEAN"" – 4 letters, not 5.
- ""DEANA"" – not a word.
- Common words: like ""LEAN"", but 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""MEAN"" is 4, add something.

""MEANS"": M-E-A-N-S → positions:1=M,2=E,3=A,4=N,5=S → so E in position 2.

Similarly, ""WEANS""? Not common, ""wizardry""? No.

Better to think of words ending with ""AN"" but since position 4 is N, position 3 is A, so words with ""AN"" in positions 3-4.

Position 3 and 4: A and N, so substring ""AN"" fixed.

So the word is X Y A N Z.

Now, E must be X or Y, since it can't be Z (position 5).

Therefore, possibilities:
Case 1: E in position 1 (X=E): so word is E Y A N Z

Valid words: 
- ""BEANS"" : E in position 2? ""B E A N S"" → position 1=B, position 2=E → E is position 2, not 1.
For position 1=E: E _ A N _

Examples: ""ELAND"" E-L-A-N-D → positions:1=E,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=D
""Eland"" is a word, meaning a type of antelope.

Also, ""EVANS"" but that's a name, might not be accepted.

Common words: ""MEANS"" has E in position 2.

For position 1=E: other words: ""EXAM"" is not 5, ""EXAMS"" is E-X-A-M-S, A and N not positioned; we need A at position 3, N at position 4.

So the word must have A at 3 and N at 4.

Words like: ""ELAND"", ""EKING"" E-K-I-N-G not A and N.

""EKING"" has I and N, not A and N.

Only specific words.

""URBAN"" U-R-B-A-N → position 3=B, position 4=A? No.

We need position 3=A, position 4=N.

So: ? ? A N ?

Better to search for words ending with ""?"" but fixed letters.

Possible 5-letter words with A as third letter and N as fourth letter:

- Words like ""PLANE"" P-L-A-N-E → but E at position 5, which is forbidden? Not forbidden but E cannot be in position 5 per feedback.

In ""PLANE"": positions:1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=E → E at position 5.

But feedback said E is not in position 5 for the secret word, so ""PLANE"" has E at position 5, but since E cannot be there, this word is invalid for the secret? Actually, in feedback, E(5) was marked '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position, so if secret word had E at position 5, it would be correct and marked ✓, but it's marked ' - ' so position is incorrect, so E cannot be position 5 in secret. Thus, any word with E at position 5 is not possible.

Similarly, for our guess, we avoid placing E at position 5.

Back to possibilities.

Case 1: E in position 1: word must be E ? A N ?

Valid English words: 
- ""ELAND"" (E-L-A-N-D)
- ""EVANS"" not common, dictionary word? Sometimes accepted.
- ""ECRUS""? Not a word.
- ""EDANA""? No.

""Means"" is M-E-A-N-S, E in position 2.

For E position 1, hard to find.

""DIANE"" D-I-A-N-E → positions:1=D,2=I,3=A,4=N,5=E → but E at position 5, which is not allowed.

Unless position 5 isn't E.

Another word: ""OCTAN"" not; ""URBAN"" doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""ELANS""? ""Elan"" can be considered, with S? ""Elans"" is not a standard word, ""elan"" means enthusiasm, but plural uncertain.

Better to consider E in position 2.

Case 2: E in position 2: word is ? E A N ?

So position 1: ?, position 2: E, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: ?

Valid words:
- ""BEANS"" - B-E-A-N-S
- ""JEANS"" - J-E-A-N-S
- ""LEANS"" - L-E-A-N-S
- ""MEANS"" - M-E-A-N-S
- ""WEANS"" - not common, wean means to accustom, but ""wean"" is 4 letters; ""weans"" could be verb form but may not be accepted; usually avoid obscure words.
- ""DEANS"" - D-E-A-N-S
- ""PEANS"" - P-E-A-N-S, pean or peen? ""Peans"" might be misspelling of paean, but ""paean"" is P-A-E-A-N, not ? E A N.
""Paean"" is P-A-E-A-N, positions 1=P,2=A,3=E,4=A,5=N — doesn't fit.

For "" ? E A N ? "", common words are like beans, jeans, leans, means, deans.

But ""deans"" is plural of dean, valid.

Now, position 5 could be S, as in many.

Or other? ""OCEAN"" O-C-E-A-N → positions 1=O,2=C,3=E,4=A,5=N — but we need position 3=A, here position 3=E, doesn't fit.

Not matching.

Another possibility: ""TEARY"" but no N.

Back to word structure.

Also, E not in position 5, which for this case, position 5 is ?, which could be E, but E can't be in position 5, so whatever is in position 5, it can't be E.

In the pattern ? E A N ?, position 5 can be different letter, like S, D, etc.

But E is already in position 2.

Yes.

Now, in our list: ""BEANS"", ""JEANS"", ""LEANS"", ""MEANS"", ""DEANS"", etc.

But we also have constraints: C and R are not in the word.

C is not present, R is not present.

In the feedback, C(x) and R(x) so C and R are not in the word at all.

Therefore, for ""BEANS"": B, E, A, N, S — no C or R, good.

""JEANS"": J, E, A, N, S — no C or R.

""LEANS"": L, E, A, N, S — L is allowed, since not forbidden.

""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S — good.

""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S — good.

Now, what about ""YEANS""? Y-E-A-N-S, yeads? ""Yeans"" might not be common; may not be in word list.

Similarly, ""HEANS"" not a word.

But also, we can have words where position 5 is not S.

For example, ""ELAND"" E-L-A-N-D, but E in position 1, L in 2.

""PLANE"" but E in position 5, forbidden.

""MANIA"" M-A-N-I-A — position 3=N? No.

Stick to the pattern.

Another word: ""SANDY"" S-A-N-D-Y → positions 1=S,2=A,3=N,4=D,5=Y — position 3 is N, but we need position 3=A, position 4=N, so not.

We need position 3=A, position 4=N.

Words with ""AN"" in middle.

Possible words: Besides those ending with S, like:

""BANAL"" B-A-N-A-L → positions 1=B,2=A,3=N,4=A,5=L — position 3=N, position 4=A, not matching A at 3 and N at 4.

Not.

""WOMAN"" not 5 letters for pattern; ""woman"" is W-O-M-A-N, positions 1=W,2=O,3=M,4=A,5=N → position 4=A, position 5=N, but we need position 3=A.

Not.

So back to ? E A N ? or E ? A N ?

Let's prioritize guessing a word that includes E and tests other common letters.

Since A and N are fixed, I can guess a word that places E elsewhere to confirm its position.

In feedback, E was position 5 in guess but wrong position, so E must be in position 1 or 2 of secret.

I can guess a word with E in position 1 or 2, and A and N in correct positions to test.

For example, guess ""MEANS"": but ""MEANS"" has E in position 2, and A and N fixed.

In ""MEANS"", position 3=A, position 4=N, same as secret, so they should be correct in guess if secret has them.

But let's see.

Perhaps guess a word that has E not in position 5.

Since A and N are correct positions, I can keep them and change other letters.

But I need to include E somewhere else.

One good strategy is to use a word that has E in position 1 or 2, and keeps A and N in position 3 and 4 if possible, but position is fixed for A and N.

For the guess, I don't have to keep the same letters; I can make a different guess to gather more information.

For example, I can guess a word that has E in position 1 or 2 to see where E is.

Also, avoid C and R, and other used letters? But C and R are out.

Letters to include: E must be in, and other common letters.

Think of words similar to the pattern.

Guess: ""LEANS""

But ""LEANS"" has L, E, A, N, S.

Position 3=A, position 4=N, should be correct.

Position 2=E, which might be wrong if secret has E elsewhere, but since E cannot be position 5, and positions 3 and 4 are taken, E can only be position 1 or 2, so position 2 is possible.

Similarly, another guess could be ""BEADS"", but position 4=D? We need position 4=N.

Position 4=N is fixed, so guess must have N as fourth letter.

Similarly, third letter A must be in guess.

So for my guess, I need a word where:
- Third letter is A
- Fourth letter is N
- And E is in the word, but not position 5
- No C or R
- Also, since E was position 5 in first guess but wrong, it should not be position 5 in this guess either? Not necessarily, I can guess with E at position 5 again, but it would likely get '-' again if E is in word but not there.

But to avoid redundancy, guess E at position 1 or 2.

So construct a word: ? ? A N ?

With E in position 1 or 2, and no C or R.

Position 1 or 2 must be E? Or can contain E.

Set E at position 2 for example.

So pattern: _ E A N _

Possible:
- Position 1: any letter except C,R, and not E? Could be E, but E might be duplicated? Not necessarily, letters can repeat.

But in feedback, no indication of duplicates yet, so E might be there only once.

But possible.

Common word: ""BEANS"" as before.

""JEANS"" ""LEANS"" etc.

Now, another possibility: ""HEART"" H-E-A-R-T — but position 4=R, but R is not supposed to be in word? R is marked 'x' in feedback, so not present.

In ""HEART"", R is there, so invalid because R is not in secret word.

Similarly, ""MEANT"" M-E-A-N-T → positions:1=M,2=E,3=A,4=N,5=T → no C or R, and position 5 is T, not E.

Yes, ""MEANT"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""OLEAN"" O-L-E-A-N, but positions not: position 3=E? Position 1=O,2=L,3=E,4=A,5=N — need position 3=A.

Not matching.

""VYASA"" not.

So ""MEANT"" is M-E-A-N-T.

Positions:1=M,2=E,3=A,4=N,5=T → all good.

E is position 2.

Similarly, ""MEAN"" is 4, so ""MEANY"" not common, ""meany"" informal.

""LEANT"" L-E-A-N-T.

""LEANT"" is a word, past tense of lean.

Similarly, ""PEANS"" might not be standard.

Another word: ""DEIGN"" but D-E-I-G-N.

Position 3=I, not A.

Not.

So possible guesses: ""BEANS"", ""MEANS"", ""LEANS"", ""JEANS"", ""DEANS"", ""MEANT"", ""LEANT"", etc.

""MEANT"" and ""LEANT"" have T at end, which tests a new letter.

Similarly, ""beans"" has S.

To maximize information, perhaps choose a word with common letters not yet tested.

First guess ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E.

Feedback: C and R not in word; A and N correct positions; E in word wrong position.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E — but A,N,E are in word, C,R out.

Letters not yet tested: many, like B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Since the word has E, A, N, and probably another vowel.

Now, for the guess, I should include E to confirm position.

Option: guess ""MEANT""

Why not ""BEANS"" or other.

But ""MEANT"" has M,E,A,N,T — M and T new letters.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" has L,E,A,N,T — L and T.

I need to select one.

Another idea: put E at position 1.

Position 1=E, position 2=?, position 3=A, position 4=N, position 5=?

With E at position 1, word is E ? A N ?

Possible words: ""ELAND"" E-L-A-N-D

""EVANS"" or ""ERASE"" but E-R-A-S-E, R present, not allowed.

""Eland"" is valid, meaning animal.

Also, ""EAGER"" E-A-G-E-R — positions not, position 2=A but we need position 2=?, position 3=A, so conflict.

Position 3 must be A, so word E X A N Y.

For example, ""ELAND"": E-L-A-N-D → position 1=E,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=D

Good, L and D new letters.

Another: ""EQUIP"" but E-Q-U-I-P, not A and N.

Not.

""EXAMS"" E-X-A-M-S → position 1=E,2=X,3=A,4=M,5=S — position 4=N? Must be N, not M. So no.

So few options: ""ELAND"" or perhaps ""ETHAN"" not.

""OASIS"" etc not.

So ""ELAND"" is one option.

But ""ELAND"" might be less common.

Perhaps E in position 2 is easier with common words.

So opt for ""MEANT"" or ""LEANS"".

Now, to decide, ""MEANT"" has T, which is common, and position 5 not E.

Similarly, ""LEANS"" has S.

Both fine.

Pick ""MEANT"".

Another candidate: ""DEALT"" D-E-A-L-T → positions:1=D,2=E,3=A,4=L,5=T — position 4=N? Must be N, not L. Not.

Position 4 must be N.

So only certain words.

""PAINT"" P-A-I-N-T → position 3=I, not A.

Not.

So valid options: 
- With E in position 2: ""BEANS"", ""JEANS"", ""LEANS"", ""MEANS"", ""MEANT"", ""LEANT"", etc.
- With E in position 1: ""ELAND"", ""EXAMS"" doesn't fit.

For effectiveness, ""MEANT"" includes M, T, E, A, N. E at position 2.

If I guess ""MEANT"", and since position 3 and 4 are A and N, should be correct, so feedback will show ✓ for A and N.

Position 2=E: if secret has E at position 2, it will be ✓, if at position 1, it will be '-'.

Position 1 and 5: M and T will get feedback.

That can give information.

Similarly, if I guess ""ELAND"", E at position 1, L at 2, D at 5.

But ""ELAND"" might not be in word list.

Assuming we use common words, ""MEANT"" or ""BEANS"" are fine.

To avoid possible duplicate, guess a word without E at position 5.

I think ""MEANT"" is good.

Guess ""MEANT"".

<guess>meant</guess>

But let's confirm the response format.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the third position and is correct (marked ""✓"").
- N is in the fourth position and is correct (marked ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked ""-""), so E must be in position 1 or 2 of the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word must match the pattern: _ _ A N _ 
- Since E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.
- The guess should avoid C and R, include E, and have A in position 3 and N in position 4.

For the next guess, I selected ""meant"" because:
- It follows the pattern: position 3 is ""A"", position 4 is ""N"".
- It places E in position 2 to test if E is correct there or misplaced.
- It introduces new common letters (M and T) for better information.
- It does not contain C or R.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and reveal if M or T are in the word.

<guess>meant</guess>",meant,"First, the previous feedback was for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(-).

Breaking that down:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so A is the second letter? No, let's check the positions.

""crane"" is five letters: C-R-A-N-E
Positions:
1. C: x (not in word)
2. R: x (not in word)
3. A: ✓ (correct position) → so the third letter is A
4. N: ✓ (correct position) → so the fourth letter is N
5. E: - (in word but wrong position) → so E is somewhere else, not in position 5.

Therefore:
- The secret word has A as the third letter and N as the fourth letter.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C and R are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must have the form: _ _ A N _
And it contains E, but not at the end. Since positions are 1-based: letter 3 is A, letter 4 is N, and E is in the word but not position 5.

Possible positions for E: it could be position 1 or 2, since position 5 is ruled out by the feedback.

Now, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that fits this information.

Constraints:
- Contains E (because E is in the word, just not in position 5)
- Does not contain C or R (since they are marked 'x', not present)
- Third letter must be A
- Fourth letter must be N

So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _

And E must be in position 1 or 2, because if it were in position 1 or 2, it would be wrong position since A and N are fixed in 3 and 4, and E can't be 5.

Position 5 is the last one, and E was in position 5 and marked '-', meaning E is in the word but position 5 is incorrect, so E must be in position 1 or 2 in the secret word.

For example, the secret word could be like ""E _ A N _"" or ""_ E A N _"", but since E is not in position 5, and positions 3 and 4 are fixed.

Now, I need to think of valid 5-letter words that fit: ? ? A N ?

And contain E in either first or second position.

Also, must not have C or R.

Let me list possible words.

First, with E in position 1: E ? A N ?

What can be in position 2? It has to be a letter, not C or R, and forming a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""BEAN"" – but ""BEAN"" is 4 letters, need 5-letter word. ""BEANS"" but that's 5 letters ending with S, but position 5 is ?, not necessarily S.

""BEANS"" would be positions: B-E-A-N-S

But in our case, pattern is _ _ A N _, so for ""BEANS"": position 1=B, 2=E, 3=A, 4=N, 5=S.

But E is in position 2, which might be wrong position? Feedback for E in ""crane"" was position 5 marked '-', meaning E is in word but not position 5, so position 2 could be possible if it's not correct.

In ""BEANS"", E is position 2, which is not position 5, so it could be valid. But let's see if it fits the A and N positions.

In ""BEANS"", position 3=A and position 4=N, perfect.

But C and R not present, good.

E is present, and in position 2.

Now, with E in position 1: E ? A N ?

Possible words:
- ""DEAN"" – 4 letters, not 5.
- ""DEANA"" – not a word.
- Common words: like ""LEAN"", but 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""MEAN"" is 4, add something.

""MEANS"": M-E-A-N-S → positions:1=M,2=E,3=A,4=N,5=S → so E in position 2.

Similarly, ""WEANS""? Not common, ""wizardry""? No.

Better to think of words ending with ""AN"" but since position 4 is N, position 3 is A, so words with ""AN"" in positions 3-4.

Position 3 and 4: A and N, so substring ""AN"" fixed.

So the word is X Y A N Z.

Now, E must be X or Y, since it can't be Z (position 5).

Therefore, possibilities:
Case 1: E in position 1 (X=E): so word is E Y A N Z

Valid words: 
- ""BEANS"" : E in position 2? ""B E A N S"" → position 1=B, position 2=E → E is position 2, not 1.
For position 1=E: E _ A N _

Examples: ""ELAND"" E-L-A-N-D → positions:1=E,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=D
""Eland"" is a word, meaning a type of antelope.

Also, ""EVANS"" but that's a name, might not be accepted.

Common words: ""MEANS"" has E in position 2.

For position 1=E: other words: ""EXAM"" is not 5, ""EXAMS"" is E-X-A-M-S, A and N not positioned; we need A at position 3, N at position 4.

So the word must have A at 3 and N at 4.

Words like: ""ELAND"", ""EKING"" E-K-I-N-G not A and N.

""EKING"" has I and N, not A and N.

Only specific words.

""URBAN"" U-R-B-A-N → position 3=B, position 4=A? No.

We need position 3=A, position 4=N.

So: ? ? A N ?

Better to search for words ending with ""?"" but fixed letters.

Possible 5-letter words with A as third letter and N as fourth letter:

- Words like ""PLANE"" P-L-A-N-E → but E at position 5, which is forbidden? Not forbidden but E cannot be in position 5 per feedback.

In ""PLANE"": positions:1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=E → E at position 5.

But feedback said E is not in position 5 for the secret word, so ""PLANE"" has E at position 5, but since E cannot be there, this word is invalid for the secret? Actually, in feedback, E(5) was marked '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position, so if secret word had E at position 5, it would be correct and marked ✓, but it's marked ' - ' so position is incorrect, so E cannot be position 5 in secret. Thus, any word with E at position 5 is not possible.

Similarly, for our guess, we avoid placing E at position 5.

Back to possibilities.

Case 1: E in position 1: word must be E ? A N ?

Valid English words: 
- ""ELAND"" (E-L-A-N-D)
- ""EVANS"" not common, dictionary word? Sometimes accepted.
- ""ECRUS""? Not a word.
- ""EDANA""? No.

""Means"" is M-E-A-N-S, E in position 2.

For E position 1, hard to find.

""DIANE"" D-I-A-N-E → positions:1=D,2=I,3=A,4=N,5=E → but E at position 5, which is not allowed.

Unless position 5 isn't E.

Another word: ""OCTAN"" not; ""URBAN"" doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""ELANS""? ""Elan"" can be considered, with S? ""Elans"" is not a standard word, ""elan"" means enthusiasm, but plural uncertain.

Better to consider E in position 2.

Case 2: E in position 2: word is ? E A N ?

So position 1: ?, position 2: E, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: ?

Valid words:
- ""BEANS"" - B-E-A-N-S
- ""JEANS"" - J-E-A-N-S
- ""LEANS"" - L-E-A-N-S
- ""MEANS"" - M-E-A-N-S
- ""WEANS"" - not common, wean means to accustom, but ""wean"" is 4 letters; ""weans"" could be verb form but may not be accepted; usually avoid obscure words.
- ""DEANS"" - D-E-A-N-S
- ""PEANS"" - P-E-A-N-S, pean or peen? ""Peans"" might be misspelling of paean, but ""paean"" is P-A-E-A-N, not ? E A N.
""Paean"" is P-A-E-A-N, positions 1=P,2=A,3=E,4=A,5=N — doesn't fit.

For "" ? E A N ? "", common words are like beans, jeans, leans, means, deans.

But ""deans"" is plural of dean, valid.

Now, position 5 could be S, as in many.

Or other? ""OCEAN"" O-C-E-A-N → positions 1=O,2=C,3=E,4=A,5=N — but we need position 3=A, here position 3=E, doesn't fit.

Not matching.

Another possibility: ""TEARY"" but no N.

Back to word structure.

Also, E not in position 5, which for this case, position 5 is ?, which could be E, but E can't be in position 5, so whatever is in position 5, it can't be E.

In the pattern ? E A N ?, position 5 can be different letter, like S, D, etc.

But E is already in position 2.

Yes.

Now, in our list: ""BEANS"", ""JEANS"", ""LEANS"", ""MEANS"", ""DEANS"", etc.

But we also have constraints: C and R are not in the word.

C is not present, R is not present.

In the feedback, C(x) and R(x) so C and R are not in the word at all.

Therefore, for ""BEANS"": B, E, A, N, S — no C or R, good.

""JEANS"": J, E, A, N, S — no C or R.

""LEANS"": L, E, A, N, S — L is allowed, since not forbidden.

""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S — good.

""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S — good.

Now, what about ""YEANS""? Y-E-A-N-S, yeads? ""Yeans"" might not be common; may not be in word list.

Similarly, ""HEANS"" not a word.

But also, we can have words where position 5 is not S.

For example, ""ELAND"" E-L-A-N-D, but E in position 1, L in 2.

""PLANE"" but E in position 5, forbidden.

""MANIA"" M-A-N-I-A — position 3=N? No.

Stick to the pattern.

Another word: ""SANDY"" S-A-N-D-Y → positions 1=S,2=A,3=N,4=D,5=Y — position 3 is N, but we need position 3=A, position 4=N, so not.

We need position 3=A, position 4=N.

Words with ""AN"" in middle.

Possible words: Besides those ending with S, like:

""BANAL"" B-A-N-A-L → positions 1=B,2=A,3=N,4=A,5=L — position 3=N, position 4=A, not matching A at 3 and N at 4.

Not.

""WOMAN"" not 5 letters for pattern; ""woman"" is W-O-M-A-N, positions 1=W,2=O,3=M,4=A,5=N → position 4=A, position 5=N, but we need position 3=A.

Not.

So back to ? E A N ? or E ? A N ?

Let's prioritize guessing a word that includes E and tests other common letters.

Since A and N are fixed, I can guess a word that places E elsewhere to confirm its position.

In feedback, E was position 5 in guess but wrong position, so E must be in position 1 or 2 of secret.

I can guess a word with E in position 1 or 2, and A and N in correct positions to test.

For example, guess ""MEANS"": but ""MEANS"" has E in position 2, and A and N fixed.

In ""MEANS"", position 3=A, position 4=N, same as secret, so they should be correct in guess if secret has them.

But let's see.

Perhaps guess a word that has E not in position 5.

Since A and N are correct positions, I can keep them and change other letters.

But I need to include E somewhere else.

One good strategy is to use a word that has E in position 1 or 2, and keeps A and N in position 3 and 4 if possible, but position is fixed for A and N.

For the guess, I don't have to keep the same letters; I can make a different guess to gather more information.

For example, I can guess a word that has E in position 1 or 2 to see where E is.

Also, avoid C and R, and other used letters? But C and R are out.

Letters to include: E must be in, and other common letters.

Think of words similar to the pattern.

Guess: ""LEANS""

But ""LEANS"" has L, E, A, N, S.

Position 3=A, position 4=N, should be correct.

Position 2=E, which might be wrong if secret has E elsewhere, but since E cannot be position 5, and positions 3 and 4 are taken, E can only be position 1 or 2, so position 2 is possible.

Similarly, another guess could be ""BEADS"", but position 4=D? We need position 4=N.

Position 4=N is fixed, so guess must have N as fourth letter.

Similarly, third letter A must be in guess.

So for my guess, I need a word where:
- Third letter is A
- Fourth letter is N
- And E is in the word, but not position 5
- No C or R
- Also, since E was position 5 in first guess but wrong, it should not be position 5 in this guess either? Not necessarily, I can guess with E at position 5 again, but it would likely get '-' again if E is in word but not there.

But to avoid redundancy, guess E at position 1 or 2.

So construct a word: ? ? A N ?

With E in position 1 or 2, and no C or R.

Position 1 or 2 must be E? Or can contain E.

Set E at position 2 for example.

So pattern: _ E A N _

Possible:
- Position 1: any letter except C,R, and not E? Could be E, but E might be duplicated? Not necessarily, letters can repeat.

But in feedback, no indication of duplicates yet, so E might be there only once.

But possible.

Common word: ""BEANS"" as before.

""JEANS"" ""LEANS"" etc.

Now, another possibility: ""HEART"" H-E-A-R-T — but position 4=R, but R is not supposed to be in word? R is marked 'x' in feedback, so not present.

In ""HEART"", R is there, so invalid because R is not in secret word.

Similarly, ""MEANT"" M-E-A-N-T → positions:1=M,2=E,3=A,4=N,5=T → no C or R, and position 5 is T, not E.

Yes, ""MEANT"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""OLEAN"" O-L-E-A-N, but positions not: position 3=E? Position 1=O,2=L,3=E,4=A,5=N — need position 3=A.

Not matching.

""VYASA"" not.

So ""MEANT"" is M-E-A-N-T.

Positions:1=M,2=E,3=A,4=N,5=T → all good.

E is position 2.

Similarly, ""MEAN"" is 4, so ""MEANY"" not common, ""meany"" informal.

""LEANT"" L-E-A-N-T.

""LEANT"" is a word, past tense of lean.

Similarly, ""PEANS"" might not be standard.

Another word: ""DEIGN"" but D-E-I-G-N.

Position 3=I, not A.

Not.

So possible guesses: ""BEANS"", ""MEANS"", ""LEANS"", ""JEANS"", ""DEANS"", ""MEANT"", ""LEANT"", etc.

""MEANT"" and ""LEANT"" have T at end, which tests a new letter.

Similarly, ""beans"" has S.

To maximize information, perhaps choose a word with common letters not yet tested.

First guess ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E.

Feedback: C and R not in word; A and N correct positions; E in word wrong position.

So letters tested: C,R,A,N,E — but A,N,E are in word, C,R out.

Letters not yet tested: many, like B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Since the word has E, A, N, and probably another vowel.

Now, for the guess, I should include E to confirm position.

Option: guess ""MEANT""

Why not ""BEANS"" or other.

But ""MEANT"" has M,E,A,N,T — M and T new letters.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" has L,E,A,N,T — L and T.

I need to select one.

Another idea: put E at position 1.

Position 1=E, position 2=?, position 3=A, position 4=N, position 5=?

With E at position 1, word is E ? A N ?

Possible words: ""ELAND"" E-L-A-N-D

""EVANS"" or ""ERASE"" but E-R-A-S-E, R present, not allowed.

""Eland"" is valid, meaning animal.

Also, ""EAGER"" E-A-G-E-R — positions not, position 2=A but we need position 2=?, position 3=A, so conflict.

Position 3 must be A, so word E X A N Y.

For example, ""ELAND"": E-L-A-N-D → position 1=E,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=D

Good, L and D new letters.

Another: ""EQUIP"" but E-Q-U-I-P, not A and N.

Not.

""EXAMS"" E-X-A-M-S → position 1=E,2=X,3=A,4=M,5=S — position 4=N? Must be N, not M. So no.

So few options: ""ELAND"" or perhaps ""ETHAN"" not.

""OASIS"" etc not.

So ""ELAND"" is one option.

But ""ELAND"" might be less common.

Perhaps E in position 2 is easier with common words.

So opt for ""MEANT"" or ""LEANS"".

Now, to decide, ""MEANT"" has T, which is common, and position 5 not E.

Similarly, ""LEANS"" has S.

Both fine.

Pick ""MEANT"".

Another candidate: ""DEALT"" D-E-A-L-T → positions:1=D,2=E,3=A,4=L,5=T — position 4=N? Must be N, not L. Not.

Position 4 must be N.

So only certain words.

""PAINT"" P-A-I-N-T → position 3=I, not A.

Not.

So valid options: 
- With E in position 2: ""BEANS"", ""JEANS"", ""LEANS"", ""MEANS"", ""MEANT"", ""LEANT"", etc.
- With E in position 1: ""ELAND"", ""EXAMS"" doesn't fit.

For effectiveness, ""MEANT"" includes M, T, E, A, N. E at position 2.

If I guess ""MEANT"", and since position 3 and 4 are A and N, should be correct, so feedback will show ✓ for A and N.

Position 2=E: if secret has E at position 2, it will be ✓, if at position 1, it will be '-'.

Position 1 and 5: M and T will get feedback.

That can give information.

Similarly, if I guess ""ELAND"", E at position 1, L at 2, D at 5.

But ""ELAND"" might not be in word list.

Assuming we use common words, ""MEANT"" or ""BEANS"" are fine.

To avoid possible duplicate, guess a word without E at position 5.

I think ""MEANT"" is good.

Guess ""MEANT"".

<guess>meant</guess>

But let's confirm the response format.Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the third position and is correct (marked ""✓"").
- N is in the fourth position and is correct (marked ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked ""-""), so E must be in position 1 or 2 of the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word must match the pattern: _ _ A N _ 
- Since E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.
- The guess should avoid C and R, include E, and have A in position 3 and N in position 4.

For the next guess, I selected ""meant"" because:
- It follows the pattern: position 3 is ""A"", position 4 is ""N"".
- It places E in position 2 to test if E is correct there or misplaced.
- It introduces new common letters (M and T) for better information.
- It does not contain C or R.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and reveal if M or T are in the word.",Guess 2: meant -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
