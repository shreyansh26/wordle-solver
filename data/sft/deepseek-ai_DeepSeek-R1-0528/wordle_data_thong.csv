We are starting a new game of Wordle. Since it's the first guess, we want to pick a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically has a mix of common letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. Common vowels and consonants in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, S, etc.

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and includes both vowels (A, E) and consonants.

Another common word is ""CRANE"". Both ""SLATE"" and ""CRANE"" are good choices.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess. It has common letters and contains two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: x (not in the word)
N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the fourth letter is N)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _

We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'N' as the fourth letter.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words with N in the fourth position:

Let's list some words that end with ""N"" (but note: the fourth letter is N, so the word ends with a consonant and then N? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is N, so the word pattern is ???N?.

Examples:
- ...N. : like ""URBAN"", but U and B are new, but we have to avoid A (which is in URBAN) -> not allowed because A is excluded.
- We need words without C, R, A, E.

Let me think of words that have N in the fourth position and don't contain C, R, A, E.

Some possibilities:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> N is the fourth letter. But does it contain excluded letters? C? no. R? no. A? no. E? no. So it's okay.
- ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> similarly, no excluded letters.
- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> no excluded letters.
- ""COUNT"": but C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BOUND"": B, O, U, N, D -> no excluded letters? B, O, U, N, D: no C, R, A, E -> okay.

But we also want to test new letters. We haven't tried P, O, I, T (in POINT) or M, O, U, T (in MOUNT) or B, O, U, D (in BOUND).

We should also consider that we know the fourth letter is N, so we can focus on the other positions.

Another idea: since we have only one correct letter (N) and we know four letters that are absent, we can try a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, I, T and we know N is in the fourth position.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that N is in the correct position, so in ""POINT"", we are placing N in the same correct position.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has more common vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels must be I, O, U, or sometimes Y.

But in ""POINT"", we have O and I.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. This uses S, H, U, T.

But we don't know if H is common.

""POINT"" seems good.

But let me check if there are words that have more than one of the common letters.

We might also consider ""BLIND"", but B, L, I, N, D: but we don't know if L and D are in the word. However, we are trying to get information.

But note: we must avoid R, A, E, C.

Another word: ""SPOON"" -> S, P, O, O, N. But the fourth letter is O? No, we need the fourth letter to be N. In ""SPOON"", the fourth letter is O, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, the word must be of the form ???N?.

Let me list a few more:
- ""STAIN"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""PLAIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""TRAIN"": R and A excluded -> invalid.
- ""BEGIN"": E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MINUS"": M, I, N, U, S -> fourth letter is U? No, we need the fourth to be N. In MINUS: M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is U, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the word must have N at position 4.

So, the pattern is: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> but the fourth letter is O? Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> no, we need the fourth to be N, so that's not it.

I think I'm getting confused. The fourth letter must be N, so in a five-letter word, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So, for example:
- ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is A, not N. We need the fourth letter to be N, so that would be the second last? Actually, in a five-letter word:
Position 1: first
Position 2: second
Position 3: third
Position 4: fourth
Position 5: fifth

So, for the word to have N at position 4, then the word is: _ _ _ N _

So, the last letter can be anything.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes, fourth is N.
- ""JOINT"": J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
- ""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
- ""BOUND"": B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- ""FOUND"": F(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but F is new, but we can use it.
- ""HOUND"": H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- ""MOUND"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)

But note: we must avoid C, R, A, E.

So, ""FOUND"" has F, O, U, N, D -> no C, R, A, E -> valid.

But we already have N in the correct position, so we don't need to test that again. We can use a word that has N in the fourth position and tests new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible in the other positions.

In ""POINT"", we test P, O, I, T (and N is fixed).
In ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

We haven't tried O, U, I, T, M, P, etc.

Another word: ""SHINY"" -> S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> that works, and we test S, H, I, Y.

But Y is less common.

""POINT"" seems solid.

But let me see if we can include S, which is a very common letter.

A word like ""STUNG"": S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> that tests S, T, U, G.

But we don't have O or I.

Alternatively, ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> tests S, L, I, G.

That might be good because we test S and L, which are common.

But we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

""SLING"" has S, L, I, N, G -> no excluded letters.

Similarly, ""SWING"": S, W, I, N, G -> W is less common.

""SLING"" or ""POINT""?

We might also consider ""BLINK"": B, L, I, N, K -> but K is new.

But let's choose one.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T).

Alternatively, ""SLING"" tests S and L, which are also common.

But we have only one guess so far, so we can choose either.

I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

So, the next guess is ""POINT"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""point"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter, marked with ""✓"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _ (where the fourth letter is N, and the other letters are unknown). The letters C, R, A, and E must be excluded from the new guess.

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It includes N in the fourth position (to maintain the known correct placement).
- It uses new, common letters (P, O, I, T) that haven't been tested yet, maximizing potential information gain.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).
- ""POINT"" is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or T are in the secret word and their positions, while confirming the fixed N.

- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words with N in the fourth position:

Let's list some words that end with ""N"" (but note: the fourth letter is N, so the word ends with a consonant and then N? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is N, so the word pattern is ???N?.

Examples:
- ...N. : like ""URBAN"", but U and B are new, but we have to avoid A (which is in URBAN) -> not allowed because A is excluded.
- We need words without C, R, A, E.

Let me think of words that have N in the fourth position and don't contain C, R, A, E.

Some possibilities:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> N is the fourth letter. But does it contain excluded letters? C? no. R? no. A? no. E? no. So it's okay.
- ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> similarly, no excluded letters.
- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> no excluded letters.
- ""COUNT"": but C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BOUND"": B, O, U, N, D -> no excluded letters? B, O, U, N, D: no C, R, A, E -> okay.

But we also want to test new letters. We haven't tried P, O, I, T (in POINT) or M, O, U, T (in MOUNT) or B, O, U, D (in BOUND).

We should also consider that we know the fourth letter is N, so we can focus on the other positions.

Another idea: since we have only one correct letter (N) and we know four letters that are absent, we can try a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, I, T and we know N is in the fourth position.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that N is in the correct position, so in ""POINT"", we are placing N in the same correct position.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has more common vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels must be I, O, U, or sometimes Y.

But in ""POINT"", we have O and I.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. This uses S, H, U, T.

But we don't know if H is common.

""POINT"" seems good.

But let me check if there are words that have more than one of the common letters.

We might also consider ""BLIND"", but B, L, I, N, D: but we don't know if L and D are in the word. However, we are trying to get information.

But note: we must avoid R, A, E, C.

Another word: ""SPOON"" -> S, P, O, O, N. But the fourth letter is O? No, we need the fourth letter to be N. In ""SPOON"", the fourth letter is O, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, the word must be of the form ???N?.

Let me list a few more:
- ""STAIN"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""PLAIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""TRAIN"": R and A excluded -> invalid.
- ""BEGIN"": E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MINUS"": M, I, N, U, S -> fourth letter is U? No, we need the fourth to be N. In MINUS: M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is U, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the word must have N at position 4.

So, the pattern is: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> but the fourth letter is O? Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> no, we need the fourth to be N, so that's not it.

I think I'm getting confused. The fourth letter must be N, so in a five-letter word, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So, for example:
- ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is A, not N. We need the fourth letter to be N, so that would be the second last? Actually, in a five-letter word:
Position 1: first
Position 2: second
Position 3: third
Position 4: fourth
Position 5: fifth

So, for the word to have N at position 4, then the word is: _ _ _ N _

So, the last letter can be anything.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes, fourth is N.
- ""JOINT"": J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
- ""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
- ""BOUND"": B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- ""FOUND"": F(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but F is new, but we can use it.
- ""HOUND"": H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- ""MOUND"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)

But note: we must avoid C, R, A, E.

So, ""FOUND"" has F, O, U, N, D -> no C, R, A, E -> valid.

But we already have N in the correct position, so we don't need to test that again. We can use a word that has N in the fourth position and tests new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible in the other positions.

In ""POINT"", we test P, O, I, T (and N is fixed).
In ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

We haven't tried O, U, I, T, M, P, etc.

Another word: ""SHINY"" -> S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> that works, and we test S, H, I, Y.

But Y is less common.

""POINT"" seems solid.

But let me see if we can include S, which is a very common letter.

A word like ""STUNG"": S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> that tests S, T, U, G.

But we don't have O or I.

Alternatively, ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> tests S, L, I, G.

That might be good because we test S and L, which are common.

But we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

""SLING"" has S, L, I, N, G -> no excluded letters.

Similarly, ""SWING"": S, W, I, N, G -> W is less common.

""SLING"" or ""POINT""?

We might also consider ""BLINK"": B, L, I, N, K -> but K is new.

But let's choose one.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T).

Alternatively, ""SLING"" tests S and L, which are also common.

But we have only one guess so far, so we can choose either.

I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

So, the next guess is ""POINT"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""point"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter, marked with ""✓"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _ (where the fourth letter is N, and the other letters are unknown). The letters C, R, A, and E must be excluded from the new guess.

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It includes N in the fourth position (to maintain the known correct placement).
- It uses new, common letters (P, O, I, T) that haven't been tested yet, maximizing potential information gain.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).
- ""POINT"" is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or T are in the secret word and their positions, while confirming the fixed N.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - This means:
     - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
     - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess: ""point"" -> P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)
   - This means:
     - N is again confirmed in the 4th position (we already knew that).
     - O is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked with ""-"" for wrong position).
     - T is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").
     - P and I are not in the word (marked with ""x"").

So, combining the feedback:

- Correct position: The 4th letter is N.
- Present but wrong position: O and T are in the word, but O is not in position 2, and T is not in position 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- 4th letter: N
- Contains O and T (but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, I

Also, from the first guess, we know the word is of the form: _ _ _ N _

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes O and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know their positions) and we can try to find their correct positions.
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.
- Uses new letters to test for other possibilities.

We know O and T are present, so we should try to place them in different positions to test.

Possible positions for O: It cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point""). So O can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, T cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback). So T can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is fixed as N.

So, the word: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We know O is in the word but not at position 2, so O must be at 1, 3, or 5.
T is in the word but not at position 5, so T must be at 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to consider that there might be other letters we haven't tried.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, E, P, I, O, N, T (but O, N, T are in the word, so we can reuse O and T? Actually, in Wordle, we can reuse letters that are known to be in the word to test positions, but in this case, we are allowed to use any letters as long as we avoid the absent ones.

But note: we know O and T are present, so we should include them in the next guess to find their correct positions. Also, we can introduce new letters to test for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions to find are 1,2,3,5 (with 4 fixed as N).

We have two known present letters: O and T. So we need to assign them to two of the positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints:
- O cannot be at 2 (from feedback)
- T cannot be at 5

Also, we must fill the other two positions with new letters.

But we have four positions and two known letters to place, so we need two new letters.

We should try a word that places O and T in positions that are possible and test new letters for the other positions.

Let's list possible positions for O and T:

For O: positions 1, 3, 5
For T: positions 1, 2, 3

But note: if we put O and T in the same word, they might be in different positions.

We also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Now, we can form a word that has:
- N at position 4
- O at one of {1,3,5}
- T at one of {1,2,3}
- And two new letters.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, let's consider placing O at position 1 and T at position 2: then the word would be O T ? N ?

But we need to fill position 3 and 5.

For example: O T _ N _

Possible words: 
- ""OTTER"" but T is repeated? And E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.
- ""OTIUM"" - not a common word.

Place O at position 1 and T at position 3: then O _ T N _

Example: ""OUTED"" but E and D? But E is excluded -> invalid.

Place O at position 1 and T at position 1? Impossible, same position.

O at 1, T at 2: as above.

O at 1, T at 3: O _ T N _

We need a word: O ? T N ?

With no C,R,A,E,P,I.

Possible: ""OUTDO"" -> O U T D O? But that's 5 letters: O(1), U(2), T(3), D(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, not D. So invalid.

We must have N at 4.

So, O ? T N ? -> positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:T, 4:N, 5:?

With no C,R,A,E,P,I.

What can be at position 2 and 5? Letters not excluded.

Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O at 1, so that's fine) and must be a new letter.

Possible: ""MUTON"" -> M U T O N? That's M(1), U(2), T(3), O(4), N(5) -> but position 4 is O, not N. We need position 4 to be N.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, for O at 1 and T at 3: word is O [letter2] T N [letter5]

Example: ""OFTEN"" -> O F T E N -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""OCTAN"" -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

Not many options.

Now, place O at position 3 and T at position 1: then T _ O N _

Word: T ? O N ?

Example: ""TALON"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
""THONG"" -> T H O N G -> this seems good? T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5). 
Check letters: T, H, O, N, G. 
Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I are absent, so H, O, N, G, T are allowed? O and T are known present, H and G are new.
But we have O at position 3 and T at position 1.

Is ""THONG"" a valid word? Yes.

But let's see the constraints: 
- O is at position 3, which is allowed (since O cannot be at 2, but 3 is fine).
- T is at position 1, which is allowed (T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).

Also, we are testing H and G.

Another possibility: place O at position 3 and T at position 2: then ? T O N ?

Word: [1] T O N [5]

Example: ""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> but E is excluded -> invalid.
""ATONE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
""STONY"" -> S T O N Y -> S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). 
Letters: S, T, O, N, Y. No absent letters? S, T, O, N, Y: T and O are known, S and Y are new. And E is not present? Yes, E is absent so it's okay.

But we have T at position 2: is that allowed? T cannot be at position 5, but position 2 is okay.

Similarly, O at position 3 is okay.

So ""STONY"" is a candidate.

Now, place O at position 5: then we have to place T at one of 1,2,3.

If O at 5, then word: [1] [2] [3] N O

And T must be at 1,2, or 3.

For example, T at 1: T ? ? N O
""TUNGO"" -> T U N G O? Positions: T(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it's G -> invalid.

T at 1: T [2] [3] N O

Example: ""TURNO"" -> T U R N O -> but R is excluded -> invalid.
""TAMBO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

T at 2: ? T ? N O
Example: ""STUNO"" -> not a word.
""UTTER"" -> U T T E R -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

T at 3: ? ? T N O
Example: ""MUTTO"" -> not common.
""BITTO"" -> B I T T O -> I excluded -> invalid.

So, it seems difficult to have O at position 5.

Therefore, better to have O at position 3 or 1? But earlier we had ""THONG"" and ""STONY"" as candidates.

Another candidate: place O at position 1 and T at position 5? But T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So, let's list the candidates we have:

1. ""THONG"": T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)
   - Tests T at 1, O at 3, and new letters H and G.

2. ""STONY"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)
   - Tests T at 2, O at 3, and new letters S and Y.

We also have the possibility of O at position 1 and T at position 3, but we couldn't find a good word without excluded letters.

Another word: ""TOUCH"" but C is excluded -> invalid.

""DOUBT"" -> D O U B T -> O(2), but O cannot be at position 2? In ""DOUBT"", O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot put O at 2.

Similarly, we cannot put T at 5.

So, back to the candidates.

We can also consider placing O at position 5? But we had trouble, but let's try: O at 5, and T at position 1: T ? ? N O

What words? ""THYNO"" not a word.

""TYNGO"" not a word.

Place O at 5 and T at 2: ? T ? N O

""STUNO"" not a word.

""ATINO"" not a word.

Place O at 5 and T at 3: ? ? T N O

""UNTIL"" -> U N T I L -> but position 4 is T? U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> not N at 4.

We need N at 4.

""ANTIC"" -> A excluded.

So, it seems hard to have O at 5.

Therefore, let's focus on O at 1 or 3.

Another word with O at 1: O _ _ N _

With T in the word? But T must be at 1,2,3 but O is at 1, so T at 2 or 3.

If T at 2: O T ? N ?

Words: ""OTARY"" not common.
""OTAKU"" not English.

If T at 3: O ? T N ?

Words: ""OFTEN"" has E -> invalid.
""OCTAN"" has C -> invalid.
""OUTGO"" -> O U T G O -> O(1), U(2), T(3), G(4), O(5) -> position 4 is G, not N -> invalid.

So, no common words with O at 1 and T at 3 with N at 4.

Therefore, the best options are ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".

Now, which one to choose?

In ""THONG"", we test T at position 1 and O at position 3, and new letters H and G.

In ""STONY"", we test T at position 2 and O at position 3, and new letters S and Y.

S is a very common letter, so testing S might be good.

Similarly, H and G are also common.

But we have to consider that if we put T at position 2, and if the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly for O.

But in ""STONY"", we are putting O at 3, which is a possible position.

We know O is not at 2, so it must be at 1,3, or5. We are testing 3.

Similarly, T is not at 5, so it must be at 1,2,3. We are testing 2.

If we get feedback that T is not at 2, then T must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly for O.

But in ""THONG"", we are testing T at 1 and O at 3.

We might get more information.

Another candidate: what about ""MOUNT""? But in the first guess, we didn't have M, but M is not excluded.

""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot use ""MOUNT"" because it places O at 2.

Similarly, ""BOUND"" has O at 2 -> invalid.

""FOUND"" same.

So, not possible.

Another word: ""TONGS"" -> T O N G S -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it's G -> invalid.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, back to ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".

I think ""STONY"" is a better choice because S is a very common letter, and Y might be at the end.

Also, ""STONY"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SHOWN"" but position 4 must be N, so ""SHOWN"" is S H O W N -> S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 4 is W, not N -> invalid.

""SHUNT"": S H U N T -> S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is at position 5, but T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.

Therefore, ""SHUNT"" is invalid because it places T at 5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this has T at 2 and N at 4, but what about O? We know O is in the word, but ""STUNG"" does not have O. We must include O because we know it is present.

Important: we know O is in the word, so we must include O in the guess to find its position. Similarly for T.

In the next guess, we should include both O and T to test their positions, along with N at 4.

Therefore, the guess must contain O and T.

In ""STUNG"", there is no O, so it doesn't help us with O's position.

Similarly, ""THONG"" has O and T, and N at 4.

""STONY"" has O and T, and N at 4.

""THONG"": T at 1, O at 3
""STONY"": T at 2, O at 3

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""STONY"" because it tests S, which is a common letter.

So, let's choose ""STONY"".

But in ""STONY"", we have O at position 3, which we are testing, and T at position 2.

If the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, if O is not at position 3, then O must be at 1 or 5.

But we are hoping to get some correct positions.

Another word: ""TOWNS"" -> T O W N S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed -> invalid.

""TOUCH"" invalid.

So, I think ""STONY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""STONY"".

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, O, N, Y.

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I. None of these are in ""STONY"", so it's okay.

And N is at position 4.

So, we'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.  

- **Guess 2: ""point"" → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)**  
  This adds:  
  - O is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - P and I are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ _ _ N _` (4th letter is N).  
- **Confirmed present letters**: O and T (but with incorrect positions).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I (cannot be used).  
- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Position constraints for T**: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- The word must include O and T, as they are confirmed present, and we need to test their positions.  
- New letters should be introduced to maximize information gain (e.g., common consonants like S, L, or H).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Must include**: O and T to test their positions, and N in the 4th position.  
- **Avoid**: C, R, A, E, P, I.  
- **Prioritize**: Testing O in position 3 (a likely candidate) and T in position 2 (to check if it fits), while introducing new common letters like S and Y for coverage.  
- **Chosen word: ""STONY""**  
  - S (position 1): New letter, tests a common consonant.  
  - T (position 2): Tests if T is correctly placed in position 2 (if not, T must be in 1 or 3).  
  - O (position 3): Tests if O is correctly placed in position 3 (if not, O must be in 1 or 5).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed correct position.  
  - Y (position 5): New letter, tests a less common vowel/consonant.  
- This guess efficiently tests key positions for O and T, covers new letters, and adheres to all constraints.

<guess>stony</guess>",stony,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - This means:
     - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
     - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess: ""point"" -> P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)
   - This means:
     - N is again confirmed in the 4th position (we already knew that).
     - O is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked with ""-"" for wrong position).
     - T is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").
     - P and I are not in the word (marked with ""x"").

So, combining the feedback:

- Correct position: The 4th letter is N.
- Present but wrong position: O and T are in the word, but O is not in position 2, and T is not in position 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- 4th letter: N
- Contains O and T (but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, I

Also, from the first guess, we know the word is of the form: _ _ _ N _

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes O and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know their positions) and we can try to find their correct positions.
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.
- Uses new letters to test for other possibilities.

We know O and T are present, so we should try to place them in different positions to test.

Possible positions for O: It cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point""). So O can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, T cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback). So T can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is fixed as N.

So, the word: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We know O is in the word but not at position 2, so O must be at 1, 3, or 5.
T is in the word but not at position 5, so T must be at 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to consider that there might be other letters we haven't tried.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, E, P, I, O, N, T (but O, N, T are in the word, so we can reuse O and T? Actually, in Wordle, we can reuse letters that are known to be in the word to test positions, but in this case, we are allowed to use any letters as long as we avoid the absent ones.

But note: we know O and T are present, so we should include them in the next guess to find their correct positions. Also, we can introduce new letters to test for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions to find are 1,2,3,5 (with 4 fixed as N).

We have two known present letters: O and T. So we need to assign them to two of the positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints:
- O cannot be at 2 (from feedback)
- T cannot be at 5

Also, we must fill the other two positions with new letters.

But we have four positions and two known letters to place, so we need two new letters.

We should try a word that places O and T in positions that are possible and test new letters for the other positions.

Let's list possible positions for O and T:

For O: positions 1, 3, 5
For T: positions 1, 2, 3

But note: if we put O and T in the same word, they might be in different positions.

We also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Now, we can form a word that has:
- N at position 4
- O at one of {1,3,5}
- T at one of {1,2,3}
- And two new letters.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, let's consider placing O at position 1 and T at position 2: then the word would be O T ? N ?

But we need to fill position 3 and 5.

For example: O T _ N _

Possible words: 
- ""OTTER"" but T is repeated? And E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.
- ""OTIUM"" - not a common word.

Place O at position 1 and T at position 3: then O _ T N _

Example: ""OUTED"" but E and D? But E is excluded -> invalid.

Place O at position 1 and T at position 1? Impossible, same position.

O at 1, T at 2: as above.

O at 1, T at 3: O _ T N _

We need a word: O ? T N ?

With no C,R,A,E,P,I.

Possible: ""OUTDO"" -> O U T D O? But that's 5 letters: O(1), U(2), T(3), D(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, not D. So invalid.

We must have N at 4.

So, O ? T N ? -> positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:T, 4:N, 5:?

With no C,R,A,E,P,I.

What can be at position 2 and 5? Letters not excluded.

Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O at 1, so that's fine) and must be a new letter.

Possible: ""MUTON"" -> M U T O N? That's M(1), U(2), T(3), O(4), N(5) -> but position 4 is O, not N. We need position 4 to be N.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, for O at 1 and T at 3: word is O [letter2] T N [letter5]

Example: ""OFTEN"" -> O F T E N -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""OCTAN"" -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

Not many options.

Now, place O at position 3 and T at position 1: then T _ O N _

Word: T ? O N ?

Example: ""TALON"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
""THONG"" -> T H O N G -> this seems good? T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5). 
Check letters: T, H, O, N, G. 
Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I are absent, so H, O, N, G, T are allowed? O and T are known present, H and G are new.
But we have O at position 3 and T at position 1.

Is ""THONG"" a valid word? Yes.

But let's see the constraints: 
- O is at position 3, which is allowed (since O cannot be at 2, but 3 is fine).
- T is at position 1, which is allowed (T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).

Also, we are testing H and G.

Another possibility: place O at position 3 and T at position 2: then ? T O N ?

Word: [1] T O N [5]

Example: ""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> but E is excluded -> invalid.
""ATONE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
""STONY"" -> S T O N Y -> S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). 
Letters: S, T, O, N, Y. No absent letters? S, T, O, N, Y: T and O are known, S and Y are new. And E is not present? Yes, E is absent so it's okay.

But we have T at position 2: is that allowed? T cannot be at position 5, but position 2 is okay.

Similarly, O at position 3 is okay.

So ""STONY"" is a candidate.

Now, place O at position 5: then we have to place T at one of 1,2,3.

If O at 5, then word: [1] [2] [3] N O

And T must be at 1,2, or 3.

For example, T at 1: T ? ? N O
""TUNGO"" -> T U N G O? Positions: T(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it's G -> invalid.

T at 1: T [2] [3] N O

Example: ""TURNO"" -> T U R N O -> but R is excluded -> invalid.
""TAMBO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

T at 2: ? T ? N O
Example: ""STUNO"" -> not a word.
""UTTER"" -> U T T E R -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

T at 3: ? ? T N O
Example: ""MUTTO"" -> not common.
""BITTO"" -> B I T T O -> I excluded -> invalid.

So, it seems difficult to have O at position 5.

Therefore, better to have O at position 3 or 1? But earlier we had ""THONG"" and ""STONY"" as candidates.

Another candidate: place O at position 1 and T at position 5? But T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So, let's list the candidates we have:

1. ""THONG"": T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)
   - Tests T at 1, O at 3, and new letters H and G.

2. ""STONY"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)
   - Tests T at 2, O at 3, and new letters S and Y.

We also have the possibility of O at position 1 and T at position 3, but we couldn't find a good word without excluded letters.

Another word: ""TOUCH"" but C is excluded -> invalid.

""DOUBT"" -> D O U B T -> O(2), but O cannot be at position 2? In ""DOUBT"", O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot put O at 2.

Similarly, we cannot put T at 5.

So, back to the candidates.

We can also consider placing O at position 5? But we had trouble, but let's try: O at 5, and T at position 1: T ? ? N O

What words? ""THYNO"" not a word.

""TYNGO"" not a word.

Place O at 5 and T at 2: ? T ? N O

""STUNO"" not a word.

""ATINO"" not a word.

Place O at 5 and T at 3: ? ? T N O

""UNTIL"" -> U N T I L -> but position 4 is T? U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> not N at 4.

We need N at 4.

""ANTIC"" -> A excluded.

So, it seems hard to have O at 5.

Therefore, let's focus on O at 1 or 3.

Another word with O at 1: O _ _ N _

With T in the word? But T must be at 1,2,3 but O is at 1, so T at 2 or 3.

If T at 2: O T ? N ?

Words: ""OTARY"" not common.
""OTAKU"" not English.

If T at 3: O ? T N ?

Words: ""OFTEN"" has E -> invalid.
""OCTAN"" has C -> invalid.
""OUTGO"" -> O U T G O -> O(1), U(2), T(3), G(4), O(5) -> position 4 is G, not N -> invalid.

So, no common words with O at 1 and T at 3 with N at 4.

Therefore, the best options are ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".

Now, which one to choose?

In ""THONG"", we test T at position 1 and O at position 3, and new letters H and G.

In ""STONY"", we test T at position 2 and O at position 3, and new letters S and Y.

S is a very common letter, so testing S might be good.

Similarly, H and G are also common.

But we have to consider that if we put T at position 2, and if the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly for O.

But in ""STONY"", we are putting O at 3, which is a possible position.

We know O is not at 2, so it must be at 1,3, or5. We are testing 3.

Similarly, T is not at 5, so it must be at 1,2,3. We are testing 2.

If we get feedback that T is not at 2, then T must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly for O.

But in ""THONG"", we are testing T at 1 and O at 3.

We might get more information.

Another candidate: what about ""MOUNT""? But in the first guess, we didn't have M, but M is not excluded.

""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot use ""MOUNT"" because it places O at 2.

Similarly, ""BOUND"" has O at 2 -> invalid.

""FOUND"" same.

So, not possible.

Another word: ""TONGS"" -> T O N G S -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it's G -> invalid.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, back to ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".

I think ""STONY"" is a better choice because S is a very common letter, and Y might be at the end.

Also, ""STONY"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SHOWN"" but position 4 must be N, so ""SHOWN"" is S H O W N -> S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 4 is W, not N -> invalid.

""SHUNT"": S H U N T -> S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is at position 5, but T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.

Therefore, ""SHUNT"" is invalid because it places T at 5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this has T at 2 and N at 4, but what about O? We know O is in the word, but ""STUNG"" does not have O. We must include O because we know it is present.

Important: we know O is in the word, so we must include O in the guess to find its position. Similarly for T.

In the next guess, we should include both O and T to test their positions, along with N at 4.

Therefore, the guess must contain O and T.

In ""STUNG"", there is no O, so it doesn't help us with O's position.

Similarly, ""THONG"" has O and T, and N at 4.

""STONY"" has O and T, and N at 4.

""THONG"": T at 1, O at 3
""STONY"": T at 2, O at 3

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""STONY"" because it tests S, which is a common letter.

So, let's choose ""STONY"".

But in ""STONY"", we have O at position 3, which we are testing, and T at position 2.

If the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, if O is not at position 3, then O must be at 1 or 5.

But we are hoping to get some correct positions.

Another word: ""TOWNS"" -> T O W N S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed -> invalid.

""TOUCH"" invalid.

So, I think ""STONY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""STONY"".

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, O, N, Y.

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I. None of these are in ""STONY"", so it's okay.

And N is at position 4.

So, we'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.  

- **Guess 2: ""point"" → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)**  
  This adds:  
  - O is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - P and I are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ _ _ N _` (4th letter is N).  
- **Confirmed present letters**: O and T (but with incorrect positions).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I (cannot be used).  
- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Position constraints for T**: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- The word must include O and T, as they are confirmed present, and we need to test their positions.  
- New letters should be introduced to maximize information gain (e.g., common consonants like S, L, or H).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Must include**: O and T to test their positions, and N in the 4th position.  
- **Avoid**: C, R, A, E, P, I.  
- **Prioritize**: Testing O in position 3 (a likely candidate) and T in position 2 (to check if it fits), while introducing new common letters like S and Y for coverage.  
- **Chosen word: ""STONY""**  
  - S (position 1): New letter, tests a common consonant.  
  - T (position 2): Tests if T is correctly placed in position 2 (if not, T must be in 1 or 3).  
  - O (position 3): Tests if O is correctly placed in position 3 (if not, O must be in 1 or 5).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed correct position.  
  - Y (position 5): New letter, tests a less common vowel/consonant.  
- This guess efficiently tests key positions for O and T, covers new letters, and adheres to all constraints.",Guess 3: stony -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game of Wordle. Since it's the first guess, we want to pick a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically has a mix of common letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. Common vowels and consonants in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, S, etc.

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and includes both vowels (A, E) and consonants.

Another common word is ""CRANE"". Both ""SLATE"" and ""CRANE"" are good choices.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess. It has common letters and contains two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: x (not in the word)
N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the fourth letter is N)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _

We must avoid using the letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'N' as the fourth letter.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words with N in the fourth position:

Let's list some words that end with ""N"" (but note: the fourth letter is N, so the word ends with a consonant and then N? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is N, so the word pattern is ???N?.

Examples:
- ...N. : like ""URBAN"", but U and B are new, but we have to avoid A (which is in URBAN) -> not allowed because A is excluded.
- We need words without C, R, A, E.

Let me think of words that have N in the fourth position and don't contain C, R, A, E.

Some possibilities:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> N is the fourth letter. But does it contain excluded letters? C? no. R? no. A? no. E? no. So it's okay.
- ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> similarly, no excluded letters.
- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> no excluded letters.
- ""COUNT"": but C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BOUND"": B, O, U, N, D -> no excluded letters? B, O, U, N, D: no C, R, A, E -> okay.

But we also want to test new letters. We haven't tried P, O, I, T (in POINT) or M, O, U, T (in MOUNT) or B, O, U, D (in BOUND).

We should also consider that we know the fourth letter is N, so we can focus on the other positions.

Another idea: since we have only one correct letter (N) and we know four letters that are absent, we can try a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, I, T and we know N is in the fourth position.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that N is in the correct position, so in ""POINT"", we are placing N in the same correct position.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has more common vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels must be I, O, U, or sometimes Y.

But in ""POINT"", we have O and I.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. This uses S, H, U, T.

But we don't know if H is common.

""POINT"" seems good.

But let me check if there are words that have more than one of the common letters.

We might also consider ""BLIND"", but B, L, I, N, D: but we don't know if L and D are in the word. However, we are trying to get information.

But note: we must avoid R, A, E, C.

Another word: ""SPOON"" -> S, P, O, O, N. But the fourth letter is O? No, we need the fourth letter to be N. In ""SPOON"", the fourth letter is O, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, the word must be of the form ???N?.

Let me list a few more:
- ""STAIN"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""PLAIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""TRAIN"": R and A excluded -> invalid.
- ""BEGIN"": E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""MINUS"": M, I, N, U, S -> fourth letter is U? No, we need the fourth to be N. In MINUS: M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is U, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the word must have N at position 4.

So, the pattern is: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> but the fourth letter is O? Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> no, we need the fourth to be N, so that's not it.

I think I'm getting confused. The fourth letter must be N, so in a five-letter word, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So, for example:
- ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is A, not N. We need the fourth letter to be N, so that would be the second last? Actually, in a five-letter word:
Position 1: first
Position 2: second
Position 3: third
Position 4: fourth
Position 5: fifth

So, for the word to have N at position 4, then the word is: _ _ _ N _

So, the last letter can be anything.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes, fourth is N.
- ""JOINT"": J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
- ""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
- ""BOUND"": B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- ""FOUND"": F(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but F is new, but we can use it.
- ""HOUND"": H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- ""MOUND"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)

But note: we must avoid C, R, A, E.

So, ""FOUND"" has F, O, U, N, D -> no C, R, A, E -> valid.

But we already have N in the correct position, so we don't need to test that again. We can use a word that has N in the fourth position and tests new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible in the other positions.

In ""POINT"", we test P, O, I, T (and N is fixed).
In ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

We haven't tried O, U, I, T, M, P, etc.

Another word: ""SHINY"" -> S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> that works, and we test S, H, I, Y.

But Y is less common.

""POINT"" seems solid.

But let me see if we can include S, which is a very common letter.

A word like ""STUNG"": S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> that tests S, T, U, G.

But we don't have O or I.

Alternatively, ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> tests S, L, I, G.

That might be good because we test S and L, which are common.

But we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

""SLING"" has S, L, I, N, G -> no excluded letters.

Similarly, ""SWING"": S, W, I, N, G -> W is less common.

""SLING"" or ""POINT""?

We might also consider ""BLINK"": B, L, I, N, K -> but K is new.

But let's choose one.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T).

Alternatively, ""SLING"" tests S and L, which are also common.

But we have only one guess so far, so we can choose either.

I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

So, the next guess is ""POINT"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""point"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter, marked with ""✓"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _ (where the fourth letter is N, and the other letters are unknown). The letters C, R, A, and E must be excluded from the new guess.

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It includes N in the fourth position (to maintain the known correct placement).
- It uses new, common letters (P, O, I, T) that haven't been tested yet, maximizing potential information gain.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).
- ""POINT"" is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or T are in the secret word and their positions, while confirming the fixed N.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - This means:
     - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
     - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess: ""point"" -> P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)
   - This means:
     - N is again confirmed in the 4th position (we already knew that).
     - O is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked with ""-"" for wrong position).
     - T is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").
     - P and I are not in the word (marked with ""x"").

So, combining the feedback:

- Correct position: The 4th letter is N.
- Present but wrong position: O and T are in the word, but O is not in position 2, and T is not in position 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- 4th letter: N
- Contains O and T (but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, I

Also, from the first guess, we know the word is of the form: _ _ _ N _

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes O and T (since we know they are in the word, but we don't know their positions) and we can try to find their correct positions.
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.
- Uses new letters to test for other possibilities.

We know O and T are present, so we should try to place them in different positions to test.

Possible positions for O: It cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point""). So O can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, T cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback). So T can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is fixed as N.

So, the word: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We know O is in the word but not at position 2, so O must be at 1, 3, or 5.
T is in the word but not at position 5, so T must be at 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to consider that there might be other letters we haven't tried.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, E, P, I, O, N, T (but O, N, T are in the word, so we can reuse O and T? Actually, in Wordle, we can reuse letters that are known to be in the word to test positions, but in this case, we are allowed to use any letters as long as we avoid the absent ones.

But note: we know O and T are present, so we should include them in the next guess to find their correct positions. Also, we can introduce new letters to test for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions to find are 1,2,3,5 (with 4 fixed as N).

We have two known present letters: O and T. So we need to assign them to two of the positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints:
- O cannot be at 2 (from feedback)
- T cannot be at 5

Also, we must fill the other two positions with new letters.

But we have four positions and two known letters to place, so we need two new letters.

We should try a word that places O and T in positions that are possible and test new letters for the other positions.

Let's list possible positions for O and T:

For O: positions 1, 3, 5
For T: positions 1, 2, 3

But note: if we put O and T in the same word, they might be in different positions.

We also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Now, we can form a word that has:
- N at position 4
- O at one of {1,3,5}
- T at one of {1,2,3}
- And two new letters.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, let's consider placing O at position 1 and T at position 2: then the word would be O T ? N ?

But we need to fill position 3 and 5.

For example: O T _ N _

Possible words: 
- ""OTTER"" but T is repeated? And E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.
- ""OTIUM"" - not a common word.

Place O at position 1 and T at position 3: then O _ T N _

Example: ""OUTED"" but E and D? But E is excluded -> invalid.

Place O at position 1 and T at position 1? Impossible, same position.

O at 1, T at 2: as above.

O at 1, T at 3: O _ T N _

We need a word: O ? T N ?

With no C,R,A,E,P,I.

Possible: ""OUTDO"" -> O U T D O? But that's 5 letters: O(1), U(2), T(3), D(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, not D. So invalid.

We must have N at 4.

So, O ? T N ? -> positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:T, 4:N, 5:?

With no C,R,A,E,P,I.

What can be at position 2 and 5? Letters not excluded.

Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O at 1, so that's fine) and must be a new letter.

Possible: ""MUTON"" -> M U T O N? That's M(1), U(2), T(3), O(4), N(5) -> but position 4 is O, not N. We need position 4 to be N.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, for O at 1 and T at 3: word is O [letter2] T N [letter5]

Example: ""OFTEN"" -> O F T E N -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""OCTAN"" -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

Not many options.

Now, place O at position 3 and T at position 1: then T _ O N _

Word: T ? O N ?

Example: ""TALON"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
""THONG"" -> T H O N G -> this seems good? T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5). 
Check letters: T, H, O, N, G. 
Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I are absent, so H, O, N, G, T are allowed? O and T are known present, H and G are new.
But we have O at position 3 and T at position 1.

Is ""THONG"" a valid word? Yes.

But let's see the constraints: 
- O is at position 3, which is allowed (since O cannot be at 2, but 3 is fine).
- T is at position 1, which is allowed (T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).

Also, we are testing H and G.

Another possibility: place O at position 3 and T at position 2: then ? T O N ?

Word: [1] T O N [5]

Example: ""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> but E is excluded -> invalid.
""ATONE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
""STONY"" -> S T O N Y -> S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). 
Letters: S, T, O, N, Y. No absent letters? S, T, O, N, Y: T and O are known, S and Y are new. And E is not present? Yes, E is absent so it's okay.

But we have T at position 2: is that allowed? T cannot be at position 5, but position 2 is okay.

Similarly, O at position 3 is okay.

So ""STONY"" is a candidate.

Now, place O at position 5: then we have to place T at one of 1,2,3.

If O at 5, then word: [1] [2] [3] N O

And T must be at 1,2, or 3.

For example, T at 1: T ? ? N O
""TUNGO"" -> T U N G O? Positions: T(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it's G -> invalid.

T at 1: T [2] [3] N O

Example: ""TURNO"" -> T U R N O -> but R is excluded -> invalid.
""TAMBO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

T at 2: ? T ? N O
Example: ""STUNO"" -> not a word.
""UTTER"" -> U T T E R -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

T at 3: ? ? T N O
Example: ""MUTTO"" -> not common.
""BITTO"" -> B I T T O -> I excluded -> invalid.

So, it seems difficult to have O at position 5.

Therefore, better to have O at position 3 or 1? But earlier we had ""THONG"" and ""STONY"" as candidates.

Another candidate: place O at position 1 and T at position 5? But T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So, let's list the candidates we have:

1. ""THONG"": T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)
   - Tests T at 1, O at 3, and new letters H and G.

2. ""STONY"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)
   - Tests T at 2, O at 3, and new letters S and Y.

We also have the possibility of O at position 1 and T at position 3, but we couldn't find a good word without excluded letters.

Another word: ""TOUCH"" but C is excluded -> invalid.

""DOUBT"" -> D O U B T -> O(2), but O cannot be at position 2? In ""DOUBT"", O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot put O at 2.

Similarly, we cannot put T at 5.

So, back to the candidates.

We can also consider placing O at position 5? But we had trouble, but let's try: O at 5, and T at position 1: T ? ? N O

What words? ""THYNO"" not a word.

""TYNGO"" not a word.

Place O at 5 and T at 2: ? T ? N O

""STUNO"" not a word.

""ATINO"" not a word.

Place O at 5 and T at 3: ? ? T N O

""UNTIL"" -> U N T I L -> but position 4 is T? U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> not N at 4.

We need N at 4.

""ANTIC"" -> A excluded.

So, it seems hard to have O at 5.

Therefore, let's focus on O at 1 or 3.

Another word with O at 1: O _ _ N _

With T in the word? But T must be at 1,2,3 but O is at 1, so T at 2 or 3.

If T at 2: O T ? N ?

Words: ""OTARY"" not common.
""OTAKU"" not English.

If T at 3: O ? T N ?

Words: ""OFTEN"" has E -> invalid.
""OCTAN"" has C -> invalid.
""OUTGO"" -> O U T G O -> O(1), U(2), T(3), G(4), O(5) -> position 4 is G, not N -> invalid.

So, no common words with O at 1 and T at 3 with N at 4.

Therefore, the best options are ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".

Now, which one to choose?

In ""THONG"", we test T at position 1 and O at position 3, and new letters H and G.

In ""STONY"", we test T at position 2 and O at position 3, and new letters S and Y.

S is a very common letter, so testing S might be good.

Similarly, H and G are also common.

But we have to consider that if we put T at position 2, and if the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly for O.

But in ""STONY"", we are putting O at 3, which is a possible position.

We know O is not at 2, so it must be at 1,3, or5. We are testing 3.

Similarly, T is not at 5, so it must be at 1,2,3. We are testing 2.

If we get feedback that T is not at 2, then T must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly for O.

But in ""THONG"", we are testing T at 1 and O at 3.

We might get more information.

Another candidate: what about ""MOUNT""? But in the first guess, we didn't have M, but M is not excluded.

""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot use ""MOUNT"" because it places O at 2.

Similarly, ""BOUND"" has O at 2 -> invalid.

""FOUND"" same.

So, not possible.

Another word: ""TONGS"" -> T O N G S -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it's G -> invalid.

We need position 4 to be N.

So, back to ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".

I think ""STONY"" is a better choice because S is a very common letter, and Y might be at the end.

Also, ""STONY"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SHOWN"" but position 4 must be N, so ""SHOWN"" is S H O W N -> S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 4 is W, not N -> invalid.

""SHUNT"": S H U N T -> S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is at position 5, but T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.

Therefore, ""SHUNT"" is invalid because it places T at 5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this has T at 2 and N at 4, but what about O? We know O is in the word, but ""STUNG"" does not have O. We must include O because we know it is present.

Important: we know O is in the word, so we must include O in the guess to find its position. Similarly for T.

In the next guess, we should include both O and T to test their positions, along with N at 4.

Therefore, the guess must contain O and T.

In ""STUNG"", there is no O, so it doesn't help us with O's position.

Similarly, ""THONG"" has O and T, and N at 4.

""STONY"" has O and T, and N at 4.

""THONG"": T at 1, O at 3
""STONY"": T at 2, O at 3

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""STONY"" because it tests S, which is a common letter.

So, let's choose ""STONY"".

But in ""STONY"", we have O at position 3, which we are testing, and T at position 2.

If the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, if O is not at position 3, then O must be at 1 or 5.

But we are hoping to get some correct positions.

Another word: ""TOWNS"" -> T O W N S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed -> invalid.

""TOUCH"" invalid.

So, I think ""STONY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""STONY"".

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, O, N, Y.

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I. None of these are in ""STONY"", so it's okay.

And N is at position 4.

So, we'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)**  
  This indicates that:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.  

- **Guess 2: ""point"" → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)**  
  This adds:  
  - O is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
  - T is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - P and I are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ _ _ N _` (4th letter is N).  
- **Confirmed present letters**: O and T (but with incorrect positions).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I (cannot be used).  
- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Position constraints for T**: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- The word must include O and T, as they are confirmed present, and we need to test their positions.  
- New letters should be introduced to maximize information gain (e.g., common consonants like S, L, or H).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Must include**: O and T to test their positions, and N in the 4th position.  
- **Avoid**: C, R, A, E, P, I.  
- **Prioritize**: Testing O in position 3 (a likely candidate) and T in position 2 (to check if it fits), while introducing new common letters like S and Y for coverage.  
- **Chosen word: ""STONY""**  
  - S (position 1): New letter, tests a common consonant.  
  - T (position 2): Tests if T is correctly placed in position 2 (if not, T must be in 1 or 3).  
  - O (position 3): Tests if O is correctly placed in position 3 (if not, O must be in 1 or 5).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed correct position.  
  - Y (position 5): New letter, tests a less common vowel/consonant.  
- This guess efficiently tests key positions for O and T, covers new letters, and adheres to all constraints.

Since it\'s the first guess, we want to pick a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically has a mix of common letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. Common vowels and consonants in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, S, etc.\n\nOne popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and includes both vowels (A, E) and consonants.\n\nAnother common word is ""CRANE"". Both ""SLATE"" and ""CRANE"" are good choices.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess. It has common letters and contains two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n\nSo, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\nC: x (not in the word)\nR: x (not in the word)\nA: x (not in the word)\nN: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the fourth letter is N)\nE: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The fourth letter of the secret word is N.\n- The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _\n\nWe must avoid using the letters C, R, A, E in our next guess.\n\nNow, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has \'N\' as the fourth letter.\n- Does not contain C, R, A, E.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible words with N in the fourth position:\n\nLet\'s list some words that end with ""N"" (but note: the fourth letter is N, so the word ends with a consonant and then N? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is N, so the word pattern is ???N?.\n\nExamples:\n- ...N. : like ""URBAN"", but U and B are new, but we have to avoid A (which is in URBAN) -> not allowed because A is excluded.\n- We need words without C, R, A, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have N in the fourth position and don\'t contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> N is the fourth letter. But does it contain excluded letters? C? no. R? no. A? no. E? no. So it\'s okay.\n- ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> similarly, no excluded letters.\n- ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> no excluded letters.\n- ""COUNT"": but C is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BOUND"": B, O, U, N, D -> no excluded letters? B, O, U, N, D: no C, R, A, E -> okay.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters. We haven\'t tried P, O, I, T (in POINT) or M, O, U, T (in MOUNT) or B, O, U, D (in BOUND).\n\nWe should also consider that we know the fourth letter is N, so we can focus on the other positions.\n\nAnother idea: since we have only one correct letter (N) and we know four letters that are absent, we can try a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, I, T and we know N is in the fourth position.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that N is in the correct position, so in ""POINT"", we are placing N in the same correct position.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has more common vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels must be I, O, U, or sometimes Y.\n\nBut in ""POINT"", we have O and I.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. This uses S, H, U, T.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H is common.\n\n""POINT"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there are words that have more than one of the common letters.\n\nWe might also consider ""BLIND"", but B, L, I, N, D: but we don\'t know if L and D are in the word. However, we are trying to get information.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, A, E, C.\n\nAnother word: ""SPOON"" -> S, P, O, O, N. But the fourth letter is O? No, we need the fourth letter to be N. In ""SPOON"", the fourth letter is O, not N. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N.\n\nSo, the word must be of the form ???N?.\n\nLet me list a few more:\n- ""STAIN"": but A is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""PLAIN"": A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""TRAIN"": R and A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BEGIN"": E is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""MINUS"": M, I, N, U, S -> fourth letter is U? No, we need the fourth to be N. In MINUS: M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is U, not N. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N, so the word must have N at position 4.\n\nSo, the pattern is: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> but the fourth letter is O? Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> no, we need the fourth to be N, so that\'s not it.\n\nI think I\'m getting confused. The fourth letter must be N, so in a five-letter word, the fourth letter is the one before the last.\n\nSo, for example:\n- ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is A, not N. We need the fourth letter to be N, so that would be the second last? Actually, in a five-letter word:\nPosition 1: first\nPosition 2: second\nPosition 3: third\nPosition 4: fourth\nPosition 5: fifth\n\nSo, for the word to have N at position 4, then the word is: _ _ _ N _\n\nSo, the last letter can be anything.\n\nFor example:\n- ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes, fourth is N.\n- ""JOINT"": J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)\n- ""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)\n- ""BOUND"": B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)\n- ""FOUND"": F(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but F is new, but we can use it.\n- ""HOUND"": H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)\n- ""MOUND"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)\n\nBut note: we must avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nSo, ""FOUND"" has F, O, U, N, D -> no C, R, A, E -> valid.\n\nBut we already have N in the correct position, so we don\'t need to test that again. We can use a word that has N in the fourth position and tests new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible in the other positions.\n\nIn ""POINT"", we test P, O, I, T (and N is fixed).\nIn ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, U, I, T, M, P, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""SHINY"" -> S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> that works, and we test S, H, I, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""POINT"" seems solid.\n\nBut let me see if we can include S, which is a very common letter.\n\nA word like ""STUNG"": S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> that tests S, T, U, G.\n\nBut we don\'t have O or I.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> tests S, L, I, G.\n\nThat might be good because we test S and L, which are common.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n""SLING"" has S, L, I, N, G -> no excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""SWING"": S, W, I, N, G -> W is less common.\n\n""SLING"" or ""POINT""?\n\nWe might also consider ""BLINK"": B, L, I, N, K -> but K is new.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T).\n\nAlternatively, ""SLING"" tests S and L, which are also common.\n\nBut we have only one guess so far, so we can choose either.\n\nI\'ll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""POINT"".\n\nBut note: we must make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""point"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter, marked with ""✓"").\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _ (where the fourth letter is N, and the other letters are unknown). The letters C, R, A, and E must be excluded from the new guess.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:\n- It includes N in the fourth position (to maintain the known correct placement).\n- It uses new, common letters (P, O, I, T) that haven\'t been tested yet, maximizing potential information gain.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n- ""POINT"" is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or T are in the secret word and their positions, while confirming the fixed N.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

So O can be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, T cannot be in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback). So T can be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is fixed as N.\n\nSo, the word: [1] [2] [3] N [5]\n\nWe know O is in the word but not at position 2, so O must be at 1, 3, or 5.\nT is in the word but not at position 5, so T must be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe also need to consider that there might be other letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nAvailable letters: We have used: C, R, A, E, P, I, O, N, T (but O, N, T are in the word, so we can reuse O and T? Actually, in Wordle, we can reuse letters that are known to be in the word to test positions, but in this case, we are allowed to use any letters as long as we avoid the absent ones.\n\nBut note: we know O and T are present, so we should include them in the next guess to find their correct positions. Also, we can introduce new letters to test for the remaining positions.\n\nThe remaining positions to find are 1,2,3,5 (with 4 fixed as N).\n\nWe have two known present letters: O and T. So we need to assign them to two of the positions 1,2,3,5, but with constraints:\n- O cannot be at 2 (from feedback)\n- T cannot be at 5\n\nAlso, we must fill the other two positions with new letters.\n\nBut we have four positions and two known letters to place, so we need two new letters.\n\nWe should try a word that places O and T in positions that are possible and test new letters for the other positions.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for O and T:\n\nFor O: positions 1, 3, 5\nFor T: positions 1, 2, 3\n\nBut note: if we put O and T in the same word, they might be in different positions.\n\nWe also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, U, D, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nNow, we can form a word that has:\n- N at position 4\n- O at one of {1,3,5}\n- T at one of {1,2,3}\n- And two new letters.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.\n\nFirst, let\'s consider placing O at position 1 and T at position 2: then the word would be O T ? N ?\n\nBut we need to fill position 3 and 5.\n\nFor example: O T _ N _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""OTTER"" but T is repeated? And E is excluded -> invalid because E is absent.\n- ""OTIUM"" - not a common word.\n\nPlace O at position 1 and T at position 3: then O _ T N _\n\nExample: ""OUTED"" but E and D? But E is excluded -> invalid.\n\nPlace O at position 1 and T at position 1? Impossible, same position.\n\nO at 1, T at 2: as above.\n\nO at 1, T at 3: O _ T N _\n\nWe need a word: O ? T N ?\n\nWith no C,R,A,E,P,I.\n\nPossible: ""OUTDO"" -> O U T D O? But that\'s 5 letters: O(1), U(2), T(3), D(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, not D. So invalid.\n\nWe must have N at 4.\n\nSo, O ? T N ? -> positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:T, 4:N, 5:?\n\nWith no C,R,A,E,P,I.\n\nWhat can be at position 2 and 5? Letters not excluded.\n\nPosition 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O at 1, so that\'s fine) and must be a new letter.\n\nPossible: ""MUTON"" -> M U T O N? That\'s M(1), U(2), T(3), O(4), N(5) -> but position 4 is O, not N. We need position 4 to be N.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N.\n\nSo, for O at 1 and T at 3: word is O [letter2] T N [letter5]\n\nExample: ""OFTEN"" -> O F T E N -> but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""OCTAN"" -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nNot many options.\n\nNow, place O at position 3 and T at position 1: then T _ O N _\n\nWord: T ? O N ?\n\nExample: ""TALON"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n""THONG"" -> T H O N G -> this seems good? T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5). \nCheck letters: T, H, O, N, G. \nAbsent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I are absent, so H, O, N, G, T are allowed? O and T are known present, H and G are new.\nBut we have O at position 3 and T at position 1.\n\nIs ""THONG"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see the constraints: \n- O is at position 3, which is allowed (since O cannot be at 2, but 3 is fine).\n- T is at position 1, which is allowed (T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).\n\nAlso, we are testing H and G.\n\nAnother possibility: place O at position 3 and T at position 2: then ? T O N ?\n\nWord: [1] T O N [5]\n\nExample: ""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> but E is excluded -> invalid.\n""ATONE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n""STONY"" -> S T O N Y -> S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). \nLetters: S, T, O, N, Y. No absent letters? S, T, O, N, Y: T and O are known, S and Y are new. And E is not present? Yes, E is absent so it\'s okay.\n\nBut we have T at position 2: is that allowed? T cannot be at position 5, but position 2 is okay.\n\nSimilarly, O at position 3 is okay.\n\nSo ""STONY"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, place O at position 5: then we have to place T at one of 1,2,3.\n\nIf O at 5, then word: [1] [2] [3] N O\n\nAnd T must be at 1,2, or 3.\n\nFor example, T at 1: T ? ? N O\n""TUNGO"" -> T U N G O? Positions: T(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it\'s G -> invalid.\n\nT at 1: T [2] [3] N O\n\nExample: ""TURNO"" -> T U R N O -> but R is excluded -> invalid.\n""TAMBO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\nT at 2: ? T ? N O\nExample: ""STUNO"" -> not a word.\n""UTTER"" -> U T T E R -> E and R excluded -> invalid.\n\nT at 3: ? ? T N O\nExample: ""MUTTO"" -> not common.\n""BITTO"" -> B I T T O -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo, it seems difficult to have O at position 5.\n\nTherefore, better to have O at position 3 or 1? But earlier we had ""THONG"" and ""STONY"" as candidates.\n\nAnother candidate: place O at position 1 and T at position 5? But T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at position 2.\n\nSo, let\'s list the candidates we have:\n\n1. ""THONG"": T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)\n   - Tests T at 1, O at 3, and new letters H and G.\n\n2. ""STONY"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)\n   - Tests T at 2, O at 3, and new letters S and Y.\n\nWe also have the possibility of O at position 1 and T at position 3, but we couldn\'t find a good word without excluded letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TOUCH"" but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""DOUBT"" -> D O U B T -> O(2), but O cannot be at position 2? In ""DOUBT"", O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot put O at 2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put T at 5.\n\nSo, back to the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider placing O at position 5? But we had trouble, but let\'s try: O at 5, and T at position 1: T ? ? N O\n\nWhat words? ""THYNO"" not a word.\n\n""TYNGO"" not a word.\n\nPlace O at 5 and T at 2: ? T ? N O\n\n""STUNO"" not a word.\n\n""ATINO"" not a word.\n\nPlace O at 5 and T at 3: ? ? T N O\n\n""UNTIL"" -> U N T I L -> but position 4 is T? U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> not N at 4.\n\nWe need N at 4.\n\n""ANTIC"" -> A excluded.\n\nSo, it seems hard to have O at 5.\n\nTherefore, let\'s focus on O at 1 or 3.\n\nAnother word with O at 1: O _ _ N _\n\nWith T in the word? But T must be at 1,2,3 but O is at 1, so T at 2 or 3.\n\nIf T at 2: O T ? N ?\n\nWords: ""OTARY"" not common.\n""OTAKU"" not English.\n\nIf T at 3: O ? T N ?\n\nWords: ""OFTEN"" has E -> invalid.\n""OCTAN"" has C -> invalid.\n""OUTGO"" -> O U T G O -> O(1), U(2), T(3), G(4), O(5) -> position 4 is G, not N -> invalid.\n\nSo, no common words with O at 1 and T at 3 with N at 4.\n\nTherefore, the best options are ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nIn ""THONG"", we test T at position 1 and O at position 3, and new letters H and G.\n\nIn ""STONY"", we test T at position 2 and O at position 3, and new letters S and Y.\n\nS is a very common letter, so testing S might be good.\n\nSimilarly, H and G are also common.\n\nBut we have to consider that if we put T at position 2, and if the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for O.\n\nBut in ""STONY"", we are putting O at 3, which is a possible position.\n\nWe know O is not at 2, so it must be at 1,3, or5. We are testing 3.\n\nSimilarly, T is not at 5, so it must be at 1,2,3. We are testing 2.\n\nIf we get feedback that T is not at 2, then T must be at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for O.\n\nBut in ""THONG"", we are testing T at 1 and O at 3.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""MOUNT""? But in the first guess, we didn\'t have M, but M is not excluded.\n\n""MOUNT"": M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed because from ""point"" feedback, O is not at position 2. So we cannot use ""MOUNT"" because it places O at 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOUND"" has O at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""FOUND"" same.\n\nSo, not possible.\n\nAnother word: ""TONGS"" -> T O N G S -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> but position 4 must be N, here it\'s G -> invalid.\n\nWe need position 4 to be N.\n\nSo, back to ""THONG"" and ""STONY"".\n\nI think ""STONY"" is a better choice because S is a very common letter, and Y might be at the end.\n\nAlso, ""STONY"" is a common word.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHOWN"" but position 4 must be N, so ""SHOWN"" is S H O W N -> S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 4 is W, not N -> invalid.\n\n""SHUNT"": S H U N T -> S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> but T is at position 5, but T cannot be at position 5! From feedback, T is not at position 5, so we cannot put T at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""SHUNT"" is invalid because it places T at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> S(1), T(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this has T at 2 and N at 4, but what about O? We know O is in the word, but ""STUNG"" does not have O. We must include O because we know it is present.\n\nImportant: we know O is in the word, so we must include O in the guess to find its position. Similarly for T.\n\nIn the next guess, we should include both O and T to test their positions, along with N at 4.\n\nTherefore, the guess must contain O and T.\n\nIn ""STUNG"", there is no O, so it doesn\'t help us with O\'s position.\n\nSimilarly, ""THONG"" has O and T, and N at 4.\n\n""STONY"" has O and T, and N at 4.\n\n""THONG"": T at 1, O at 3\n""STONY"": T at 2, O at 3\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""STONY"" because it tests S, which is a common letter.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""STONY"".\n\nBut in ""STONY"", we have O at position 3, which we are testing, and T at position 2.\n\nIf the feedback shows that T is not at position 2, then we know T must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, if O is not at position 3, then O must be at 1 or 5.\n\nBut we are hoping to get some correct positions.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWNS"" -> T O W N S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> but O is at position 2, which is not allowed -> invalid.\n\n""TOUCH"" invalid.\n\nSo, I think ""STONY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""STONY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: S, T, O, N, Y.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I.

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are absent.

2. **point**: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)
   - O is present but not in position 2.
   - T is present but not in position 5.
   - P and I are absent.

3. **stony**: S(x) T(-) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd) → so O is at position 3.
   - N is in the correct position (4th) → confirmed.
   - T is present but not in position 2 (since it's ""-"" at position 2 in ""stony"").
   - S and Y are absent.

### What we know now:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: N
  - So the word is: _ _ O N _
- **Present letters with constraints**:
  - T is in the word but not at position 2 or 5. Since positions 3 and 4 are taken by O and N, T must be at position 1 (the only remaining possibility, since position 2 is also disallowed by the feedback from ""stony"").
    - From ""point"" feedback, T is not at 5.
    - From ""stony"" feedback, T is not at 2 (since the ""-"" at position 2 means it's not correct there).
    - T must be in the word, so it must be at position 1.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, S, Y (so these cannot be used).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: Position 1, 2, and 5. But position 1 must be T (as deduced), so only positions 2 and 5 need to be filled.

Therefore:
- Position 1: T (since it must be there and no other position left).
- Positions: 1:T, 2:?, 3:O, 4:N, 5:?

The secret word is T _ O N _

Now, we need to guess a word that fits this pattern with N at 4 and O at 3, T at 1, and avoids absent letters.

Also, the letter at position 2 and 5 must be from the remaining available letters.

### Available letters:
We have avoided: C, R, A, E, P, I, S, Y.

Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

But we must find a valid English word of the form T ? O N ?

### Candidate words:
- The second and fifth positions need letters that form a real word.

Common words fitting T?ON?:
- ""TONGS"" has T O N G S, but position 2 should be O? No: T(1),? O N? Actually, in TONGS: T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) → but our pattern is T(1), ?(2), O(3), N(4), ?(5). So ""TONGS"" doesn't match because O is at 2 and N at 3, not O at 3 and N at 4.

We need a word that matches T [letter2] O N [letter5].

Examples:
- ""TROOP"" but R is absent → invalid.
- ""THONG"": T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) → valid? Let's check absent letters: H and G are not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,A,E,P,I,S,Y. So H and G are acceptable.
- ""TONGUE"": T O N G U E → E absent → invalid.
- ""TONNE"": T O N N E → E absent → invalid.
- ""TONIC"": I and C absent → invalid.
- ""THONG"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""CHRON"" not English.
- ""BROWN"" but R absent → invalid.
- ""FLOWN"" F L O W N → pattern: F? You need T at start.

The word must start with T.

So, let's list words: T ? O N ?

- ""THONK""? Not common.
- ""THOON""? Not common.
- ""THONG"": T H O N G → matches T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5).
- ""TRONS"" → R absent → invalid.
- ""TOONS"" → O at position 2? T O O N S → position 2 and 3: O and O? But our pattern requires position 3 to be O, position 2 to be something else. In ""TOONS"": T(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) → O is at both 2 and 3? But S is absent → invalid.

""BRONC"" but C absent → invalid.

So, ""THONG"" seems like a good candidate.

Another word: ""TOUCH"" → C absent → invalid.

""DOUGH"" not starting with T.

Therefore, ""THONG"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to confirm that G and H are allowed. Yes, since they haven't been tested and aren't in the absent list.

Moreover, in feedback:
- From ""stony"", Y is absent, but H and G weren't tested.

Also, note that in ""stony"", we guessed S, T, O, N, Y. S and Y were absent, but T, O, N were discussed.

For the fourth guess, we can guess ""THONG"" to confirm.

But since position 1,3,4 are fixed as T,O,N, we need to test position 2 and 5.

However, ""THONG"" uses H and G.

If ""THONG"" is the secret word, we win. Otherwise, the feedback will tell us about H and G.

But are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""TALON"" but A absent → invalid.

""THORN"" → T H O R N → but R is absent → invalid.

""TOKEN"" → O at 2? T O K E N → E absent → invalid.

""TONUS"" → T O N U S → O at 2? Pattern mismatch: T(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) → not our pattern.

""TUN"" less than 5 letters.

So, ""THONG"" seems the most common word.

Another possibility: ""SHOWN"" starts with S, not T.

""GOWN"" too short.

Thus, ""THONG"" is a valid English word that fits the pattern.

We can guess ""THONG"".

But let's see if we have other options.

""CLOWN"" has C → invalid.

So, I think ""THONG"" is the best guess.

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""THONG"".
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, E (not in the word).  
  - Correct position: N at position 4.  
  → Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ N _`.  

- **Guess 2 (""point""):**  
  - Absent letters: P, I (not in the word).  
  - Present but wrong position: O (not at position 2), T (not at position 5).  
  → O must be in position 1, 3, or 5; T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

- **Guess 3 (""stony""):**  
  - Absent letters: S, Y (not in the word).  
  - Correct positions: O at position 3, N at position 4.  
  - Present but wrong position: T (not at position 2).  
  → T cannot be at position 2 or 5, so it must be at position 1 (only remaining option).  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: O  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 1: T (since T is present and cannot be at positions 2 or 5, leaving position 1 as the only option).  
- **Secret word pattern**: `T _ O N _`.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, S, Y (cannot be used).  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 2: Must be a letter not absent (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).  
  - Position 5: Must similarly avoid absent letters.  
- **Constraints**: The word must be a valid English word fitting `T ? O N ?`.

### Next Guess:
Given the pattern `T _ O N _`, common words like ""THONG"" fit well:  
- T (1), H (2), O (3), N (4), G (5).  
- Tests new letters: H (position 2) and G (position 5).  
- Avoids all absent letters.  
- ""THONG"" is a valid English word that could be the solution or provide critical feedback on positions 2 and 5.

<guess>thong</guess>",thong,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - C, R, A, E are absent.

2. **point**: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(✓) T(-)
   - O is present but not in position 2.
   - T is present but not in position 5.
   - P and I are absent.

3. **stony**: S(x) T(-) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd) → so O is at position 3.
   - N is in the correct position (4th) → confirmed.
   - T is present but not in position 2 (since it's ""-"" at position 2 in ""stony"").
   - S and Y are absent.

### What we know now:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: N
  - So the word is: _ _ O N _
- **Present letters with constraints**:
  - T is in the word but not at position 2 or 5. Since positions 3 and 4 are taken by O and N, T must be at position 1 (the only remaining possibility, since position 2 is also disallowed by the feedback from ""stony"").
    - From ""point"" feedback, T is not at 5.
    - From ""stony"" feedback, T is not at 2 (since the ""-"" at position 2 means it's not correct there).
    - T must be in the word, so it must be at position 1.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, S, Y (so these cannot be used).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: Position 1, 2, and 5. But position 1 must be T (as deduced), so only positions 2 and 5 need to be filled.

Therefore:
- Position 1: T (since it must be there and no other position left).
- Positions: 1:T, 2:?, 3:O, 4:N, 5:?

The secret word is T _ O N _

Now, we need to guess a word that fits this pattern with N at 4 and O at 3, T at 1, and avoids absent letters.

Also, the letter at position 2 and 5 must be from the remaining available letters.

### Available letters:
We have avoided: C, R, A, E, P, I, S, Y.

Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

But we must find a valid English word of the form T ? O N ?

### Candidate words:
- The second and fifth positions need letters that form a real word.

Common words fitting T?ON?:
- ""TONGS"" has T O N G S, but position 2 should be O? No: T(1),? O N? Actually, in TONGS: T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) → but our pattern is T(1), ?(2), O(3), N(4), ?(5). So ""TONGS"" doesn't match because O is at 2 and N at 3, not O at 3 and N at 4.

We need a word that matches T [letter2] O N [letter5].

Examples:
- ""TROOP"" but R is absent → invalid.
- ""THONG"": T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) → valid? Let's check absent letters: H and G are not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,A,E,P,I,S,Y. So H and G are acceptable.
- ""TONGUE"": T O N G U E → E absent → invalid.
- ""TONNE"": T O N N E → E absent → invalid.
- ""TONIC"": I and C absent → invalid.
- ""THONG"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""CHRON"" not English.
- ""BROWN"" but R absent → invalid.
- ""FLOWN"" F L O W N → pattern: F? You need T at start.

The word must start with T.

So, let's list words: T ? O N ?

- ""THONK""? Not common.
- ""THOON""? Not common.
- ""THONG"": T H O N G → matches T(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), G(5).
- ""TRONS"" → R absent → invalid.
- ""TOONS"" → O at position 2? T O O N S → position 2 and 3: O and O? But our pattern requires position 3 to be O, position 2 to be something else. In ""TOONS"": T(1), O(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) → O is at both 2 and 3? But S is absent → invalid.

""BRONC"" but C absent → invalid.

So, ""THONG"" seems like a good candidate.

Another word: ""TOUCH"" → C absent → invalid.

""DOUGH"" not starting with T.

Therefore, ""THONG"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to confirm that G and H are allowed. Yes, since they haven't been tested and aren't in the absent list.

Moreover, in feedback:
- From ""stony"", Y is absent, but H and G weren't tested.

Also, note that in ""stony"", we guessed S, T, O, N, Y. S and Y were absent, but T, O, N were discussed.

For the fourth guess, we can guess ""THONG"" to confirm.

But since position 1,3,4 are fixed as T,O,N, we need to test position 2 and 5.

However, ""THONG"" uses H and G.

If ""THONG"" is the secret word, we win. Otherwise, the feedback will tell us about H and G.

But are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""TALON"" but A absent → invalid.

""THORN"" → T H O R N → but R is absent → invalid.

""TOKEN"" → O at 2? T O K E N → E absent → invalid.

""TONUS"" → T O N U S → O at 2? Pattern mismatch: T(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) → not our pattern.

""TUN"" less than 5 letters.

So, ""THONG"" seems the most common word.

Another possibility: ""SHOWN"" starts with S, not T.

""GOWN"" too short.

Thus, ""THONG"" is a valid English word that fits the pattern.

We can guess ""THONG"".

But let's see if we have other options.

""CLOWN"" has C → invalid.

So, I think ""THONG"" is the best guess.

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""THONG"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, E (not in the word).  
  - Correct position: N at position 4.  
  → Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ N _`.  

- **Guess 2 (""point""):**  
  - Absent letters: P, I (not in the word).  
  - Present but wrong position: O (not at position 2), T (not at position 5).  
  → O must be in position 1, 3, or 5; T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

- **Guess 3 (""stony""):**  
  - Absent letters: S, Y (not in the word).  
  - Correct positions: O at position 3, N at position 4.  
  - Present but wrong position: T (not at position 2).  
  → T cannot be at position 2 or 5, so it must be at position 1 (only remaining option).  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: O  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 1: T (since T is present and cannot be at positions 2 or 5, leaving position 1 as the only option).  
- **Secret word pattern**: `T _ O N _`.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, S, Y (cannot be used).  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 2: Must be a letter not absent (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).  
  - Position 5: Must similarly avoid absent letters.  
- **Constraints**: The word must be a valid English word fitting `T ? O N ?`.

### Next Guess:
Given the pattern `T _ O N _`, common words like ""THONG"" fit well:  
- T (1), H (2), O (3), N (4), G (5).  
- Tests new letters: H (position 2) and G (position 5).  
- Avoids all absent letters.  
- ""THONG"" is a valid English word that could be the solution or provide critical feedback on positions 2 and 5.",Guess 4: thong -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
