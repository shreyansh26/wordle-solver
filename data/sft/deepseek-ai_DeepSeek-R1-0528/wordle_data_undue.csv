We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle are often words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 But note: We want to cover multiple common letters and also have a balanced vowel-consonant mix.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative amount earned on an investment) that is also a good starter? But let me stick to a more common one.

 However, note the rules: we need a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me check: CRANE is a bird or a machine used for lifting. Valid.

 So my first guess: CRANE.

 But note: the feedback will give us information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

 We are going to represent the guess as:
 <guess>CRANE</guess>
</think>
For my first guess, I want to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetition. After considering several options, I chose **CRANE** because:
- It contains five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering frequent consonants and vowels.
- These letters appear in many English words, increasing the likelihood of hits.
- The word is valid and optimally balanced for positional analysis.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

So, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word we are looking for has:
- The fifth letter is E.
- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).
- It does not contain C, R, or A.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We want to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

One strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.

But note: we don't know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven't tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it's correct.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.

Let me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.

Examples:
- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don't know. We have to consider that possibility.

But note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.

- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don't know if that's correct.

We can try ""LINED"":
- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn't match because we need the fifth letter to be E.

We need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.

So the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

And N is in one of positions 1,2,3.

We also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).

Now, let's think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don't know about S, I, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don't know if the word has O, I, S.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don't know.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don't know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.

""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that's a candidate.

Position 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don't know about G and L.

""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).

Position 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it's not there.

So for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.

So we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.

So for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.

We need a valid word of the form ??N?E.

Examples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.

Similarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).

""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.

So these are candidates.

Now, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.

So for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).

We can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover more common letters to get information.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

We must avoid putting N in position 4.

So we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.
- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.

But note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's good.

However, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tested before.

- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.
- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn't end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.

- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.
- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.

We also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don't know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. But we can assume for now.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.

We can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.

But we are not sure about the position of N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.

But we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven't tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.

But ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.

Another candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So we must avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.

But let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.

We can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn't have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.

However, including N might help us find its position.

But note: if we don't include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don't include N, we won't get any indication about N, but we know it's there. So it's better to include N to test a new position.

So I think we should include N.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels or consonants.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.

""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don't know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.

But ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it's a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""NOISE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn't end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn't end with E.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

We are going to guess ""NOISE"".

The word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.

If the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.

If N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it's in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.

So it's informative.

Another candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).

""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.

We can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E's? And doesn't have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don't include it, we don't test a new position.

But I think including N is better.

Another word: ""NEEDY"" doesn't end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.

""NEWIE"" not a word.

I think ""NOISE"" is good.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).

So we are testing if N is in position 1.

If we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.

Either way, we get information.

Also, we test O, I, S.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.
- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.
- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

### Key Insights:
1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.
4. The next guess should:
   - End with E (to leverage the known position).
   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.
   - Avoid C, R, A.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).
  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.
- **Why ""NOISE""?**:
  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.
  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.
  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.

<guess>NOISE</guess>",NOISE,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

So, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word we are looking for has:
- The fifth letter is E.
- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).
- It does not contain C, R, or A.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We want to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

One strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.

But note: we don't know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven't tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it's correct.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.

Let me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.

Examples:
- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don't know. We have to consider that possibility.

But note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.

- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don't know if that's correct.

We can try ""LINED"":
- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn't match because we need the fifth letter to be E.

We need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.

So the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

And N is in one of positions 1,2,3.

We also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).

Now, let's think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don't know about S, I, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don't know if the word has O, I, S.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don't know.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don't know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.

""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that's a candidate.

Position 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don't know about G and L.

""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).

Position 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it's not there.

So for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.

So we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.

So for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.

We need a valid word of the form ??N?E.

Examples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.

Similarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).

""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.

So these are candidates.

Now, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.

So for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).

We can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover more common letters to get information.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

We must avoid putting N in position 4.

So we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.
- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.

But note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's good.

However, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tested before.

- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.
- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn't end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.

- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.
- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.

We also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don't know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. But we can assume for now.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.

We can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.

But we are not sure about the position of N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.

But we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven't tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.

But ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.

Another candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So we must avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.

But let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.

We can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn't have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.

However, including N might help us find its position.

But note: if we don't include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don't include N, we won't get any indication about N, but we know it's there. So it's better to include N to test a new position.

So I think we should include N.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels or consonants.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.

""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don't know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.

But ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it's a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""NOISE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn't end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn't end with E.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

We are going to guess ""NOISE"".

The word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.

If the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.

If N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it's in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.

So it's informative.

Another candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).

""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.

We can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E's? And doesn't have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don't include it, we don't test a new position.

But I think including N is better.

Another word: ""NEEDY"" doesn't end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.

""NEWIE"" not a word.

I think ""NOISE"" is good.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).

So we are testing if N is in position 1.

If we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.

Either way, we get information.

Also, we test O, I, S.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.
- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.
- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

### Key Insights:
1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.
4. The next guess should:
   - End with E (to leverage the known position).
   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.
   - Avoid C, R, A.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).
  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.
- **Why ""NOISE""?**:
  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.
  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.
  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.",Guess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle are often words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 But note: We want to cover multiple common letters and also have a balanced vowel-consonant mix.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative amount earned on an investment) that is also a good starter? But let me stick to a more common one.

 However, note the rules: we need a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me check: CRANE is a bird or a machine used for lifting. Valid.

 So my first guess: CRANE.

 But note: the feedback will give us information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

 We are going to represent the guess as:
 <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I want to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetition. After considering several options, I chose **CRANE** because:
- It contains five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering frequent consonants and vowels.
- These letters appear in many English words, increasing the likelihood of hits.
- The word is valid and optimally balanced for positional analysis.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

So, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word we are looking for has:
- The fifth letter is E.
- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).
- It does not contain C, R, or A.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We want to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

One strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.

But note: we don't know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven't tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it's correct.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.

Let me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.

Examples:
- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don't know. We have to consider that possibility.

But note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.

- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don't know if that's correct.

We can try ""LINED"":
- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn't match because we need the fifth letter to be E.

We need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.

So the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

And N is in one of positions 1,2,3.

We also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).

Now, let's think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don't know about S, I, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don't know if the word has O, I, S.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don't know.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don't know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.

""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that's a candidate.

Position 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don't know about G and L.

""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).

Position 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it's not there.

So for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.

So we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.

So for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.

We need a valid word of the form ??N?E.

Examples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.

Similarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).

""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.

So these are candidates.

Now, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.

So for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).

We can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover more common letters to get information.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

We must avoid putting N in position 4.

So we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.
- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.

But note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's good.

However, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tested before.

- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.
- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn't end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.

- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.
- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.

We also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don't know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. But we can assume for now.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.

We can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.

But we are not sure about the position of N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.

But we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven't tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.

But ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.

Another candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So we must avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.

But let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.

We can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn't have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.

However, including N might help us find its position.

But note: if we don't include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don't include N, we won't get any indication about N, but we know it's there. So it's better to include N to test a new position.

So I think we should include N.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels or consonants.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.

""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don't know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.

But ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it's a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""NOISE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn't end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn't end with E.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

We are going to guess ""NOISE"".

The word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.

If the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.

If N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it's in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.

So it's informative.

Another candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).

""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.

We can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E's? And doesn't have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don't include it, we don't test a new position.

But I think including N is better.

Another word: ""NEEDY"" doesn't end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.

""NEWIE"" not a word.

I think ""NOISE"" is good.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).

So we are testing if N is in position 1.

If we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.

Either way, we get information.

Also, we test O, I, S.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.
- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.
- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

### Key Insights:
1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.
4. The next guess should:
   - End with E (to leverage the known position).
   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.
   - Avoid C, R, A.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).
  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.
- **Why ""NOISE""?**:
  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.
  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.
  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.

The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.\n2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.\n3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the word we are looking for has:\n- The fifth letter is E.\n- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).\n- It does not contain C, R, or A.\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.\n\nWe want to choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).\n- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).\n- Avoids the letters C, R, A.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.\n\nCommon letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with E and have an N.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.\n\nOne strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven\'t tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.\n\nLet me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.\n\nExamples:\n- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N\'s, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don\'t know. We have to consider that possibility.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.\n\n- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.\n\n- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nWe can try ""LINED"":\n- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn\'t match because we need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nWe need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.\n\nSo the word must be ? ? ? ? E.\n\nNow, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\nAnd N is in one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don\'t know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don\'t know about S, I, D.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.\n\nHowever, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, S.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nPosition 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don\'t know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.\n\n""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nPosition 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don\'t know about G and L.\n\n""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).\n\nPosition 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\nWe should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.\n\nSo for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.\n\nWe need a valid word of the form ??N?E.\n\nExamples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.\n\nSimilarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).\n\n""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.\n\nSo these are candidates.\n\nNow, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).\n\nWe can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to cover more common letters to get information.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nSo a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nWe must avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nSo we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.\n\nLet me list some candidates:\n\n- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.\n- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.\n\nBut note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that\'s good.\n\nHowever, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven\'t tested before.\n\n- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.\n- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn\'t end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.\n\n- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.\n- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don\'t know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn\'t know. But we can assume for now.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.\n\nWe can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.\n\nBut we are not sure about the position of N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have N at all?

And it tests N in position 1, which we haven\'t tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.\n\nBut ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nSo we must avoid position 4 for N.\n\nTherefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.\n\nWe can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word.

""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.\n\n""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don\'t know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.\n\nBut ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it\'s a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn\'t end with E.

- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓) 
- N is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for N, meaning it's present but not in position 1).
- O, I, S are not in the word (all x).
- E is in position 5 (confirmed again).

What we know:
1. The word has E in position 5: [ ? , ? , ? , ? , E ]
2. The word contains N, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) or position 1 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, O, I, S (from previous x's).

Since N can only be in position 2 or 3, and E is at position 5, we can write the word as:
- If N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]
- If N in position 3: [ ?, ?, N, ?, E ]

We need to avoid letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and O, I, S (from guess 2). So used and excluded are: C,R,A,O,I,S.

We know N and E are in the word.

Now, for the remaining letters, we should try common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. Remaining vowels: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and has N in position 2 or 3.

Let's brainstorm words:

Case 1: N in position 2 (format: ? N ? ? E)
- Examples: 
  - ""UNDUE"" - but has U and D, but also U at position 1? Let's check: U N D U E -> position: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). But U appears twice? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the fourth letter is U, but we don't know about U. However, we haven't excluded U yet. But note: the word has to have distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible. Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters. But this word has U and D. 
  - ""ANKLE"" - but A is excluded (from guess1).
  - ""INLET"" - ends with T, not E.
  - Need the word to end with E: so ? N ? ? E.
  - Valid words: 
    - ""UNTIE"": U N T I E -> but I is excluded (from guess2).
    - ""UNMEE"" not a word.
    - ""UNSEE"" not a word.
    - ""UNGUE"" not common.
    - ""UNWED"": ends with D, not E.
    - ""UNCLE"": C excluded and ends with E? U N C L E -> C is excluded.
    - ""UNDUE"": as above, but has two U's? U N D U E. And we don't know if U is allowed.

Case 2: N in position 3 (format: ? ? N ? E)
- Examples:
  - ""PLANE"": A excluded.
  - ""CRANE"": C excluded and we know N not in position 4? But in CRANE, N is in position 4? Anyway excluded.
  - ""THINE"": T H I N E -> I excluded.
  - ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> O excluded.
  - ""SHONE"": S H O N E -> O excluded and S excluded.
  - ""GIVEN"": ends with N, not E? G-I-V-E-N, so E is fourth? G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5). Not E at end.
  - We need E at the end: so ? ? N ? E.
  - Valid words:
    - ""BUNCE"": not common and has C? B U N C E -> C excluded.
    - ""DUNCE"": D U N C E -> C excluded.
    - ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> letters L, U, G. No excluded letters. U is new, L and G new.
    - ""SINGE"": S excluded and I excluded.
    - ""TINGE"": T I N G E -> I excluded? And T and G are new? But I is excluded (from guess2), so cannot use.
    - ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded.
    - ""FUNGI"": not E ending.
    - ""RUNGE"": R excluded? R is excluded? Guess1: R(x).

So for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L,U,N,G,E) seems valid. It avoids excluded letters.

What about N in position 2? We had trouble finding options. Let me think:
  - ""ANGEL"": A excluded and ends with L.
  - ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> but R excluded. And ends with R? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)R(5). Not E at end.
  - ""INDEX"": I excluded and ends with X.
  - ""UNFED"": U N F E D -> ends with D. But word: U N F E D, so fifth letter D.
  - ""UNTIE"": I excluded.
  - ""UNSET"": S excluded and ends with T.
  - ""UNWED"": ends with D.
  - ""UNMET"": M E T? ends with T. U N M E T -> T at end.
  - ""UNITE"": I excluded.

So maybe there are no common words with N in position 2, ending with E, and without excluded letters? 

Let's list letters not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y is sometimes vowel).

Now, for N in position 2: ? N ? ? E

First ? must be a vowel or consonant? We need a word: 

Possible:
- ""UNITE"" but I excluded.
- ""UNLTE"" not a word.
- ""UNGTE"" not a word.
- How about ""UNDUE""? U N D U E -> that is a word. And letters: U, D. We haven't excluded U or D. So why not? 

But ""UNDUE"" has two U's? So it contains U twice? But the word uses U at positions 1 and 4? And N at 2, D at 3, E at 5.

The feedback: would it be marked? The secret word might not have two U's? We don't know. 

But in this case, we can try ""UNDUE"", but it uses U twice, which might not be efficient.

Another word: ""UNPEG"" doesn't end with E.

""UNSEE"" not a word.

So perhaps ""UNDUE"" is acceptable.

But we have an alternative for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"".

Now, we don't know if N is in position 2 or 3, so we need to test.

We can choose a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

Another word for N in position 2: ""UNREE"" not a word. ""UNBER"" not E ending.

Perhaps ""UPEND"": U P E N D -> ends with D? And E is in position 3? Not E ending.

But wait, ""UPEND"" means to end something? But it doesn't end with E.

Maybe ""ADDED"" not E ending.

So I think the only common word with N in position 2 and E ending is ""UNDUE"", but it has repeated U.

However, there might be others: ""UNHUE""? Not a word.

Perhaps we don't force the position and choose a word that tests N in a new position? But we don't have many tries.

We can choose ""LUNGE"", which assumes N in position 3, but if N is actually in position 2, we'll get feedback that it's wrong and we can adjust.

Similarly, if we choose ""UNDUE"", it tests N in position 2.

But ""UNDUE"" uses two U's, which might not be ideal because:
- If the word has only one U, then the U at position 1 might be marked correctly or as dash, and the U at position 4 might be x if not in word? But if the word has U only once, then one U will get the feedback (dash if not in correct position, but we don't know which one).

Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are handled by marking each occurrence. But if the secret word has only one U, then one U in our guess would be marked as present (or correct) and the other might be absent? But it depends on the actual count.

To avoid complexity, maybe choose a word without duplicates.

Another word for N in position 3: ""RANGE"" R excluded.

""MANGE"" A excluded.

""BENNE"" B E N N E? Two N's? B(1)E(2)N(3)N(4)E(5). We know N is present, but we don't know if there are two N's. But in feedback for guess1, we had one N dash, but if there were two N's, we might have missed one? Actually, guess1 had only one N, so we saw one dash, meaning at least one N. There could be two.

In ""BENNE"", we have two N's, but fourth position is N? But we know N cannot be in position 4? From guess1, feedback said N not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. But in ""BENNE"", position 4 is N? So that would be invalid because we know position 4 is not N. So we cannot use a word with N in position 4.

Therefore, words must avoid putting N in position 4.

Back to ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). N is in position 3, which is acceptable.

Similarly, ""PURGE"" doesn't have N.

Another one: ""MINKE"" M I N K E -> but I is excluded? Guess2: I(x), so I is excluded. Cannot use.

""FUDGE"" doesn't have N.

So I think ""LUNGE"" is a good choice for N in position 3.

For position 2, we have ""UNDUE"", but let's see if there's another: ""ANKHS"" not E ending. How about ""UNWEPT""? Too long.

""UNATE""? Not a word.

So maybe the words are rare.

Therefore, I propose to guess ""LUNGE"", which tests N in position 3 and introduces L, U, G.

If that is not correct, we can try other options later.

Therefore, next guess: ""LUNGE"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - E is in the word and in position 5.  
    - N is present but not in position 4.  
    - C, R, A are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - N is present but not in position 1.  
    - O, I, S are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is confirmed again.  

**Key Conclusions:**  
1. **Fixed Position**:  
   - Position 5 must be **E** → Word pattern: `[?][?][?][?]E`  
2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **N** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 (from NOISE feedback) or 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
   → N must be in **position 2 or 3**.  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S are not in the word → Must avoid these letters.  
4. **Letters to Test**:  
   - Focus on new common letters like B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, U.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test the position of N (position 2 or 3) while introducing untested letters to gather maximum information.  
- **Word Structure**:  
  - Case 1: If N in position 2 → `[?] N [?] [?] E` (e.g., `UNDUE`, but has duplicate U).  
  - Case 2: If N in position 3 → `[?] [?] N [?] E` (e.g., `LUNGE`, `TINGE`).  
- **Preferred Approach**:  
  - Test **N in position 3** first, as `LUNGE` (valid word) avoids duplicates, uses common consonants (L, G), and includes U (untested vowel).  
  - If incorrect, future guesses can pivot to N in position 2.  
- **Why this word?**:  
  - Covers N in position 3, ruling out half the possibilities for N.  
  - Tests letters L, U, G (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).  

### Next Guess: LUNGE
- **Structure**: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)  
- **Expected Feedback**:  
  - If N is in position 3: ✓ for N.  
  - If N is in position 2: - (for N) since N is present but misplaced.  
  - Feedback for L, U, G will reveal their presence/absence.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle are often words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 But note: We want to cover multiple common letters and also have a balanced vowel-consonant mix.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative amount earned on an investment) that is also a good starter? But let me stick to a more common one.

 However, note the rules: we need a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me check: CRANE is a bird or a machine used for lifting. Valid.

 So my first guess: CRANE.

 But note: the feedback will give us information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

 We are going to represent the guess as:
 <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I want to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetition. After considering several options, I chose **CRANE** because:
- It contains five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering frequent consonants and vowels.
- These letters appear in many English words, increasing the likelihood of hits.
- The word is valid and optimally balanced for positional analysis.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

So, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word we are looking for has:
- The fifth letter is E.
- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).
- It does not contain C, R, or A.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We want to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

One strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.

But note: we don't know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven't tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it's correct.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.

Let me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.

Examples:
- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don't know. We have to consider that possibility.

But note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.

- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don't know if that's correct.

We can try ""LINED"":
- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn't match because we need the fifth letter to be E.

We need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.

So the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

And N is in one of positions 1,2,3.

We also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).

Now, let's think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don't know about S, I, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don't know if the word has O, I, S.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don't know.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don't know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.

""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that's a candidate.

Position 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don't know about G and L.

""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).

Position 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it's not there.

So for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.

So we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.

So for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.

We need a valid word of the form ??N?E.

Examples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.

Similarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).

""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.

So these are candidates.

Now, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.

So for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).

We can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover more common letters to get information.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

We must avoid putting N in position 4.

So we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.
- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.

But note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's good.

However, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tested before.

- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.
- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn't end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.

- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.
- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.

We also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don't know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. But we can assume for now.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.

We can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.

But we are not sure about the position of N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.

But we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven't tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.

But ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.

Another candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So we must avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.

But let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.

We can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn't have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.

However, including N might help us find its position.

But note: if we don't include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don't include N, we won't get any indication about N, but we know it's there. So it's better to include N to test a new position.

So I think we should include N.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels or consonants.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.

""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don't know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.

But ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it's a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""NOISE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn't end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn't end with E.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

We are going to guess ""NOISE"".

The word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.

If the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.

If N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it's in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.

So it's informative.

Another candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).

""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.

We can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E's? And doesn't have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don't include it, we don't test a new position.

But I think including N is better.

Another word: ""NEEDY"" doesn't end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.

""NEWIE"" not a word.

I think ""NOISE"" is good.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).

So we are testing if N is in position 1.

If we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.

Either way, we get information.

Also, we test O, I, S.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.
- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.
- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

### Key Insights:
1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.
4. The next guess should:
   - End with E (to leverage the known position).
   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.
   - Avoid C, R, A.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).
  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.
- **Why ""NOISE""?**:
  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.
  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.
  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.

<guess>NOISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓) 
- N is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for N, meaning it's present but not in position 1).
- O, I, S are not in the word (all x).
- E is in position 5 (confirmed again).

What we know:
1. The word has E in position 5: [ ? , ? , ? , ? , E ]
2. The word contains N, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) or position 1 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, O, I, S (from previous x's).

Since N can only be in position 2 or 3, and E is at position 5, we can write the word as:
- If N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]
- If N in position 3: [ ?, ?, N, ?, E ]

We need to avoid letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and O, I, S (from guess 2). So used and excluded are: C,R,A,O,I,S.

We know N and E are in the word.

Now, for the remaining letters, we should try common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. Remaining vowels: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and has N in position 2 or 3.

Let's brainstorm words:

Case 1: N in position 2 (format: ? N ? ? E)
- Examples: 
  - ""UNDUE"" - but has U and D, but also U at position 1? Let's check: U N D U E -> position: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). But U appears twice? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the fourth letter is U, but we don't know about U. However, we haven't excluded U yet. But note: the word has to have distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible. Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters. But this word has U and D. 
  - ""ANKLE"" - but A is excluded (from guess1).
  - ""INLET"" - ends with T, not E.
  - Need the word to end with E: so ? N ? ? E.
  - Valid words: 
    - ""UNTIE"": U N T I E -> but I is excluded (from guess2).
    - ""UNMEE"" not a word.
    - ""UNSEE"" not a word.
    - ""UNGUE"" not common.
    - ""UNWED"": ends with D, not E.
    - ""UNCLE"": C excluded and ends with E? U N C L E -> C is excluded.
    - ""UNDUE"": as above, but has two U's? U N D U E. And we don't know if U is allowed.

Case 2: N in position 3 (format: ? ? N ? E)
- Examples:
  - ""PLANE"": A excluded.
  - ""CRANE"": C excluded and we know N not in position 4? But in CRANE, N is in position 4? Anyway excluded.
  - ""THINE"": T H I N E -> I excluded.
  - ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> O excluded.
  - ""SHONE"": S H O N E -> O excluded and S excluded.
  - ""GIVEN"": ends with N, not E? G-I-V-E-N, so E is fourth? G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5). Not E at end.
  - We need E at the end: so ? ? N ? E.
  - Valid words:
    - ""BUNCE"": not common and has C? B U N C E -> C excluded.
    - ""DUNCE"": D U N C E -> C excluded.
    - ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> letters L, U, G. No excluded letters. U is new, L and G new.
    - ""SINGE"": S excluded and I excluded.
    - ""TINGE"": T I N G E -> I excluded? And T and G are new? But I is excluded (from guess2), so cannot use.
    - ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded.
    - ""FUNGI"": not E ending.
    - ""RUNGE"": R excluded? R is excluded? Guess1: R(x).

So for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L,U,N,G,E) seems valid. It avoids excluded letters.

What about N in position 2? We had trouble finding options. Let me think:
  - ""ANGEL"": A excluded and ends with L.
  - ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> but R excluded. And ends with R? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)R(5). Not E at end.
  - ""INDEX"": I excluded and ends with X.
  - ""UNFED"": U N F E D -> ends with D. But word: U N F E D, so fifth letter D.
  - ""UNTIE"": I excluded.
  - ""UNSET"": S excluded and ends with T.
  - ""UNWED"": ends with D.
  - ""UNMET"": M E T? ends with T. U N M E T -> T at end.
  - ""UNITE"": I excluded.

So maybe there are no common words with N in position 2, ending with E, and without excluded letters? 

Let's list letters not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y is sometimes vowel).

Now, for N in position 2: ? N ? ? E

First ? must be a vowel or consonant? We need a word: 

Possible:
- ""UNITE"" but I excluded.
- ""UNLTE"" not a word.
- ""UNGTE"" not a word.
- How about ""UNDUE""? U N D U E -> that is a word. And letters: U, D. We haven't excluded U or D. So why not? 

But ""UNDUE"" has two U's? So it contains U twice? But the word uses U at positions 1 and 4? And N at 2, D at 3, E at 5.

The feedback: would it be marked? The secret word might not have two U's? We don't know. 

But in this case, we can try ""UNDUE"", but it uses U twice, which might not be efficient.

Another word: ""UNPEG"" doesn't end with E.

""UNSEE"" not a word.

So perhaps ""UNDUE"" is acceptable.

But we have an alternative for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"".

Now, we don't know if N is in position 2 or 3, so we need to test.

We can choose a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

Another word for N in position 2: ""UNREE"" not a word. ""UNBER"" not E ending.

Perhaps ""UPEND"": U P E N D -> ends with D? And E is in position 3? Not E ending.

But wait, ""UPEND"" means to end something? But it doesn't end with E.

Maybe ""ADDED"" not E ending.

So I think the only common word with N in position 2 and E ending is ""UNDUE"", but it has repeated U.

However, there might be others: ""UNHUE""? Not a word.

Perhaps we don't force the position and choose a word that tests N in a new position? But we don't have many tries.

We can choose ""LUNGE"", which assumes N in position 3, but if N is actually in position 2, we'll get feedback that it's wrong and we can adjust.

Similarly, if we choose ""UNDUE"", it tests N in position 2.

But ""UNDUE"" uses two U's, which might not be ideal because:
- If the word has only one U, then the U at position 1 might be marked correctly or as dash, and the U at position 4 might be x if not in word? But if the word has U only once, then one U will get the feedback (dash if not in correct position, but we don't know which one).

Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are handled by marking each occurrence. But if the secret word has only one U, then one U in our guess would be marked as present (or correct) and the other might be absent? But it depends on the actual count.

To avoid complexity, maybe choose a word without duplicates.

Another word for N in position 3: ""RANGE"" R excluded.

""MANGE"" A excluded.

""BENNE"" B E N N E? Two N's? B(1)E(2)N(3)N(4)E(5). We know N is present, but we don't know if there are two N's. But in feedback for guess1, we had one N dash, but if there were two N's, we might have missed one? Actually, guess1 had only one N, so we saw one dash, meaning at least one N. There could be two.

In ""BENNE"", we have two N's, but fourth position is N? But we know N cannot be in position 4? From guess1, feedback said N not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. But in ""BENNE"", position 4 is N? So that would be invalid because we know position 4 is not N. So we cannot use a word with N in position 4.

Therefore, words must avoid putting N in position 4.

Back to ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). N is in position 3, which is acceptable.

Similarly, ""PURGE"" doesn't have N.

Another one: ""MINKE"" M I N K E -> but I is excluded? Guess2: I(x), so I is excluded. Cannot use.

""FUDGE"" doesn't have N.

So I think ""LUNGE"" is a good choice for N in position 3.

For position 2, we have ""UNDUE"", but let's see if there's another: ""ANKHS"" not E ending. How about ""UNWEPT""? Too long.

""UNATE""? Not a word.

So maybe the words are rare.

Therefore, I propose to guess ""LUNGE"", which tests N in position 3 and introduces L, U, G.

If that is not correct, we can try other options later.

Therefore, next guess: ""LUNGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - E is in the word and in position 5.  
    - N is present but not in position 4.  
    - C, R, A are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - N is present but not in position 1.  
    - O, I, S are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is confirmed again.  

**Key Conclusions:**  
1. **Fixed Position**:  
   - Position 5 must be **E** → Word pattern: `[?][?][?][?]E`  
2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **N** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 (from NOISE feedback) or 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
   → N must be in **position 2 or 3**.  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S are not in the word → Must avoid these letters.  
4. **Letters to Test**:  
   - Focus on new common letters like B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, U.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test the position of N (position 2 or 3) while introducing untested letters to gather maximum information.  
- **Word Structure**:  
  - Case 1: If N in position 2 → `[?] N [?] [?] E` (e.g., `UNDUE`, but has duplicate U).  
  - Case 2: If N in position 3 → `[?] [?] N [?] E` (e.g., `LUNGE`, `TINGE`).  
- **Preferred Approach**:  
  - Test **N in position 3** first, as `LUNGE` (valid word) avoids duplicates, uses common consonants (L, G), and includes U (untested vowel).  
  - If incorrect, future guesses can pivot to N in position 2.  
- **Why this word?**:  
  - Covers N in position 3, ruling out half the possibilities for N.  
  - Tests letters L, U, G (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).  

### Next Guess: LUNGE
- **Structure**: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)  
- **Expected Feedback**:  
  - If N is in position 3: ✓ for N.  
  - If N is in position 2: - (for N) since N is present but misplaced.  
  - Feedback for L, U, G will reveal their presence/absence.

Since there is no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.\n A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n Common starting words in Wordle are often words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.\n But note: We want to cover multiple common letters and also have a balanced vowel-consonant mix.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative amount earned on an investment) that is also a good starter? But let me stick to a more common one.\n\n However, note the rules: we need a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.\n\n Let me check: CRANE is a bird or a machine used for lifting. Valid.\n\n So my first guess: CRANE.\n\n But note: the feedback will give us information about which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n We are going to represent the guess as:\n <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I want to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetition. After considering several options, I chose **CRANE** because:\n- It contains five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering frequent consonants and vowels.\n- These letters appear in many English words, increasing the likelihood of hits.\n- The word is valid and optimally balanced for positional analysis.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: ✓ (correct letter and position)\n\nSo, we know:\n1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.\n2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.\n3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the word we are looking for has:\n- The fifth letter is E.\n- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).\n- It does not contain C, R, or A.\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.\n\nWe want to choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).\n- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).\n- Avoids the letters C, R, A.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.\n\nCommon letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with E and have an N.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.\n\nOne strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven\'t tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.\n\nLet me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.\n\nExamples:\n- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N\'s, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don\'t know. We have to consider that possibility.\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.\n\n- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.\n\n- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nWe can try ""LINED"":\n- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn\'t match because we need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nWe need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.\n\nSo the word must be ? ? ? ? E.\n\nNow, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\nAnd N is in one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don\'t know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don\'t know about S, I, D.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.\n\nHowever, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, S.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nPosition 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don\'t know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.\n\n""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nPosition 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don\'t know about G and L.\n\n""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).\n\nPosition 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\nWe should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.\n\nSo for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.\n\nWe need a valid word of the form ??N?E.\n\nExamples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.\n\nSimilarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).\n\n""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.\n\nSo these are candidates.\n\nNow, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).\n\nWe can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to cover more common letters to get information.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nSo a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nWe must avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nSo we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.\n\nLet me list some candidates:\n\n- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.\n- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.\n\nBut note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that\'s good.\n\nHowever, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven\'t tested before.\n\n- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.\n- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn\'t end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.\n\n- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.\n- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don\'t know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn\'t know. But we can assume for now.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.\n\nWe can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.\n\nBut we are not sure about the position of N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.\n\nBut we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven\'t tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.\n\nBut ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nSo we must avoid position 4 for N.\n\nTherefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.\n\nWe can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn\'t have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don\'t include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.\n\nHowever, including N might help us find its position.\n\nBut note: if we don\'t include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get any indication about N, but we know it\'s there. So it\'s better to include N to test a new position.\n\nSo I think we should include N.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that tests more vowels or consonants.\n\nAnother idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.\n\n""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don\'t know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.\n\nBut ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it\'s a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn\'t end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see the feedback we might get.\n\nWe are going to guess ""NOISE"".\n\nThe word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.\n\nIf the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.\n\nIf N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it\'s in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).\n\n""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nSo I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.\n\nWe can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E\'s? And doesn\'t have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don\'t include it, we don\'t test a new position.\n\nBut I think including N is better.\n\nAnother word: ""NEEDY"" doesn\'t end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.\n\n""NEWIE"" not a word.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that\'s correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).\n\nSo we are testing if N is in position 1.\n\nIf we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.\n\nEither way, we get information.\n\nAlso, we test O, I, S.\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.\n- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.\n- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.\n- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).\n2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).\n3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.\n4. The next guess should:\n   - End with E (to leverage the known position).\n   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.\n   - Avoid C, R, A.\n   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.\n\n### Thought Process for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.\n- **Candidate Words**:\n  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).\n  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.\n- **Why ""NOISE""?**:\n  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.\n  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.\n  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.\n\n<guess>NOISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\n- C, R, A are not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓) \n- N is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for N, meaning it\'s present but not in position 1).\n- O, I, S are not in the word (all x).\n- E is in position 5 (confirmed again).\n\nWhat we know:\n1. The word has E in position 5: [ ? , ? , ? , ? , E ]\n2. The word contains N, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) or position 1 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 2 or 3.\n3. The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, O, I, S (from previous x\'s).\n\nSince N can only be in position 2 or 3, and E is at position 5, we can write the word as:\n- If N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]\n- If N in position 3: [ ?, ?, N, ?, E ]\n\nWe need to avoid letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.\n\nWe have used letters: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and O, I, S (from guess 2). So used and excluded are: C,R,A,O,I,S.\n\nWe know N and E are in the word.\n\nNow, for the remaining letters, we should try common consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tried. Remaining vowels: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and has N in position 2 or 3.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words:\n\nCase 1: N in position 2 (format: ? N ? ? E)\n- Examples: \n  - ""UNDUE"" - but has U and D, but also U at position 1? Let\'s check: U N D U E -> position: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). But U appears twice? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the fourth letter is U, but we don\'t know about U. However, we haven\'t excluded U yet. But note: the word has to have distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible. Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters. But this word has U and D. \n  - ""ANKLE"" - but A is excluded (from guess1).\n  - ""INLET"" - ends with T, not E.\n  - Need the word to end with E: so ? N ? ? E.\n  - Valid words: \n    - ""UNTIE"": U N T I E -> but I is excluded (from guess2).\n    - ""UNMEE"" not a word.\n    - ""UNSEE"" not a word.\n    - ""UNGUE"" not common.\n    - ""UNWED"": ends with D, not E.\n    - ""UNCLE"": C excluded and ends with E? U N C L E -> C is excluded.\n    - ""UNDUE"": as above, but has two U\'s? U N D U E. And we don\'t know if U is allowed.\n\nCase 2: N in position 3 (format: ? ? N ? E)\n- Examples:\n  - ""PLANE"": A excluded.\n  - ""CRANE"": C excluded and we know N not in position 4? But in CRANE, N is in position 4? Anyway excluded.\n  - ""THINE"": T H I N E -> I excluded.\n  - ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> O excluded.\n  - ""SHONE"": S H O N E -> O excluded and S excluded.\n  - ""GIVEN"": ends with N, not E? G-I-V-E-N, so E is fourth? G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5). Not E at end.\n  - We need E at the end: so ? ? N ? E.\n  - Valid words:\n    - ""BUNCE"": not common and has C? B U N C E -> C excluded.\n    - ""DUNCE"": D U N C E -> C excluded.\n    - ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> letters L, U, G. No excluded letters. U is new, L and G new.\n    - ""SINGE"": S excluded and I excluded.\n    - ""TINGE"": T I N G E -> I excluded? And T and G are new? But I is excluded (from guess2), so cannot use.\n    - ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded.\n    - ""FUNGI"": not E ending.\n    - ""RUNGE"": R excluded? R is excluded? Guess1: R(x).\n\nSo for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L,U,N,G,E) seems valid. It avoids excluded letters.\n\nWhat about N in position 2? We had trouble finding options. Let me think:\n  - ""ANGEL"": A excluded and ends with L.\n  - ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> but R excluded. And ends with R? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)R(5). Not E at end.\n  - ""INDEX"": I excluded and ends with X.\n  - ""UNFED"": U N F E D -> ends with D. But word: U N F E D, so fifth letter D.\n  - ""UNTIE"": I excluded.\n  - ""UNSET"": S excluded and ends with T.\n  - ""UNWED"": ends with D.\n  - ""UNMET"": M E T? ends with T. U N M E T -> T at end.\n  - ""UNITE"": I excluded.\n\nSo maybe there are no common words with N in position 2, ending with E, and without excluded letters? \n\nLet\'s list letters not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y is sometimes vowel).\n\nNow, for N in position 2: ? N ? ? E\n\nFirst ? must be a vowel or consonant? We need a word: \n\nPossible:\n- ""UNITE"" but I excluded.\n- ""UNLTE"" not a word.\n- ""UNGTE"" not a word.\n- How about ""UNDUE""? U N D U E -> that is a word. And letters: U, D. We haven\'t excluded U or D. So why not? \n\nBut ""UNDUE"" has two U\'s? So it contains U twice? But the word uses U at positions 1 and 4? And N at 2, D at 3, E at 5.\n\nThe feedback: would it be marked? The secret word might not have two U\'s? We don\'t know. \n\nBut in this case, we can try ""UNDUE"", but it uses U twice, which might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""UNPEG"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""UNSEE"" not a word.\n\nSo perhaps ""UNDUE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we have an alternative for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"".\n\nNow, we don\'t know if N is in position 2 or 3, so we need to test.\n\nWe can choose a word that covers both possibilities? But it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word for N in position 2: ""UNREE"" not a word. ""UNBER"" not E ending.\n\nPerhaps ""UPEND"": U P E N D -> ends with D? And E is in position 3? Not E ending.\n\nBut wait, ""UPEND"" means to end something? But it doesn\'t end with E.\n\nMaybe ""ADDED"" not E ending.\n\nSo I think the only common word with N in position 2 and E ending is ""UNDUE"", but it has repeated U.\n\nHowever, there might be others: ""UNHUE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps we don\'t force the position and choose a word that tests N in a new position? But we don\'t have many tries.\n\nWe can choose ""LUNGE"", which assumes N in position 3, but if N is actually in position 2, we\'ll get feedback that it\'s wrong and we can adjust.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""UNDUE"", it tests N in position 2.\n\nBut ""UNDUE"" uses two U\'s, which might not be ideal because:\n- If the word has only one U, then the U at position 1 might be marked correctly or as dash, and the U at position 4 might be x if not in word? But if the word has U only once, then one U will get the feedback (dash if not in correct position, but we don\'t know which one).\n\nActually, in Wordle, duplicates are handled by marking each occurrence. But if the secret word has only one U, then one U in our guess would be marked as present (or correct) and the other might be absent? But it depends on the actual count.\n\nTo avoid complexity, maybe choose a word without duplicates.\n\nAnother word for N in position 3: ""RANGE"" R excluded.\n\n""MANGE"" A excluded.\n\n""BENNE"" B E N N E? Two N\'s? B(1)E(2)N(3)N(4)E(5). We know N is present, but we don\'t know if there are two N\'s. But in feedback for guess1, we had one N dash, but if there were two N\'s, we might have missed one? Actually, guess1 had only one N, so we saw one dash, meaning at least one N. There could be two.\n\nIn ""BENNE"", we have two N\'s, but fourth position is N? But we know N cannot be in position 4? From guess1, feedback said N not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. But in ""BENNE"", position 4 is N? So that would be invalid because we know position 4 is not N. So we cannot use a word with N in position 4.\n\nTherefore, words must avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nBack to ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). N is in position 3, which is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, ""PURGE"" doesn\'t have N.\n\nAnother one: ""MINKE"" M I N K E -> but I is excluded? Guess2: I(x), so I is excluded. Cannot use.\n\n""FUDGE"" doesn\'t have N.\n\nSo I think ""LUNGE"" is a good choice for N in position 3.\n\nFor position 2, we have ""UNDUE"", but let\'s see if there\'s another: ""ANKHS"" not E ending. How about ""UNWEPT""? Too long.\n\n""UNATE""? Not a word.\n\nSo maybe the words are rare.\n\nTherefore, I propose to guess ""LUNGE"", which tests N in position 3 and introduces L, U, G.\n\nIf that is not correct, we can try other options later.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""LUNGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n**Feedback Summary:**\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - E is in the word and in position 5.  \n    - N is present but not in position 4.  \n    - C, R, A are absent.  \n- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - N is present but not in position 1.  \n    - O, I, S are absent.  \n    - E in position 5 is confirmed again.  \n\n**Key Conclusions:**  \n1. **Fixed Position**:  \n   - Position 5 must be **E** → Word pattern: `[?][?][?][?]E`  \n2. **Present Letters**:  \n   - **N** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 (from NOISE feedback) or 4 (from CRANE feedback).  \n   → N must be in **position 2 or 3**.  \n3. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, R, A, O, I, S are not in the word → Must avoid these letters.  \n4. **Letters to Test**:  \n   - Focus on new common letters like B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, U.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- **Goal**: Test the position of N (position 2 or 3) while introducing untested letters to gather maximum information.  \n- **Word Structure**:  \n  - Case 1: If N in position 2 → `[?] N [?] [?] E` (e.g., `UNDUE`, but has duplicate U).  \n  - Case 2: If N in position 3 → `[?] [?] N [?] E` (e.g., `LUNGE`, `TINGE`).  \n- **Preferred Approach**:  \n  - Test **N in position 3** first, as `LUNGE` (valid word) avoids duplicates, uses common consonants (L, G), and includes U (untested vowel).  \n  - If incorrect, future guesses can pivot to N in position 2.  \n- **Why this word?**:  \n  - Covers N in position 3, ruling out half the possibilities for N.  \n  - Tests letters L, U, G (all high-frequency and untested).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).  \n\n### Next Guess: LUNGE\n- **Structure**: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)  \n- **Expected Feedback**:  \n  - If N is in position 3: ✓ for N.  \n  - If N is in position 2: - (for N) since N is present but misplaced.  \n  - Feedback for L, U, G will reveal their presence/absence.\n\n<guess>LUNGE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: LUNGE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are absent.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- E is present and in position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- N is present but not in position 1.
- O, I, S are absent.
- E in position 5 is confirmed.

Guess 3: LUNGE -> L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
- L is absent.
- U is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 3.
- G is absent.
- E in position 5 is confirmed.

What we know:
1. The word ends with E: [ ?, ?, ?, ?, E ]
2. N is present, but not in position 1 (from guess2), not in position 3 (from guess3), and not in position 4 (from guess1). Therefore, N must be in position 2. The only position left is 2.

So, the word has N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]

3. U is present but not in position 2 (from guess3, since U was in position 2 and got a dash). But position 2 is now N, so U must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 4. However, position 5 is E, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

4. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G (from all feedbacks: x means absent).

So, absent: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

5. We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S, L, U, G. The only known present letters are N, E, and U (and we know E and N positions partially).

Present letters: N (in position 2), E (in position 5), and U (somewhere, not in position 2).

The word has three known letters: N, E, U, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The word structure: [ ? , N, ? , ? , E ]

U is in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: 
- Position 2: N
- Position 5: E
- Contains U (in position 1, 3, or 4)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G

Available letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and U is already present, but we need to place it).

We can try to form words.

Let's consider the possibilities for U:

Case 1: U in position 1: U N ? ? E
- Examples: 
  - ""UNITE"" but I is absent.
  - ""UNDUE"" but U in position 1 and 4? But we have U in position 1 and then another U? Also, D is available. But ""UNDUE"" has two U's? And we know U is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for LUNGE, we had U in position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one U is present. If the word has only one U, then in ""UNDUE"" we would have two U's: one might be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But it's messy.

  Let me check: if the word has only one U, and we guess ""UNDUE"", then:
  - If the U is in position 1, then the first U is correct (if the word has U in position 1) or dash (if U is elsewhere). But the second U (position 4) would be absent if the word has only one U.

  But we don't know the count. So it's better to avoid duplicates if possible.

Case 2: U in position 3: ? N U ? E
- Examples: 
  - ""INURE"" but I absent.
  - ""ENNUI"" doesn't end with E? E N N U I -> not E at end.
  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.
  - ""UNTIE"" I absent.
  - ""ANURY"" not a word.
  - Let's think: ""TUNED"" ends with D? T U N E D -> not E at end.
  - We need to end with E: so ? N U ? E
  - Possible words: 
    - ""BUNCE"" but C absent? B U N C E -> C is absent, so invalid.
    - ""DUNCE"" D U N C E -> C absent.
    - ""FUNGI"" not E ending.
    - ""JUNTA"" not E ending.
    - ""MUNGE"" but G absent? M U N G E -> G is absent (from guess3: G(x)).
    - ""PUNCE"" not common and has C? P U N C E -> C absent.
    - ""RUNED"" ends with D? R U N E D -> R absent and ends with D.
    - ""TUNER"" ends with R? T U N E R -> R absent.
    - ""HUNKE"" not a word? Or ""HUNKY"" not E ending.
    - ""PUNKA"" not E ending.

  I'm struggling. What about ""DUNES""? But S absent? D U N E S -> S is absent (from guess2: S(x)), and also the structure is D(1)U(2)N(3)E(4)S(5) but we need position 2 to be N? In ""DUNES"", position 2 is U, not N. We need position 2 to be N.

  We have [ ? , N, U, ? , E ] for this case.

  So: position 1: ?, position 2: N, position 3: U, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

  Words: 
  - ""ENNUI"" not E ending.
  - ""INUKU"" not a word.
  - ""ANURA"" not E and A absent.
  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""CNUTS"" not E and C,S absent.
  - ""DNUTS"" not a word.
  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""GNUS"" too short.
  - ""HNUES"" not a word? And S absent.
  - ""KNUDS"" not E ending.
  - ""MNUES"" not a word? M N U E S -> S absent.
  - ""PNUTS"" not E and S absent.
  - ""TNUES"" not a word? T N U E S -> S absent.
  - ""UNKED"" U N K E D -> but position 1 is U, not ? for position 1. This is for case 1? We are in case 2: position 1 is not U, position 3 is U.

  Let me search: is there a word like ""X N U X E"" where X are letters not excluded.

  For example: 
  - ""ENURE"": E N U R E -> but R is absent, and also E in position 1? But we don't know if E is only at the end? We have E at the end, but it might be elsewhere? In feedback, we only know about the E at position 5. There could be another E? But in guess1 and guess2, we had E only at position 5 and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. So it's possible.

  ""ENURE"": E(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> but R is absent, so invalid.

  ""INURE"": I(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> I and R absent.

  ""ONURE"" not a word.

  ""UNSEE"" S absent.

  I think there are no common words for this pattern.

Case 3: U in position 4: ? N ? U E
- Structure: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]
- Examples:
  - ""ANVIL"" not E ending.
  - ""ENDUE"": E N D U E -> E in position 1 and 5? But we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, D is available.
  - ""INSUE"" I and S absent.
  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.
  - ""UNDEE"" U N D E E -> but E in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)E(5). So position 4 is E, but we have U in position 4? No, in this word, position 4 is E, not U. We need U in position 4.

  So: position 4 must be U: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]

  Words:
  - ""ENHUB"" not a word.
  - ""INJUD"" not E ending.
  - ""ANGRU"" not E ending.
  - ""BENDU"" not E ending.
  - ""DENUM"" not E ending.
  - ""FENDU"" not E ending? F E N D U -> ends with U.
  - ""GENUA"" not E ending.
  - ""MENUS"" S absent and ends with S.
  - ""PENDU"" not E ending.
  - ""TENDU"" T E N D U -> ends with U.
  - ""VENDU"" V E N D U -> ends with U.

  We need to end with E, so the word must be ...E, so position 5 is E, so position 4 is U, so the word ends with ""UE"". 

  Words ending with ""UE"": 
  - ""ARGUE"" R absent.
  - ""BEGUE"" not common.
  - ""DUE"" too short.
  - ""FUGUE"" G absent and U in position 2? F U G U E -> not our pattern.
  - ""HONGU"" not a word.
  - ""JUNGU"" not a word.
  - ""TONGUE"" too long? 6 letters.
  - ""VENUE"" V E N U E? V(1)E(2)N(3)U(4)E(5) -> but position 2 is E, not N. We need position 2 to be N.

  We need position 2 to be N: so the word is [X, N, Y, U, E]

  Examples: 
  - ""ENHUE"" not a word? E N H U E -> E in position 1 and 5, H in position 3.
  - ""INHUE"" not a word.
  - ""ONURE"" not a word.
  - ""UNBUE"" not a word.
  - ""ANXUE"" not a word.

  How about ""ENDUE""? But ""ENDUE"" is E N D U E, so positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). This matches the pattern: position 2 is N, position 4 is U, position 5 is E. And it has E in position 1 as well? But we don't know if that's allowed.

  ""ENDUE"" is a word: to endow or provide.

  And it uses D, which is not excluded.

  Also, it has two E's? But that's okay.

  Now, check the absent letters: E, N, D, U, E. The letters are E, N, D, U. We know E, N, U are present, D is new and not excluded.

  Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G. D is not in that list, so it's okay.

  So ""ENDUE"" is a candidate.

  But we have U in position 4, which is what we want.

  Also, in this word, position 1 is E. We don't know if E is in position 1? But we only know that E is in position 5. It could be in other positions? Yes, it's possible.

  So ""ENDUE"" seems valid.

  But let's confirm the feedback we would get.

  We know:
  - Position 2: N is correct, so we should get a check for N.
  - Position 5: E is correct, check.
  - Position 4: U, we are guessing U in position 4, and if the word has U in position 4, then check. But we don't know if U is in position 4? We only know U is present, but not where. In this guess, we are testing U in position 4.

  Also, position 1: E, if the word has E in position 1, then check; otherwise, if E is only at the end, then position 1 E would be marked as absent? But we know E is at the end, but it might be elsewhere. If the word has only one E (at position 5), then the E at position 1 would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word elsewhere? But wait, if the word has only one E, and it's at position 5, then an E at position 1 would be marked as not in the word (x). But if the word has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position (-) if not in position 1.

  But in our case, we are trying to solve, so we can use this to get information.

  However, we have limited guesses, so we need to be careful.

  Another candidate: ""UNTIE"" but I and T? I is absent.

  Or ""UNMET"" ends with T.

  So ""ENDUE"" seems a good candidate.

  But we also have the possibility that U is in position 1 or 3, but we couldn't find words for those. So maybe U is in position 4.

  Therefore, I think ""ENDUE"" is a valid guess.

  But note: in ""ENDUE"", we have E in position 1 and 5. We don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible.

  Alternatively, is there a word without duplicate E? For example, with U in position 4 and no E at position 1.

  For pattern [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]:

  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""CNUZE"" not a word.
  - ""DNUTS"" not E ending.
  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""KNUPE"" not a word? K N U P E -> K(1)N(2)U(3)? No, we need U in position 4: so [K, N, ?, U, E] -> K N ? U E.

  ""KNULE"" not a word.

  ""MNEME"" not U in position 4.

  I think ""ENDUE"" is the only common word.

  Another one: ""INDUE"" but I is absent. I(1)N(2)D(3)U(4)E(5) -> I absent.

  So ""ENDUE"" is the best bet.

  But we have to consider that we might have U in position 1.

  For U in position 1: [U, N, ?, ?, E]

  We need a word: U N ? ? E

  Examples:
  - ""UNDEE"": U N D E E -> positions: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? But in this word, position 4 is E, so the word is U N D E E. But we know position 5 is E, so position 4 is E? That's possible. But then we have two E's: position 4 and 5.

  ""UNDEE"" is a word? It means a wave, I think? Or not common.

  ""UNDEN"" not E ending.

  ""UNLED"" ends with D.

  ""UNMET"" ends with T.

  ""UNPEG"" ends with G.

  ""UNSET"" S absent.

  ""UNWED"" ends with D.

  ""UNZIP"" ends with P.

  ""UNDYE"" U N D Y E -> Y in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)Y(4)E(5). So Y is in position 4. And Y is not excluded.

  ""UNDYE"" is a word? To remove dye? Not common, but valid.

  So we have two candidates: ""ENDUE"" and ""UNDYE"".

  But ""UNDYE"" has U in position 1, which is a possibility.

  We also have ""ENDUE"" with U in position 4.

  How to choose?

  We can also consider the frequency of letters.

  But we have to make a guess.

  Let's see what information we can get.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume U's position but tests multiple possibilities.

  But it's hard because we have to avoid many letters.

  We know U is present, so we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested: position 1 or 4 (since position 2 and 3 are tested and not U).

  We haven't tested position 1 or 4 for U.

  In ""ENDUE"", we test U in position 4 and E in position 1.

  In ""UNDYE"", we test U in position 1 and Y in position 4.

  We also have to consider that the word might have only one U.

  Since we have limited guesses, and we are on the fourth guess (we have three guesses left), we can try one.

  I think ""ENDUE"" is more common.

  But let's see the feedback from guess3: U was in position 2 and got a dash, so U is not in position 2, but it is in the word. That doesn't give us information about other positions.

  Perhaps we can try to guess a word that has U in position 1 and also tests other letters.

  But I think we should go with ""ENDUE"".

  Or, to avoid the duplicate E, we can try ""UNDYE"".

  But ""UNDYE"" uses Y, which is less common.

  Another idea: is there a word with U in position 4 and without E in position 1? For example, [X, N, Y, U, E] where X is not E.

  We had ""INDUE"" but I absent.

  ""KNDUE"" not a word.

  ""MNDUE"" not a word.

  ""PNDUE"" not a word.

  ""TNDUE"" not a word.

  ""WNDUE"" not a word.

  So no common words.

  Therefore, the only common word we have is ""ENDUE"".

  So I'll go with ""ENDUE"".

  But let's double-check the feedback we might get.

  If the word is ""ENDUE"", then we get:
  - E in position 1: if the word has E in position 1, then ✓; but if not, then x or -.
  But we know the word has E in position 5, and it might have another E.

  If the word is not ""ENDUE"", but has U in position 4, then we might get feedback that helps.

  For example, if we guess ""ENDUE"" and the word is something else with U in position 4, then:
  - Position 1: E might be absent or present elsewhere.
  - Position 2: N is correct, so ✓.
  - Position 3: D might be correct or not.
  - Position 4: U might be correct or not (if U is in position 4, then ✓).
  - Position 5: E ✓.

  But we are hoping to solve it.

  Given that we have to guess, I think ""ENDUE"" is a reasonable choice.

  So next guess: ""ENDUE""

But wait, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can also consider that we might have missed something.

Another possibility: what if the word has U in position 1? And we haven't guessed it.

For example, ""UNDER"" but R absent.

""UNMET"" ends with T.

""UNGET"" G absent.

""UNLET"" L absent.

""UNPEN"" ends with N.

""UNSEW"" S absent.

""UNWET"" ends with T.

""UNKED"" U N K E D -> ends with D.

""UNKID"" not a word.

""UNBED"" U N B E D -> ends with D.

""UNFED"" U N F E D -> ends with D.

""UNJAM"" not E ending.

So no common words ending with E for U in position 1 except ""UNDYE"" or ""UNDEE"".

""UNDEE"" has two E's: U N D E E.

But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? No, in ""UNDEE"", position 4 is E and position 5 is E, so it's possible.

But then the word would have two E's.

In our feedback, we only have one E confirmed (position 5), so there could be another.

But in ""UNDEE"", we have U in position 1, N in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, E in position 5.

So if we guess ""UNDEE"", then:
- U in position 1: if U is in position 1, then ✓ or -? But we know U is present, so if not in position 1, then -.
- N in position 2: ✓ (since we know N is in position 2).
- D in position 3: ? 
- E in position 4: if the word has E in position 4, then ✓, but if not, then - (since E is in the word at position 5).
- E in position 5: ✓.

But we don't know if the word has E in position 4.

However, we are not sure.

Given the time, I think ""ENDUE"" is a better choice because it's more common.

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - E is in position 5.  
    - N is present but not in position 4.  
    - C, R, A are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - N is present but not in position 1.  
    - O, I, S are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is confirmed.  
- **Guess 3 (LUNGE)**: L(x), U(-), N(-), G(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - U is present but not in position 2.  
    - N is present but not in position 3.  
    - L, G are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is reconfirmed.  

**Key Conclusions:**  
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 5 is **E**.  
   - **N must be in position 2** (the only remaining position, as it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).  
   → Word pattern: `[?] N [?] [?] E`  
2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **U** is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G are **not in the word** (must avoid these).  
4. **Remaining Letters**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
   - Available vowels: U (already confirmed), and Y (sometimes vowel).  

### Strategy for Next Guess

<guess>ENDUE</guess>",ENDUE,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are absent.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- E is present and in position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- N is present but not in position 1.
- O, I, S are absent.
- E in position 5 is confirmed.

Guess 3: LUNGE -> L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
- L is absent.
- U is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 3.
- G is absent.
- E in position 5 is confirmed.

What we know:
1. The word ends with E: [ ?, ?, ?, ?, E ]
2. N is present, but not in position 1 (from guess2), not in position 3 (from guess3), and not in position 4 (from guess1). Therefore, N must be in position 2. The only position left is 2.

So, the word has N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]

3. U is present but not in position 2 (from guess3, since U was in position 2 and got a dash). But position 2 is now N, so U must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 4. However, position 5 is E, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

4. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G (from all feedbacks: x means absent).

So, absent: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

5. We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S, L, U, G. The only known present letters are N, E, and U (and we know E and N positions partially).

Present letters: N (in position 2), E (in position 5), and U (somewhere, not in position 2).

The word has three known letters: N, E, U, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The word structure: [ ? , N, ? , ? , E ]

U is in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: 
- Position 2: N
- Position 5: E
- Contains U (in position 1, 3, or 4)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G

Available letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and U is already present, but we need to place it).

We can try to form words.

Let's consider the possibilities for U:

Case 1: U in position 1: U N ? ? E
- Examples: 
  - ""UNITE"" but I is absent.
  - ""UNDUE"" but U in position 1 and 4? But we have U in position 1 and then another U? Also, D is available. But ""UNDUE"" has two U's? And we know U is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for LUNGE, we had U in position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one U is present. If the word has only one U, then in ""UNDUE"" we would have two U's: one might be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But it's messy.

  Let me check: if the word has only one U, and we guess ""UNDUE"", then:
  - If the U is in position 1, then the first U is correct (if the word has U in position 1) or dash (if U is elsewhere). But the second U (position 4) would be absent if the word has only one U.

  But we don't know the count. So it's better to avoid duplicates if possible.

Case 2: U in position 3: ? N U ? E
- Examples: 
  - ""INURE"" but I absent.
  - ""ENNUI"" doesn't end with E? E N N U I -> not E at end.
  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.
  - ""UNTIE"" I absent.
  - ""ANURY"" not a word.
  - Let's think: ""TUNED"" ends with D? T U N E D -> not E at end.
  - We need to end with E: so ? N U ? E
  - Possible words: 
    - ""BUNCE"" but C absent? B U N C E -> C is absent, so invalid.
    - ""DUNCE"" D U N C E -> C absent.
    - ""FUNGI"" not E ending.
    - ""JUNTA"" not E ending.
    - ""MUNGE"" but G absent? M U N G E -> G is absent (from guess3: G(x)).
    - ""PUNCE"" not common and has C? P U N C E -> C absent.
    - ""RUNED"" ends with D? R U N E D -> R absent and ends with D.
    - ""TUNER"" ends with R? T U N E R -> R absent.
    - ""HUNKE"" not a word? Or ""HUNKY"" not E ending.
    - ""PUNKA"" not E ending.

  I'm struggling. What about ""DUNES""? But S absent? D U N E S -> S is absent (from guess2: S(x)), and also the structure is D(1)U(2)N(3)E(4)S(5) but we need position 2 to be N? In ""DUNES"", position 2 is U, not N. We need position 2 to be N.

  We have [ ? , N, U, ? , E ] for this case.

  So: position 1: ?, position 2: N, position 3: U, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

  Words: 
  - ""ENNUI"" not E ending.
  - ""INUKU"" not a word.
  - ""ANURA"" not E and A absent.
  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""CNUTS"" not E and C,S absent.
  - ""DNUTS"" not a word.
  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""GNUS"" too short.
  - ""HNUES"" not a word? And S absent.
  - ""KNUDS"" not E ending.
  - ""MNUES"" not a word? M N U E S -> S absent.
  - ""PNUTS"" not E and S absent.
  - ""TNUES"" not a word? T N U E S -> S absent.
  - ""UNKED"" U N K E D -> but position 1 is U, not ? for position 1. This is for case 1? We are in case 2: position 1 is not U, position 3 is U.

  Let me search: is there a word like ""X N U X E"" where X are letters not excluded.

  For example: 
  - ""ENURE"": E N U R E -> but R is absent, and also E in position 1? But we don't know if E is only at the end? We have E at the end, but it might be elsewhere? In feedback, we only know about the E at position 5. There could be another E? But in guess1 and guess2, we had E only at position 5 and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. So it's possible.

  ""ENURE"": E(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> but R is absent, so invalid.

  ""INURE"": I(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> I and R absent.

  ""ONURE"" not a word.

  ""UNSEE"" S absent.

  I think there are no common words for this pattern.

Case 3: U in position 4: ? N ? U E
- Structure: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]
- Examples:
  - ""ANVIL"" not E ending.
  - ""ENDUE"": E N D U E -> E in position 1 and 5? But we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, D is available.
  - ""INSUE"" I and S absent.
  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.
  - ""UNDEE"" U N D E E -> but E in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)E(5). So position 4 is E, but we have U in position 4? No, in this word, position 4 is E, not U. We need U in position 4.

  So: position 4 must be U: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]

  Words:
  - ""ENHUB"" not a word.
  - ""INJUD"" not E ending.
  - ""ANGRU"" not E ending.
  - ""BENDU"" not E ending.
  - ""DENUM"" not E ending.
  - ""FENDU"" not E ending? F E N D U -> ends with U.
  - ""GENUA"" not E ending.
  - ""MENUS"" S absent and ends with S.
  - ""PENDU"" not E ending.
  - ""TENDU"" T E N D U -> ends with U.
  - ""VENDU"" V E N D U -> ends with U.

  We need to end with E, so the word must be ...E, so position 5 is E, so position 4 is U, so the word ends with ""UE"". 

  Words ending with ""UE"": 
  - ""ARGUE"" R absent.
  - ""BEGUE"" not common.
  - ""DUE"" too short.
  - ""FUGUE"" G absent and U in position 2? F U G U E -> not our pattern.
  - ""HONGU"" not a word.
  - ""JUNGU"" not a word.
  - ""TONGUE"" too long? 6 letters.
  - ""VENUE"" V E N U E? V(1)E(2)N(3)U(4)E(5) -> but position 2 is E, not N. We need position 2 to be N.

  We need position 2 to be N: so the word is [X, N, Y, U, E]

  Examples: 
  - ""ENHUE"" not a word? E N H U E -> E in position 1 and 5, H in position 3.
  - ""INHUE"" not a word.
  - ""ONURE"" not a word.
  - ""UNBUE"" not a word.
  - ""ANXUE"" not a word.

  How about ""ENDUE""? But ""ENDUE"" is E N D U E, so positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). This matches the pattern: position 2 is N, position 4 is U, position 5 is E. And it has E in position 1 as well? But we don't know if that's allowed.

  ""ENDUE"" is a word: to endow or provide.

  And it uses D, which is not excluded.

  Also, it has two E's? But that's okay.

  Now, check the absent letters: E, N, D, U, E. The letters are E, N, D, U. We know E, N, U are present, D is new and not excluded.

  Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G. D is not in that list, so it's okay.

  So ""ENDUE"" is a candidate.

  But we have U in position 4, which is what we want.

  Also, in this word, position 1 is E. We don't know if E is in position 1? But we only know that E is in position 5. It could be in other positions? Yes, it's possible.

  So ""ENDUE"" seems valid.

  But let's confirm the feedback we would get.

  We know:
  - Position 2: N is correct, so we should get a check for N.
  - Position 5: E is correct, check.
  - Position 4: U, we are guessing U in position 4, and if the word has U in position 4, then check. But we don't know if U is in position 4? We only know U is present, but not where. In this guess, we are testing U in position 4.

  Also, position 1: E, if the word has E in position 1, then check; otherwise, if E is only at the end, then position 1 E would be marked as absent? But we know E is at the end, but it might be elsewhere. If the word has only one E (at position 5), then the E at position 1 would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word elsewhere? But wait, if the word has only one E, and it's at position 5, then an E at position 1 would be marked as not in the word (x). But if the word has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position (-) if not in position 1.

  But in our case, we are trying to solve, so we can use this to get information.

  However, we have limited guesses, so we need to be careful.

  Another candidate: ""UNTIE"" but I and T? I is absent.

  Or ""UNMET"" ends with T.

  So ""ENDUE"" seems a good candidate.

  But we also have the possibility that U is in position 1 or 3, but we couldn't find words for those. So maybe U is in position 4.

  Therefore, I think ""ENDUE"" is a valid guess.

  But note: in ""ENDUE"", we have E in position 1 and 5. We don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible.

  Alternatively, is there a word without duplicate E? For example, with U in position 4 and no E at position 1.

  For pattern [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]:

  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""CNUZE"" not a word.
  - ""DNUTS"" not E ending.
  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""KNUPE"" not a word? K N U P E -> K(1)N(2)U(3)? No, we need U in position 4: so [K, N, ?, U, E] -> K N ? U E.

  ""KNULE"" not a word.

  ""MNEME"" not U in position 4.

  I think ""ENDUE"" is the only common word.

  Another one: ""INDUE"" but I is absent. I(1)N(2)D(3)U(4)E(5) -> I absent.

  So ""ENDUE"" is the best bet.

  But we have to consider that we might have U in position 1.

  For U in position 1: [U, N, ?, ?, E]

  We need a word: U N ? ? E

  Examples:
  - ""UNDEE"": U N D E E -> positions: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? But in this word, position 4 is E, so the word is U N D E E. But we know position 5 is E, so position 4 is E? That's possible. But then we have two E's: position 4 and 5.

  ""UNDEE"" is a word? It means a wave, I think? Or not common.

  ""UNDEN"" not E ending.

  ""UNLED"" ends with D.

  ""UNMET"" ends with T.

  ""UNPEG"" ends with G.

  ""UNSET"" S absent.

  ""UNWED"" ends with D.

  ""UNZIP"" ends with P.

  ""UNDYE"" U N D Y E -> Y in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)Y(4)E(5). So Y is in position 4. And Y is not excluded.

  ""UNDYE"" is a word? To remove dye? Not common, but valid.

  So we have two candidates: ""ENDUE"" and ""UNDYE"".

  But ""UNDYE"" has U in position 1, which is a possibility.

  We also have ""ENDUE"" with U in position 4.

  How to choose?

  We can also consider the frequency of letters.

  But we have to make a guess.

  Let's see what information we can get.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume U's position but tests multiple possibilities.

  But it's hard because we have to avoid many letters.

  We know U is present, so we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested: position 1 or 4 (since position 2 and 3 are tested and not U).

  We haven't tested position 1 or 4 for U.

  In ""ENDUE"", we test U in position 4 and E in position 1.

  In ""UNDYE"", we test U in position 1 and Y in position 4.

  We also have to consider that the word might have only one U.

  Since we have limited guesses, and we are on the fourth guess (we have three guesses left), we can try one.

  I think ""ENDUE"" is more common.

  But let's see the feedback from guess3: U was in position 2 and got a dash, so U is not in position 2, but it is in the word. That doesn't give us information about other positions.

  Perhaps we can try to guess a word that has U in position 1 and also tests other letters.

  But I think we should go with ""ENDUE"".

  Or, to avoid the duplicate E, we can try ""UNDYE"".

  But ""UNDYE"" uses Y, which is less common.

  Another idea: is there a word with U in position 4 and without E in position 1? For example, [X, N, Y, U, E] where X is not E.

  We had ""INDUE"" but I absent.

  ""KNDUE"" not a word.

  ""MNDUE"" not a word.

  ""PNDUE"" not a word.

  ""TNDUE"" not a word.

  ""WNDUE"" not a word.

  So no common words.

  Therefore, the only common word we have is ""ENDUE"".

  So I'll go with ""ENDUE"".

  But let's double-check the feedback we might get.

  If the word is ""ENDUE"", then we get:
  - E in position 1: if the word has E in position 1, then ✓; but if not, then x or -.
  But we know the word has E in position 5, and it might have another E.

  If the word is not ""ENDUE"", but has U in position 4, then we might get feedback that helps.

  For example, if we guess ""ENDUE"" and the word is something else with U in position 4, then:
  - Position 1: E might be absent or present elsewhere.
  - Position 2: N is correct, so ✓.
  - Position 3: D might be correct or not.
  - Position 4: U might be correct or not (if U is in position 4, then ✓).
  - Position 5: E ✓.

  But we are hoping to solve it.

  Given that we have to guess, I think ""ENDUE"" is a reasonable choice.

  So next guess: ""ENDUE""

But wait, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can also consider that we might have missed something.

Another possibility: what if the word has U in position 1? And we haven't guessed it.

For example, ""UNDER"" but R absent.

""UNMET"" ends with T.

""UNGET"" G absent.

""UNLET"" L absent.

""UNPEN"" ends with N.

""UNSEW"" S absent.

""UNWET"" ends with T.

""UNKED"" U N K E D -> ends with D.

""UNKID"" not a word.

""UNBED"" U N B E D -> ends with D.

""UNFED"" U N F E D -> ends with D.

""UNJAM"" not E ending.

So no common words ending with E for U in position 1 except ""UNDYE"" or ""UNDEE"".

""UNDEE"" has two E's: U N D E E.

But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? No, in ""UNDEE"", position 4 is E and position 5 is E, so it's possible.

But then the word would have two E's.

In our feedback, we only have one E confirmed (position 5), so there could be another.

But in ""UNDEE"", we have U in position 1, N in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, E in position 5.

So if we guess ""UNDEE"", then:
- U in position 1: if U is in position 1, then ✓ or -? But we know U is present, so if not in position 1, then -.
- N in position 2: ✓ (since we know N is in position 2).
- D in position 3: ? 
- E in position 4: if the word has E in position 4, then ✓, but if not, then - (since E is in the word at position 5).
- E in position 5: ✓.

But we don't know if the word has E in position 4.

However, we are not sure.

Given the time, I think ""ENDUE"" is a better choice because it's more common.

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - E is in position 5.  
    - N is present but not in position 4.  
    - C, R, A are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - N is present but not in position 1.  
    - O, I, S are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is confirmed.  
- **Guess 3 (LUNGE)**: L(x), U(-), N(-), G(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - U is present but not in position 2.  
    - N is present but not in position 3.  
    - L, G are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is reconfirmed.  

**Key Conclusions:**  
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 5 is **E**.  
   - **N must be in position 2** (the only remaining position, as it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).  
   → Word pattern: `[?] N [?] [?] E`  
2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **U** is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G are **not in the word** (must avoid these).  
4. **Remaining Letters**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
   - Available vowels: U (already confirmed), and Y (sometimes vowel).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**:  
  - Confirm the position of U (position 1, 3, or 4).  
  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, T, M, H) to cover remaining unknowns.  
- **Word Selection**:  
  - **Pattern**: `[?] N [?] [?] E` (N in position 2, E in position 5).  
  - U must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.  
  - After evaluating options (e.g., ""UNDUE"", ""ENDUE"", ""UNDYE""), **""ENDUE""** is optimal:  
    - Ends with E, places N in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  
    - Tests U in position 4 (critical for narrowing U's location).  
    - Introduces D (position 3) and E (position 1) — E may be duplicated.  
    - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- **Why ""ENDUE""?**  
  - If U is in position 4, feedback will confirm with ✓.  
  - If U is not in position 4, feedback will show - (misplaced) or x (absent), ruling out position 4.  
  - Tests E in position 1 (if E is duplicated, feedback may show - or ✓).  
  - Tests D in position 3 (new letter).",Guess 4: ENDUE -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(✓) D(✓) U(✓) E(✓),FAIL

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle are often words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 But note: We want to cover multiple common letters and also have a balanced vowel-consonant mix.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative amount earned on an investment) that is also a good starter? But let me stick to a more common one.

 However, note the rules: we need a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me check: CRANE is a bird or a machine used for lifting. Valid.

 So my first guess: CRANE.

 But note: the feedback will give us information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

 We are going to represent the guess as:
 <guess>CRANE</guess>For my first guess, I want to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetition. After considering several options, I chose **CRANE** because:
- It contains five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering frequent consonants and vowels.
- These letters appear in many English words, increasing the likelihood of hits.
- The word is valid and optimally balanced for positional analysis.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

So, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the word ends with E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the word is 5 letters, N must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3) because position 4 was wrong and position 5 is E.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word we are looking for has:
- The fifth letter is E.
- It contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position (so in position 1, 2, or 3).
- It does not contain C, R, or A.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We want to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter N (but not in the fourth position, so we can try to put it in a different position to test).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3.

We also know that the word has an N and an E, and three other letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form a word that ends with E and has N in one of the first three positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

One strategy is to try a word that has N in position 1 or 2, and then use other new letters.

But note: we don't know the position of N, so we might put it in a position we haven't tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it's correct.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting N in the fourth position (which we already know is wrong) and put it in a new position.

Let me list some words that end with E and have an N, and avoid C, R, A.

Examples:
- ""INANE"": but it has A (which is excluded) and two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, our feedback for N was only one dash, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two dashes? Not necessarily: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one N, we only get one piece of feedback. So the word might have more than one N? But we don't know. We have to consider that possibility.

But note: we must avoid A, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

- ""MINCE"": has C (excluded) and M, I, N, C, E -> but C is excluded.

- ""LINED"": has L, I, N, E, D. This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don't know if that's correct.

We can try ""LINED"":
- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn't match because we need the fifth letter to be E.

We need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.

So the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

And N is in one of positions 1,2,3.

We also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).

Now, let's think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don't know about S, I, D.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.

However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don't know if the word has O, I, S.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don't know.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don't know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.

""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that's a candidate.

Position 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don't know about G and L.

""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).

Position 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it's not there.

So for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.

So we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.

So for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.

We need a valid word of the form ??N?E.

Examples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.

Similarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).

""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.

So these are candidates.

Now, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.

So for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).

We can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover more common letters to get information.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

We must avoid putting N in position 4.

So we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.
- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.

But note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's good.

However, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tested before.

- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.
- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn't end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.

- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.
- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.

We also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don't know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. But we can assume for now.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.

We can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.

But we are not sure about the position of N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.

But we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven't tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.

But ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.

Another candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So we must avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.

But let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.

We can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn't have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.

However, including N might help us find its position.

But note: if we don't include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don't include N, we won't get any indication about N, but we know it's there. So it's better to include N to test a new position.

So I think we should include N.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels or consonants.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.

""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don't know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.

But ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it's a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""NOISE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn't end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn't end with E.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

We are going to guess ""NOISE"".

The word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.

If the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.

If N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it's in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.

So it's informative.

Another candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).

""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.

So I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.

We can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E's? And doesn't have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don't include it, we don't test a new position.

But I think including N is better.

Another word: ""NEEDY"" doesn't end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.

""NEWIE"" not a word.

I think ""NOISE"" is good.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that's correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).

So we are testing if N is in position 1.

If we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.

Either way, we get information.

Also, we test O, I, S.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.
- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.
- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

### Key Insights:
1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.
4. The next guess should:
   - End with E (to leverage the known position).
   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.
   - Avoid C, R, A.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).
  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.
- **Why ""NOISE""?**:
  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.
  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.
  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.

<guess>NOISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓) 
- N is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for N, meaning it's present but not in position 1).
- O, I, S are not in the word (all x).
- E is in position 5 (confirmed again).

What we know:
1. The word has E in position 5: [ ? , ? , ? , ? , E ]
2. The word contains N, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) or position 1 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, O, I, S (from previous x's).

Since N can only be in position 2 or 3, and E is at position 5, we can write the word as:
- If N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]
- If N in position 3: [ ?, ?, N, ?, E ]

We need to avoid letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and O, I, S (from guess 2). So used and excluded are: C,R,A,O,I,S.

We know N and E are in the word.

Now, for the remaining letters, we should try common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. Remaining vowels: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and has N in position 2 or 3.

Let's brainstorm words:

Case 1: N in position 2 (format: ? N ? ? E)
- Examples: 
  - ""UNDUE"" - but has U and D, but also U at position 1? Let's check: U N D U E -> position: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). But U appears twice? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the fourth letter is U, but we don't know about U. However, we haven't excluded U yet. But note: the word has to have distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible. Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters. But this word has U and D. 
  - ""ANKLE"" - but A is excluded (from guess1).
  - ""INLET"" - ends with T, not E.
  - Need the word to end with E: so ? N ? ? E.
  - Valid words: 
    - ""UNTIE"": U N T I E -> but I is excluded (from guess2).
    - ""UNMEE"" not a word.
    - ""UNSEE"" not a word.
    - ""UNGUE"" not common.
    - ""UNWED"": ends with D, not E.
    - ""UNCLE"": C excluded and ends with E? U N C L E -> C is excluded.
    - ""UNDUE"": as above, but has two U's? U N D U E. And we don't know if U is allowed.

Case 2: N in position 3 (format: ? ? N ? E)
- Examples:
  - ""PLANE"": A excluded.
  - ""CRANE"": C excluded and we know N not in position 4? But in CRANE, N is in position 4? Anyway excluded.
  - ""THINE"": T H I N E -> I excluded.
  - ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> O excluded.
  - ""SHONE"": S H O N E -> O excluded and S excluded.
  - ""GIVEN"": ends with N, not E? G-I-V-E-N, so E is fourth? G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5). Not E at end.
  - We need E at the end: so ? ? N ? E.
  - Valid words:
    - ""BUNCE"": not common and has C? B U N C E -> C excluded.
    - ""DUNCE"": D U N C E -> C excluded.
    - ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> letters L, U, G. No excluded letters. U is new, L and G new.
    - ""SINGE"": S excluded and I excluded.
    - ""TINGE"": T I N G E -> I excluded? And T and G are new? But I is excluded (from guess2), so cannot use.
    - ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded.
    - ""FUNGI"": not E ending.
    - ""RUNGE"": R excluded? R is excluded? Guess1: R(x).

So for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L,U,N,G,E) seems valid. It avoids excluded letters.

What about N in position 2? We had trouble finding options. Let me think:
  - ""ANGEL"": A excluded and ends with L.
  - ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> but R excluded. And ends with R? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)R(5). Not E at end.
  - ""INDEX"": I excluded and ends with X.
  - ""UNFED"": U N F E D -> ends with D. But word: U N F E D, so fifth letter D.
  - ""UNTIE"": I excluded.
  - ""UNSET"": S excluded and ends with T.
  - ""UNWED"": ends with D.
  - ""UNMET"": M E T? ends with T. U N M E T -> T at end.
  - ""UNITE"": I excluded.

So maybe there are no common words with N in position 2, ending with E, and without excluded letters? 

Let's list letters not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y is sometimes vowel).

Now, for N in position 2: ? N ? ? E

First ? must be a vowel or consonant? We need a word: 

Possible:
- ""UNITE"" but I excluded.
- ""UNLTE"" not a word.
- ""UNGTE"" not a word.
- How about ""UNDUE""? U N D U E -> that is a word. And letters: U, D. We haven't excluded U or D. So why not? 

But ""UNDUE"" has two U's? So it contains U twice? But the word uses U at positions 1 and 4? And N at 2, D at 3, E at 5.

The feedback: would it be marked? The secret word might not have two U's? We don't know. 

But in this case, we can try ""UNDUE"", but it uses U twice, which might not be efficient.

Another word: ""UNPEG"" doesn't end with E.

""UNSEE"" not a word.

So perhaps ""UNDUE"" is acceptable.

But we have an alternative for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"".

Now, we don't know if N is in position 2 or 3, so we need to test.

We can choose a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

Another word for N in position 2: ""UNREE"" not a word. ""UNBER"" not E ending.

Perhaps ""UPEND"": U P E N D -> ends with D? And E is in position 3? Not E ending.

But wait, ""UPEND"" means to end something? But it doesn't end with E.

Maybe ""ADDED"" not E ending.

So I think the only common word with N in position 2 and E ending is ""UNDUE"", but it has repeated U.

However, there might be others: ""UNHUE""? Not a word.

Perhaps we don't force the position and choose a word that tests N in a new position? But we don't have many tries.

We can choose ""LUNGE"", which assumes N in position 3, but if N is actually in position 2, we'll get feedback that it's wrong and we can adjust.

Similarly, if we choose ""UNDUE"", it tests N in position 2.

But ""UNDUE"" uses two U's, which might not be ideal because:
- If the word has only one U, then the U at position 1 might be marked correctly or as dash, and the U at position 4 might be x if not in word? But if the word has U only once, then one U will get the feedback (dash if not in correct position, but we don't know which one).

Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are handled by marking each occurrence. But if the secret word has only one U, then one U in our guess would be marked as present (or correct) and the other might be absent? But it depends on the actual count.

To avoid complexity, maybe choose a word without duplicates.

Another word for N in position 3: ""RANGE"" R excluded.

""MANGE"" A excluded.

""BENNE"" B E N N E? Two N's? B(1)E(2)N(3)N(4)E(5). We know N is present, but we don't know if there are two N's. But in feedback for guess1, we had one N dash, but if there were two N's, we might have missed one? Actually, guess1 had only one N, so we saw one dash, meaning at least one N. There could be two.

In ""BENNE"", we have two N's, but fourth position is N? But we know N cannot be in position 4? From guess1, feedback said N not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. But in ""BENNE"", position 4 is N? So that would be invalid because we know position 4 is not N. So we cannot use a word with N in position 4.

Therefore, words must avoid putting N in position 4.

Back to ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). N is in position 3, which is acceptable.

Similarly, ""PURGE"" doesn't have N.

Another one: ""MINKE"" M I N K E -> but I is excluded? Guess2: I(x), so I is excluded. Cannot use.

""FUDGE"" doesn't have N.

So I think ""LUNGE"" is a good choice for N in position 3.

For position 2, we have ""UNDUE"", but let's see if there's another: ""ANKHS"" not E ending. How about ""UNWEPT""? Too long.

""UNATE""? Not a word.

So maybe the words are rare.

Therefore, I propose to guess ""LUNGE"", which tests N in position 3 and introduces L, U, G.

If that is not correct, we can try other options later.

Therefore, next guess: ""LUNGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - E is in the word and in position 5.  
    - N is present but not in position 4.  
    - C, R, A are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - N is present but not in position 1.  
    - O, I, S are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is confirmed again.  

**Key Conclusions:**  
1. **Fixed Position**:  
   - Position 5 must be **E** → Word pattern: `[?][?][?][?]E`  
2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **N** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 (from NOISE feedback) or 4 (from CRANE feedback).  
   → N must be in **position 2 or 3**.  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S are not in the word → Must avoid these letters.  
4. **Letters to Test**:  
   - Focus on new common letters like B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, U.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test the position of N (position 2 or 3) while introducing untested letters to gather maximum information.  
- **Word Structure**:  
  - Case 1: If N in position 2 → `[?] N [?] [?] E` (e.g., `UNDUE`, but has duplicate U).  
  - Case 2: If N in position 3 → `[?] [?] N [?] E` (e.g., `LUNGE`, `TINGE`).  
- **Preferred Approach**:  
  - Test **N in position 3** first, as `LUNGE` (valid word) avoids duplicates, uses common consonants (L, G), and includes U (untested vowel).  
  - If incorrect, future guesses can pivot to N in position 2.  
- **Why this word?**:  
  - Covers N in position 3, ruling out half the possibilities for N.  
  - Tests letters L, U, G (all high-frequency and untested).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).  

### Next Guess: LUNGE
- **Structure**: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)  
- **Expected Feedback**:  
  - If N is in position 3: ✓ for N.  
  - If N is in position 2: - (for N) since N is present but misplaced.  
  - Feedback for L, U, G will reveal their presence/absence.

- E is present and in position 5.

Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- N is present but not in position 1.
- O, I, S are absent.
- E in position 5 is confirmed.

Guess 3: LUNGE -> L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
- L is absent.
- U is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 3.
- G is absent.
- E in position 5 is confirmed.

What we know:
1. The word ends with E: [ ?, ?, ?, ?, E ]
2. N is present, but not in position 1 (from guess2), not in position 3 (from guess3), and not in position 4 (from guess1). Therefore, N must be in position 2. The only position left is 2.

So, the word has N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]

3. U is present but not in position 2 (from guess3, since U was in position 2 and got a dash). But position 2 is now N, so U must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 4. However, position 5 is E, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

4. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G (from all feedbacks: x means absent).

So, absent: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

5. We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S, L, U, G. The only known present letters are N, E, and U (and we know E and N positions partially).

Present letters: N (in position 2), E (in position 5), and U (somewhere, not in position 2).

The word has three known letters: N, E, U, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The word structure: [ ? , N, ? , ? , E ]

U is in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: 
- Position 2: N
- Position 5: E
- Contains U (in position 1, 3, or 4)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G

Available letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and U is already present, but we need to place it).

We can try to form words.

Let's consider the possibilities for U:

Case 1: U in position 1: U N ? ? E
- Examples: 
  - ""UNITE"" but I is absent.
  - ""UNDUE"" but U in position 1 and 4? But we have U in position 1 and then another U? Also, D is available. But ""UNDUE"" has two U's? And we know U is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for LUNGE, we had U in position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one U is present. If the word has only one U, then in ""UNDUE"" we would have two U's: one might be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But it's messy.

  Let me check: if the word has only one U, and we guess ""UNDUE"", then:
  - If the U is in position 1, then the first U is correct (if the word has U in position 1) or dash (if U is elsewhere). But the second U (position 4) would be absent if the word has only one U.

  But we don't know the count. So it's better to avoid duplicates if possible.

Case 2: U in position 3: ? N U ? E
- Examples: 
  - ""INURE"" but I absent.
  - ""ENNUI"" doesn't end with E? E N N U I -> not E at end.
  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.
  - ""UNTIE"" I absent.
  - ""ANURY"" not a word.
  - Let's think: ""TUNED"" ends with D? T U N E D -> not E at end.
  - We need to end with E: so ? N U ? E
  - Possible words: 
    - ""BUNCE"" but C absent? B U N C E -> C is absent, so invalid.
    - ""DUNCE"" D U N C E -> C absent.
    - ""FUNGI"" not E ending.
    - ""JUNTA"" not E ending.
    - ""MUNGE"" but G absent? M U N G E -> G is absent (from guess3: G(x)).
    - ""PUNCE"" not common and has C? P U N C E -> C absent.
    - ""RUNED"" ends with D? R U N E D -> R absent and ends with D.
    - ""TUNER"" ends with R? T U N E R -> R absent.
    - ""HUNKE"" not a word? Or ""HUNKY"" not E ending.
    - ""PUNKA"" not E ending.

  I'm struggling. What about ""DUNES""? But S absent? D U N E S -> S is absent (from guess2: S(x)), and also the structure is D(1)U(2)N(3)E(4)S(5) but we need position 2 to be N? In ""DUNES"", position 2 is U, not N. We need position 2 to be N.

  We have [ ? , N, U, ? , E ] for this case.

  So: position 1: ?, position 2: N, position 3: U, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

  Words: 
  - ""ENNUI"" not E ending.
  - ""INUKU"" not a word.
  - ""ANURA"" not E and A absent.
  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""CNUTS"" not E and C,S absent.
  - ""DNUTS"" not a word.
  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""GNUS"" too short.
  - ""HNUES"" not a word? And S absent.
  - ""KNUDS"" not E ending.
  - ""MNUES"" not a word? M N U E S -> S absent.
  - ""PNUTS"" not E and S absent.
  - ""TNUES"" not a word? T N U E S -> S absent.
  - ""UNKED"" U N K E D -> but position 1 is U, not ? for position 1. This is for case 1? We are in case 2: position 1 is not U, position 3 is U.

  Let me search: is there a word like ""X N U X E"" where X are letters not excluded.

  For example: 
  - ""ENURE"": E N U R E -> but R is absent, and also E in position 1? But we don't know if E is only at the end? We have E at the end, but it might be elsewhere? In feedback, we only know about the E at position 5. There could be another E? But in guess1 and guess2, we had E only at position 5 and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn't know. So it's possible.

  ""ENURE"": E(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> but R is absent, so invalid.

  ""INURE"": I(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> I and R absent.

  ""ONURE"" not a word.

  ""UNSEE"" S absent.

  I think there are no common words for this pattern.

Case 3: U in position 4: ? N ? U E
- Structure: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]
- Examples:
  - ""ANVIL"" not E ending.
  - ""ENDUE"": E N D U E -> E in position 1 and 5? But we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, D is available.
  - ""INSUE"" I and S absent.
  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.
  - ""UNDEE"" U N D E E -> but E in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)E(5). So position 4 is E, but we have U in position 4? No, in this word, position 4 is E, not U. We need U in position 4.

  So: position 4 must be U: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]

  Words:
  - ""ENHUB"" not a word.
  - ""INJUD"" not E ending.
  - ""ANGRU"" not E ending.
  - ""BENDU"" not E ending.
  - ""DENUM"" not E ending.
  - ""FENDU"" not E ending? F E N D U -> ends with U.
  - ""GENUA"" not E ending.
  - ""MENUS"" S absent and ends with S.
  - ""PENDU"" not E ending.
  - ""TENDU"" T E N D U -> ends with U.
  - ""VENDU"" V E N D U -> ends with U.

  We need to end with E, so the word must be ...E, so position 5 is E, so position 4 is U, so the word ends with ""UE"". 

  Words ending with ""UE"": 
  - ""ARGUE"" R absent.
  - ""BEGUE"" not common.
  - ""DUE"" too short.
  - ""FUGUE"" G absent and U in position 2? F U G U E -> not our pattern.
  - ""HONGU"" not a word.
  - ""JUNGU"" not a word.
  - ""TONGUE"" too long? 6 letters.
  - ""VENUE"" V E N U E? V(1)E(2)N(3)U(4)E(5) -> but position 2 is E, not N. We need position 2 to be N.

  We need position 2 to be N: so the word is [X, N, Y, U, E]

  Examples: 
  - ""ENHUE"" not a word? E N H U E -> E in position 1 and 5, H in position 3.
  - ""INHUE"" not a word.
  - ""ONURE"" not a word.
  - ""UNBUE"" not a word.
  - ""ANXUE"" not a word.

  How about ""ENDUE""? But ""ENDUE"" is E N D U E, so positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). This matches the pattern: position 2 is N, position 4 is U, position 5 is E. And it has E in position 1 as well? But we don't know if that's allowed.

  ""ENDUE"" is a word: to endow or provide.

  And it uses D, which is not excluded.

  Also, it has two E's? But that's okay.

  Now, check the absent letters: E, N, D, U, E. The letters are E, N, D, U. We know E, N, U are present, D is new and not excluded.

  Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G. D is not in that list, so it's okay.

  So ""ENDUE"" is a candidate.

  But we have U in position 4, which is what we want.

  Also, in this word, position 1 is E. We don't know if E is in position 1? But we only know that E is in position 5. It could be in other positions? Yes, it's possible.

  So ""ENDUE"" seems valid.

  But let's confirm the feedback we would get.

  We know:
  - Position 2: N is correct, so we should get a check for N.
  - Position 5: E is correct, check.
  - Position 4: U, we are guessing U in position 4, and if the word has U in position 4, then check. But we don't know if U is in position 4? We only know U is present, but not where. In this guess, we are testing U in position 4.

  Also, position 1: E, if the word has E in position 1, then check; otherwise, if E is only at the end, then position 1 E would be marked as absent? But we know E is at the end, but it might be elsewhere. If the word has only one E (at position 5), then the E at position 1 would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word elsewhere? But wait, if the word has only one E, and it's at position 5, then an E at position 1 would be marked as not in the word (x). But if the word has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position (-) if not in position 1.

  But in our case, we are trying to solve, so we can use this to get information.

  However, we have limited guesses, so we need to be careful.

  Another candidate: ""UNTIE"" but I and T? I is absent.

  Or ""UNMET"" ends with T.

  So ""ENDUE"" seems a good candidate.

  But we also have the possibility that U is in position 1 or 3, but we couldn't find words for those. So maybe U is in position 4.

  Therefore, I think ""ENDUE"" is a valid guess.

  But note: in ""ENDUE"", we have E in position 1 and 5. We don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible.

  Alternatively, is there a word without duplicate E? For example, with U in position 4 and no E at position 1.

  For pattern [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]:

  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""CNUZE"" not a word.
  - ""DNUTS"" not E ending.
  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.
  - ""KNUPE"" not a word? K N U P E -> K(1)N(2)U(3)? No, we need U in position 4: so [K, N, ?, U, E] -> K N ? U E.

  ""KNULE"" not a word.

  ""MNEME"" not U in position 4.

  I think ""ENDUE"" is the only common word.

  Another one: ""INDUE"" but I is absent. I(1)N(2)D(3)U(4)E(5) -> I absent.

  So ""ENDUE"" is the best bet.

  But we have to consider that we might have U in position 1.

  For U in position 1: [U, N, ?, ?, E]

  We need a word: U N ? ? E

  Examples:
  - ""UNDEE"": U N D E E -> positions: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? But in this word, position 4 is E, so the word is U N D E E. But we know position 5 is E, so position 4 is E? That's possible. But then we have two E's: position 4 and 5.

  ""UNDEE"" is a word? It means a wave, I think? Or not common.

  ""UNDEN"" not E ending.

  ""UNLED"" ends with D.

  ""UNMET"" ends with T.

  ""UNPEG"" ends with G.

  ""UNSET"" S absent.

  ""UNWED"" ends with D.

  ""UNZIP"" ends with P.

  ""UNDYE"" U N D Y E -> Y in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)Y(4)E(5). So Y is in position 4. And Y is not excluded.

  ""UNDYE"" is a word? To remove dye? Not common, but valid.

  So we have two candidates: ""ENDUE"" and ""UNDYE"".

  But ""UNDYE"" has U in position 1, which is a possibility.

  We also have ""ENDUE"" with U in position 4.

  How to choose?

  We can also consider the frequency of letters.

  But we have to make a guess.

  Let's see what information we can get.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume U's position but tests multiple possibilities.

  But it's hard because we have to avoid many letters.

  We know U is present, so we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested: position 1 or 4 (since position 2 and 3 are tested and not U).

  We haven't tested position 1 or 4 for U.

  In ""ENDUE"", we test U in position 4 and E in position 1.

  In ""UNDYE"", we test U in position 1 and Y in position 4.

  We also have to consider that the word might have only one U.

  Since we have limited guesses, and we are on the fourth guess (we have three guesses left), we can try one.

  I think ""ENDUE"" is more common.

  But let's see the feedback from guess3: U was in position 2 and got a dash, so U is not in position 2, but it is in the word. That doesn't give us information about other positions.

  Perhaps we can try to guess a word that has U in position 1 and also tests other letters.

  But I think we should go with ""ENDUE"".

  Or, to avoid the duplicate E, we can try ""UNDYE"".

  But ""UNDYE"" uses Y, which is less common.

  Another idea: is there a word with U in position 4 and without E in position 1? For example, [X, N, Y, U, E] where X is not E.

  We had ""INDUE"" but I absent.

  ""KNDUE"" not a word.

  ""MNDUE"" not a word.

  ""PNDUE"" not a word.

  ""TNDUE"" not a word.

  ""WNDUE"" not a word.

  So no common words.

  Therefore, the only common word we have is ""ENDUE"".

  So I'll go with ""ENDUE"".

  But let's double-check the feedback we might get.

  If the word is ""ENDUE"", then we get:
  - E in position 1: if the word has E in position 1, then ✓; but if not, then x or -.
  But we know the word has E in position 5, and it might have another E.

  If the word is not ""ENDUE"", but has U in position 4, then we might get feedback that helps.

  For example, if we guess ""ENDUE"" and the word is something else with U in position 4, then:
  - Position 1: E might be absent or present elsewhere.
  - Position 2: N is correct, so ✓.
  - Position 3: D might be correct or not.
  - Position 4: U might be correct or not (if U is in position 4, then ✓).
  - Position 5: E ✓.

  But we are hoping to solve it.

  Given that we have to guess, I think ""ENDUE"" is a reasonable choice.

  So next guess: ""ENDUE""

But wait, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can also consider that we might have missed something.

Another possibility: what if the word has U in position 1? And we haven't guessed it.

For example, ""UNDER"" but R absent.

""UNMET"" ends with T.

""UNGET"" G absent.

""UNLET"" L absent.

""UNPEN"" ends with N.

""UNSEW"" S absent.

""UNWET"" ends with T.

""UNKED"" U N K E D -> ends with D.

""UNKID"" not a word.

""UNBED"" U N B E D -> ends with D.

""UNFED"" U N F E D -> ends with D.

""UNJAM"" not E ending.

So no common words ending with E for U in position 1 except ""UNDYE"" or ""UNDEE"".

""UNDEE"" has two E's: U N D E E.

But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? No, in ""UNDEE"", position 4 is E and position 5 is E, so it's possible.

But then the word would have two E's.

In our feedback, we only have one E confirmed (position 5), so there could be another.

But in ""UNDEE"", we have U in position 1, N in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, E in position 5.

So if we guess ""UNDEE"", then:
- U in position 1: if U is in position 1, then ✓ or -? But we know U is present, so if not in position 1, then -.
- N in position 2: ✓ (since we know N is in position 2).
- D in position 3: ? 
- E in position 4: if the word has E in position 4, then ✓, but if not, then - (since E is in the word at position 5).
- E in position 5: ✓.

But we don't know if the word has E in position 4.

However, we are not sure.

Given the time, I think ""ENDUE"" is a better choice because it's more common.

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - E is in position 5.  
    - N is present but not in position 4.  
    - C, R, A are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - N is present but not in position 1.  
    - O, I, S are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is confirmed.  
- **Guess 3 (LUNGE)**: L(x), U(-), N(-), G(x), E(✓)  
  → **Insights**:  
    - U is present but not in position 2.  
    - N is present but not in position 3.  
    - L, G are absent.  
    - E in position 5 is reconfirmed.  

**Key Conclusions:**  
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 5 is **E**.  
   - **N must be in position 2** (the only remaining position, as it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).  
   → Word pattern: `[?] N [?] [?] E`  
2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **U** is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G are **not in the word** (must avoid these).  
4. **Remaining Letters**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
   - Available vowels: U (already confirmed), and Y (sometimes vowel).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**:  
  - Confirm the position of U (position 1, 3, or 4).  
  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, T, M, H) to cover remaining unknowns.  
- **Word Selection**:  
  - **Pattern**: `[?] N [?] [?] E` (N in position 2, E in position 5).  
  - U must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.  
  - After evaluating options (e.g., ""UNDUE"", ""ENDUE"", ""UNDYE""), **""ENDUE""** is optimal:  
    - Ends with E, places N in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  
    - Tests U in position 4 (critical for narrowing U's location).  
    - Introduces D (position 3) and E (position 1) — E may be duplicated.  
    - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- **Why ""ENDUE""?**  
  - If U is in position 4, feedback will confirm with ✓.  
  - If U is not in position 4, feedback will show - (misplaced) or x (absent), ruling out position 4.  
  - Tests E in position 1 (if E is duplicated, feedback may show - or ✓).  
  - Tests D in position 3 (new letter).

This avoids C, R, A. And it ends with E. We can put N in position 3? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nWe can try ""LINED"":\n- L in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4? But wait, we know position 5 is E, so position 4 must be something else. In ""LINED"", the letters are L-I-N-E-D, so the fifth letter is D? That doesn\'t match because we need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nWe need a word that ends with E, so the fifth letter must be E.\n\nSo the word must be ? ? ? ? E.\n\nNow, we have to put N in one of the first three positions? Or the fourth? But we know from feedback that N is not in the fourth position (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash, meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo the word structure: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\nAnd N is in one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe also know that letter4 is not N (because of the feedback).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit: ? ? ? ? E, with N in one of the first three, and without C, R, A.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> but S is new, N in position 2? But we don\'t know. Also, we have to avoid using excluded letters? We don\'t know about S, I, D.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are not in the word (C, R, A). So S, I, D are allowed.\n\nHowever, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> but this has O, I, S, and ends with E. But note: if we put N in position 1, then we are testing if N is in position 1. But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, S.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Probably not, but we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, and N is somewhere in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in a different position than we think and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nPosition 1: words like ""NICHE"" (but has C, excluded), ""NAIVE"" (has A, excluded), ""NOBLE"" (has B, L, E; but we don\'t know about B and L). But we avoid A and C.\n\n""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no C, R, A. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nPosition 2: words like ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T -> but the fifth letter is T, not E). We need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo for position 2: ""?N?E"". Examples: ""INNEE"" not a word, ""UNSEE"" not common, ""ONCET"" not E ending. How about ""ANODE"" but has A (excluded). ""INURE"" (I, N, U, R, E) but R is excluded. ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> that could work? But we don\'t know about G and L.\n\n""INGLE"" is a word (meaning a fire in a fireplace).\n\nPosition 3: ""??N?E"". Examples: ""PLANE"" has A (excluded), ""STONE"" has S, T, O, N, E -> no excluded letters? S, T, O, N, E. And ends with E. N is in position 4? But wait, in ""STONE"", the positions are: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know from the feedback that N is not in position 4 (because in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got a dash). So if we use ""STONE"", we would be putting N in position 4 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\nWe should avoid putting N in position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo for position 3: we need a word with N in position 3 and E at the end. Example: ""CONED"" has C and O, N, E, D -> but C is excluded. ""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D -> no excluded letters. So ""BONED"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> but wait, the fifth letter is D, not E. We need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo we need the word to end with E, so the fifth letter is E. Therefore, the fourth letter must be the one before E.\n\nSo for a word with N in position 3: the structure is [letter1][letter2]N[letter4]E.\n\nWe need a valid word of the form ??N?E.\n\nExamples: ""MINCE"" has C (excluded). ""DANCE"" has A and C (excluded). ""BUNCE"" not common. ""LUNGE"": L, U, N, G, E -> that works? L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). So N is in position 3, and we avoid C, R, A.\n\nSimilarly, ""SINGE"": S, I, N, G, E -> S(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5).\n\n""TINGE"": T, I, N, G, E.\n\nSo these are candidates.\n\nNow, we also have to consider that we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We know C, R, A are absent. N and E are present.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should avoid C, R, A, and we can reuse N and E (but E must be at the end).\n\nWe can use the following new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to cover more common letters to get information.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nSo a word like ""SLINE"" is not a word. ""STINE"" not common. ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nWe must avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nSo we need a word that has N in position 1, 2, or 3, and ends with E.\n\nLet me list some candidates:\n\n- N in position 1: ""NOBLE"" (N, O, B, L, E) -> tests O, B, L.\n- N in position 1: ""NOISE"" (N, O, I, S, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E, so positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So that works? But we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position. And we test O, I, S.\n\nBut note: we know the fifth letter is E, so in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that\'s good.\n\nHowever, we are putting N in position 1, which we haven\'t tested before.\n\n- N in position 2: ""INGLE"" (I, N, G, L, E) -> tests I, G, L.\n- N in position 2: ""UNLIT"" doesn\'t end with E. ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E) -> but then the fifth letter is E? ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so E at the end. And N in position 2. Tests U, I, T.\n\n- N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L, U, N, G, E) -> tests L, U, G.\n- N in position 3: ""SINGE"" (S, I, N, G, E) -> tests S, I, G.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word might have the letter E only at the end? But we don\'t know. It might have E elsewhere? But in our feedback, we only have one E and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn\'t know. But we can assume for now.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to maximize the information.\n\nWe can choose a word that has many common letters and avoids repeating the same position for N if we are unsure.\n\nBut we are not sure about the position of N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have N at all? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to test a new position.\n\nBut we are required to form a valid word, and we know N is in the word, so we can use it.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: N, O, I, S, E. And it tests N in position 1, which we haven\'t tested. Also, it tests O, I, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" is good because it tests U, N, I, T, E.\n\nBut ""UNITE"" has U which is less common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SOOTE"" not a word. ""SHONE"" (S, H, O, N, E) -> but N is in position 4? In ""SHONE"": S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nSo we must avoid position 4 for N.\n\nTherefore, ""NOISE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if ""NOISE"" is valid: yes, it means a sound.\n\nWe can also consider ""TOISE"" not a word. ""POISE"" (P, O, I, S, E) -> but that doesn\'t have N. We know the word has an N, so if we don\'t include N, we might not get information about its position. But we can still get information about other letters.\n\nHowever, including N might help us find its position.\n\nBut note: if we don\'t include N, then the feedback for the word will show that we are missing N? Actually, the feedback will mark any letter that is in the word. So if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get any indication about N, but we know it\'s there. So it\'s better to include N to test a new position.\n\nSo I think we should include N.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that tests more vowels or consonants.\n\nAnother idea: ""OUNCE"" has C (excluded) and ends with E? ""OUNCE"" is O-U-N-C-E, so C is excluded.\n\n""MINKE"" has M, I, N, K, E -> but we don\'t know about M, I, K. And N is in position 3? ""MINKE"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5). So that works.\n\nBut ""MINKE"" is a type of whale, so it\'s a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""LINEN"" doesn\'t end with E. ""NINNY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see the feedback we might get.\n\nWe are going to guess ""NOISE"".\n\nThe word is ? ? ? ? E, and we are guessing N, O, I, S, E.\n\nIf the word has N in position 1, then we get a check for N and for E (since E is at the end). Then we get information about O, I, S.\n\nIf N is not in position 1, then we get a dash for N if it\'s in the word but not position 1 (which we know it is in the word, so it must be a dash or check). And then we know N is in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback for O, I, S.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SINCE"" has C (excluded).\n\n""THINE"" has T, H, I, N, E -> but ""THINE"" is an old word for ""yours"", and it ends with E. N is in position 4? T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nSo I think ""NOISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 tries total, so we are on the second of six.\n\nWe can also consider ""LOUIE"" but that has two E\'s? And doesn\'t have N. We need to include N? Not necessarily, but we know N is in the word, so if we don\'t include it, we don\'t test a new position.\n\nBut I think including N is better.\n\nAnother word: ""NEEDY"" doesn\'t end with E? It ends with Y. We need to end with E.\n\n""NEWIE"" not a word.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut let me check: in ""NOISE"", the fifth letter is E, so that\'s correct. And we are putting N in position 1, which is a new position (we previously had N in position 4, which was wrong).\n\nSo we are testing if N is in position 1.\n\nIf we get a check for N, then we know position 1 is N. If we get a dash, then N is in position 2 or 3.\n\nEither way, we get information.\n\nAlso, we test O, I, S.\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.\n- **R(x)**: R is not in the word.\n- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.\n- **N(-)**: N is in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- **E(✓)**: E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The word **ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).\n2. **N is present** but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).\n3. **C, R, and A are absent** from the word and should be avoided in future guesses.\n4. The next guess should:\n   - End with E (to leverage the known position).\n   - Include N in a new position (1, 2, or 3) to test its location.\n   - Avoid C, R, A.\n   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L) to maximize information.\n\n### Thought Process for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal**: Test N in a new position (position 1, since position 4 was already ruled out) and cover frequent letters like O, I, S.\n- **Candidate Words**:\n  - ""NOISE"": Ends with E, places N in position 1 (untested), and introduces O, I, S. Valid word (meaning a sound or disturbance).\n  - Alternatives considered: ""UNITE"" (N in position 2, tests U, I, T) and ""SINGE"" (N in position 3, tests S, I, G). ""NOISE"" is preferred because it uses more common letters (O, I, S) and tests position 1 for N.\n- **Why ""NOISE""?**:\n  - If N is in position 1, we get a ✓ for N, confirming its position.\n  - If N is not in position 1, we get a - for N (since N is present but misplaced), narrowing it to position 2 or 3.\n  - Feedback for O, I, and S will reveal if any are present and their positions, regardless of N.\n\n<guess>NOISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\n- C, R, A are not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓) \n- N is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for N, meaning it\'s present but not in position 1).\n- O, I, S are not in the word (all x).\n- E is in position 5 (confirmed again).\n\nWhat we know:\n1. The word has E in position 5: [ ? , ? , ? , ? , E ]\n2. The word contains N, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) or position 1 (from guess 2). So N must be in position 2 or 3.\n3. The word does NOT contain: C, R, A, O, I, S (from previous x\'s).\n\nSince N can only be in position 2 or 3, and E is at position 5, we can write the word as:\n- If N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]\n- If N in position 3: [ ?, ?, N, ?, E ]\n\nWe need to avoid letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.\n\nWe have used letters: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and O, I, S (from guess 2). So used and excluded are: C,R,A,O,I,S.\n\nWe know N and E are in the word.\n\nNow, for the remaining letters, we should try common consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tried. Remaining vowels: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and has N in position 2 or 3.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words:\n\nCase 1: N in position 2 (format: ? N ? ? E)\n- Examples: \n  - ""UNDUE"" - but has U and D, but also U at position 1? Let\'s check: U N D U E -> position: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). But U appears twice? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the fourth letter is U, but we don\'t know about U. However, we haven\'t excluded U yet. But note: the word has to have distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible. Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters. But this word has U and D. \n  - ""ANKLE"" - but A is excluded (from guess1).\n  - ""INLET"" - ends with T, not E.\n  - Need the word to end with E: so ? N ? ? E.\n  - Valid words: \n    - ""UNTIE"": U N T I E -> but I is excluded (from guess2).\n    - ""UNMEE"" not a word.\n    - ""UNSEE"" not a word.\n    - ""UNGUE"" not common.\n    - ""UNWED"": ends with D, not E.\n    - ""UNCLE"": C excluded and ends with E? U N C L E -> C is excluded.\n    - ""UNDUE"": as above, but has two U\'s? U N D U E. And we don\'t know if U is allowed.\n\nCase 2: N in position 3 (format: ? ? N ? E)\n- Examples:\n  - ""PLANE"": A excluded.\n  - ""CRANE"": C excluded and we know N not in position 4? But in CRANE, N is in position 4? Anyway excluded.\n  - ""THINE"": T H I N E -> I excluded.\n  - ""PHONE"": P H O N E -> O excluded.\n  - ""SHONE"": S H O N E -> O excluded and S excluded.\n  - ""GIVEN"": ends with N, not E? G-I-V-E-N, so E is fourth? G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5). Not E at end.\n  - We need E at the end: so ? ? N ? E.\n  - Valid words:\n    - ""BUNCE"": not common and has C? B U N C E -> C excluded.\n    - ""DUNCE"": D U N C E -> C excluded.\n    - ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> letters L, U, G. No excluded letters. U is new, L and G new.\n    - ""SINGE"": S excluded and I excluded.\n    - ""TINGE"": T I N G E -> I excluded? And T and G are new? But I is excluded (from guess2), so cannot use.\n    - ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded.\n    - ""FUNGI"": not E ending.\n    - ""RUNGE"": R excluded? R is excluded? Guess1: R(x).\n\nSo for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"" (L,U,N,G,E) seems valid. It avoids excluded letters.\n\nWhat about N in position 2? We had trouble finding options. Let me think:\n  - ""ANGEL"": A excluded and ends with L.\n  - ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> but R excluded. And ends with R? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)R(5). Not E at end.\n  - ""INDEX"": I excluded and ends with X.\n  - ""UNFED"": U N F E D -> ends with D. But word: U N F E D, so fifth letter D.\n  - ""UNTIE"": I excluded.\n  - ""UNSET"": S excluded and ends with T.\n  - ""UNWED"": ends with D.\n  - ""UNMET"": M E T? ends with T. U N M E T -> T at end.\n  - ""UNITE"": I excluded.\n\nSo maybe there are no common words with N in position 2, ending with E, and without excluded letters? \n\nLet\'s list letters not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y is sometimes vowel).\n\nNow, for N in position 2: ? N ? ? E\n\nFirst ? must be a vowel or consonant? We need a word: \n\nPossible:\n- ""UNITE"" but I excluded.\n- ""UNLTE"" not a word.\n- ""UNGTE"" not a word.\n- How about ""UNDUE""? U N D U E -> that is a word. And letters: U, D. We haven\'t excluded U or D. So why not? \n\nBut ""UNDUE"" has two U\'s? So it contains U twice? But the word uses U at positions 1 and 4? And N at 2, D at 3, E at 5.\n\nThe feedback: would it be marked? The secret word might not have two U\'s? We don\'t know. \n\nBut in this case, we can try ""UNDUE"", but it uses U twice, which might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""UNPEG"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""UNSEE"" not a word.\n\nSo perhaps ""UNDUE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we have an alternative for N in position 3: ""LUNGE"".\n\nNow, we don\'t know if N is in position 2 or 3, so we need to test.\n\nWe can choose a word that covers both possibilities? But it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word for N in position 2: ""UNREE"" not a word. ""UNBER"" not E ending.\n\nPerhaps ""UPEND"": U P E N D -> ends with D? And E is in position 3? Not E ending.\n\nBut wait, ""UPEND"" means to end something? But it doesn\'t end with E.\n\nMaybe ""ADDED"" not E ending.\n\nSo I think the only common word with N in position 2 and E ending is ""UNDUE"", but it has repeated U.\n\nHowever, there might be others: ""UNHUE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps we don\'t force the position and choose a word that tests N in a new position? But we don\'t have many tries.\n\nWe can choose ""LUNGE"", which assumes N in position 3, but if N is actually in position 2, we\'ll get feedback that it\'s wrong and we can adjust.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""UNDUE"", it tests N in position 2.\n\nBut ""UNDUE"" uses two U\'s, which might not be ideal because:\n- If the word has only one U, then the U at position 1 might be marked correctly or as dash, and the U at position 4 might be x if not in word? But if the word has U only once, then one U will get the feedback (dash if not in correct position, but we don\'t know which one).\n\nActually, in Wordle, duplicates are handled by marking each occurrence. But if the secret word has only one U, then one U in our guess would be marked as present (or correct) and the other might be absent? But it depends on the actual count.\n\nTo avoid complexity, maybe choose a word without duplicates.\n\nAnother word for N in position 3: ""RANGE"" R excluded.\n\n""MANGE"" A excluded.\n\n""BENNE"" B E N N E? Two N\'s? B(1)E(2)N(3)N(4)E(5). We know N is present, but we don\'t know if there are two N\'s. But in feedback for guess1, we had one N dash, but if there were two N\'s, we might have missed one? Actually, guess1 had only one N, so we saw one dash, meaning at least one N. There could be two.\n\nIn ""BENNE"", we have two N\'s, but fourth position is N? But we know N cannot be in position 4? From guess1, feedback said N not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. But in ""BENNE"", position 4 is N? So that would be invalid because we know position 4 is not N. So we cannot use a word with N in position 4.\n\nTherefore, words must avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nBack to ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). N is in position 3, which is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, ""PURGE"" doesn\'t have N.\n\nAnother one: ""MINKE"" M I N K E -> but I is excluded? Guess2: I(x), so I is excluded. Cannot use.\n\n""FUDGE"" doesn\'t have N.\n\nSo I think ""LUNGE"" is a good choice for N in position 3.\n\nFor position 2, we have ""UNDUE"", but let\'s see if there\'s another: ""ANKHS"" not E ending. How about ""UNWEPT""? Too long.\n\n""UNATE""? Not a word.\n\nSo maybe the words are rare.\n\nTherefore, I propose to guess ""LUNGE"", which tests N in position 3 and introduces L, U, G.\n\nIf that is not correct, we can try other options later.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""LUNGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n**Feedback Summary:**\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - E is in the word and in position 5.  \n    - N is present but not in position 4.  \n    - C, R, A are absent.  \n- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - N is present but not in position 1.  \n    - O, I, S are absent.  \n    - E in position 5 is confirmed again.  \n\n**Key Conclusions:**  \n1. **Fixed Position**:  \n   - Position 5 must be **E** → Word pattern: `[?][?][?][?]E`  \n2. **Present Letters**:  \n   - **N** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 (from NOISE feedback) or 4 (from CRANE feedback).  \n   → N must be in **position 2 or 3**.  \n3. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, R, A, O, I, S are not in the word → Must avoid these letters.  \n4. **Letters to Test**:  \n   - Focus on new common letters like B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, U.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- **Goal**: Test the position of N (position 2 or 3) while introducing untested letters to gather maximum information.  \n- **Word Structure**:  \n  - Case 1: If N in position 2 → `[?] N [?] [?] E` (e.g., `UNDUE`, but has duplicate U).  \n  - Case 2: If N in position 3 → `[?] [?] N [?] E` (e.g., `LUNGE`, `TINGE`).  \n- **Preferred Approach**:  \n  - Test **N in position 3** first, as `LUNGE` (valid word) avoids duplicates, uses common consonants (L, G), and includes U (untested vowel).  \n  - If incorrect, future guesses can pivot to N in position 2.  \n- **Why this word?**:  \n  - Covers N in position 3, ruling out half the possibilities for N.  \n  - Tests letters L, U, G (all high-frequency and untested).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).  \n\n### Next Guess: LUNGE\n- **Structure**: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)  \n- **Expected Feedback**:  \n  - If N is in position 3: ✓ for N.  \n  - If N is in position 2: - (for N) since N is present but misplaced.  \n  - Feedback for L, U, G will reveal their presence/absence.\n\n<guess>LUNGE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: LUNGE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\n- C, R, A are absent.\n- N is present but not in position 4.\n- E is present and in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n- N is present but not in position 1.\n- O, I, S are absent.\n- E in position 5 is confirmed.\n\nGuess 3: LUNGE -> L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)\n- L is absent.\n- U is present but not in position 2.\n- N is present but not in position 3.\n- G is absent.\n- E in position 5 is confirmed.\n\nWhat we know:\n1. The word ends with E: [ ?, ?, ?, ?, E ]\n2. N is present, but not in position 1 (from guess2), not in position 3 (from guess3), and not in position 4 (from guess1). Therefore, N must be in position 2. The only position left is 2.\n\nSo, the word has N in position 2: [ ?, N, ?, ?, E ]\n\n3. U is present but not in position 2 (from guess3, since U was in position 2 and got a dash). But position 2 is now N, so U must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 4. However, position 5 is E, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n4. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G (from all feedbacks: x means absent).\n\nSo, absent: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.\n\n5. We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S, L, U, G. The only known present letters are N, E, and U (and we know E and N positions partially).\n\nPresent letters: N (in position 2), E (in position 5), and U (somewhere, not in position 2).\n\nThe word has three known letters: N, E, U, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nThe word structure: [ ? , N, ? , ? , E ]\n\nU is in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: \n- Position 2: N\n- Position 5: E\n- Contains U (in position 1, 3, or 4)\n- Does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and U is already present, but we need to place it).\n\nWe can try to form words.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities for U:\n\nCase 1: U in position 1: U N ? ? E\n- Examples: \n  - ""UNITE"" but I is absent.\n  - ""UNDUE"" but U in position 1 and 4? But we have U in position 1 and then another U? Also, D is available. But ""UNDUE"" has two U\'s? And we know U is present, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for LUNGE, we had U in position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one U is present. If the word has only one U, then in ""UNDUE"" we would have two U\'s: one might be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But it\'s messy.\n\n  Let me check: if the word has only one U, and we guess ""UNDUE"", then:\n  - If the U is in position 1, then the first U is correct (if the word has U in position 1) or dash (if U is elsewhere). But the second U (position 4) would be absent if the word has only one U.\n\n  But we don\'t know the count. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nCase 2: U in position 3: ? N U ? E\n- Examples: \n  - ""INURE"" but I absent.\n  - ""ENNUI"" doesn\'t end with E? E N N U I -> not E at end.\n  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.\n  - ""UNTIE"" I absent.\n  - ""ANURY"" not a word.\n  - Let\'s think: ""TUNED"" ends with D? T U N E D -> not E at end.\n  - We need to end with E: so ? N U ? E\n  - Possible words: \n    - ""BUNCE"" but C absent? B U N C E -> C is absent, so invalid.\n    - ""DUNCE"" D U N C E -> C absent.\n    - ""FUNGI"" not E ending.\n    - ""JUNTA"" not E ending.\n    - ""MUNGE"" but G absent? M U N G E -> G is absent (from guess3: G(x)).\n    - ""PUNCE"" not common and has C? P U N C E -> C absent.\n    - ""RUNED"" ends with D? R U N E D -> R absent and ends with D.\n    - ""TUNER"" ends with R? T U N E R -> R absent.\n    - ""HUNKE"" not a word? Or ""HUNKY"" not E ending.\n    - ""PUNKA"" not E ending.\n\n  I\'m struggling. What about ""DUNES""? But S absent? D U N E S -> S is absent (from guess2: S(x)), and also the structure is D(1)U(2)N(3)E(4)S(5) but we need position 2 to be N? In ""DUNES"", position 2 is U, not N. We need position 2 to be N.\n\n  We have [ ? , N, U, ? , E ] for this case.\n\n  So: position 1: ?, position 2: N, position 3: U, position 4: ?, position 5: E.\n\n  Words: \n  - ""ENNUI"" not E ending.\n  - ""INUKU"" not a word.\n  - ""ANURA"" not E and A absent.\n  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.\n  - ""CNUTS"" not E and C,S absent.\n  - ""DNUTS"" not a word.\n  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.\n  - ""GNUS"" too short.\n  - ""HNUES"" not a word? And S absent.\n  - ""KNUDS"" not E ending.\n  - ""MNUES"" not a word? M N U E S -> S absent.\n  - ""PNUTS"" not E and S absent.\n  - ""TNUES"" not a word? T N U E S -> S absent.\n  - ""UNKED"" U N K E D -> but position 1 is U, not ? for position 1. This is for case 1? We are in case 2: position 1 is not U, position 3 is U.\n\n  Let me search: is there a word like ""X N U X E"" where X are letters not excluded.\n\n  For example: \n  - ""ENURE"": E N U R E -> but R is absent, and also E in position 1? But we don\'t know if E is only at the end? We have E at the end, but it might be elsewhere? In feedback, we only know about the E at position 5. There could be another E? But in guess1 and guess2, we had E only at position 5 and it was correct, so if there were another E, we wouldn\'t know. So it\'s possible.\n\n  ""ENURE"": E(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> but R is absent, so invalid.\n\n  ""INURE"": I(1) N(2) U(3) R(4) E(5) -> I and R absent.\n\n  ""ONURE"" not a word.\n\n  ""UNSEE"" S absent.\n\n  I think there are no common words for this pattern.\n\nCase 3: U in position 4: ? N ? U E\n- Structure: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]\n- Examples:\n  - ""ANVIL"" not E ending.\n  - ""ENDUE"": E N D U E -> E in position 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if E is duplicated. Also, D is available.\n  - ""INSUE"" I and S absent.\n  - ""ONCET"" not E ending.\n  - ""UNDEE"" U N D E E -> but E in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)E(4)E(5). So position 4 is E, but we have U in position 4? No, in this word, position 4 is E, not U. We need U in position 4.\n\n  So: position 4 must be U: [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]\n\n  Words:\n  - ""ENHUB"" not a word.\n  - ""INJUD"" not E ending.\n  - ""ANGRU"" not E ending.\n  - ""BENDU"" not E ending.\n  - ""DENUM"" not E ending.\n  - ""FENDU"" not E ending? F E N D U -> ends with U.\n  - ""GENUA"" not E ending.\n  - ""MENUS"" S absent and ends with S.\n  - ""PENDU"" not E ending.\n  - ""TENDU"" T E N D U -> ends with U.\n  - ""VENDU"" V E N D U -> ends with U.\n\n  We need to end with E, so the word must be ...E, so position 5 is E, so position 4 is U, so the word ends with ""UE"". \n\n  Words ending with ""UE"": \n  - ""ARGUE"" R absent.\n  - ""BEGUE"" not common.\n  - ""DUE"" too short.\n  - ""FUGUE"" G absent and U in position 2? F U G U E -> not our pattern.\n  - ""HONGU"" not a word.\n  - ""JUNGU"" not a word.\n  - ""TONGUE"" too long? 6 letters.\n  - ""VENUE"" V E N U E? V(1)E(2)N(3)U(4)E(5) -> but position 2 is E, not N. We need position 2 to be N.\n\n  We need position 2 to be N: so the word is [X, N, Y, U, E]\n\n  Examples: \n  - ""ENHUE"" not a word? E N H U E -> E in position 1 and 5, H in position 3.\n  - ""INHUE"" not a word.\n  - ""ONURE"" not a word.\n  - ""UNBUE"" not a word.\n  - ""ANXUE"" not a word.\n\n  How about ""ENDUE""? But ""ENDUE"" is E N D U E, so positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5). This matches the pattern: position 2 is N, position 4 is U, position 5 is E. And it has E in position 1 as well? But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed.\n\n  ""ENDUE"" is a word: to endow or provide.\n\n  And it uses D, which is not excluded.\n\n  Also, it has two E\'s? But that\'s okay.\n\n  Now, check the absent letters: E, N, D, U, E. The letters are E, N, D, U. We know E, N, U are present, D is new and not excluded.\n\n  Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G. D is not in that list, so it\'s okay.\n\n  So ""ENDUE"" is a candidate.\n\n  But we have U in position 4, which is what we want.\n\n  Also, in this word, position 1 is E. We don\'t know if E is in position 1? But we only know that E is in position 5. It could be in other positions? Yes, it\'s possible.\n\n  So ""ENDUE"" seems valid.\n\n  But let\'s confirm the feedback we would get.\n\n  We know:\n  - Position 2: N is correct, so we should get a check for N.\n  - Position 5: E is correct, check.\n  - Position 4: U, we are guessing U in position 4, and if the word has U in position 4, then check. But we don\'t know if U is in position 4? We only know U is present, but not where. In this guess, we are testing U in position 4.\n\n  Also, position 1: E, if the word has E in position 1, then check; otherwise, if E is only at the end, then position 1 E would be marked as absent? But we know E is at the end, but it might be elsewhere. If the word has only one E (at position 5), then the E at position 1 would be marked as absent (x) because it\'s not in the word elsewhere? But wait, if the word has only one E, and it\'s at position 5, then an E at position 1 would be marked as not in the word (x). But if the word has two E\'s, then it might be marked as present but wrong position (-) if not in position 1.\n\n  But in our case, we are trying to solve, so we can use this to get information.\n\n  However, we have limited guesses, so we need to be careful.\n\n  Another candidate: ""UNTIE"" but I and T? I is absent.\n\n  Or ""UNMET"" ends with T.\n\n  So ""ENDUE"" seems a good candidate.\n\n  But we also have the possibility that U is in position 1 or 3, but we couldn\'t find words for those. So maybe U is in position 4.\n\n  Therefore, I think ""ENDUE"" is a valid guess.\n\n  But note: in ""ENDUE"", we have E in position 1 and 5. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. But it\'s possible.\n\n  Alternatively, is there a word without duplicate E? For example, with U in position 4 and no E at position 1.\n\n  For pattern [ ?, N, ?, U, E ]:\n\n  - ""BNUKE"" not a word.\n  - ""CNUZE"" not a word.\n  - ""DNUTS"" not E ending.\n  - ""FNUKE"" not a word.\n  - ""KNUPE"" not a word? K N U P E -> K(1)N(2)U(3)? No, we need U in position 4: so [K, N, ?, U, E] -> K N ? U E.\n\n  ""KNULE"" not a word.\n\n  ""MNEME"" not U in position 4.\n\n  I think ""ENDUE"" is the only common word.\n\n  Another one: ""INDUE"" but I is absent. I(1)N(2)D(3)U(4)E(5) -> I absent.\n\n  So ""ENDUE"" is the best bet.\n\n  But we have to consider that we might have U in position 1.\n\n  For U in position 1: [U, N, ?, ?, E]\n\n  We need a word: U N ? ? E\n\n  Examples:\n  - ""UNDEE"": U N D E E -> positions: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? But in this word, position 4 is E, so the word is U N D E E. But we know position 5 is E, so position 4 is E? That\'s possible. But then we have two E\'s: position 4 and 5.\n\n  ""UNDEE"" is a word? It means a wave, I think? Or not common.\n\n  ""UNDEN"" not E ending.\n\n  ""UNLED"" ends with D.\n\n  ""UNMET"" ends with T.\n\n  ""UNPEG"" ends with G.\n\n  ""UNSET"" S absent.\n\n  ""UNWED"" ends with D.\n\n  ""UNZIP"" ends with P.\n\n  ""UNDYE"" U N D Y E -> Y in position 4? U(1)N(2)D(3)Y(4)E(5). So Y is in position 4. And Y is not excluded.\n\n  ""UNDYE"" is a word? To remove dye? Not common, but valid.\n\n  So we have two candidates: ""ENDUE"" and ""UNDYE"".\n\n  But ""UNDYE"" has U in position 1, which is a possibility.\n\n  We also have ""ENDUE"" with U in position 4.\n\n  How to choose?\n\n  We can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\n  But we have to make a guess.\n\n  Let\'s see what information we can get.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume U\'s position but tests multiple possibilities.\n\n  But it\'s hard because we have to avoid many letters.\n\n  We know U is present, so we can try to put U in a position we haven\'t tested: position 1 or 4 (since position 2 and 3 are tested and not U).\n\n  We haven\'t tested position 1 or 4 for U.\n\n  In ""ENDUE"", we test U in position 4 and E in position 1.\n\n  In ""UNDYE"", we test U in position 1 and Y in position 4.\n\n  We also have to consider that the word might have only one U.\n\n  Since we have limited guesses, and we are on the fourth guess (we have three guesses left), we can try one.\n\n  I think ""ENDUE"" is more common.\n\n  But let\'s see the feedback from guess3: U was in position 2 and got a dash, so U is not in position 2, but it is in the word. That doesn\'t give us information about other positions.\n\n  Perhaps we can try to guess a word that has U in position 1 and also tests other letters.\n\n  But I think we should go with ""ENDUE"".\n\n  Or, to avoid the duplicate E, we can try ""UNDYE"".\n\n  But ""UNDYE"" uses Y, which is less common.\n\n  Another idea: is there a word with U in position 4 and without E in position 1? For example, [X, N, Y, U, E] where X is not E.\n\n  We had ""INDUE"" but I absent.\n\n  ""KNDUE"" not a word.\n\n  ""MNDUE"" not a word.\n\n  ""PNDUE"" not a word.\n\n  ""TNDUE"" not a word.\n\n  ""WNDUE"" not a word.\n\n  So no common words.\n\n  Therefore, the only common word we have is ""ENDUE"".\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""ENDUE"".\n\n  But let\'s double-check the feedback we might get.\n\n  If the word is ""ENDUE"", then we get:\n  - E in position 1: if the word has E in position 1, then ✓; but if not, then x or -.\n  But we know the word has E in position 5, and it might have another E.\n\n  If the word is not ""ENDUE"", but has U in position 4, then we might get feedback that helps.\n\n  For example, if we guess ""ENDUE"" and the word is something else with U in position 4, then:\n  - Position 1: E might be absent or present elsewhere.\n  - Position 2: N is correct, so ✓.\n  - Position 3: D might be correct or not.\n  - Position 4: U might be correct or not (if U is in position 4, then ✓).\n  - Position 5: E ✓.\n\n  But we are hoping to solve it.\n\n  Given that we have to guess, I think ""ENDUE"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n  So next guess: ""ENDUE""\n\nBut wait, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can also consider that we might have missed something.\n\nAnother possibility: what if the word has U in position 1? And we haven\'t guessed it.\n\nFor example, ""UNDER"" but R absent.\n\n""UNMET"" ends with T.\n\n""UNGET"" G absent.\n\n""UNLET"" L absent.\n\n""UNPEN"" ends with N.\n\n""UNSEW"" S absent.\n\n""UNWET"" ends with T.\n\n""UNKED"" U N K E D -> ends with D.\n\n""UNKID"" not a word.\n\n""UNBED"" U N B E D -> ends with D.\n\n""UNFED"" U N F E D -> ends with D.\n\n""UNJAM"" not E ending.\n\nSo no common words ending with E for U in position 1 except ""UNDYE"" or ""UNDEE"".\n\n""UNDEE"" has two E\'s: U N D E E.\n\nBut position 4 is E, and we need to have a letter in position 4 that is not E? No, in ""UNDEE"", position 4 is E and position 5 is E, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut then the word would have two E\'s.\n\nIn our feedback, we only have one E confirmed (position 5), so there could be another.\n\nBut in ""UNDEE"", we have U in position 1, N in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, E in position 5.\n\nSo if we guess ""UNDEE"", then:\n- U in position 1: if U is in position 1, then ✓ or -? But we know U is present, so if not in position 1, then -.\n- N in position 2: ✓ (since we know N is in position 2).\n- D in position 3: ? \n- E in position 4: if the word has E in position 4, then ✓, but if not, then - (since E is in the word at position 5).\n- E in position 5: ✓.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has E in position 4.\n\nHowever, we are not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I think ""ENDUE"" is a better choice because it\'s more common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n**Feedback Summary:**\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - E is in position 5.  \n    - N is present but not in position 4.  \n    - C, R, A are absent.  \n- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - N is present but not in position 1.  \n    - O, I, S are absent.  \n    - E in position 5 is confirmed.  \n- **Guess 3 (LUNGE)**: L(x), U(-), N(-), G(x), E(✓)  \n  → **Insights**:  \n    - U is present but not in position 2.  \n    - N is present but not in position 3.  \n    - L, G are absent.  \n    - E in position 5 is reconfirmed.  \n\n**Key Conclusions:**  \n1. **Fixed Positions**:  \n   - Position 5 is **E**.  \n   - **N must be in position 2** (the only remaining position, as it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).  \n   → Word pattern: `[?] N [?] [?] E`  \n2. **Present Letters**:  \n   - **U** is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  \n3. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G are **not in the word** (must avoid these).  \n4. **Remaining Letters**:  \n   - Available consonants: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y  \n   - Available vowels: U (already confirmed), and Y (sometimes vowel).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- **Goal**:  \n  - Confirm the position of U (position 1, 3, or 4).  \n  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, T, M, H) to cover remaining unknowns.  \n- **Word Selection**:  \n  - **Pattern**: `[?] N [?] [?] E` (N in position 2, E in position 5).  \n  - U must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.  \n  - After evaluating options (e.g., ""UNDUE"", ""ENDUE"", ""UNDYE""), **""ENDUE""** is optimal:  \n    - Ends with E, places N in position 2 (✓ confirmed).  \n    - Tests U in position 4 (critical for narrowing U\'s location).  \n    - Introduces D (position 3) and E (position 1) — E may be duplicated.  \n    - Avoids all excluded letters.  \n- **Why ""ENDUE""?**  \n  - If U is in position 4, feedback will confirm with ✓.  \n  - If U is not in position 4, feedback will show - (misplaced) or x (absent), ruling out position 4.  \n  - Tests E in position 1 (if E is duplicated, feedback may show - or ✓).  \n  - Tests D in position 3 (new letter).\n\n<guess>ENDUE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: LUNGE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: ENDUE -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(✓) D(✓) U(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: LUNGE -> L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: ENDUE -> E(-) N(✓) D(✓) U(✓) E(✓)

Let's decode:

From Guess 4 (ENDUE):
- E in position 1: dash (-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 1 (also, since E is at position 5, it must be that E appears multiple times? But note: the dash means it's present but not here, so we conclude E is present and not in position 1, so likely only at position 5? Or elsewhere? But we know position 5 is E, so if E is only at position 5 then a guess of E elsewhere should get a dash if it's present elsewhere? No.)

Wait: feedback for ENDUE: 
- First E (position 1): dash (-) -> meaning the letter E is in the word but not in position 1.
- N (position 2): check (✓) -> correct.
- D (position 3): check (✓) -> correct.
- U (position 4): check (✓) -> correct.
- E (position 5): check (✓) -> correct.

Therefore, the word must have the following:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: E
- And since E is present but not in position 1, that means the word has at least one E that is not at position 1 (which we know is at position 5).

But now we know: [ ?, N, D, U, E ]

So the word is of the form: X, N, D, U, E

Now, we don't know the first letter. The feedback for the first E in ENDUE was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in position 1. Given that positions 3,4,5 are D,U,E, there are no E's in those positions except the last one? Position 5 is E, and position 1 was guessed as E but was dash, indicating that E is present elsewhere (like position 5) but not in position 1.

Actually, since position 5 is E and the word ends with E, the dash for position 1 E implies that the E in the word is only at position 5? But the dash means that E is present, but not in that position, so there must be at least one E present somewhere else, which is position 5.

Moreover, in the word, we have positions 2,3,4,5 fixed: N, D, U, E. So the only unknown is position 1.

Now, the question is: what can the first letter be?

We also know from previous feedback what letters are absent.

Absent letters: from all feedbacks:
- Guess1: C, R, A (absent)
- Guess2: O, I, S (absent)
- Guess3: L, G (absent)
- Also, in Guess4: we see that position 1 got a dash for E, which doesn't reveal absence of the letter, but since E is present, it's not absent.

Now, what about letters that haven't been tested? The word has N,D,U,E in positions 2,3,4,5 and an unknown first letter.

The first letter must be a letter that is:
- Not absent (so not C,R,A,O,I,S,L,G)
- And it must form a valid English word: X N D U E

Now, we note that the word ""ENDUE"" ends in ""UE"", but we guessed it and now we know the fixed pattern: * and then N D U E.

Looking for words that match ? N D U E:

Common 5-letter words: 
- Only ""ENDUE"" comes to mind, but our guess was ENDUE and the feedback showed that position 1 E is wrong, so the word cannot be ENDUE because that would have E in position 1 matching, but it got a dash meaning it shouldn't be E.

Therefore, the word is not ENDUE. What else?

Perhaps ""UNDUE""? But UNDUE is U N D U E.

Structure: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5).

But in this case, the first letter is U.

But U is already used as the fourth letter. Also, check feedback for UNDUE if we guessed it? But we didn't, so let's see.

But let's see how the feedback would be for UNDUE if the word is UNDUE: well, U at position 1? So if the word has U at position 1, it would be a check? But let's analyze.

First, U is present in the word? Yes, but if the word is UNDUE, then:
- Position 1: U should be ✓ if U is in position 1.
- Position 2: N ✓
- Position 3: D ✓
- Position 4: U: this is a duplicate. If the word has two U's, then it would be correct? Or if only one? UNDUE has two U's: positions 1 and 4.

But in our case, from feedback of Guess3: U was present but not in position 2, so it could be in position 1 or 4? Or others, but we have fixed positions.

Suppose the word is UNDUE: [U, N, D, U, E]

Now, compare to previous feedback:

- Guess4 ENDUE: position 1 E dash -> correctly, because U is at position 1, not E. So E is at position 5, but position 1 is U. However, the feedback for position 1 in ENDUE was dash because E is not at position 1.

But UNDUE would be valid? And the feedback we got was for ENDUE, so we didn't guess UNDUE yet.

But we know that position 4 is U? In Guess4 ENDUE, position 4 U was check, meaning U is at position 4. So in the word, position 4 is U.

Therefore, if we have UNDUE, then position 1 is U and position 4 is U. That's fine.

But what about the missing first letter? It must be U? So the word is UNDUE.

Is UNDUE a word? Yes.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Other candidates for ? N D U E:
- I can't think of any common words except UNDUE.

Therefore, the word is likely UNDUE.

We can confirm with previous feedback.

In Guess3: LUNGE. If the word is UNDUE, then:
- L: absent -> x (matches)
- U: in position 2? But the word UNDUE has U at position 1 and 4. U at position 2? No, so U was guessed in position 2 and got a dash, meaning U is present but not in position 2 -> correct because U is at 1 and 4.
- N: guessed in position 3? But the word has N at position 2. So N not in position 3 -> dash, which is correct.
- G: absent -> x (matches)
- E: ✓ at position 5 -> matches.

Similarly, all other feedback matches.

So the word is UNDUE.

We are to make the next guess, which is guess 5. Since we have deduced the word, we can guess it.

But note: we have two more tries? Total 6, we are on guess 5.

But we should guess UNDUE.

But let me be thorough.

Is there another word? For example, ""ANDUE"" is not a word. ""BNDUE"" not a word. ""CNDUE"" no. ""DNDUE"" not a word. etc.

So UNDUE is the only possibility.

Therefore, next guess: UNDUE.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
**Feedback Summary:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)  
  → E in position 5, N present (not position 4), C/R/A absent.
- **Guess 2 (NOISE)**: N(-), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → N present (not position 1), O/I/S absent, E in position 5 confirmed.
- **Guess 3 (LUNGE)**: L(x), U(-), N(-), G(x), E(✓)  
  → U present (not position 2), N present (not position 3), L/G absent.
- **Guess 4 (ENDUE)**: E(-), N(✓), D(✓), U(✓), E(✓)  
  → N in position 2, D in position 3, U in position 4, E in position 5, E present (but not position 1).

**Key Deductions:**  
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **N** (from ENDUE ✓).  
   - Position 3: **D** (from ENDUE ✓).  
   - Position 4: **U** (from ENDUE ✓).  
   - Position 5: **E** (all guesses ✓).  
2. **Position 1**:  
   - Unknown but must avoid absent letters (C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G).  
   - ENDUE feedback shows E(-) → E is present but **not in position 1** (already at position 5).  
3. **Word Pattern**:  
   - `[?] N D U E`  
4. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G cannot be in the word.  
5. **Remaining Possibilities**:  
   - Position 1 must be a letter not excluded and form a valid English word.  
   - **Only viable word**: `U N D U E` (**UNDUE**), as:  
     - U is confirmed present (from LUNGE feedback).  
     - Matches pattern and avoids all absent letters.  
     - No other common words fit `? N D U E` (e.g., ""ENDUE"" is invalid due to E(-) in position 1).

### Next Guess: UNDUE
This guess uses U in position 1 to complete the word, aligning with all feedback.

<guess>UNDUE</guess>",UNDUE,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOISE -> N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: LUNGE -> L(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: ENDUE -> E(-) N(✓) D(✓) U(✓) E(✓)

Let's decode:

From Guess 4 (ENDUE):
- E in position 1: dash (-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 1 (also, since E is at position 5, it must be that E appears multiple times? But note: the dash means it's present but not here, so we conclude E is present and not in position 1, so likely only at position 5? Or elsewhere? But we know position 5 is E, so if E is only at position 5 then a guess of E elsewhere should get a dash if it's present elsewhere? No.)

Wait: feedback for ENDUE: 
- First E (position 1): dash (-) -> meaning the letter E is in the word but not in position 1.
- N (position 2): check (✓) -> correct.
- D (position 3): check (✓) -> correct.
- U (position 4): check (✓) -> correct.
- E (position 5): check (✓) -> correct.

Therefore, the word must have the following:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: E
- And since E is present but not in position 1, that means the word has at least one E that is not at position 1 (which we know is at position 5).

But now we know: [ ?, N, D, U, E ]

So the word is of the form: X, N, D, U, E

Now, we don't know the first letter. The feedback for the first E in ENDUE was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in position 1. Given that positions 3,4,5 are D,U,E, there are no E's in those positions except the last one? Position 5 is E, and position 1 was guessed as E but was dash, indicating that E is present elsewhere (like position 5) but not in position 1.

Actually, since position 5 is E and the word ends with E, the dash for position 1 E implies that the E in the word is only at position 5? But the dash means that E is present, but not in that position, so there must be at least one E present somewhere else, which is position 5.

Moreover, in the word, we have positions 2,3,4,5 fixed: N, D, U, E. So the only unknown is position 1.

Now, the question is: what can the first letter be?

We also know from previous feedback what letters are absent.

Absent letters: from all feedbacks:
- Guess1: C, R, A (absent)
- Guess2: O, I, S (absent)
- Guess3: L, G (absent)
- Also, in Guess4: we see that position 1 got a dash for E, which doesn't reveal absence of the letter, but since E is present, it's not absent.

Now, what about letters that haven't been tested? The word has N,D,U,E in positions 2,3,4,5 and an unknown first letter.

The first letter must be a letter that is:
- Not absent (so not C,R,A,O,I,S,L,G)
- And it must form a valid English word: X N D U E

Now, we note that the word ""ENDUE"" ends in ""UE"", but we guessed it and now we know the fixed pattern: * and then N D U E.

Looking for words that match ? N D U E:

Common 5-letter words: 
- Only ""ENDUE"" comes to mind, but our guess was ENDUE and the feedback showed that position 1 E is wrong, so the word cannot be ENDUE because that would have E in position 1 matching, but it got a dash meaning it shouldn't be E.

Therefore, the word is not ENDUE. What else?

Perhaps ""UNDUE""? But UNDUE is U N D U E.

Structure: U(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5).

But in this case, the first letter is U.

But U is already used as the fourth letter. Also, check feedback for UNDUE if we guessed it? But we didn't, so let's see.

But let's see how the feedback would be for UNDUE if the word is UNDUE: well, U at position 1? So if the word has U at position 1, it would be a check? But let's analyze.

First, U is present in the word? Yes, but if the word is UNDUE, then:
- Position 1: U should be ✓ if U is in position 1.
- Position 2: N ✓
- Position 3: D ✓
- Position 4: U: this is a duplicate. If the word has two U's, then it would be correct? Or if only one? UNDUE has two U's: positions 1 and 4.

But in our case, from feedback of Guess3: U was present but not in position 2, so it could be in position 1 or 4? Or others, but we have fixed positions.

Suppose the word is UNDUE: [U, N, D, U, E]

Now, compare to previous feedback:

- Guess4 ENDUE: position 1 E dash -> correctly, because U is at position 1, not E. So E is at position 5, but position 1 is U. However, the feedback for position 1 in ENDUE was dash because E is not at position 1.

But UNDUE would be valid? And the feedback we got was for ENDUE, so we didn't guess UNDUE yet.

But we know that position 4 is U? In Guess4 ENDUE, position 4 U was check, meaning U is at position 4. So in the word, position 4 is U.

Therefore, if we have UNDUE, then position 1 is U and position 4 is U. That's fine.

But what about the missing first letter? It must be U? So the word is UNDUE.

Is UNDUE a word? Yes.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Other candidates for ? N D U E:
- I can't think of any common words except UNDUE.

Therefore, the word is likely UNDUE.

We can confirm with previous feedback.

In Guess3: LUNGE. If the word is UNDUE, then:
- L: absent -> x (matches)
- U: in position 2? But the word UNDUE has U at position 1 and 4. U at position 2? No, so U was guessed in position 2 and got a dash, meaning U is present but not in position 2 -> correct because U is at 1 and 4.
- N: guessed in position 3? But the word has N at position 2. So N not in position 3 -> dash, which is correct.
- G: absent -> x (matches)
- E: ✓ at position 5 -> matches.

Similarly, all other feedback matches.

So the word is UNDUE.

We are to make the next guess, which is guess 5. Since we have deduced the word, we can guess it.

But note: we have two more tries? Total 6, we are on guess 5.

But we should guess UNDUE.

But let me be thorough.

Is there another word? For example, ""ANDUE"" is not a word. ""BNDUE"" not a word. ""CNDUE"" no. ""DNDUE"" not a word. etc.

So UNDUE is the only possibility.

Therefore, next guess: UNDUE.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
