We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good first word.
 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has unique letters and includes letters like A, E, I, O, R, S, T.

 After considering, a good starting word is ""CRATE"". It covers common vowels and consonants.

 However, note that we are allowed any 5-letter word. Another popular choice is ""ROAST"", but I think ""CRATE"" is solid.

 Let me check: C, R, A, T, E are all very common.

 But note: the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ : correct letter and position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 Our first guess: ""CRATE""

 Format: 
   We respond with: <guess> CRATE </guess>
</think>
For the first guess, I want to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. ""CRATE"" is an effective opener because: 

- It contains three common vowels (A, E) and important consonants (C, R, T)
- All letters are unique, increasing coverage
- Frequent letters like R, T, and E help test key positions  

This will provide clear feedback on frequently used letters and position-based patterns for the secret word.

We are given the first guess: ""CRATE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
This means:
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (since marked x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (since marked with -)

Given this information:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we guessed E at the end and it was wrong).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or T.

For our next guess, we need:
- A 5-letter word that includes E (but not in the fifth position).
- It should not contain C, R, A, or T.
- We want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Possible letters to include: Since E is present, we can try to put E in different positions to locate it.

We also have many letters eliminated: C, R, A, T are out. So we avoid those.

Common letters not used yet: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Given E is not in the last position, let's try to put E in the first or middle positions to test.

Also, since only E was found and four letters are eliminated, the word likely has less common letters or a different set.

A good strategy is to use a word with E in a different position and include new common letters.

For example, position of E: Our first guess had E at the 5th position, so it must be in positions 1-4.

We can try putting E at the beginning? But let's consider other possibilities.

Possible words: How about ""SPINE""? But that has T? Wait, no T allowed? Wait, no we cannot have T because T is eliminated. Feedback T(x) means no T.

So words without: C, R, A, T.

""SPINE"" has P, I, N, E, S? But what about the structure.

Better to think of words with E not at the end.

Examples:
- E in position 1: ELBOW, ECLIP? But ECLIP has C? C is eliminated. So not.

Let's generate words with E somewhere in positions 1-4 and without C,R,A,T.

Common possibilities:
- Words starting with S? Like SPEND, SPEED? But E at position 3 and 4? SPEED: S P E E D -> has two E's? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? Well, Wordle allows duplicates unless specified. But in this case, only one E known.

Actually, in the feedback: we have one E marked as present, but if the word has two E's, then we might see two E's getting feedback. But here only one - for E, so maybe the word has only one E? But note: the feedback only marks the E in the last position as -, but if we had another E in another position, it might be marked differently? But in our guess ""CRATE"" we have only one E.

So the secret word has at least one E.

Our next word should ideally have letters not guessed before, except for E.

We have to use E again.

We cannot use: C, R, A, T.

So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Focus on frequent ones: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, H, K, W.

Idea: Try a word with E in position 1? But finding words without A and T etc. is harder.

Position 1: E? Like ELDER? But L,D,E,R? R not allowed? R is eliminated.

We cannot use R.

So any word we choose must not contain R.

Position 2: E? Like DEUCE? But has C and E? C eliminated.

Another idea: Since E is not at position 5, try E at position 4 or position 1, etc.

Also, we need to cover new letters.

After elimination, common letters to try: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, P, M, B, H, Y, etc.

Let me list possible words: 
- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.

EERIE has R? Not allowed.

ELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn't E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.

But ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E's? That's fine.

But in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.

But let's not complicate. We can use words with multiple E's but it might confuse.

Focus on one E.

Better words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.

Another: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D's? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.

D position 1 and 5? E at 4.

But D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we'll get feedback accordingly.

But let's aim for unique letters? Unless it's necessary.

Ideal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.

Position possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.

We guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.

Try E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn't E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.

For new guess, let's avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

Similarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.

Words starting with E: E with letters from available.

E + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.

EDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.

Focus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.

Word with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn't be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn't help with finding the position of E.

We should put E in a position we haven't tested? We only know position 5 is not E.

So test position 1 to 4: let's choose to put E in position 1.

But let's say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.

But E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.

Since in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E's, but let's not assume.

But ELBOW has E only once.

Now, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.

Sounds good. But let's see.

Another possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.

Example: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn't E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it's not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.

Similarly, don't put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.

Prioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.

Common positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.

We can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.

Example word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.

So cannot have words with R.

Available letters only: without C,R,A,T.

So PRIDE not allowed because R.

Better words focusing on E at 4: 
""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.

""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.

C is eliminated so C should not be in.

""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.

""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.

""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.

Only when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.

""DODGE"": E at 5? 

Plenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.

Words with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.

""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.

Position 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.

Usually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.

""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.

Not working.

Consider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.

But S at5? Then E is at position4.

Perfect: it has E at position 4? We haven't tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.

Another word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.

Also, E at position 4.

But both HOMES and BIKES are possible.

We also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.

Available letters: best to use letters with high frequency.

S, O, N, I, H are common.

HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.

BIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.

Perhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.

Either way.

Since E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.

But we have a choice.

Another classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.

Not.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.

But I think HOMES is a common word.

HOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.

Similarly, the letter S is at position5.

Since in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.

And S has not been tested.

So let's go with HOMES.

But wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it's in another position? Then we know E is not at4.

Similarly for other letters.

This will give good information.

Other word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.

""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.

Perhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.

Not great.

""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.

Since WE decided HOMES might be solid.

Alternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.

But L,I,N,D are new.

Then HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.

I think ""HOMES"" is fine.

So our guess could be ""HOMES"".

But let's confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.

And feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.

Thus, next guess: HOMES.

Response: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>

In the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.

So.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.
- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.
- Consider positions for E that haven't been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

I selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:
- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).
- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.
- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).
- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).

This guess will provide feedback on E's position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.

<guess>HOMES</guess>",HOMES,"We are given the first guess: ""CRATE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.

EERIE has R? Not allowed.

ELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn't E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.

But ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E's? That's fine.

But in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.

But let's not complicate. We can use words with multiple E's but it might confuse.

Focus on one E.

Better words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.

Another: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D's? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.

D position 1 and 5? E at 4.

But D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we'll get feedback accordingly.

But let's aim for unique letters? Unless it's necessary.

Ideal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.

Position possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.

We guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.

Try E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn't E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.

For new guess, let's avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

Similarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.

Words starting with E: E with letters from available.

E + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.

EDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.

Focus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.

Word with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn't be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn't help with finding the position of E.

We should put E in a position we haven't tested? We only know position 5 is not E.

So test position 1 to 4: let's choose to put E in position 1.

But let's say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.

But E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.

Since in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E's, but let's not assume.

But ELBOW has E only once.

Now, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.

Sounds good. But let's see.

Another possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.

Example: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn't E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it's not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.

Similarly, don't put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.

Prioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.

Common positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.

We can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.

Example word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.

So cannot have words with R.

Available letters only: without C,R,A,T.

So PRIDE not allowed because R.

Better words focusing on E at 4: 
""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.

""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.

C is eliminated so C should not be in.

""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.

""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.

""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.

Only when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.

""DODGE"": E at 5? 

Plenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.

Words with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.

""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.

Position 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.

Usually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.

""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.

Not working.

Consider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.

But S at5? Then E is at position4.

Perfect: it has E at position 4? We haven't tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.

Another word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.

Also, E at position 4.

But both HOMES and BIKES are possible.

We also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.

Available letters: best to use letters with high frequency.

S, O, N, I, H are common.

HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.

BIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.

Perhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.

Either way.

Since E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.

But we have a choice.

Another classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.

Not.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.

But I think HOMES is a common word.

HOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.

Similarly, the letter S is at position5.

Since in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.

And S has not been tested.

So let's go with HOMES.

But wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it's in another position? Then we know E is not at4.

Similarly for other letters.

This will give good information.

Other word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.

""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.

Perhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.

Not great.

""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.

Since WE decided HOMES might be solid.

Alternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.

But L,I,N,D are new.

Then HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.

I think ""HOMES"" is fine.

So our guess could be ""HOMES"".

But let's confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.

And feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.

Thus, next guess: HOMES.

Response: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>

In the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.

So.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.
- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.
- Consider positions for E that haven't been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

I selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:
- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).
- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.
- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).
- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).

This guess will provide feedback on E's position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.",Guess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,WEEDY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good first word.
 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has unique letters and includes letters like A, E, I, O, R, S, T.

 After considering, a good starting word is ""CRATE"". It covers common vowels and consonants.

 However, note that we are allowed any 5-letter word. Another popular choice is ""ROAST"", but I think ""CRATE"" is solid.

 Let me check: C, R, A, T, E are all very common.

 But note: the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ : correct letter and position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 Our first guess: ""CRATE""

 Format: 
   We respond with: <guess> CRATE </guess>For the first guess, I want to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. ""CRATE"" is an effective opener because: 

- It contains three common vowels (A, E) and important consonants (C, R, T)
- All letters are unique, increasing coverage
- Frequent letters like R, T, and E help test key positions  

This will provide clear feedback on frequently used letters and position-based patterns for the secret word.

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""CRATE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
This means:
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (since marked x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (since marked with -)

Given this information:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we guessed E at the end and it was wrong).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or T.

For our next guess, we need:
- A 5-letter word that includes E (but not in the fifth position).
- It should not contain C, R, A, or T.
- We want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Possible letters to include: Since E is present, we can try to put E in different positions to locate it.

We also have many letters eliminated: C, R, A, T are out. So we avoid those.

Common letters not used yet: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Given E is not in the last position, let's try to put E in the first or middle positions to test.

Also, since only E was found and four letters are eliminated, the word likely has less common letters or a different set.

A good strategy is to use a word with E in a different position and include new common letters.

For example, position of E: Our first guess had E at the 5th position, so it must be in positions 1-4.

We can try putting E at the beginning? But let's consider other possibilities.

Possible words: How about ""SPINE""? But that has T? Wait, no T allowed? Wait, no we cannot have T because T is eliminated. Feedback T(x) means no T.

So words without: C, R, A, T.

""SPINE"" has P, I, N, E, S? But what about the structure.

Better to think of words with E not at the end.

Examples:
- E in position 1: ELBOW, ECLIP? But ECLIP has C? C is eliminated. So not.

Let's generate words with E somewhere in positions 1-4 and without C,R,A,T.

Common possibilities:
- Words starting with S? Like SPEND, SPEED? But E at position 3 and 4? SPEED: S P E E D -> has two E's? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? Well, Wordle allows duplicates unless specified. But in this case, only one E known.

Actually, in the feedback: we have one E marked as present, but if the word has two E's, then we might see two E's getting feedback. But here only one - for E, so maybe the word has only one E? But note: the feedback only marks the E in the last position as -, but if we had another E in another position, it might be marked differently? But in our guess ""CRATE"" we have only one E.

So the secret word has at least one E.

Our next word should ideally have letters not guessed before, except for E.

We have to use E again.

We cannot use: C, R, A, T.

So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Focus on frequent ones: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, H, K, W.

Idea: Try a word with E in position 1? But finding words without A and T etc. is harder.

Position 1: E? Like ELDER? But L,D,E,R? R not allowed? R is eliminated.

We cannot use R.

So any word we choose must not contain R.

Position 2: E? Like DEUCE? But has C and E? C eliminated.

Another idea: Since E is not at position 5, try E at position 4 or position 1, etc.

Also, we need to cover new letters.

After elimination, common letters to try: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, P, M, B, H, Y, etc.

Let me list possible words: 
- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.

EERIE has R? Not allowed.

ELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn't E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.

But ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E's? That's fine.

But in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.

But let's not complicate. We can use words with multiple E's but it might confuse.

Focus on one E.

Better words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.

Another: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D's? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.

D position 1 and 5? E at 4.

But D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we'll get feedback accordingly.

But let's aim for unique letters? Unless it's necessary.

Ideal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.

Position possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.

We guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.

Try E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn't E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.

For new guess, let's avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

Similarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.

Words starting with E: E with letters from available.

E + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.

EDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.

Focus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.

Word with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn't be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn't help with finding the position of E.

We should put E in a position we haven't tested? We only know position 5 is not E.

So test position 1 to 4: let's choose to put E in position 1.

But let's say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.

But E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.

Since in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E's, but let's not assume.

But ELBOW has E only once.

Now, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.

Sounds good. But let's see.

Another possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.

Example: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn't E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it's not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.

Similarly, don't put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.

Prioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.

Common positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.

We can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.

Example word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.

So cannot have words with R.

Available letters only: without C,R,A,T.

So PRIDE not allowed because R.

Better words focusing on E at 4: 
""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.

""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.

C is eliminated so C should not be in.

""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.

""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.

""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.

Only when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.

""DODGE"": E at 5? 

Plenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.

Words with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.

""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.

Position 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.

Usually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.

""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.

Not working.

Consider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.

But S at5? Then E is at position4.

Perfect: it has E at position 4? We haven't tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.

Another word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.

Also, E at position 4.

But both HOMES and BIKES are possible.

We also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.

Available letters: best to use letters with high frequency.

S, O, N, I, H are common.

HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.

BIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.

Perhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.

Either way.

Since E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.

But we have a choice.

Another classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.

Not.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.

But I think HOMES is a common word.

HOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.

Similarly, the letter S is at position5.

Since in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.

And S has not been tested.

So let's go with HOMES.

But wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it's in another position? Then we know E is not at4.

Similarly for other letters.

This will give good information.

Other word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.

""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.

Perhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.

Not great.

""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.

Since WE decided HOMES might be solid.

Alternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.

But L,I,N,D are new.

Then HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.

I think ""HOMES"" is fine.

So our guess could be ""HOMES"".

But let's confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.

And feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.

Thus, next guess: HOMES.

Response: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>

In the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.

So.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.
- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.
- Consider positions for E that haven't been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

I selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:
- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).
- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.
- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).
- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).

This guess will provide feedback on E's position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.

So we avoid those.\n\nCommon letters not used yet: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.\n\nGiven E is not in the last position, let\'s try to put E in the first or middle positions to test.\n\nAlso, since only E was found and four letters are eliminated, the word likely has less common letters or a different set.\n\nA good strategy is to use a word with E in a different position and include new common letters.\n\nFor example, position of E: Our first guess had E at the 5th position, so it must be in positions 1-4.\n\nWe can try putting E at the beginning? But let\'s consider other possibilities.\n\nPossible words: How about ""SPINE""? But that has T? Wait, no T allowed? Wait, no we cannot have T because T is eliminated. Feedback T(x) means no T.\n\nSo words without: C, R, A, T.\n\n""SPINE"" has P, I, N, E, S? But what about the structure.\n\nBetter to think of words with E not at the end.\n\nExamples:\n- E in position 1: ELBOW, ECLIP? But ECLIP has C? C is eliminated. So not.\n\nLet\'s generate words with E somewhere in positions 1-4 and without C,R,A,T.\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- Words starting with S? Like SPEND, SPEED? But E at position 3 and 4? SPEED: S P E E D -> has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? Well, Wordle allows duplicates unless specified. But in this case, only one E known.\n\nActually, in the feedback: we have one E marked as present, but if the word has two E\'s, then we might see two E\'s getting feedback. But here only one - for E, so maybe the word has only one E? But note: the feedback only marks the E in the last position as -, but if we had another E in another position, it might be marked differently? But in our guess ""CRATE"" we have only one E.\n\nSo the secret word has at least one E.\n\nOur next word should ideally have letters not guessed before, except for E.\n\nWe have to use E again.\n\nWe cannot use: C, R, A, T.\n\nSo available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFocus on frequent ones: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, H, K, W.\n\nIdea: Try a word with E in position 1? But finding words without A and T etc. is harder.\n\nPosition 1: E? Like ELDER? But L,D,E,R? R not allowed? R is eliminated.\n\nWe cannot use R.\n\nSo any word we choose must not contain R.\n\nPosition 2: E? Like DEUCE? But has C and E? C eliminated.\n\nAnother idea: Since E is not at position 5, try E at position 4 or position 1, etc.\n\nAlso, we need to cover new letters.\n\nAfter elimination, common letters to try: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, P, M, B, H, Y, etc.\n\nLet me list possible words: \n- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.\n\nEERIE has R? Not allowed.\n\nELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn\'t E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.\n\nBut ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E\'s? That\'s fine.\n\nBut in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.\n\nBut let\'s not complicate. We can use words with multiple E\'s but it might confuse.\n\nFocus on one E.\n\nBetter words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.\n\nAnother: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D\'s? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.\n\nD position 1 and 5? E at 4.\n\nBut D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we\'ll get feedback accordingly.\n\nBut let\'s aim for unique letters? Unless it\'s necessary.\n\nIdeal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.\n\nPosition possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.\n\nTry E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn\'t E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nFor new guess, let\'s avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.\n\nWords starting with E: E with letters from available.\n\nE + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.\n\nEDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.\n\nFocus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.\n\nWord with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn\'t be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn\'t help with finding the position of E.\n\nWe should put E in a position we haven\'t tested? We only know position 5 is not E.\n\nSo test position 1 to 4: let\'s choose to put E in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.\n\nSince in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E\'s, but let\'s not assume.\n\nBut ELBOW has E only once.\n\nNow, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.\n\nSounds good. But let\'s see.\n\nAnother possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.\n\nExample: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn\'t E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it\'s not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, don\'t put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.\n\nPrioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.\n\nCommon positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.\n\nWe can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.\n\nExample word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.\n\nSo cannot have words with R.\n\nAvailable letters only: without C,R,A,T.\n\nSo PRIDE not allowed because R.\n\nBetter words focusing on E at 4: \n""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.\n\n""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.\n\nC is eliminated so C should not be in.\n\n""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.\n\n""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.\n\n""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.\n\nOnly when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.\n\n""DODGE"": E at 5? \n\nPlenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.\n\nWords with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.\n\n""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.\n\nPosition 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.\n\n""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.\n\nUsually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nPosition 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.\n\n""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.\n\nNot working.\n\nConsider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.\n\nBut S at5? Then E is at position4.\n\nPerfect: it has E at position 4? We haven\'t tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.\n\nAnother word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.\n\nAlso, E at position 4.\n\nBut both HOMES and BIKES are possible.\n\nWe also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.\n\nAvailable letters: best to use letters with high frequency.\n\nS, O, N, I, H are common.\n\nHOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.\n\nBIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.\n\nPerhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.\n\nEither way.\n\nSince E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.\n\nBut we have a choice.\n\nAnother classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.\n\nBut I think HOMES is a common word.\n\nHOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.\n\nSimilarly, the letter S is at position5.\n\nSince in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.\n\nAnd S has not been tested.\n\nSo let\'s go with HOMES.\n\nBut wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it\'s in another position? Then we know E is not at4.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nThis will give good information.\n\nOther word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.\n\n""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.\n\n""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.\n\nPerhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.\n\nNot great.\n\n""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.\n\nSince WE decided HOMES might be solid.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.\n\nBut L,I,N,D are new.\n\nThen HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.\n\nI think ""HOMES"" is fine.\n\nSo our guess could be ""HOMES"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.\n\nAnd feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.\n\nThus, next guess: HOMES.\n\nResponse: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>\n\nIn the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.\n\nSo.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":\n- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.\n- Consider positions for E that haven\'t been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).\n\nI selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:\n- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).\n- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.\n- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).\n- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on E\'s position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.\n\n<guess>HOMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

So, the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. Also, C, R, A, T are absent.

Guess 2: HOMES
- H: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in HOMES)
- S: x (not in word)

Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, H, O, M, S are absent.

Now, we know the following:

Absent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S
Present letters: E (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since not 4 or 5)

We have used 9 unique letters that are absent (C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S) and one present (E). There are 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left to consider.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is present but we know it must be in positions 1,2,3)

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes E in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the available letters.

Also, since E is present and we know it's not at 4 or 5, we should try to place it in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. We haven't tested position 1, 2, or 3 for E yet.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters from the available list: B, D, F, G, I, L, N, P, U, Y (less common: J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z)

We can try to use a word with E at position 1, for example, to test that position.

Possible words with E at position 1 and using available letters:

- E at 1: e.g., ""E"", then next letters from available.

Examples:
- ""ELFIN"": E L F I N -> but L, F, I, N are available? Yes. But ""ELFIN"" is a word? Meaning: like an elf, or small and delicate. Valid.
- ""ENDOW"": E N D O W -> but O is eliminated? O is absent (from HOMES feedback: O(x)), so cannot use O. So not.
- ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L -> A is eliminated? A(x) from first guess, so not.
- ""EJECT"": E J E C T -> C and T eliminated? Yes, so not.

Better: ""ELVEN""? E L V E N -> V and N available? But V is less common, and we have two E's? We don't know if the secret has two E's, but it might. However, we are trying to get information.

But ""ELVEN"" might not be common.

""EDGED"": E D G E D -> two D's and two E's? Not ideal for information.

""EIDER"": E I D E R -> R eliminated? R(x) from first guess, so not.

""ENNUI"": E N N U I -> has two N's? But U and I available. Valid word? Yes, meaning boredom.

But we want to cover more common letters.

Another: ""PINEY""? But E at position 4? We want E at 1? ""PINEY"" is P,I,N,E,Y -> E at 4? But we are trying to test E at 1.

Let's focus on E at 1.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A eliminated? A(x) so not.

""EBONY"": E B O N Y -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""ELFIN"" seems okay: E L F I N.

But F and I? F is not extremely common, but possible.

""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""EDIFY"": E D I F Y -> D, I, F, Y available? Yes. ""EDIFY"" is a word, meaning to instruct or improve.

Similarly, ""ELUDE"": E L U D E -> E at 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is not E? So if we put E at 5, it might be x? But we are putting E at 1 and 5? The E at 5 might be marked x if the secret has only one E? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

So ""ELUDE"" has E at 5, which we know is wrong, so it might be a waste? But it could help if there is a duplicate E? Unlikely.

Better to use a word with E only once and in position 1,2, or 3.

So ""EDIFY"": E at 1, then D, I, F, Y.

But Y at the end? Position 5.

Similarly, ""ENVOY"": E N V O Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EPOXY"": E P O X Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EXIST"": E X I S T -> S and T eliminated? S(x) and T(x) so not.

""ELINT"": E L I N T -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""EDIFY"" or ""ELFIN"" are candidates.

What about E at position 2? We haven't tested that.

For example, words with E in position 2: like ""DEUCE""? But D E U C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""LEMON"": L E M O N -> M and O eliminated? M(x) and O(x) from HOMES, so not.

""BEING"": B E I N G -> E at position 2? B, I, N, G available? Yes. ""BEING"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> E at 2? F, I, G, N available? Yes.

""WEIRD"": W E I R D -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""HEIST"": H E I S T -> H and S eliminated? H(x) and S(x) so not.

""DEITY"": D E I T Y -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""BEING"" and ""FEIGN"" are possible.

E at position 3: words like ""AXIOM""? But A and O eliminated? Not.

""MEDIA"": M E D I A -> M and A eliminated? M(x) and A(x) so not.

""ODIUM"": O and M eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E at position 3? B at1, E at2? ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5). So E at position 2? Not 3.

""BEGIN"" has E at position 2.

For E at position 3: ""ABIDE""? A eliminated? Not.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> A eliminated? Not.

""RADII"": R and A eliminated? Not.

""TOWEL"": T and O and E at 4? Not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> E at position 3 and 4? But we are testing E at 3? And Q and U available? But E at 4? We know position 4 is not E? From HOMES feedback? In HOMES, E was at position 4 and got -, meaning E is not at 4? So if we put E at 4 again, it might be x or -? But we know it's not at 4, so avoid.

Similarly, position 5 we avoid.

So for E at position 3: ""OPINE"": O and E at 5? Not.

""URINE"": U R I N E -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""SPIEL"": S and E at 4? Not.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> no E? We need to include E.

""ADIEU"": A and E at 4? Not.

""JUMBO"": no E.

Perhaps ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""FIELD"": F I E L D -> E at position 3? F at1, I2, E3, L4, D5. Yes, and letters F,I,E,L,D. F,I,L,D available? Yes. ""FIELD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same, E at 3.

""YIELD"": Y I E L D.

But W and Y are less common? But possible.

""FIEND"": F I E N D -> E at 3? F,I,E,N,D. N and D available.

""FIEND"" is a word.

Now, comparing:

- E at 1: ""EDIFY"" (E,D,I,F,Y) or ""ELFIN"" (E,L,F,I,N)
- E at 2: ""BEING"" (B,E,I,N,G) or ""FEIGN"" (F,E,I,G,N)
- E at 3: ""FIELD"" (F,I,E,L,D) or ""FIEND"" (F,I,E,N,D)

We need to choose one that covers more common letters and new information.

Since we have limited guesses left (4 tries remaining), we should maximize information.

Note that in ""BEING"", we have B,E,I,N,G — all new except E.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" has F,E,I,G,N.

""EDIFY"" has E,D,I,F,Y — includes Y which is less common.

""ELFIN"" has E,L,F,I,N.

""FIELD"" has F,I,E,L,D.

""FIEND"" has F,I,E,N,D.

Common letters: I, N, D, L, F, G, B are all reasonable.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

Also, we know E must be in 1,2, or 3, so by placing E at a specific position, we can test that position.

For example, if we put E at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly for other positions.

But we have three positions to test, and we can only test one at a time.

Perhaps start with E at position 1? Since it's a common starting position.

But let's see the frequency: E is common at the end, but we know it's not at 4 or 5, so beginning or middle.

In 5-letter words, E is common at position 1? Not as common as at the end, but still.

We can choose a word that has E at position 2, which is also common.

I think ""BEING"" is a good choice: it has common letters B,E,I,N,G. B and G are consonants, I is vowel, N is common.

""BEING"" places E at position 2.

If E is at position 2, we get ✓ for E. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" is similar but with F instead of B.

B is more common than F? In English, B is more frequent than F? According to letter frequency, E is most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

But we have eliminated many common ones, so B and F are about the same? B is 19th, F is 14th? F is slightly more common? F is 14th, B is 19th in frequency? But in our available, we have to use what we have.

But ""BEING"" is a very common word, so I'll go with that.

Another option: ""DEIGN""? D E I G N -> E at 2? D,E,I,G,N. But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to do something unworthy.

But ""BEING"" is simpler.

I think ""BEING"" is fine.

So let's guess ""BEING"".

But in ""BEING"", we have E at position 2. If the secret has E at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Now, if we get feedback that E is not at 2, then we can try E at 1 or 3 next.

Similarly, if any of B, I, N, G are present, we get feedback.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""BEING"" as the next guess.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked as ""-"").

### Key Insights:
1. **Eliminated Letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
2. **Confirmed Present Letters**: E is in the word but **not in positions 4 or 5**. Therefore, E must be in **position 1, 2, or 3**.
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters not eliminated).
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3 (to test a new position for E).
   - Use **new common letters** to maximize information gain (e.g., B, I, N, G, D, L, F).
   - Avoid eliminated letters.
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., I, N, G, B) to increase chances of hits.

### Why ""BEING""?
- **Word**: BEING (B, E, I, N, G).
- **Placement of E**: E is in **position 2** (a new position to test, since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- **Letter Coverage**:
  - Tests **B** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **N** (position 4), and **G** (position 5)—all new, common letters.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S).
- **Information Gain**:
  - If E is in position 2, feedback will show ""✓"" for E, confirming its position.
  - If E is not in position 2, it must be in position 1 or 3 (narrowing possibilities).
  - Feedback on B, I, N, G will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for E while testing four new high-frequency letters.

<guess>BEING</guess>",BEING,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

So, the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. Also, C, R, A, T are absent.

Guess 2: HOMES
- H: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in HOMES)
- S: x (not in word)

Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, H, O, M, S are absent.

Now, we know the following:

Absent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S
Present letters: E (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since not 4 or 5)

We have used 9 unique letters that are absent (C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S) and one present (E). There are 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left to consider.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is present but we know it must be in positions 1,2,3)

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes E in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the available letters.

Also, since E is present and we know it's not at 4 or 5, we should try to place it in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. We haven't tested position 1, 2, or 3 for E yet.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters from the available list: B, D, F, G, I, L, N, P, U, Y (less common: J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z)

We can try to use a word with E at position 1, for example, to test that position.

Possible words with E at position 1 and using available letters:

- E at 1: e.g., ""E"", then next letters from available.

Examples:
- ""ELFIN"": E L F I N -> but L, F, I, N are available? Yes. But ""ELFIN"" is a word? Meaning: like an elf, or small and delicate. Valid.
- ""ENDOW"": E N D O W -> but O is eliminated? O is absent (from HOMES feedback: O(x)), so cannot use O. So not.
- ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L -> A is eliminated? A(x) from first guess, so not.
- ""EJECT"": E J E C T -> C and T eliminated? Yes, so not.

Better: ""ELVEN""? E L V E N -> V and N available? But V is less common, and we have two E's? We don't know if the secret has two E's, but it might. However, we are trying to get information.

But ""ELVEN"" might not be common.

""EDGED"": E D G E D -> two D's and two E's? Not ideal for information.

""EIDER"": E I D E R -> R eliminated? R(x) from first guess, so not.

""ENNUI"": E N N U I -> has two N's? But U and I available. Valid word? Yes, meaning boredom.

But we want to cover more common letters.

Another: ""PINEY""? But E at position 4? We want E at 1? ""PINEY"" is P,I,N,E,Y -> E at 4? But we are trying to test E at 1.

Let's focus on E at 1.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A eliminated? A(x) so not.

""EBONY"": E B O N Y -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""ELFIN"" seems okay: E L F I N.

But F and I? F is not extremely common, but possible.

""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""EDIFY"": E D I F Y -> D, I, F, Y available? Yes. ""EDIFY"" is a word, meaning to instruct or improve.

Similarly, ""ELUDE"": E L U D E -> E at 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is not E? So if we put E at 5, it might be x? But we are putting E at 1 and 5? The E at 5 might be marked x if the secret has only one E? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

So ""ELUDE"" has E at 5, which we know is wrong, so it might be a waste? But it could help if there is a duplicate E? Unlikely.

Better to use a word with E only once and in position 1,2, or 3.

So ""EDIFY"": E at 1, then D, I, F, Y.

But Y at the end? Position 5.

Similarly, ""ENVOY"": E N V O Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EPOXY"": E P O X Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EXIST"": E X I S T -> S and T eliminated? S(x) and T(x) so not.

""ELINT"": E L I N T -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""EDIFY"" or ""ELFIN"" are candidates.

What about E at position 2? We haven't tested that.

For example, words with E in position 2: like ""DEUCE""? But D E U C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""LEMON"": L E M O N -> M and O eliminated? M(x) and O(x) from HOMES, so not.

""BEING"": B E I N G -> E at position 2? B, I, N, G available? Yes. ""BEING"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> E at 2? F, I, G, N available? Yes.

""WEIRD"": W E I R D -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""HEIST"": H E I S T -> H and S eliminated? H(x) and S(x) so not.

""DEITY"": D E I T Y -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""BEING"" and ""FEIGN"" are possible.

E at position 3: words like ""AXIOM""? But A and O eliminated? Not.

""MEDIA"": M E D I A -> M and A eliminated? M(x) and A(x) so not.

""ODIUM"": O and M eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E at position 3? B at1, E at2? ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5). So E at position 2? Not 3.

""BEGIN"" has E at position 2.

For E at position 3: ""ABIDE""? A eliminated? Not.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> A eliminated? Not.

""RADII"": R and A eliminated? Not.

""TOWEL"": T and O and E at 4? Not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> E at position 3 and 4? But we are testing E at 3? And Q and U available? But E at 4? We know position 4 is not E? From HOMES feedback? In HOMES, E was at position 4 and got -, meaning E is not at 4? So if we put E at 4 again, it might be x or -? But we know it's not at 4, so avoid.

Similarly, position 5 we avoid.

So for E at position 3: ""OPINE"": O and E at 5? Not.

""URINE"": U R I N E -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""SPIEL"": S and E at 4? Not.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> no E? We need to include E.

""ADIEU"": A and E at 4? Not.

""JUMBO"": no E.

Perhaps ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""FIELD"": F I E L D -> E at position 3? F at1, I2, E3, L4, D5. Yes, and letters F,I,E,L,D. F,I,L,D available? Yes. ""FIELD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same, E at 3.

""YIELD"": Y I E L D.

But W and Y are less common? But possible.

""FIEND"": F I E N D -> E at 3? F,I,E,N,D. N and D available.

""FIEND"" is a word.

Now, comparing:

- E at 1: ""EDIFY"" (E,D,I,F,Y) or ""ELFIN"" (E,L,F,I,N)
- E at 2: ""BEING"" (B,E,I,N,G) or ""FEIGN"" (F,E,I,G,N)
- E at 3: ""FIELD"" (F,I,E,L,D) or ""FIEND"" (F,I,E,N,D)

We need to choose one that covers more common letters and new information.

Since we have limited guesses left (4 tries remaining), we should maximize information.

Note that in ""BEING"", we have B,E,I,N,G — all new except E.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" has F,E,I,G,N.

""EDIFY"" has E,D,I,F,Y — includes Y which is less common.

""ELFIN"" has E,L,F,I,N.

""FIELD"" has F,I,E,L,D.

""FIEND"" has F,I,E,N,D.

Common letters: I, N, D, L, F, G, B are all reasonable.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

Also, we know E must be in 1,2, or 3, so by placing E at a specific position, we can test that position.

For example, if we put E at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly for other positions.

But we have three positions to test, and we can only test one at a time.

Perhaps start with E at position 1? Since it's a common starting position.

But let's see the frequency: E is common at the end, but we know it's not at 4 or 5, so beginning or middle.

In 5-letter words, E is common at position 1? Not as common as at the end, but still.

We can choose a word that has E at position 2, which is also common.

I think ""BEING"" is a good choice: it has common letters B,E,I,N,G. B and G are consonants, I is vowel, N is common.

""BEING"" places E at position 2.

If E is at position 2, we get ✓ for E. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" is similar but with F instead of B.

B is more common than F? In English, B is more frequent than F? According to letter frequency, E is most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

But we have eliminated many common ones, so B and F are about the same? B is 19th, F is 14th? F is slightly more common? F is 14th, B is 19th in frequency? But in our available, we have to use what we have.

But ""BEING"" is a very common word, so I'll go with that.

Another option: ""DEIGN""? D E I G N -> E at 2? D,E,I,G,N. But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to do something unworthy.

But ""BEING"" is simpler.

I think ""BEING"" is fine.

So let's guess ""BEING"".

But in ""BEING"", we have E at position 2. If the secret has E at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Now, if we get feedback that E is not at 2, then we can try E at 1 or 3 next.

Similarly, if any of B, I, N, G are present, we get feedback.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""BEING"" as the next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good first word.
 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has unique letters and includes letters like A, E, I, O, R, S, T.

 After considering, a good starting word is ""CRATE"". It covers common vowels and consonants.

 However, note that we are allowed any 5-letter word. Another popular choice is ""ROAST"", but I think ""CRATE"" is solid.

 Let me check: C, R, A, T, E are all very common.

 But note: the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ : correct letter and position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 Our first guess: ""CRATE""

 Format: 
   We respond with: <guess> CRATE </guess>For the first guess, I want to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. ""CRATE"" is an effective opener because: 

- It contains three common vowels (A, E) and important consonants (C, R, T)
- All letters are unique, increasing coverage
- Frequent letters like R, T, and E help test key positions  

This will provide clear feedback on frequently used letters and position-based patterns for the secret word.

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""CRATE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
This means:
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (since marked x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (since marked with -)

Given this information:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we guessed E at the end and it was wrong).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or T.

For our next guess, we need:
- A 5-letter word that includes E (but not in the fifth position).
- It should not contain C, R, A, or T.
- We want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Possible letters to include: Since E is present, we can try to put E in different positions to locate it.

We also have many letters eliminated: C, R, A, T are out. So we avoid those.

Common letters not used yet: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Given E is not in the last position, let's try to put E in the first or middle positions to test.

Also, since only E was found and four letters are eliminated, the word likely has less common letters or a different set.

A good strategy is to use a word with E in a different position and include new common letters.

For example, position of E: Our first guess had E at the 5th position, so it must be in positions 1-4.

We can try putting E at the beginning? But let's consider other possibilities.

Possible words: How about ""SPINE""? But that has T? Wait, no T allowed? Wait, no we cannot have T because T is eliminated. Feedback T(x) means no T.

So words without: C, R, A, T.

""SPINE"" has P, I, N, E, S? But what about the structure.

Better to think of words with E not at the end.

Examples:
- E in position 1: ELBOW, ECLIP? But ECLIP has C? C is eliminated. So not.

Let's generate words with E somewhere in positions 1-4 and without C,R,A,T.

Common possibilities:
- Words starting with S? Like SPEND, SPEED? But E at position 3 and 4? SPEED: S P E E D -> has two E's? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? Well, Wordle allows duplicates unless specified. But in this case, only one E known.

Actually, in the feedback: we have one E marked as present, but if the word has two E's, then we might see two E's getting feedback. But here only one - for E, so maybe the word has only one E? But note: the feedback only marks the E in the last position as -, but if we had another E in another position, it might be marked differently? But in our guess ""CRATE"" we have only one E.

So the secret word has at least one E.

Our next word should ideally have letters not guessed before, except for E.

We have to use E again.

We cannot use: C, R, A, T.

So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Focus on frequent ones: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, H, K, W.

Idea: Try a word with E in position 1? But finding words without A and T etc. is harder.

Position 1: E? Like ELDER? But L,D,E,R? R not allowed? R is eliminated.

We cannot use R.

So any word we choose must not contain R.

Position 2: E? Like DEUCE? But has C and E? C eliminated.

Another idea: Since E is not at position 5, try E at position 4 or position 1, etc.

Also, we need to cover new letters.

After elimination, common letters to try: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, P, M, B, H, Y, etc.

Let me list possible words: 
- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.

EERIE has R? Not allowed.

ELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn't E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.

But ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E's? That's fine.

But in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.

But let's not complicate. We can use words with multiple E's but it might confuse.

Focus on one E.

Better words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.

Another: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D's? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.

D position 1 and 5? E at 4.

But D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we'll get feedback accordingly.

But let's aim for unique letters? Unless it's necessary.

Ideal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.

Position possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.

We guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.

Try E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn't E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.

For new guess, let's avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

Similarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.

Words starting with E: E with letters from available.

E + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.

EDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.

Focus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.

Word with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn't be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn't help with finding the position of E.

We should put E in a position we haven't tested? We only know position 5 is not E.

So test position 1 to 4: let's choose to put E in position 1.

But let's say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.

But E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.

Since in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E's, but let's not assume.

But ELBOW has E only once.

Now, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.

Sounds good. But let's see.

Another possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.

Example: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn't E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it's not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.

Similarly, don't put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.

Prioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.

Common positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.

We can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.

Example word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.

So cannot have words with R.

Available letters only: without C,R,A,T.

So PRIDE not allowed because R.

Better words focusing on E at 4: 
""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.

""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.

C is eliminated so C should not be in.

""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.

""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.

""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.

Only when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.

""DODGE"": E at 5? 

Plenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.

Words with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.

""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.

Position 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.

Usually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.

""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.

Not working.

Consider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.

But S at5? Then E is at position4.

Perfect: it has E at position 4? We haven't tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.

Another word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.

Also, E at position 4.

But both HOMES and BIKES are possible.

We also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.

Available letters: best to use letters with high frequency.

S, O, N, I, H are common.

HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.

BIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.

Perhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.

Either way.

Since E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.

But we have a choice.

Another classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.

Not.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.

But I think HOMES is a common word.

HOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.

Similarly, the letter S is at position5.

Since in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.

And S has not been tested.

So let's go with HOMES.

But wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it's in another position? Then we know E is not at4.

Similarly for other letters.

This will give good information.

Other word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.

""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.

Perhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.

Not great.

""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.

Since WE decided HOMES might be solid.

Alternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.

But L,I,N,D are new.

Then HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.

I think ""HOMES"" is fine.

So our guess could be ""HOMES"".

But let's confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.

And feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.

Thus, next guess: HOMES.

Response: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>

In the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.

So.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.
- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.
- Consider positions for E that haven't been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

I selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:
- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).
- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.
- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).
- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).

This guess will provide feedback on E's position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.

<guess>HOMES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

So, the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. Also, C, R, A, T are absent.

Guess 2: HOMES
- H: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in HOMES)
- S: x (not in word)

Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, H, O, M, S are absent.

Now, we know the following:

Absent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S
Present letters: E (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since not 4 or 5)

We have used 9 unique letters that are absent (C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S) and one present (E). There are 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left to consider.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is present but we know it must be in positions 1,2,3)

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes E in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the available letters.

Also, since E is present and we know it's not at 4 or 5, we should try to place it in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. We haven't tested position 1, 2, or 3 for E yet.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters from the available list: B, D, F, G, I, L, N, P, U, Y (less common: J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z)

We can try to use a word with E at position 1, for example, to test that position.

Possible words with E at position 1 and using available letters:

- E at 1: e.g., ""E"", then next letters from available.

Examples:
- ""ELFIN"": E L F I N -> but L, F, I, N are available? Yes. But ""ELFIN"" is a word? Meaning: like an elf, or small and delicate. Valid.
- ""ENDOW"": E N D O W -> but O is eliminated? O is absent (from HOMES feedback: O(x)), so cannot use O. So not.
- ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L -> A is eliminated? A(x) from first guess, so not.
- ""EJECT"": E J E C T -> C and T eliminated? Yes, so not.

Better: ""ELVEN""? E L V E N -> V and N available? But V is less common, and we have two E's? We don't know if the secret has two E's, but it might. However, we are trying to get information.

But ""ELVEN"" might not be common.

""EDGED"": E D G E D -> two D's and two E's? Not ideal for information.

""EIDER"": E I D E R -> R eliminated? R(x) from first guess, so not.

""ENNUI"": E N N U I -> has two N's? But U and I available. Valid word? Yes, meaning boredom.

But we want to cover more common letters.

Another: ""PINEY""? But E at position 4? We want E at 1? ""PINEY"" is P,I,N,E,Y -> E at 4? But we are trying to test E at 1.

Let's focus on E at 1.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A eliminated? A(x) so not.

""EBONY"": E B O N Y -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""ELFIN"" seems okay: E L F I N.

But F and I? F is not extremely common, but possible.

""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""EDIFY"": E D I F Y -> D, I, F, Y available? Yes. ""EDIFY"" is a word, meaning to instruct or improve.

Similarly, ""ELUDE"": E L U D E -> E at 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is not E? So if we put E at 5, it might be x? But we are putting E at 1 and 5? The E at 5 might be marked x if the secret has only one E? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

So ""ELUDE"" has E at 5, which we know is wrong, so it might be a waste? But it could help if there is a duplicate E? Unlikely.

Better to use a word with E only once and in position 1,2, or 3.

So ""EDIFY"": E at 1, then D, I, F, Y.

But Y at the end? Position 5.

Similarly, ""ENVOY"": E N V O Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EPOXY"": E P O X Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EXIST"": E X I S T -> S and T eliminated? S(x) and T(x) so not.

""ELINT"": E L I N T -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""EDIFY"" or ""ELFIN"" are candidates.

What about E at position 2? We haven't tested that.

For example, words with E in position 2: like ""DEUCE""? But D E U C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""LEMON"": L E M O N -> M and O eliminated? M(x) and O(x) from HOMES, so not.

""BEING"": B E I N G -> E at position 2? B, I, N, G available? Yes. ""BEING"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> E at 2? F, I, G, N available? Yes.

""WEIRD"": W E I R D -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""HEIST"": H E I S T -> H and S eliminated? H(x) and S(x) so not.

""DEITY"": D E I T Y -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""BEING"" and ""FEIGN"" are possible.

E at position 3: words like ""AXIOM""? But A and O eliminated? Not.

""MEDIA"": M E D I A -> M and A eliminated? M(x) and A(x) so not.

""ODIUM"": O and M eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E at position 3? B at1, E at2? ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5). So E at position 2? Not 3.

""BEGIN"" has E at position 2.

For E at position 3: ""ABIDE""? A eliminated? Not.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> A eliminated? Not.

""RADII"": R and A eliminated? Not.

""TOWEL"": T and O and E at 4? Not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> E at position 3 and 4? But we are testing E at 3? And Q and U available? But E at 4? We know position 4 is not E? From HOMES feedback? In HOMES, E was at position 4 and got -, meaning E is not at 4? So if we put E at 4 again, it might be x or -? But we know it's not at 4, so avoid.

Similarly, position 5 we avoid.

So for E at position 3: ""OPINE"": O and E at 5? Not.

""URINE"": U R I N E -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""SPIEL"": S and E at 4? Not.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> no E? We need to include E.

""ADIEU"": A and E at 4? Not.

""JUMBO"": no E.

Perhaps ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""FIELD"": F I E L D -> E at position 3? F at1, I2, E3, L4, D5. Yes, and letters F,I,E,L,D. F,I,L,D available? Yes. ""FIELD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same, E at 3.

""YIELD"": Y I E L D.

But W and Y are less common? But possible.

""FIEND"": F I E N D -> E at 3? F,I,E,N,D. N and D available.

""FIEND"" is a word.

Now, comparing:

- E at 1: ""EDIFY"" (E,D,I,F,Y) or ""ELFIN"" (E,L,F,I,N)
- E at 2: ""BEING"" (B,E,I,N,G) or ""FEIGN"" (F,E,I,G,N)
- E at 3: ""FIELD"" (F,I,E,L,D) or ""FIEND"" (F,I,E,N,D)

We need to choose one that covers more common letters and new information.

Since we have limited guesses left (4 tries remaining), we should maximize information.

Note that in ""BEING"", we have B,E,I,N,G — all new except E.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" has F,E,I,G,N.

""EDIFY"" has E,D,I,F,Y — includes Y which is less common.

""ELFIN"" has E,L,F,I,N.

""FIELD"" has F,I,E,L,D.

""FIEND"" has F,I,E,N,D.

Common letters: I, N, D, L, F, G, B are all reasonable.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

Also, we know E must be in 1,2, or 3, so by placing E at a specific position, we can test that position.

For example, if we put E at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly for other positions.

But we have three positions to test, and we can only test one at a time.

Perhaps start with E at position 1? Since it's a common starting position.

But let's see the frequency: E is common at the end, but we know it's not at 4 or 5, so beginning or middle.

In 5-letter words, E is common at position 1? Not as common as at the end, but still.

We can choose a word that has E at position 2, which is also common.

I think ""BEING"" is a good choice: it has common letters B,E,I,N,G. B and G are consonants, I is vowel, N is common.

""BEING"" places E at position 2.

If E is at position 2, we get ✓ for E. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" is similar but with F instead of B.

B is more common than F? In English, B is more frequent than F? According to letter frequency, E is most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

But we have eliminated many common ones, so B and F are about the same? B is 19th, F is 14th? F is slightly more common? F is 14th, B is 19th in frequency? But in our available, we have to use what we have.

But ""BEING"" is a very common word, so I'll go with that.

Another option: ""DEIGN""? D E I G N -> E at 2? D,E,I,G,N. But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to do something unworthy.

But ""BEING"" is simpler.

I think ""BEING"" is fine.

So let's guess ""BEING"".

But in ""BEING"", we have E at position 2. If the secret has E at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Now, if we get feedback that E is not at 2, then we can try E at 1 or 3 next.

Similarly, if any of B, I, N, G are present, we get feedback.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""BEING"" as the next guess.

<guess>BEING</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked as ""-"").

### Key Insights:
1. **Eliminated Letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
2. **Confirmed Present Letters**: E is in the word but **not in positions 4 or 5**. Therefore, E must be in **position 1, 2, or 3**.
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters not eliminated).
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3 (to test a new position for E).
   - Use **new common letters** to maximize information gain (e.g., B, I, N, G, D, L, F).
   - Avoid eliminated letters.
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., I, N, G, B) to increase chances of hits.

### Why ""BEING""?
- **Word**: BEING (B, E, I, N, G).
- **Placement of E**: E is in **position 2** (a new position to test, since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- **Letter Coverage**:
  - Tests **B** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **N** (position 4), and **G** (position 5)—all new, common letters.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S).
- **Information Gain**:
  - If E is in position 2, feedback will show ""✓"" for E, confirming its position.
  - If E is not in position 2, it must be in position 1 or 3 (narrowing possibilities).
  - Feedback on B, I, N, G will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for E while testing four new high-frequency letters.

That\'s fine.\n\nBut in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.\n\nBut let\'s not complicate. We can use words with multiple E\'s but it might confuse.\n\nFocus on one E.\n\nBetter words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.\n\nAnother: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D\'s? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.\n\nD position 1 and 5? E at 4.\n\nBut D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we\'ll get feedback accordingly.\n\nBut let\'s aim for unique letters? Unless it\'s necessary.\n\nIdeal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.\n\nPosition possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.\n\nTry E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn\'t E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nFor new guess, let\'s avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.\n\nWords starting with E: E with letters from available.\n\nE + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.\n\nEDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.\n\nFocus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.\n\nWord with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn\'t be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn\'t help with finding the position of E.\n\nWe should put E in a position we haven\'t tested? We only know position 5 is not E.\n\nSo test position 1 to 4: let\'s choose to put E in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.\n\nSince in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E\'s, but let\'s not assume.\n\nBut ELBOW has E only once.\n\nNow, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.\n\nSounds good. But let\'s see.\n\nAnother possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.\n\nExample: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn\'t E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it\'s not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, don\'t put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.\n\nPrioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.\n\nCommon positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.\n\nWe can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.\n\nExample word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.\n\nSo cannot have words with R.\n\nAvailable letters only: without C,R,A,T.\n\nSo PRIDE not allowed because R.\n\nBetter words focusing on E at 4: \n""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.\n\n""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.\n\nC is eliminated so C should not be in.\n\n""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.\n\n""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.\n\n""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.\n\nOnly when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.\n\n""DODGE"": E at 5? \n\nPlenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.\n\nWords with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.\n\n""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.\n\nPosition 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.\n\n""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.\n\nUsually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nPosition 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.\n\n""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.\n\nNot working.\n\nConsider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.\n\nBut S at5? Then E is at position4.\n\nPerfect: it has E at position 4? We haven\'t tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.\n\nAnother word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.\n\nAlso, E at position 4.\n\nBut both HOMES and BIKES are possible.\n\nWe also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.\n\nAvailable letters: best to use letters with high frequency.\n\nS, O, N, I, H are common.\n\nHOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.\n\nBIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.\n\nPerhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.\n\nEither way.\n\nSince E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.\n\nBut we have a choice.\n\nAnother classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.\n\nBut I think HOMES is a common word.\n\nHOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.\n\nSimilarly, the letter S is at position5.\n\nSince in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.\n\nAnd S has not been tested.\n\nSo let\'s go with HOMES.\n\nBut wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it\'s in another position? Then we know E is not at4.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nThis will give good information.\n\nOther word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.\n\n""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.\n\n""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.\n\nPerhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.\n\nNot great.\n\n""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.\n\nSince WE decided HOMES might be solid.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.\n\nBut L,I,N,D are new.\n\nThen HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.\n\nI think ""HOMES"" is fine.\n\nSo our guess could be ""HOMES"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.\n\nAnd feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.\n\nThus, next guess: HOMES.\n\nResponse: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>\n\nIn the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.\n\nSo.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":\n- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.\n- Consider positions for E that haven\'t been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).\n\nI selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:\n- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).\n- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.\n- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).\n- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on E\'s position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.\n\n<guess>HOMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRATE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nSo, the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. Also, C, R, A, T are absent.\n\nGuess 2: HOMES\n- H: x (not in word)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- M: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in HOMES)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has E, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, H, O, M, S are absent.\n\nNow, we know the following:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S\nPresent letters: E (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since not 4 or 5)\n\nWe have used 9 unique letters that are absent (C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S) and one present (E). There are 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left to consider.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is present but we know it must be in positions 1,2,3)\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes E in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the available letters.\n\nAlso, since E is present and we know it\'s not at 4 or 5, we should try to place it in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. We haven\'t tested position 1, 2, or 3 for E yet.\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.\n\nCommon letters from the available list: B, D, F, G, I, L, N, P, U, Y (less common: J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z)\n\nWe can try to use a word with E at position 1, for example, to test that position.\n\nPossible words with E at position 1 and using available letters:\n\n- E at 1: e.g., ""E"", then next letters from available.\n\nExamples:\n- ""ELFIN"": E L F I N -> but L, F, I, N are available? Yes. But ""ELFIN"" is a word? Meaning: like an elf, or small and delicate. Valid.\n- ""ENDOW"": E N D O W -> but O is eliminated? O is absent (from HOMES feedback: O(x)), so cannot use O. So not.\n- ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L -> A is eliminated? A(x) from first guess, so not.\n- ""EJECT"": E J E C T -> C and T eliminated? Yes, so not.\n\nBetter: ""ELVEN""? E L V E N -> V and N available? But V is less common, and we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the secret has two E\'s, but it might. However, we are trying to get information.\n\nBut ""ELVEN"" might not be common.\n\n""EDGED"": E D G E D -> two D\'s and two E\'s? Not ideal for information.\n\n""EIDER"": E I D E R -> R eliminated? R(x) from first guess, so not.\n\n""ENNUI"": E N N U I -> has two N\'s? But U and I available. Valid word? Yes, meaning boredom.\n\nBut we want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother: ""PINEY""? But E at position 4? We want E at 1? ""PINEY"" is P,I,N,E,Y -> E at 4? But we are trying to test E at 1.\n\nLet\'s focus on E at 1.\n\n""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A eliminated? A(x) so not.\n\n""EBONY"": E B O N Y -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.\n\n""ELFIN"" seems okay: E L F I N.\n\nBut F and I?

""EDIFY"" is a word, meaning to instruct or improve.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELUDE"": E L U D E -> E at 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is not E? So if we put E at 5, it might be x? But we are putting E at 1 and 5? The E at 5 might be marked x if the secret has only one E? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo ""ELUDE"" has E at 5, which we know is wrong, so it might be a waste? But it could help if there is a duplicate E? Unlikely.\n\nBetter to use a word with E only once and in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo ""EDIFY"": E at 1, then D, I, F, Y.\n\nBut Y at the end? Position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""ENVOY"": E N V O Y -> O eliminated? Not.\n\n""EPOXY"": E P O X Y -> O eliminated? Not.\n\n""EXIST"": E X I S T -> S and T eliminated? S(x) and T(x) so not.\n\n""ELINT"": E L I N T -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.\n\nSo ""EDIFY"" or ""ELFIN"" are candidates.\n\nWhat about E at position 2? We haven\'t tested that.\n\nFor example, words with E in position 2: like ""DEUCE""? But D E U C E -> C eliminated? Not.\n\n""LEMON"": L E M O N -> M and O eliminated? M(x) and O(x) from HOMES, so not.\n\n""BEING"": B E I N G -> E at position 2? B, I, N, G available? Yes. ""BEING"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> E at 2?

Not.\n\n""TOWEL"": T and O and E at 4? Not.\n\n""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> E at position 3 and 4? But we are testing E at 3? And Q and U available? But E at 4? We know position 4 is not E? From HOMES feedback? In HOMES, E was at position 4 and got -, meaning E is not at 4? So if we put E at 4 again, it might be x or -? But we know it\'s not at 4, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 we avoid.\n\nSo for E at position 3: ""OPINE"": O and E at 5? Not.\n\n""URINE"": U R I N E -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.\n\n""SPIEL"": S and E at 4? Not.\n\n""GUILD"": G U I L D -> no E? We need to include E.\n\n""ADIEU"": A and E at 4? Not.\n\n""JUMBO"": no E.\n\nPerhaps ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> C eliminated? Not.\n\n""FIELD"": F I E L D -> E at position 3? F at1, I2, E3, L4, D5. Yes, and letters F,I,E,L,D. F,I,L,D available? Yes. ""FIELD"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same, E at 3.\n\n""YIELD"": Y I E L D.\n\nBut W and Y are less common? But possible.\n\n""FIEND"": F I E N D -> E at 3? F,I,E,N,D. N and D available.\n\n""FIEND"" is a word.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\n- E at 1: ""EDIFY"" (E,D,I,F,Y) or ""ELFIN"" (E,L,F,I,N)\n- E at 2: ""BEING"" (B,E,I,N,G) or ""FEIGN"" (F,E,I,G,N)\n- E at 3: ""FIELD"" (F,I,E,L,D) or ""FIEND"" (F,I,E,N,D)\n\nWe need to choose one that covers more common letters and new information.\n\nSince we have limited guesses left (4 tries remaining), we should maximize information.\n\nNote that in ""BEING"", we have B,E,I,N,G — all new except E.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEIGN"" has F,E,I,G,N.\n\n""EDIFY"" has E,D,I,F,Y — includes Y which is less common.\n\n""ELFIN"" has E,L,F,I,N.\n\n""FIELD"" has F,I,E,L,D.\n\n""FIEND"" has F,I,E,N,D.\n\nCommon letters: I, N, D, L, F, G, B are all reasonable.\n\nBut we have to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nAlso, we know E must be in 1,2, or 3, so by placing E at a specific position, we can test that position.\n\nFor example, if we put E at position 1 and it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, then E must be in 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut we have three positions to test, and we can only test one at a time.\n\nPerhaps start with E at position 1? Since it\'s a common starting position.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: E is common at the end, but we know it\'s not at 4 or 5, so beginning or middle.\n\nIn 5-letter words, E is common at position 1? Not as common as at the end, but still.\n\nWe can choose a word that has E at position 2, which is also common.\n\nI think ""BEING"" is a good choice: it has common letters B,E,I,N,G. B and G are consonants, I is vowel, N is common.\n\n""BEING"" places E at position 2.\n\nIf E is at position 2, we get ✓ for E. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, we test B, I, N, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEIGN"" is similar but with F instead of B.\n\nB is more common than F? In English, B is more frequent than F? According to letter frequency, E is most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.\n\nBut we have eliminated many common ones, so B and F are about the same? B is 19th, F is 14th? F is slightly more common? F is 14th, B is 19th in frequency? But in our available, we have to use what we have.\n\nBut ""BEING"" is a very common word, so I\'ll go with that.\n\nAnother option: ""DEIGN""? D E I G N -> E at 2? D,E,I,G,N. But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to do something unworthy.\n\nBut ""BEING"" is simpler.\n\nI think ""BEING"" is fine.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""BEING"".\n\nBut in ""BEING"", we have E at position 2. If the secret has E at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, we test B, I, N, G.\n\nNow, if we get feedback that E is not at 2, then we can try E at 1 or 3 next.\n\nSimilarly, if any of B, I, N, G are present, we get feedback.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BEING"" as the next guess.\n\n<guess>BEING</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  \n  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HOMES -> H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").

Guess 3: BEING -> B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since we guessed E at position 2 and got ""✓"").
  - B, I, N, G are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the second position (position 2).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is confirmed at position 2, so we don't need to guess it again? Actually, we know it's fixed at position 2, so the word is _ E _ _ _

We have 5 positions: 
  Position 1: unknown, but not any eliminated letter.
  Position 2: E (fixed)
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: unknown

We need to form a word of the form ? E ? ? ? with the available letters.

Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to avoid the eliminated letters: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G.

Now, we need to choose a word that uses the available letters and has E in the second position.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but C is eliminated? C is in the eliminated list? Yes, from guess1: C(x). So not.
- ""LEVER"" -> R eliminated? R(x) from guess1. Also, L is available? But R is not.
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but we have two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in this case, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know from guess2 that E is not at position 4 (because in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning it's not there). So if we put E at position4, it would be wrong? But if the word has two E's, then it might be present? However, in the feedback for BEING, we only have one E (at position2) and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us if there are more E's. But in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was present (but wrong position), and in the second guess, E at position4 was present (but wrong position). That suggests that E might be only one? Or multiple? Actually, the feedback for E in CRATE was ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position5. Similarly, in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position4. Then in BEING, E at position2 got ""✓"", meaning it is at position2. So if there is only one E, then positions 4 and 5 cannot have E. But if there are two E's, then the other E could be at position1 or 3? But we haven't tested position1 or 3 for E? Actually, we haven't placed E at position1 or 3 yet.

But note: in the feedback for BEING, we have E at position2 correct, and the other letters (B,I,N,G) are absent. But we don't have any feedback about other positions for E? Because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So it's possible that there is another E? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should not assume there is only one E. But we know that position2 has E, and positions 4 and 5 do not have E? Not necessarily: we only know that when we guessed E at position4 and position5, it was not there at that time? But if there is a duplicate E, it could be at position4? However, in HOMES, we had E at position4 and it was marked ""-"", which means that either the secret word has E but not at position4, or if there is a duplicate, then one of the E's is at position2 (which we now know) and the other could be at position4? But then the feedback for HOMES would have shown two marks for E? But in HOMES, we only had one E? So if the secret has two E's, and we guess one E at position4, and the secret has E at position2 and say position3, then the feedback for HOMES would show one ""-"" for E (if the secret has two E's, but we only guessed one, then we get one mark). The feedback marks only the letters we guess? So if we guess one E and the secret has two E's, we only get one mark? Yes.

So it's possible that there is another E? But we don't have evidence.

However, to be efficient, we can assume for now that there is only one E? Or we can test? But we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in other positions to avoid confusion? But we are forced to have E at position2.

So for the next guess, we need to fill positions 1,3,4,5 with available letters.

Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word: [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] E [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z]

But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Now, let's think of common words that fit.

Examples:
- ""DELLY"" -> not a word? 
- ""JELLY"" -> J,E,L,L,Y -> but L repeated? And J and Y available? But ""JELLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have E at position2? J at1, E at2, L at3, L at4, Y at5. But we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word? Also, we have to check if L is available? Yes, L is available.

But we have eliminated: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G. So L is available.

But in ""JELLY"", we have L at position3 and4? So if we guess, we might get feedback on L.

But is ""JELLY"" common? Yes.

Another: ""KELLY"" -> K,E,L,L,Y -> similar.

But K is available.

""DEUCE"" not because C eliminated.

""LEPER"" -> R eliminated? R is eliminated.

""PENNE"" -> but N eliminated? N(x) from BEING? Yes, N is eliminated? In BEING, N at position4 got x, so N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

Similarly, G is eliminated, I eliminated, etc.

So we cannot use N.

In ""JELLY"", we don't use any eliminated letters? J, E, L, L, Y. E is fixed at2, J, L, Y are available? But we have two L's? That's acceptable.

But let's see if there are words without duplicates.

""VELDT"" -> V,E,L,D,T -> but T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes, T eliminated.

""WELCH"" -> H eliminated? H(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""YELPS"" -> S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""ZEBRA"" -> Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? All three? Not.

""QUEUE"" -> Q,U,E,U,E -> E at position2 and5? But we know position5 cannot have E? Because in CRATE, E at5 was marked ""-"", meaning E is not at5. So if we put E at5, it would be wrong? But if there is a duplicate, it might be marked? But we know E is at2, so position5 should not be E? So ""QUEUE"" has E at5, which we know is incorrect? So it would be marked x? Then we waste a letter.

So avoid putting E at positions we know it's not? So avoid position4 and5 for E? But in our pattern, we are not putting E at4 or5? In the word we form, we have E at2, and other positions are non-E? But we can use E again? But we don't have to.

To avoid confusion, we can avoid using E in other positions? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But for now, let's try to use a word without E in other positions.

So for positions 1,3,4,5: use non-E letters from available.

Available non-E letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, common words with E at2:

- ""LEVY"": but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DEVIL"": D,E,V,I,L -> but I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes, I is eliminated? In BEING, I at position3 got x, so I not in word? So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I and N eliminated? Not.

""PECKY"": P,E,C,K,Y -> C eliminated? Not.

""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> has E at position2 and4? But we know position4 is not E? From HOMES? So if we put E at4, it might be x? But if the secret has only one E, then E at4 would be x. If two, then it might be -? But we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid putting E at4.

So ""JEWEL"" has E at4, which we suspect is not correct.

Similarly, ""NEWEL"": N,E,W,E,L -> N eliminated and E at4? Not.

""REWET"": R and E at4? Not.

""HEWER"": H and E at4? Not.

So let's avoid E at4.

What about ""LEVER""? R eliminated? Not.

""BEVEL"": B eliminated? B(x) from BEING? Yes.

""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.

""FEVER"": F,E,V,E,R -> R eliminated? Not.

""JETTY"": J,E,T,T,Y -> T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes.

""KEDGE"": K,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated? G(x) from BEING? Yes, and E at5? Avoid.

""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated and E at5? Not.

""WEDGY"": W,E,D,G,Y -> G eliminated? Not.

""PEDAL"": P,E,D,A,L -> A eliminated? A(x) from CRATE? Yes.

""MEDIA"": M and A eliminated? Not.

So it's hard.

Another idea: ""YELP"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""YELPS"" is 5, but S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""ZEXES"": Z,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated and E at4? Not.

""LEXIS"": L,E,X,I,S -> I and S eliminated? Not.

""JUMPS"": J,U,M,P,S -> M and S eliminated? Not.

Perhaps we need to use less common letters.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> E at4? Avoid.

""WEXED"": not common.

""YEXED"": not common.

""JUKED"": J,U,K,E,D -> E at4? In ""JUKED"", positions: J1, U2? No, we need E at2. So ""JUKED"" has U at2? Not E.

We need E at2.

So the word must have the second letter E.

How about ""DEBYE""? D,E,B,Y,E -> B eliminated and E at5? Not.

""DEFY"" is 4 letters.

""DELAY"": D,E,L,A,Y -> A eliminated? Not.

""DELFT"": D,E,L,F,T -> T eliminated? Not.

""DELPH"": D,E,L,P,H -> H eliminated? Not.

""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> E at5? Avoid.

""DEMUR"": D,E,M,U,R -> M and R eliminated? Not.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> N, I, M eliminated? All? Not.

""DEPOT"": D,E,P,O,T -> O and T eliminated? Not.

""DEPTH"": D,E,P,T,H -> T and H eliminated? Not.

""DEUCE"": C eliminated? Not.

""DEVON"": D,E,V,O,N -> O and N eliminated? Not.

""DEWAX"": D,E,W,A,X -> A eliminated? Not.

""DEWED"": D,E,W,E,D -> E at4? Avoid.

""DEXES"": D,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated and E at4? Not.

""JEEPS"": J,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated and E at1? We have E at2? ""JEEPS"": J1, E2, E3, P4, S5. So E at2 and3? But we have two E's? And S eliminated? Not.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""LEEPS"": not common.

""PEEPS"": P,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEEPS"": V,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

We are struggling.

Another approach: use L, which is common.

""LEEKS"": L,E,E,K,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""LEETS"": L,E,E,T,S -> T and S eliminated? Not.

""LEEZY"": not common.

""LEZZY"": not common.

""LYCEA"": L,Y,C,E,A -> C and A eliminated? Not.

Perhaps ""QUEEN"" but N eliminated and E at4? Not.

""QUEER"": R eliminated? Not.

""QUEYS"": Q,U,E,Y,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEENA"": V,E,E,N,A -> N and A eliminated? Not.

""WEEDS"": W,E,E,D,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WEELS"": W,E,E,L,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WEEMS"": W,E,E,M,S -> M and S eliminated? Not.

""WEENS"": W,E,E,N,S -> N and S eliminated? Not.

""WEEPS"": W,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YEEDS"": Y,E,E,D,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YELKS"": Y,E,L,K,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YELLS"": Y,E,L,L,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YERKS"": Y,E,R,K,S -> R and S eliminated? Not.

""YESES"": Y,E,S,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""ZEBEC"": Z,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.

""ZEBRA"": Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? Not.

""ZERDA"": Z,E,R,D,A -> R and A eliminated? Not.

""ZERKS"": Z,E,R,K,S -> R and S eliminated? Not.

""ZILLA"": Z,I,L,L,A -> I and A eliminated? Not.

This is difficult. We need to use less common letters or accept that we might have to use a word with a duplicate E or use available letters that are less common.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words with E at position2 and using only available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and no eliminated letters.

And avoid E in other positions? Or not? We can use E in other positions, but we know position4 and5 are not E for the secret? Not necessarily, but we have evidence that position4 and5 are not E? From previous feedback.

From guess1: E at5 is not correct (got -), so if there is only one E, then position5 is not E. Similarly, from guess2: E at4 is not correct (got -), so if only one E, position4 is not E. But if there are two E's, then position4 or5 could have the second E? But we don't know.

To be safe, we can choose a word that has E only at position2? Or we can use a word with E at2 and another position? But it might be inefficient.

But we have to make a guess.

Let's consider ""JEWEL"" again: J,E,W,E,L -> positions: J1, E2, W3, E4, L5. But E at4: we know from HOMES that when we put E at4, it was not correct, so if we put E at4 again, it will likely be x or -? But if the secret has a second E at4, it would be -? But we don't know.

But to avoid risk, let's try to find a word without E at4 or5.

Another word: ""LEVEE"" -> L,E,V,E,E -> E at2,4,5? But position4 and5 are E? We know position5 is not E? So not good.

""PEDES"" -> P,E,D,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VELES"" -> V,E,L,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WELLY"" -> W,E,L,L,Y -> no E elsewhere? W1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. So only E at2. And letters: W, E, L, L, Y. All available? W, L, Y are available. E is fixed.

So ""WELLY"" is a word? Meaning: a waterproof boot or to beat in a contest? Yes, it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""JELLY"" has J,E,L,L,Y -> only E at2? J1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. And J, L, Y available.

""KEVEL"" -> K,E,V,E,L -> E at2 and4? Avoid.

""PEWIT"" -> P,E,W,I,T -> I and T eliminated? Not.

""REWIN"" -> R and I and N eliminated? Not.

""SEWAN"" -> S eliminated? Not.

""TEWED"" -> T eliminated? Not.

""VEGAS"" -> V,E,G,A,S -> G, A, S eliminated? Not.

""VELLE"" -> not common.

""WEDEL"" -> W,E,D,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.

""XEBEC"" -> X,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.

""YECCH"" -> not common.

""ZEBUS"" -> Z,E,B,U,S -> B and S eliminated? Not.

So ""WELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are candidates.

Also, ""DEKKO"" -> D,E,K,K,O -> O eliminated? O(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""LEKKY"" -> not common.

""PEKOE"" -> P,E,K,O,E -> O eliminated and E at5? Not.

""TEKKE"" -> T eliminated? Not.

""VELUM"" -> V,E,L,U,M -> M eliminated? M(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""HELIX"" -> H eliminated? Not.

""FELID"" -> F,E,L,I,D -> I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes.

""KELPY"" -> K,E,L,P,Y -> only E at2? K1, E2, L3, P4, Y5. And K,L,P,Y available? Yes. ""KELPY"" is a word? Meaning: a type of seaweed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DELPY"" not common.

So we have:
- ""WELLY"": W,E,L,L,Y
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y
- ""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y

All have E at position2 and no other E.

We can choose one.

""WELLY"" has two L's, which might be good to test L.

Similarly, ""JELLY"" has two L's.

""KELPY"" has L and P.

Since L is common, it's good to test.

Also, Y is common at the end.

I think ""JELLY"" is a common word, so let's go with that.

But J is less common than W or K? But we have to use available letters.

Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" is not possible.

Another word: ""LEEKY"" -> L,E,E,K,Y -> E at2 and3? But we have two E's? And we don't know if we can have duplicate E? But it's allowed, but we are testing.

But in ""LEEKY"", E at3 might be redundant.

Stick with ""JELLY"".

So guess: JELLY

But let's confirm the letters: J, E, L, L, Y. E at position2. J, L, Y are available.

Eliminated letters are not used.

So I think it's fine.

<guess>JELLY</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- **Guess 3: BEING** → Feedback: B(x), E(✓), I(x), N(x), G(x)  
  - **Meaning**: B, I, N, G are **not in the word**. E is **correct and in position 2**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Position**: E is fixed in **position 2** of the secret word (from BEING feedback: E(✓)).
2. **Eliminated Letters (12 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"").
3. **Available Letters**: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ E _ _ _`, where:
   - Position 1: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 2: E (fixed).
   - Positions 3, 4, 5: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on **testing new common letters** from the available list (e.g., L, Y, D, F, P, K) to maximize information.
   - Avoid using E in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out for E, and position 2 is confirmed).
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency available letters (e.g., L, Y) and avoid rare letters (e.g., Q, X, Z) if possible.
   - Given the constraints, ""JELLY"" is a strong choice:
     - Uses E in position 2 (confirmed).
     - Tests new common letters: J (position 1), L (positions 3 and 4), Y (position 5).
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.
     - Provides feedback on L (if present, and its position) and Y (if present).

### Why ""JELLY""?
- **Word**: JELLY (J, E, L, L, Y).
- **Letter Coverage**:
  - **J**: Tested in position 1 (new letter).
  - **E**: Confirmed in position 2 (no need for feedback on E).
  - **L**: Tested in positions 3 and 4 (common consonant; duplicate L helps test for letter frequency).
  - **Y**: Tested in position 5 (common vowel-like letter, often at word ends).
- **Information Gain**:
  - Feedback will reveal if J, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.
  - If L is present, feedback will indicate if it is in position 3, 4, or both (or neither).
  - Further narrows down possibilities for positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

This guess efficiently tests multiple new letters while respecting the fixed E in position 2 and leveraging common English word patterns.

<guess>JELLY</guess>",JELLY,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HOMES -> H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").

Guess 3: BEING -> B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since we guessed E at position 2 and got ""✓"").
  - B, I, N, G are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the second position (position 2).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is confirmed at position 2, so we don't need to guess it again? Actually, we know it's fixed at position 2, so the word is _ E _ _ _

We have 5 positions: 
  Position 1: unknown, but not any eliminated letter.
  Position 2: E (fixed)
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: unknown

We need to form a word of the form ? E ? ? ? with the available letters.

Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to avoid the eliminated letters: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G.

Now, we need to choose a word that uses the available letters and has E in the second position.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but C is eliminated? C is in the eliminated list? Yes, from guess1: C(x). So not.
- ""LEVER"" -> R eliminated? R(x) from guess1. Also, L is available? But R is not.
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but we have two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in this case, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know from guess2 that E is not at position 4 (because in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning it's not there). So if we put E at position4, it would be wrong? But if the word has two E's, then it might be present? However, in the feedback for BEING, we only have one E (at position2) and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us if there are more E's. But in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was present (but wrong position), and in the second guess, E at position4 was present (but wrong position). That suggests that E might be only one? Or multiple? Actually, the feedback for E in CRATE was ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position5. Similarly, in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position4. Then in BEING, E at position2 got ""✓"", meaning it is at position2. So if there is only one E, then positions 4 and 5 cannot have E. But if there are two E's, then the other E could be at position1 or 3? But we haven't tested position1 or 3 for E? Actually, we haven't placed E at position1 or 3 yet.

But note: in the feedback for BEING, we have E at position2 correct, and the other letters (B,I,N,G) are absent. But we don't have any feedback about other positions for E? Because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So it's possible that there is another E? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should not assume there is only one E. But we know that position2 has E, and positions 4 and 5 do not have E? Not necessarily: we only know that when we guessed E at position4 and position5, it was not there at that time? But if there is a duplicate E, it could be at position4? However, in HOMES, we had E at position4 and it was marked ""-"", which means that either the secret word has E but not at position4, or if there is a duplicate, then one of the E's is at position2 (which we now know) and the other could be at position4? But then the feedback for HOMES would have shown two marks for E? But in HOMES, we only had one E? So if the secret has two E's, and we guess one E at position4, and the secret has E at position2 and say position3, then the feedback for HOMES would show one ""-"" for E (if the secret has two E's, but we only guessed one, then we get one mark). The feedback marks only the letters we guess? So if we guess one E and the secret has two E's, we only get one mark? Yes.

So it's possible that there is another E? But we don't have evidence.

However, to be efficient, we can assume for now that there is only one E? Or we can test? But we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in other positions to avoid confusion? But we are forced to have E at position2.

So for the next guess, we need to fill positions 1,3,4,5 with available letters.

Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word: [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] E [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z]

But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Now, let's think of common words that fit.

Examples:
- ""DELLY"" -> not a word? 
- ""JELLY"" -> J,E,L,L,Y -> but L repeated? And J and Y available? But ""JELLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have E at position2? J at1, E at2, L at3, L at4, Y at5. But we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word? Also, we have to check if L is available? Yes, L is available.

But we have eliminated: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G. So L is available.

But in ""JELLY"", we have L at position3 and4? So if we guess, we might get feedback on L.

But is ""JELLY"" common? Yes.

Another: ""KELLY"" -> K,E,L,L,Y -> similar.

But K is available.

""DEUCE"" not because C eliminated.

""LEPER"" -> R eliminated? R is eliminated.

""PENNE"" -> but N eliminated? N(x) from BEING? Yes, N is eliminated? In BEING, N at position4 got x, so N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

Similarly, G is eliminated, I eliminated, etc.

So we cannot use N.

In ""JELLY"", we don't use any eliminated letters? J, E, L, L, Y. E is fixed at2, J, L, Y are available? But we have two L's? That's acceptable.

But let's see if there are words without duplicates.

""VELDT"" -> V,E,L,D,T -> but T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes, T eliminated.

""WELCH"" -> H eliminated? H(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""YELPS"" -> S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""ZEBRA"" -> Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? All three? Not.

""QUEUE"" -> Q,U,E,U,E -> E at position2 and5? But we know position5 cannot have E? Because in CRATE, E at5 was marked ""-"", meaning E is not at5. So if we put E at5, it would be wrong? But if there is a duplicate, it might be marked? But we know E is at2, so position5 should not be E? So ""QUEUE"" has E at5, which we know is incorrect? So it would be marked x? Then we waste a letter.

So avoid putting E at positions we know it's not? So avoid position4 and5 for E? But in our pattern, we are not putting E at4 or5? In the word we form, we have E at2, and other positions are non-E? But we can use E again? But we don't have to.

To avoid confusion, we can avoid using E in other positions? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But for now, let's try to use a word without E in other positions.

So for positions 1,3,4,5: use non-E letters from available.

Available non-E letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, common words with E at2:

- ""LEVY"": but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DEVIL"": D,E,V,I,L -> but I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes, I is eliminated? In BEING, I at position3 got x, so I not in word? So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I and N eliminated? Not.

""PECKY"": P,E,C,K,Y -> C eliminated? Not.

""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> has E at position2 and4? But we know position4 is not E? From HOMES? So if we put E at4, it might be x? But if the secret has only one E, then E at4 would be x. If two, then it might be -? But we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid putting E at4.

So ""JEWEL"" has E at4, which we suspect is not correct.

Similarly, ""NEWEL"": N,E,W,E,L -> N eliminated and E at4? Not.

""REWET"": R and E at4? Not.

""HEWER"": H and E at4? Not.

So let's avoid E at4.

What about ""LEVER""? R eliminated? Not.

""BEVEL"": B eliminated? B(x) from BEING? Yes.

""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.

""FEVER"": F,E,V,E,R -> R eliminated? Not.

""JETTY"": J,E,T,T,Y -> T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes.

""KEDGE"": K,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated? G(x) from BEING? Yes, and E at5? Avoid.

""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated and E at5? Not.

""WEDGY"": W,E,D,G,Y -> G eliminated? Not.

""PEDAL"": P,E,D,A,L -> A eliminated? A(x) from CRATE? Yes.

""MEDIA"": M and A eliminated? Not.

So it's hard.

Another idea: ""YELP"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""YELPS"" is 5, but S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""ZEXES"": Z,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated and E at4? Not.

""LEXIS"": L,E,X,I,S -> I and S eliminated? Not.

""JUMPS"": J,U,M,P,S -> M and S eliminated? Not.

Perhaps we need to use less common letters.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> E at4? Avoid.

""WEXED"": not common.

""YEXED"": not common.

""JUKED"": J,U,K,E,D -> E at4? In ""JUKED"", positions: J1, U2? No, we need E at2. So ""JUKED"" has U at2? Not E.

We need E at2.

So the word must have the second letter E.

How about ""DEBYE""? D,E,B,Y,E -> B eliminated and E at5? Not.

""DEFY"" is 4 letters.

""DELAY"": D,E,L,A,Y -> A eliminated? Not.

""DELFT"": D,E,L,F,T -> T eliminated? Not.

""DELPH"": D,E,L,P,H -> H eliminated? Not.

""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> E at5? Avoid.

""DEMUR"": D,E,M,U,R -> M and R eliminated? Not.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> N, I, M eliminated? All? Not.

""DEPOT"": D,E,P,O,T -> O and T eliminated? Not.

""DEPTH"": D,E,P,T,H -> T and H eliminated? Not.

""DEUCE"": C eliminated? Not.

""DEVON"": D,E,V,O,N -> O and N eliminated? Not.

""DEWAX"": D,E,W,A,X -> A eliminated? Not.

""DEWED"": D,E,W,E,D -> E at4? Avoid.

""DEXES"": D,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated and E at4? Not.

""JEEPS"": J,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated and E at1? We have E at2? ""JEEPS"": J1, E2, E3, P4, S5. So E at2 and3? But we have two E's? And S eliminated? Not.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""LEEPS"": not common.

""PEEPS"": P,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEEPS"": V,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

We are struggling.

Another approach: use L, which is common.

""LEEKS"": L,E,E,K,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""LEETS"": L,E,E,T,S -> T and S eliminated? Not.

""LEEZY"": not common.

""LEZZY"": not common.

""LYCEA"": L,Y,C,E,A -> C and A eliminated? Not.

Perhaps ""QUEEN"" but N eliminated and E at4? Not.

""QUEER"": R eliminated? Not.

""QUEYS"": Q,U,E,Y,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEENA"": V,E,E,N,A -> N and A eliminated? Not.

""WEEDS"": W,E,E,D,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WEELS"": W,E,E,L,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WEEMS"": W,E,E,M,S -> M and S eliminated? Not.

""WEENS"": W,E,E,N,S -> N and S eliminated? Not.

""WEEPS"": W,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YEEDS"": Y,E,E,D,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YELKS"": Y,E,L,K,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YELLS"": Y,E,L,L,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YERKS"": Y,E,R,K,S -> R and S eliminated? Not.

""YESES"": Y,E,S,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""ZEBEC"": Z,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.

""ZEBRA"": Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? Not.

""ZERDA"": Z,E,R,D,A -> R and A eliminated? Not.

""ZERKS"": Z,E,R,K,S -> R and S eliminated? Not.

""ZILLA"": Z,I,L,L,A -> I and A eliminated? Not.

This is difficult. We need to use less common letters or accept that we might have to use a word with a duplicate E or use available letters that are less common.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words with E at position2 and using only available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and no eliminated letters.

And avoid E in other positions? Or not? We can use E in other positions, but we know position4 and5 are not E for the secret? Not necessarily, but we have evidence that position4 and5 are not E? From previous feedback.

From guess1: E at5 is not correct (got -), so if there is only one E, then position5 is not E. Similarly, from guess2: E at4 is not correct (got -), so if only one E, position4 is not E. But if there are two E's, then position4 or5 could have the second E? But we don't know.

To be safe, we can choose a word that has E only at position2? Or we can use a word with E at2 and another position? But it might be inefficient.

But we have to make a guess.

Let's consider ""JEWEL"" again: J,E,W,E,L -> positions: J1, E2, W3, E4, L5. But E at4: we know from HOMES that when we put E at4, it was not correct, so if we put E at4 again, it will likely be x or -? But if the secret has a second E at4, it would be -? But we don't know.

But to avoid risk, let's try to find a word without E at4 or5.

Another word: ""LEVEE"" -> L,E,V,E,E -> E at2,4,5? But position4 and5 are E? We know position5 is not E? So not good.

""PEDES"" -> P,E,D,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VELES"" -> V,E,L,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WELLY"" -> W,E,L,L,Y -> no E elsewhere? W1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. So only E at2. And letters: W, E, L, L, Y. All available? W, L, Y are available. E is fixed.

So ""WELLY"" is a word? Meaning: a waterproof boot or to beat in a contest? Yes, it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""JELLY"" has J,E,L,L,Y -> only E at2? J1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. And J, L, Y available.

""KEVEL"" -> K,E,V,E,L -> E at2 and4? Avoid.

""PEWIT"" -> P,E,W,I,T -> I and T eliminated? Not.

""REWIN"" -> R and I and N eliminated? Not.

""SEWAN"" -> S eliminated? Not.

""TEWED"" -> T eliminated? Not.

""VEGAS"" -> V,E,G,A,S -> G, A, S eliminated? Not.

""VELLE"" -> not common.

""WEDEL"" -> W,E,D,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.

""XEBEC"" -> X,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.

""YECCH"" -> not common.

""ZEBUS"" -> Z,E,B,U,S -> B and S eliminated? Not.

So ""WELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are candidates.

Also, ""DEKKO"" -> D,E,K,K,O -> O eliminated? O(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""LEKKY"" -> not common.

""PEKOE"" -> P,E,K,O,E -> O eliminated and E at5? Not.

""TEKKE"" -> T eliminated? Not.

""VELUM"" -> V,E,L,U,M -> M eliminated? M(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""HELIX"" -> H eliminated? Not.

""FELID"" -> F,E,L,I,D -> I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes.

""KELPY"" -> K,E,L,P,Y -> only E at2? K1, E2, L3, P4, Y5. And K,L,P,Y available? Yes. ""KELPY"" is a word? Meaning: a type of seaweed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DELPY"" not common.

So we have:
- ""WELLY"": W,E,L,L,Y
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y
- ""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y

All have E at position2 and no other E.

We can choose one.

""WELLY"" has two L's, which might be good to test L.

Similarly, ""JELLY"" has two L's.

""KELPY"" has L and P.

Since L is common, it's good to test.

Also, Y is common at the end.

I think ""JELLY"" is a common word, so let's go with that.

But J is less common than W or K? But we have to use available letters.

Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" is not possible.

Another word: ""LEEKY"" -> L,E,E,K,Y -> E at2 and3? But we have two E's? And we don't know if we can have duplicate E? But it's allowed, but we are testing.

But in ""LEEKY"", E at3 might be redundant.

Stick with ""JELLY"".

So guess: JELLY

But let's confirm the letters: J, E, L, L, Y. E at position2. J, L, Y are available.

Eliminated letters are not used.

So I think it's fine.

<guess>JELLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- **Guess 3: BEING** → Feedback: B(x), E(✓), I(x), N(x), G(x)  
  - **Meaning**: B, I, N, G are **not in the word**. E is **correct and in position 2**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Position**: E is fixed in **position 2** of the secret word (from BEING feedback: E(✓)).
2. **Eliminated Letters (12 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"").
3. **Available Letters**: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ E _ _ _`, where:
   - Position 1: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 2: E (fixed).
   - Positions 3, 4, 5: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on **testing new common letters** from the available list (e.g., L, Y, D, F, P, K) to maximize information.
   - Avoid using E in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out for E, and position 2 is confirmed).
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency available letters (e.g., L, Y) and avoid rare letters (e.g., Q, X, Z) if possible.
   - Given the constraints, ""JELLY"" is a strong choice:
     - Uses E in position 2 (confirmed).
     - Tests new common letters: J (position 1), L (positions 3 and 4), Y (position 5).
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.
     - Provides feedback on L (if present, and its position) and Y (if present).

### Why ""JELLY""?
- **Word**: JELLY (J, E, L, L, Y).
- **Letter Coverage**:
  - **J**: Tested in position 1 (new letter).
  - **E**: Confirmed in position 2 (no need for feedback on E).
  - **L**: Tested in positions 3 and 4 (common consonant; duplicate L helps test for letter frequency).
  - **Y**: Tested in position 5 (common vowel-like letter, often at word ends).
- **Information Gain**:
  - Feedback will reveal if J, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.
  - If L is present, feedback will indicate if it is in position 3, 4, or both (or neither).
  - Further narrows down possibilities for positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

This guess efficiently tests multiple new letters while respecting the fixed E in position 2 and leveraging common English word patterns.",Guess 4: JELLY -> FEEDBACK: J(x) E(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good first word.
 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has unique letters and includes letters like A, E, I, O, R, S, T.

 After considering, a good starting word is ""CRATE"". It covers common vowels and consonants.

 However, note that we are allowed any 5-letter word. Another popular choice is ""ROAST"", but I think ""CRATE"" is solid.

 Let me check: C, R, A, T, E are all very common.

 But note: the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ : correct letter and position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 Our first guess: ""CRATE""

 Format: 
   We respond with: <guess> CRATE </guess>For the first guess, I want to maximize information by covering common vowels and consonants. ""CRATE"" is an effective opener because: 

- It contains three common vowels (A, E) and important consonants (C, R, T)
- All letters are unique, increasing coverage
- Frequent letters like R, T, and E help test key positions  

This will provide clear feedback on frequently used letters and position-based patterns for the secret word.

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""CRATE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
This means:
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (since marked x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (since marked with -)

Given this information:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we guessed E at the end and it was wrong).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or T.

For our next guess, we need:
- A 5-letter word that includes E (but not in the fifth position).
- It should not contain C, R, A, or T.
- We want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Possible letters to include: Since E is present, we can try to put E in different positions to locate it.

We also have many letters eliminated: C, R, A, T are out. So we avoid those.

Common letters not used yet: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Given E is not in the last position, let's try to put E in the first or middle positions to test.

Also, since only E was found and four letters are eliminated, the word likely has less common letters or a different set.

A good strategy is to use a word with E in a different position and include new common letters.

For example, position of E: Our first guess had E at the 5th position, so it must be in positions 1-4.

We can try putting E at the beginning? But let's consider other possibilities.

Possible words: How about ""SPINE""? But that has T? Wait, no T allowed? Wait, no we cannot have T because T is eliminated. Feedback T(x) means no T.

So words without: C, R, A, T.

""SPINE"" has P, I, N, E, S? But what about the structure.

Better to think of words with E not at the end.

Examples:
- E in position 1: ELBOW, ECLIP? But ECLIP has C? C is eliminated. So not.

Let's generate words with E somewhere in positions 1-4 and without C,R,A,T.

Common possibilities:
- Words starting with S? Like SPEND, SPEED? But E at position 3 and 4? SPEED: S P E E D -> has two E's? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? Well, Wordle allows duplicates unless specified. But in this case, only one E known.

Actually, in the feedback: we have one E marked as present, but if the word has two E's, then we might see two E's getting feedback. But here only one - for E, so maybe the word has only one E? But note: the feedback only marks the E in the last position as -, but if we had another E in another position, it might be marked differently? But in our guess ""CRATE"" we have only one E.

So the secret word has at least one E.

Our next word should ideally have letters not guessed before, except for E.

We have to use E again.

We cannot use: C, R, A, T.

So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Focus on frequent ones: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, H, K, W.

Idea: Try a word with E in position 1? But finding words without A and T etc. is harder.

Position 1: E? Like ELDER? But L,D,E,R? R not allowed? R is eliminated.

We cannot use R.

So any word we choose must not contain R.

Position 2: E? Like DEUCE? But has C and E? C eliminated.

Another idea: Since E is not at position 5, try E at position 4 or position 1, etc.

Also, we need to cover new letters.

After elimination, common letters to try: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, P, M, B, H, Y, etc.

Let me list possible words: 
- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.

EERIE has R? Not allowed.

ELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn't E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.

But ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E's? That's fine.

But in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.

But let's not complicate. We can use words with multiple E's but it might confuse.

Focus on one E.

Better words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.

Another: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D's? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.

D position 1 and 5? E at 4.

But D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we'll get feedback accordingly.

But let's aim for unique letters? Unless it's necessary.

Ideal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.

Position possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.

We guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.

Try E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn't E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.

For new guess, let's avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

Similarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.

Words starting with E: E with letters from available.

E + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.

EDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.

Focus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.

Word with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn't be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn't help with finding the position of E.

We should put E in a position we haven't tested? We only know position 5 is not E.

So test position 1 to 4: let's choose to put E in position 1.

But let's say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.

But E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.

Since in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E's, but let's not assume.

But ELBOW has E only once.

Now, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.

Sounds good. But let's see.

Another possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.

Example: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn't E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it's not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.

Similarly, don't put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.

Prioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.

Common positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.

We can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.

Example word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.

So cannot have words with R.

Available letters only: without C,R,A,T.

So PRIDE not allowed because R.

Better words focusing on E at 4: 
""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.

""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.

C is eliminated so C should not be in.

""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.

""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.

""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.

Only when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.

""DODGE"": E at 5? 

Plenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.

Words with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.

""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.

Position 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.

Usually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.

""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.

Not working.

Consider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.

But S at5? Then E is at position4.

Perfect: it has E at position 4? We haven't tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.

Another word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.

Also, E at position 4.

But both HOMES and BIKES are possible.

We also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.

Available letters: best to use letters with high frequency.

S, O, N, I, H are common.

HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.

BIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.

Perhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.

Either way.

Since E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.

But we have a choice.

Another classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.

Not.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.

But I think HOMES is a common word.

HOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.

Similarly, the letter S is at position5.

Since in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.

And S has not been tested.

So let's go with HOMES.

But wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it's in another position? Then we know E is not at4.

Similarly for other letters.

This will give good information.

Other word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.

""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.

Perhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.

Not great.

""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.

Since WE decided HOMES might be solid.

Alternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.

But L,I,N,D are new.

Then HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.

I think ""HOMES"" is fine.

So our guess could be ""HOMES"".

But let's confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.

And feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.

Thus, next guess: HOMES.

Response: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>

In the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.

So.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.
- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.
- Consider positions for E that haven't been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

I selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:
- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).
- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.
- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).
- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).

This guess will provide feedback on E's position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.

<guess>HOMES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

So, the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. Also, C, R, A, T are absent.

Guess 2: HOMES
- H: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in HOMES)
- S: x (not in word)

Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, H, O, M, S are absent.

Now, we know the following:

Absent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S
Present letters: E (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since not 4 or 5)

We have used 9 unique letters that are absent (C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S) and one present (E). There are 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left to consider.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is present but we know it must be in positions 1,2,3)

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes E in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the available letters.

Also, since E is present and we know it's not at 4 or 5, we should try to place it in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. We haven't tested position 1, 2, or 3 for E yet.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters from the available list: B, D, F, G, I, L, N, P, U, Y (less common: J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z)

We can try to use a word with E at position 1, for example, to test that position.

Possible words with E at position 1 and using available letters:

- E at 1: e.g., ""E"", then next letters from available.

Examples:
- ""ELFIN"": E L F I N -> but L, F, I, N are available? Yes. But ""ELFIN"" is a word? Meaning: like an elf, or small and delicate. Valid.
- ""ENDOW"": E N D O W -> but O is eliminated? O is absent (from HOMES feedback: O(x)), so cannot use O. So not.
- ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L -> A is eliminated? A(x) from first guess, so not.
- ""EJECT"": E J E C T -> C and T eliminated? Yes, so not.

Better: ""ELVEN""? E L V E N -> V and N available? But V is less common, and we have two E's? We don't know if the secret has two E's, but it might. However, we are trying to get information.

But ""ELVEN"" might not be common.

""EDGED"": E D G E D -> two D's and two E's? Not ideal for information.

""EIDER"": E I D E R -> R eliminated? R(x) from first guess, so not.

""ENNUI"": E N N U I -> has two N's? But U and I available. Valid word? Yes, meaning boredom.

But we want to cover more common letters.

Another: ""PINEY""? But E at position 4? We want E at 1? ""PINEY"" is P,I,N,E,Y -> E at 4? But we are trying to test E at 1.

Let's focus on E at 1.

""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A eliminated? A(x) so not.

""EBONY"": E B O N Y -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""ELFIN"" seems okay: E L F I N.

But F and I? F is not extremely common, but possible.

""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.

""EDIFY"": E D I F Y -> D, I, F, Y available? Yes. ""EDIFY"" is a word, meaning to instruct or improve.

Similarly, ""ELUDE"": E L U D E -> E at 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is not E? So if we put E at 5, it might be x? But we are putting E at 1 and 5? The E at 5 might be marked x if the secret has only one E? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it's not there.

So ""ELUDE"" has E at 5, which we know is wrong, so it might be a waste? But it could help if there is a duplicate E? Unlikely.

Better to use a word with E only once and in position 1,2, or 3.

So ""EDIFY"": E at 1, then D, I, F, Y.

But Y at the end? Position 5.

Similarly, ""ENVOY"": E N V O Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EPOXY"": E P O X Y -> O eliminated? Not.

""EXIST"": E X I S T -> S and T eliminated? S(x) and T(x) so not.

""ELINT"": E L I N T -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""EDIFY"" or ""ELFIN"" are candidates.

What about E at position 2? We haven't tested that.

For example, words with E in position 2: like ""DEUCE""? But D E U C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""LEMON"": L E M O N -> M and O eliminated? M(x) and O(x) from HOMES, so not.

""BEING"": B E I N G -> E at position 2? B, I, N, G available? Yes. ""BEING"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> E at 2? F, I, G, N available? Yes.

""WEIRD"": W E I R D -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""HEIST"": H E I S T -> H and S eliminated? H(x) and S(x) so not.

""DEITY"": D E I T Y -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.

So ""BEING"" and ""FEIGN"" are possible.

E at position 3: words like ""AXIOM""? But A and O eliminated? Not.

""MEDIA"": M E D I A -> M and A eliminated? M(x) and A(x) so not.

""ODIUM"": O and M eliminated? Not.

""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E at position 3? B at1, E at2? ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5). So E at position 2? Not 3.

""BEGIN"" has E at position 2.

For E at position 3: ""ABIDE""? A eliminated? Not.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> A eliminated? Not.

""RADII"": R and A eliminated? Not.

""TOWEL"": T and O and E at 4? Not.

""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> E at position 3 and 4? But we are testing E at 3? And Q and U available? But E at 4? We know position 4 is not E? From HOMES feedback? In HOMES, E was at position 4 and got -, meaning E is not at 4? So if we put E at 4 again, it might be x or -? But we know it's not at 4, so avoid.

Similarly, position 5 we avoid.

So for E at position 3: ""OPINE"": O and E at 5? Not.

""URINE"": U R I N E -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.

""SPIEL"": S and E at 4? Not.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> no E? We need to include E.

""ADIEU"": A and E at 4? Not.

""JUMBO"": no E.

Perhaps ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> C eliminated? Not.

""FIELD"": F I E L D -> E at position 3? F at1, I2, E3, L4, D5. Yes, and letters F,I,E,L,D. F,I,L,D available? Yes. ""FIELD"" is a word.

Similarly, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same, E at 3.

""YIELD"": Y I E L D.

But W and Y are less common? But possible.

""FIEND"": F I E N D -> E at 3? F,I,E,N,D. N and D available.

""FIEND"" is a word.

Now, comparing:

- E at 1: ""EDIFY"" (E,D,I,F,Y) or ""ELFIN"" (E,L,F,I,N)
- E at 2: ""BEING"" (B,E,I,N,G) or ""FEIGN"" (F,E,I,G,N)
- E at 3: ""FIELD"" (F,I,E,L,D) or ""FIEND"" (F,I,E,N,D)

We need to choose one that covers more common letters and new information.

Since we have limited guesses left (4 tries remaining), we should maximize information.

Note that in ""BEING"", we have B,E,I,N,G — all new except E.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" has F,E,I,G,N.

""EDIFY"" has E,D,I,F,Y — includes Y which is less common.

""ELFIN"" has E,L,F,I,N.

""FIELD"" has F,I,E,L,D.

""FIEND"" has F,I,E,N,D.

Common letters: I, N, D, L, F, G, B are all reasonable.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

Also, we know E must be in 1,2, or 3, so by placing E at a specific position, we can test that position.

For example, if we put E at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly for other positions.

But we have three positions to test, and we can only test one at a time.

Perhaps start with E at position 1? Since it's a common starting position.

But let's see the frequency: E is common at the end, but we know it's not at 4 or 5, so beginning or middle.

In 5-letter words, E is common at position 1? Not as common as at the end, but still.

We can choose a word that has E at position 2, which is also common.

I think ""BEING"" is a good choice: it has common letters B,E,I,N,G. B and G are consonants, I is vowel, N is common.

""BEING"" places E at position 2.

If E is at position 2, we get ✓ for E. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Similarly, ""FEIGN"" is similar but with F instead of B.

B is more common than F? In English, B is more frequent than F? According to letter frequency, E is most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

But we have eliminated many common ones, so B and F are about the same? B is 19th, F is 14th? F is slightly more common? F is 14th, B is 19th in frequency? But in our available, we have to use what we have.

But ""BEING"" is a very common word, so I'll go with that.

Another option: ""DEIGN""? D E I G N -> E at 2? D,E,I,G,N. But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to do something unworthy.

But ""BEING"" is simpler.

I think ""BEING"" is fine.

So let's guess ""BEING"".

But in ""BEING"", we have E at position 2. If the secret has E at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B, I, N, G.

Now, if we get feedback that E is not at 2, then we can try E at 1 or 3 next.

Similarly, if any of B, I, N, G are present, we get feedback.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""BEING"" as the next guess.

<guess>BEING</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked as ""-"").

### Key Insights:
1. **Eliminated Letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
2. **Confirmed Present Letters**: E is in the word but **not in positions 4 or 5**. Therefore, E must be in **position 1, 2, or 3**.
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters not eliminated).
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3 (to test a new position for E).
   - Use **new common letters** to maximize information gain (e.g., B, I, N, G, D, L, F).
   - Avoid eliminated letters.
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., I, N, G, B) to increase chances of hits.

### Why ""BEING""?
- **Word**: BEING (B, E, I, N, G).
- **Placement of E**: E is in **position 2** (a new position to test, since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- **Letter Coverage**:
  - Tests **B** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **N** (position 4), and **G** (position 5)—all new, common letters.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S).
- **Information Gain**:
  - If E is in position 2, feedback will show ""✓"" for E, confirming its position.
  - If E is not in position 2, it must be in position 1 or 3 (narrowing possibilities).
  - Feedback on B, I, N, G will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for E while testing four new high-frequency letters.

<guess>BEING</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
Guess 3: BEING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HOMES -> H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").

Guess 3: BEING -> B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since we guessed E at position 2 and got ""✓"").
  - B, I, N, G are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the second position (position 2).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is confirmed at position 2, so we don't need to guess it again? Actually, we know it's fixed at position 2, so the word is _ E _ _ _

We have 5 positions: 
  Position 1: unknown, but not any eliminated letter.
  Position 2: E (fixed)
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: unknown

We need to form a word of the form ? E ? ? ? with the available letters.

Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to avoid the eliminated letters: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G.

Now, we need to choose a word that uses the available letters and has E in the second position.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but C is eliminated? C is in the eliminated list? Yes, from guess1: C(x). So not.
- ""LEVER"" -> R eliminated? R(x) from guess1. Also, L is available? But R is not.
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but we have two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in this case, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know from guess2 that E is not at position 4 (because in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning it's not there). So if we put E at position4, it would be wrong? But if the word has two E's, then it might be present? However, in the feedback for BEING, we only have one E (at position2) and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us if there are more E's. But in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was present (but wrong position), and in the second guess, E at position4 was present (but wrong position). That suggests that E might be only one? Or multiple? Actually, the feedback for E in CRATE was ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position5. Similarly, in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position4. Then in BEING, E at position2 got ""✓"", meaning it is at position2. So if there is only one E, then positions 4 and 5 cannot have E. But if there are two E's, then the other E could be at position1 or 3? But we haven't tested position1 or 3 for E? Actually, we haven't placed E at position1 or 3 yet.

But note: in the feedback for BEING, we have E at position2 correct, and the other letters (B,I,N,G) are absent. But we don't have any feedback about other positions for E? Because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So it's possible that there is another E? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should not assume there is only one E. But we know that position2 has E, and positions 4 and 5 do not have E? Not necessarily: we only know that when we guessed E at position4 and position5, it was not there at that time? But if there is a duplicate E, it could be at position4? However, in HOMES, we had E at position4 and it was marked ""-"", which means that either the secret word has E but not at position4, or if there is a duplicate, then one of the E's is at position2 (which we now know) and the other could be at position4? But then the feedback for HOMES would have shown two marks for E? But in HOMES, we only had one E? So if the secret has two E's, and we guess one E at position4, and the secret has E at position2 and say position3, then the feedback for HOMES would show one ""-"" for E (if the secret has two E's, but we only guessed one, then we get one mark). The feedback marks only the letters we guess? So if we guess one E and the secret has two E's, we only get one mark? Yes.

So it's possible that there is another E? But we don't have evidence.

However, to be efficient, we can assume for now that there is only one E? Or we can test? But we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in other positions to avoid confusion? But we are forced to have E at position2.

So for the next guess, we need to fill positions 1,3,4,5 with available letters.

Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word: [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] E [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z]

But we must avoid using eliminated letters.

Now, let's think of common words that fit.

Examples:
- ""DELLY"" -> not a word? 
- ""JELLY"" -> J,E,L,L,Y -> but L repeated? And J and Y available? But ""JELLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have E at position2? J at1, E at2, L at3, L at4, Y at5. But we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word? Also, we have to check if L is available? Yes, L is available.

But we have eliminated: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G. So L is available.

But in ""JELLY"", we have L at position3 and4? So if we guess, we might get feedback on L.

But is ""JELLY"" common? Yes.

Another: ""KELLY"" -> K,E,L,L,Y -> similar.

But K is available.

""DEUCE"" not because C eliminated.

""LEPER"" -> R eliminated? R is eliminated.

""PENNE"" -> but N eliminated? N(x) from BEING? Yes, N is eliminated? In BEING, N at position4 got x, so N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

Similarly, G is eliminated, I eliminated, etc.

So we cannot use N.

In ""JELLY"", we don't use any eliminated letters? J, E, L, L, Y. E is fixed at2, J, L, Y are available? But we have two L's? That's acceptable.

But let's see if there are words without duplicates.

""VELDT"" -> V,E,L,D,T -> but T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes, T eliminated.

""WELCH"" -> H eliminated? H(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""YELPS"" -> S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""ZEBRA"" -> Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? All three? Not.

""QUEUE"" -> Q,U,E,U,E -> E at position2 and5? But we know position5 cannot have E? Because in CRATE, E at5 was marked ""-"", meaning E is not at5. So if we put E at5, it would be wrong? But if there is a duplicate, it might be marked? But we know E is at2, so position5 should not be E? So ""QUEUE"" has E at5, which we know is incorrect? So it would be marked x? Then we waste a letter.

So avoid putting E at positions we know it's not? So avoid position4 and5 for E? But in our pattern, we are not putting E at4 or5? In the word we form, we have E at2, and other positions are non-E? But we can use E again? But we don't have to.

To avoid confusion, we can avoid using E in other positions? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But for now, let's try to use a word without E in other positions.

So for positions 1,3,4,5: use non-E letters from available.

Available non-E letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, common words with E at2:

- ""LEVY"": but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DEVIL"": D,E,V,I,L -> but I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes, I is eliminated? In BEING, I at position3 got x, so I not in word? So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I and N eliminated? Not.

""PECKY"": P,E,C,K,Y -> C eliminated? Not.

""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> has E at position2 and4? But we know position4 is not E? From HOMES? So if we put E at4, it might be x? But if the secret has only one E, then E at4 would be x. If two, then it might be -? But we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid putting E at4.

So ""JEWEL"" has E at4, which we suspect is not correct.

Similarly, ""NEWEL"": N,E,W,E,L -> N eliminated and E at4? Not.

""REWET"": R and E at4? Not.

""HEWER"": H and E at4? Not.

So let's avoid E at4.

What about ""LEVER""? R eliminated? Not.

""BEVEL"": B eliminated? B(x) from BEING? Yes.

""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.

""FEVER"": F,E,V,E,R -> R eliminated? Not.

""JETTY"": J,E,T,T,Y -> T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes.

""KEDGE"": K,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated? G(x) from BEING? Yes, and E at5? Avoid.

""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated and E at5? Not.

""WEDGY"": W,E,D,G,Y -> G eliminated? Not.

""PEDAL"": P,E,D,A,L -> A eliminated? A(x) from CRATE? Yes.

""MEDIA"": M and A eliminated? Not.

So it's hard.

Another idea: ""YELP"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""YELPS"" is 5, but S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""ZEXES"": Z,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated and E at4? Not.

""LEXIS"": L,E,X,I,S -> I and S eliminated? Not.

""JUMPS"": J,U,M,P,S -> M and S eliminated? Not.

Perhaps we need to use less common letters.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> E at4? Avoid.

""WEXED"": not common.

""YEXED"": not common.

""JUKED"": J,U,K,E,D -> E at4? In ""JUKED"", positions: J1, U2? No, we need E at2. So ""JUKED"" has U at2? Not E.

We need E at2.

So the word must have the second letter E.

How about ""DEBYE""? D,E,B,Y,E -> B eliminated and E at5? Not.

""DEFY"" is 4 letters.

""DELAY"": D,E,L,A,Y -> A eliminated? Not.

""DELFT"": D,E,L,F,T -> T eliminated? Not.

""DELPH"": D,E,L,P,H -> H eliminated? Not.

""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> E at5? Avoid.

""DEMUR"": D,E,M,U,R -> M and R eliminated? Not.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> N, I, M eliminated? All? Not.

""DEPOT"": D,E,P,O,T -> O and T eliminated? Not.

""DEPTH"": D,E,P,T,H -> T and H eliminated? Not.

""DEUCE"": C eliminated? Not.

""DEVON"": D,E,V,O,N -> O and N eliminated? Not.

""DEWAX"": D,E,W,A,X -> A eliminated? Not.

""DEWED"": D,E,W,E,D -> E at4? Avoid.

""DEXES"": D,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated and E at4? Not.

""JEEPS"": J,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated and E at1? We have E at2? ""JEEPS"": J1, E2, E3, P4, S5. So E at2 and3? But we have two E's? And S eliminated? Not.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""LEEPS"": not common.

""PEEPS"": P,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEEPS"": V,E,E,P,S -> S eliminated? Not.

We are struggling.

Another approach: use L, which is common.

""LEEKS"": L,E,E,K,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""LEETS"": L,E,E,T,S -> T and S eliminated? Not.

""LEEZY"": not common.

""LEZZY"": not common.

""LYCEA"": L,Y,C,E,A -> C and A eliminated? Not.

Perhaps ""QUEEN"" but N eliminated and E at4? Not.

""QUEER"": R eliminated? Not.

""QUEYS"": Q,U,E,Y,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VEENA"": V,E,E,N,A -> N and A eliminated? Not.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""ZEBEC"": Z,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.

""ZEBRA"": Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? Not.

""ZERKS"": Z,E,R,K,S -> R and S eliminated? Not.

""ZILLA"": Z,I,L,L,A -> I and A eliminated? Not.

This is difficult. We need to use less common letters or accept that we might have to use a word with a duplicate E or use available letters that are less common.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words with E at position2 and using only available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and no eliminated letters.

And avoid E in other positions? Or not? We can use E in other positions, but we know position4 and5 are not E for the secret? Not necessarily, but we have evidence that position4 and5 are not E? From previous feedback.

From guess1: E at5 is not correct (got -), so if there is only one E, then position5 is not E. Similarly, from guess2: E at4 is not correct (got -), so if only one E, position4 is not E. But if there are two E's, then position4 or5 could have the second E? But we don't know.

To be safe, we can choose a word that has E only at position2? Or we can use a word with E at2 and another position? But it might be inefficient.

But we have to make a guess.

Let's consider ""JEWEL"" again: J,E,W,E,L -> positions: J1, E2, W3, E4, L5. But E at4: we know from HOMES that when we put E at4, it was not correct, so if we put E at4 again, it will likely be x or -? But if the secret has a second E at4, it would be -? But we don't know.

But to avoid risk, let's try to find a word without E at4 or5.

Another word: ""LEVEE"" -> L,E,V,E,E -> E at2,4,5? But position4 and5 are E? We know position5 is not E? So not good.

""PEDES"" -> P,E,D,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""VELES"" -> V,E,L,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.

""WELLY"" -> W,E,L,L,Y -> no E elsewhere? W1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. So only E at2. And letters: W, E, L, L, Y. All available? W, L, Y are available. E is fixed.

So ""WELLY"" is a word? Meaning: a waterproof boot or to beat in a contest? Yes, it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""JELLY"" has J,E,L,L,Y -> only E at2? J1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. And J, L, Y available.

""KEVEL"" -> K,E,V,E,L -> E at2 and4? Avoid.

""PEWIT"" -> P,E,W,I,T -> I and T eliminated? Not.

""REWIN"" -> R and I and N eliminated? Not.

""SEWAN"" -> S eliminated? Not.

""TEWED"" -> T eliminated? Not.

""VEGAS"" -> V,E,G,A,S -> G, A, S eliminated? Not.

""VELLE"" -> not common.

""WEDEL"" -> W,E,D,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.

""XEBEC"" -> X,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.

""YECCH"" -> not common.

""ZEBUS"" -> Z,E,B,U,S -> B and S eliminated? Not.

So ""WELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are candidates.

Also, ""DEKKO"" -> D,E,K,K,O -> O eliminated? O(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""LEKKY"" -> not common.

""PEKOE"" -> P,E,K,O,E -> O eliminated and E at5? Not.

""TEKKE"" -> T eliminated? Not.

""VELUM"" -> V,E,L,U,M -> M eliminated? M(x) from HOMES? Yes.

""HELIX"" -> H eliminated? Not.

""FELID"" -> F,E,L,I,D -> I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes.

""KELPY"" -> K,E,L,P,Y -> only E at2? K1, E2, L3, P4, Y5. And K,L,P,Y available? Yes. ""KELPY"" is a word? Meaning: a type of seaweed? Yes.

Similarly, ""DELPY"" not common.

So we have:
- ""WELLY"": W,E,L,L,Y
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y
- ""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y

All have E at position2 and no other E.

We can choose one.

""WELLY"" has two L's, which might be good to test L.

Similarly, ""JELLY"" has two L's.

""KELPY"" has L and P.

Since L is common, it's good to test.

Also, Y is common at the end.

I think ""JELLY"" is a common word, so let's go with that.

But J is less common than W or K? But we have to use available letters.

Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" is not possible.

Another word: ""LEEKY"" -> L,E,E,K,Y -> E at2 and3? But we have two E's? And we don't know if we can have duplicate E? But it's allowed, but we are testing.

But in ""LEEKY"", E at3 might be redundant.

Stick with ""JELLY"".

So guess: JELLY

But let's confirm the letters: J, E, L, L, Y. E at position2. J, L, Y are available.

Eliminated letters are not used.

So I think it's fine.

<guess>JELLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- **Guess 3: BEING** → Feedback: B(x), E(✓), I(x), N(x), G(x)  
  - **Meaning**: B, I, N, G are **not in the word**. E is **correct and in position 2**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Position**: E is fixed in **position 2** of the secret word (from BEING feedback: E(✓)).
2. **Eliminated Letters (12 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"").
3. **Available Letters**: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ E _ _ _`, where:
   - Position 1: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 2: E (fixed).
   - Positions 3, 4, 5: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on **testing new common letters** from the available list (e.g., L, Y, D, F, P, K) to maximize information.
   - Avoid using E in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out for E, and position 2 is confirmed).
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency available letters (e.g., L, Y) and avoid rare letters (e.g., Q, X, Z) if possible.
   - Given the constraints, ""JELLY"" is a strong choice:
     - Uses E in position 2 (confirmed).
     - Tests new common letters: J (position 1), L (positions 3 and 4), Y (position 5).
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.
     - Provides feedback on L (if present, and its position) and Y (if present).

### Why ""JELLY""?
- **Word**: JELLY (J, E, L, L, Y).
- **Letter Coverage**:
  - **J**: Tested in position 1 (new letter).
  - **E**: Confirmed in position 2 (no need for feedback on E).
  - **L**: Tested in positions 3 and 4 (common consonant; duplicate L helps test for letter frequency).
  - **Y**: Tested in position 5 (common vowel-like letter, often at word ends).
- **Information Gain**:
  - Feedback will reveal if J, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.
  - If L is present, feedback will indicate if it is in position 3, 4, or both (or neither).
  - Further narrows down possibilities for positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.

This guess efficiently tests multiple new letters while respecting the fixed E in position 2 and leveraging common English word patterns.

So we avoid those.\n\nCommon letters not used yet: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.\n\nGiven E is not in the last position, let\'s try to put E in the first or middle positions to test.\n\nAlso, since only E was found and four letters are eliminated, the word likely has less common letters or a different set.\n\nA good strategy is to use a word with E in a different position and include new common letters.\n\nFor example, position of E: Our first guess had E at the 5th position, so it must be in positions 1-4.\n\nWe can try putting E at the beginning? But let\'s consider other possibilities.\n\nPossible words: How about ""SPINE""? But that has T? Wait, no T allowed? Wait, no we cannot have T because T is eliminated. Feedback T(x) means no T.\n\nSo words without: C, R, A, T.\n\n""SPINE"" has P, I, N, E, S? But what about the structure.\n\nBetter to think of words with E not at the end.\n\nExamples:\n- E in position 1: ELBOW, ECLIP? But ECLIP has C? C is eliminated. So not.\n\nLet\'s generate words with E somewhere in positions 1-4 and without C,R,A,T.\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- Words starting with S? Like SPEND, SPEED? But E at position 3 and 4? SPEED: S P E E D -> has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? Well, Wordle allows duplicates unless specified. But in this case, only one E known.\n\nActually, in the feedback: we have one E marked as present, but if the word has two E\'s, then we might see two E\'s getting feedback. But here only one - for E, so maybe the word has only one E? But note: the feedback only marks the E in the last position as -, but if we had another E in another position, it might be marked differently? But in our guess ""CRATE"" we have only one E.\n\nSo the secret word has at least one E.\n\nOur next word should ideally have letters not guessed before, except for E.\n\nWe have to use E again.\n\nWe cannot use: C, R, A, T.\n\nSo available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFocus on frequent ones: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, H, K, W.\n\nIdea: Try a word with E in position 1? But finding words without A and T etc. is harder.\n\nPosition 1: E? Like ELDER? But L,D,E,R? R not allowed? R is eliminated.\n\nWe cannot use R.\n\nSo any word we choose must not contain R.\n\nPosition 2: E? Like DEUCE? But has C and E? C eliminated.\n\nAnother idea: Since E is not at position 5, try E at position 4 or position 1, etc.\n\nAlso, we need to cover new letters.\n\nAfter elimination, common letters to try: S, O, N, I, L, D, U, P, M, B, H, Y, etc.\n\nLet me list possible words: \n- E at pos 1: E, but then the next letter. Without A? Examples: EERIE? But E at end? We guess E at pos 1 and 5? But we have E already? And R eliminated.\n\nEERIE has R? Not allowed.\n\nELOPE: E L O P E -> E at 1 and 5? But E at 5 is the same as before? We know position 5 isn\'t E. And O and L? Also, T eliminated? Wait, no T in ELOPE.\n\nBut ELOPE: E L O P E -> letters E,L,O,P. Avoided C,R,A,T. But we have two E\'s? That\'s fine.\n\nBut in feedback, if the secret has E only once, then placing E at position 1 and 5 might show one - and one x? But we know E is present, so one of them will match.\n\nBut let\'s not complicate. We can use words with multiple E\'s but it might confuse.\n\nFocus on one E.\n\nBetter words: How about ""OUNCE""? No C? C is eliminated? OUNCE has C? So not. Spell? O U N C E -> C at position 4? Eliminated. C(x) so no C.\n\nAnother: ""DINED""? D I N E D -> two D\'s? Without R,A,T? And E at position 4.\n\nD position 1 and 5? E at 4.\n\nBut D might not be duplicated? If secret has one D, we\'ll get feedback accordingly.\n\nBut let\'s aim for unique letters? Unless it\'s necessary.\n\nIdeal: Use a word with many new letters and one E in a new position.\n\nPosition possibilities for E: 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe guessed pos 5: wrong, so E is not at 5.\n\nTry E at position 1: words like ENSUE, but N S U E? S,U,N,E? But E at end? We know end isn\'t E? In the guess, if we put E at end, but we already tried? If the secret word has E at end, our first guess would have shown E(✓) or at least -? But it showed E(-) for pos 5, meaning E is present but not at 5. So E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nFor new guess, let\'s avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, placing E at position 1: is possible.\n\nWords starting with E: E with letters from available.\n\nE + S? ESILE? Not common? ESILE is not a common word. Better to use common words only.\n\nEDIFY? E D I F Y? F and Y less common? But possible. Lacks common letters.\n\nFocus on S: words starting with S? Like SPIEL, SKIMP? But SKIMP lacks E? We need to include E.\n\nWord with E and common consonants: how about ""SLOPE""? S L O P E? E repeated at end? But E is at position 5? We know position 5 shouldn\'t be E? But in SLOPE we are putting E again at end? Why? That wouldn\'t help with finding the position of E.\n\nWe should put E in a position we haven\'t tested? We only know position 5 is not E.\n\nSo test position 1 to 4: let\'s choose to put E in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s say ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> E at 1, includes L,B,O,W. No C,R,A,T? Check: L,B,O,W none eliminated? Eliminated were only C,R,A,T. So fine? But ""ELBOW"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut E at position 1 might help: if E is at 1, feedback will show ✓ for position 1. If not, then - or something else.\n\nSince in first guess E was present but wrong position, if in ELBOW E at position 1 is correct, we get ✓. If not, then E must be in pos 2,3,4 and position 1 wrong? Then E at position 1 might be marked x? But E is in the word, so it would be marked - if E is elsewhere? Unless duplicate E\'s, but let\'s not assume.\n\nBut ELBOW has E only once.\n\nNow, ELBOW: letters E,L,B,O,W. All new except E.\n\nSounds good. But let\'s see.\n\nAnother possibility: E at position 4: include other letters.\n\nExample: ""GUIDE""? G U I D E -> E at end? We know end isn\'t E? But position 5: we avoid? Because we already got E(-) for position 5? That means E is not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again will likely be x or -? But if the word has only one E and it\'s not 5, putting E at 5 will result in x? Unless there is duplicate E? We don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid position 5 for E? Focus on positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, don\'t put E at position 2? But we can test all positions except 5.\n\nPrioritize positions 1 and 4? Since 3 might be common.\n\nCommon positions: E often at end, but now end not possible? So positions 3 or 4 might be frequent.\n\nWe can put E at position 4: guess with E at 4.\n\nExample word: ""PRIDE""? But P R I D E -> has R? R not allowed? Eliminated in first guess? R(x) meaning no R.\n\nSo cannot have words with R.\n\nAvailable letters only: without C,R,A,T.\n\nSo PRIDE not allowed because R.\n\nBetter words focusing on E at 4: \n""SAINT""? Has A T? A and T are eliminated? ""SAINT"": S, A, I, N, T? All except S,I,N have A and T? A and T must not be present, so invalid.\n\n""QUICK""? Has Q,U,I,C,K? C eliminated? Yes? No C.\n\nC is eliminated so C should not be in.\n\n""OLIVE""? O L I V E? E at 5? Position 5? Avoid.\n\n""ABIDE""? Has A? Eliminated? No, A not allowed.\n\n""MOVIE""? M O V I E? E at position 5? Again.\n\nOnly when E is at 4? Like ""LODGE"": L O D G E -> E at 5.\n\n""DODGE"": E at 5? \n\nPlenty of words with E at 5? But we want E at 4? How about an example: ""BULGE"" -> E at 5.\n\nWords with E at position 4: Often ending with GE or SE? Like ""PURGE""? But P U R G E -> has R? Not allowed.\n\n""PLUME"": P L U M E -> E at 5? Not 4.\n\nPosition 4: ""IMAGE""? I M A G E? A eliminated? A(x) so no A.\n\n""OXIDE""? O X I D E? Position 4? E at 5? D at 4, E at 5.\n\nUsually E is last? But we need E at position 4? In a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nPosition 4: for example ""DIVER"" -> D at1, I2, V3, E4, R5? But R5? R not allowed? And R eliminated.\n\n""TIMER"": T,I,M,E,R? T and R eliminated? No.\n\nNot working.\n\nConsider: ""HOUSE""? H at1, O2, U3, S4, E5? E at5, but we avoid position 5? Similarly, ""HOMES"": H O M E S -> E at4? Here, position 4 is E? So ""HOMES"": positions: H-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, S-5.\n\nBut S at5? Then E is at position4.\n\nPerfect: it has E at position 4? We haven\'t tested position4 before? And avoids eliminated letters: letters in HOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Do any of these conflict? Not C,R,A,T? So okay.\n\nAnother word: ""BIKES"": B I K E S, E at position 4? Position: 1-B, 2-I, 3-K, 4-E, 5-S.\n\nAlso, E at position 4.\n\nBut both HOMES and BIKES are possible.\n\nWe also need to consider other letters: after first guess, eliminated are C,R,A,T.\n\nAvailable letters: best to use letters with high frequency.\n\nS, O, N, I, H are common.\n\nHOMES: H,O,M,E,S. Includes O and S and H? Good.\n\nBIKES: B,I,K,E,S. Includes S and I? Also good.\n\nPerhaps HOMES? Or maybe ""POSED"": P O S E D? E at position 4? P,O,S,E,D? Possible? But then we have E at4 and D at5.\n\nEither way.\n\nSince E must be in position 1-4 and we guessed at5 wrong, we can test E at4 with HOMES.\n\nBut we have a choice.\n\nAnother classic: ""QUERY""? But has Q,U,E,R,Y? R not allowed? R eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""PIKED""? P I K E D? E at4? Okay.\n\nBut I think HOMES is a common word.\n\nHOMES: avoids C,R,A,T. Gets E at position4? And tests new letters H,O,M,S.\n\nSimilarly, the letter S is at position5.\n\nSince in the first guess, we had a word that ended with E, now we end with S? Which is fine.\n\nAnd S has not been tested.\n\nSo let\'s go with HOMES.\n\nBut wait: will the feedback show the E? We know E must be present, but if in HOMES we put E at position4, and the secret word has E at position4, it will be ✓. If elsewhere, then E might be marked - if it\'s in another position? Then we know E is not at4.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nThis will give good information.\n\nOther word: we could try E at position1? Like ""EGGED""? E G G E D? Has duplicates? Not efficient.\n\n""ENTER""? E N T E R? But T and R eliminated? Not.\n\n""BEGIN""? B E G I N? E at position2? Avoid.\n\nPerhaps E at position1: ""EJECT""? But has J,C? C eliminated.\n\nNot great.\n\n""EMBED""? E M B E D? E at1 and E at4? Then letters E,M,B,D. Also possible? But B and D not very common? But okay.\n\nSince WE decided HOMES might be solid.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""LINED""? L I N E D? E at4? But N at3? And avoids R,A,T,C? Yes: L,I,N,E,D. All new except E.\n\nBut L,I,N,D are new.\n\nThen HOMES: H,O,M,E,S? Both good.\n\nI think ""HOMES"" is fine.\n\nSo our guess could be ""HOMES"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: H O M E S – five letters, common English word.\n\nAnd feedback from first guess: no C,R,A,T, so safe.\n\nThus, next guess: HOMES.\n\nResponse: formatted as <guess>HOMES</guess>\n\nIn the response format, we need to think step by step? We did.\n\nSo.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":\n- C, R, A, T are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include the letter E (since it is confirmed present), but not in the fifth position.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or T, as they are eliminated.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information about the secret word.\n- Consider positions for E that haven\'t been tested—positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).\n\nI selected ""HOMES"" as the guess because:\n- It places E in position 4 (testing a new position).\n- It uses new common letters: H, O, M, S.\n- All letters (H, O, M, E, S) are available (no C, R, A, T).\n- ""HOMES"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of common consonants (H, M, S) and a common vowel (O).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on E\'s position and test whether H, O, M, or S are part of the secret word and in which positions.\n\n<guess>HOMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRATE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nSo, the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. Also, C, R, A, T are absent.\n\nGuess 2: HOMES\n- H: x (not in word)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- M: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in HOMES)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has E, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, H, O, M, S are absent.\n\nNow, we know the following:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S\nPresent letters: E (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since not 4 or 5)\n\nWe have used 9 unique letters that are absent (C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S) and one present (E). There are 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left to consider.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is present but we know it must be in positions 1,2,3)\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes E in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3, and uses only the available letters.\n\nAlso, since E is present and we know it\'s not at 4 or 5, we should try to place it in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. We haven\'t tested position 1, 2, or 3 for E yet.\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.\n\nCommon letters from the available list: B, D, F, G, I, L, N, P, U, Y (less common: J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z)\n\nWe can try to use a word with E at position 1, for example, to test that position.\n\nPossible words with E at position 1 and using available letters:\n\n- E at 1: e.g., ""E"", then next letters from available.\n\nExamples:\n- ""ELFIN"": E L F I N -> but L, F, I, N are available? Yes. But ""ELFIN"" is a word? Meaning: like an elf, or small and delicate. Valid.\n- ""ENDOW"": E N D O W -> but O is eliminated? O is absent (from HOMES feedback: O(x)), so cannot use O. So not.\n- ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L -> A is eliminated? A(x) from first guess, so not.\n- ""EJECT"": E J E C T -> C and T eliminated? Yes, so not.\n\nBetter: ""ELVEN""? E L V E N -> V and N available? But V is less common, and we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the secret has two E\'s, but it might. However, we are trying to get information.\n\nBut ""ELVEN"" might not be common.\n\n""EDGED"": E D G E D -> two D\'s and two E\'s? Not ideal for information.\n\n""EIDER"": E I D E R -> R eliminated? R(x) from first guess, so not.\n\n""ENNUI"": E N N U I -> has two N\'s? But U and I available. Valid word? Yes, meaning boredom.\n\nBut we want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother: ""PINEY""? But E at position 4? We want E at 1? ""PINEY"" is P,I,N,E,Y -> E at 4? But we are trying to test E at 1.\n\nLet\'s focus on E at 1.\n\n""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A eliminated? A(x) so not.\n\n""EBONY"": E B O N Y -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.\n\n""ELFIN"" seems okay: E L F I N.\n\nBut F and I? F is not extremely common, but possible.\n\n""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> O eliminated? O(x) so not.\n\n""EDIFY"": E D I F Y -> D, I, F, Y available? Yes. ""EDIFY"" is a word, meaning to instruct or improve.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELUDE"": E L U D E -> E at 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is not E? So if we put E at 5, it might be x? But we are putting E at 1 and 5? The E at 5 might be marked x if the secret has only one E? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E at position 5 again? Since we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo ""ELUDE"" has E at 5, which we know is wrong, so it might be a waste? But it could help if there is a duplicate E? Unlikely.\n\nBetter to use a word with E only once and in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo ""EDIFY"": E at 1, then D, I, F, Y.\n\nBut Y at the end? Position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""ENVOY"": E N V O Y -> O eliminated? Not.\n\n""EPOXY"": E P O X Y -> O eliminated? Not.\n\n""EXIST"": E X I S T -> S and T eliminated? S(x) and T(x) so not.\n\n""ELINT"": E L I N T -> T eliminated? T(x) so not.\n\nSo ""EDIFY"" or ""ELFIN"" are candidates.\n\nWhat about E at position 2? We haven\'t tested that.\n\nFor example, words with E in position 2: like ""DEUCE""? But D E U C E -> C eliminated? Not.\n\n""LEMON"": L E M O N -> M and O eliminated? M(x) and O(x) from HOMES, so not.\n\n""BEING"": B E I N G -> E at position 2? B, I, N, G available? Yes. ""BEING"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> E at 2?

Not.\n\n""TOWEL"": T and O and E at 4? Not.\n\n""QUEEN"": Q U E E N -> E at position 3 and 4? But we are testing E at 3? And Q and U available? But E at 4? We know position 4 is not E? From HOMES feedback? In HOMES, E was at position 4 and got -, meaning E is not at 4? So if we put E at 4 again, it might be x or -? But we know it\'s not at 4, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 we avoid.\n\nSo for E at position 3: ""OPINE"": O and E at 5? Not.\n\n""URINE"": U R I N E -> R eliminated? R(x) so not.\n\n""SPIEL"": S and E at 4? Not.\n\n""GUILD"": G U I L D -> no E? We need to include E.\n\n""ADIEU"": A and E at 4? Not.\n\n""JUMBO"": no E.\n\nPerhaps ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> C eliminated? Not.\n\n""FIELD"": F I E L D -> E at position 3? F at1, I2, E3, L4, D5. Yes, and letters F,I,E,L,D. F,I,L,D available? Yes. ""FIELD"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same, E at 3.\n\n""YIELD"": Y I E L D.\n\nBut W and Y are less common? But possible.\n\n""FIEND"": F I E N D -> E at 3? F,I,E,N,D. N and D available.\n\n""FIEND"" is a word.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\n- E at 1: ""EDIFY"" (E,D,I,F,Y) or ""ELFIN"" (E,L,F,I,N)\n- E at 2: ""BEING"" (B,E,I,N,G) or ""FEIGN"" (F,E,I,G,N)\n- E at 3: ""FIELD"" (F,I,E,L,D) or ""FIEND"" (F,I,E,N,D)\n\nWe need to choose one that covers more common letters and new information.\n\nSince we have limited guesses left (4 tries remaining), we should maximize information.\n\nNote that in ""BEING"", we have B,E,I,N,G — all new except E.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEIGN"" has F,E,I,G,N.\n\n""EDIFY"" has E,D,I,F,Y — includes Y which is less common.\n\n""ELFIN"" has E,L,F,I,N.\n\n""FIELD"" has F,I,E,L,D.\n\n""FIEND"" has F,I,E,N,D.\n\nCommon letters: I, N, D, L, F, G, B are all reasonable.\n\nBut we have to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nAlso, we know E must be in 1,2, or 3, so by placing E at a specific position, we can test that position.\n\nFor example, if we put E at position 1 and it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, then E must be in 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut we have three positions to test, and we can only test one at a time.\n\nPerhaps start with E at position 1? Since it\'s a common starting position.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: E is common at the end, but we know it\'s not at 4 or 5, so beginning or middle.\n\nIn 5-letter words, E is common at position 1? Not as common as at the end, but still.\n\nWe can choose a word that has E at position 2, which is also common.\n\nI think ""BEING"" is a good choice: it has common letters B,E,I,N,G. B and G are consonants, I is vowel, N is common.\n\n""BEING"" places E at position 2.\n\nIf E is at position 2, we get ✓ for E. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, we test B, I, N, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""FEIGN"" is similar but with F instead of B.\n\nB is more common than F? In English, B is more frequent than F? According to letter frequency, E is most common, then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.\n\nBut we have eliminated many common ones, so B and F are about the same? B is 19th, F is 14th? F is slightly more common? F is 14th, B is 19th in frequency? But in our available, we have to use what we have.\n\nBut ""BEING"" is a very common word, so I\'ll go with that.\n\nAnother option: ""DEIGN""? D E I G N -> E at 2? D,E,I,G,N. But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to do something unworthy.\n\nBut ""BEING"" is simpler.\n\nI think ""BEING"" is fine.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""BEING"".\n\nBut in ""BEING"", we have E at position 2. If the secret has E at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, then we know E is at 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, we test B, I, N, G.\n\nNow, if we get feedback that E is not at 2, then we can try E at 1 or 3 next.\n\nSimilarly, if any of B, I, N, G are present, we get feedback.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BEING"" as the next guess.\n\n<guess>BEING</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  \n  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n- **Guess 2: HOMES** → Feedback: H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  \n  - **Meaning**: H, O, M, S are **not in the word**. E is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked as ""-"").\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Eliminated Letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n2. **Confirmed Present Letters**: E is in the word but **not in positions 4 or 5**. Therefore, E must be in **position 1, 2, or 3**.\n3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters not eliminated).\n4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Must include **E** in position 1, 2, or 3 (to test a new position for E).\n   - Use **new common letters** to maximize information gain (e.g., B, I, N, G, D, L, F).\n   - Avoid eliminated letters.\n   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., I, N, G, B) to increase chances of hits.\n\n### Why ""BEING""?\n- **Word**: BEING (B, E, I, N, G).\n- **Placement of E**: E is in **position 2** (a new position to test, since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).\n- **Letter Coverage**:\n  - Tests **B** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **N** (position 4), and **G** (position 5)—all new, common letters.\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S).\n- **Information Gain**:\n  - If E is in position 2, feedback will show ""✓"" for E, confirming its position.\n  - If E is not in position 2, it must be in position 1 or 3 (narrowing possibilities).\n  - Feedback on B, I, N, G will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for E while testing four new high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>BEING</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HOMES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: BEING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: HOMES -> H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").\n\nGuess 3: BEING -> B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, position 2 (since we guessed E at position 2 and got ""✓"").\n  - B, I, N, G are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has E in the second position (position 2).\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n- Available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is confirmed at position 2, so we don\'t need to guess it again? Actually, we know it\'s fixed at position 2, so the word is _ E _ _ _\n\nWe have 5 positions: \n  Position 1: unknown, but not any eliminated letter.\n  Position 2: E (fixed)\n  Position 3: unknown\n  Position 4: unknown\n  Position 5: unknown\n\nWe need to form a word of the form ? E ? ? ? with the available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe have to avoid the eliminated letters: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that uses the available letters and has E in the second position.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit this pattern.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DEUCE"" -> but C is eliminated? C is in the eliminated list? Yes, from guess1: C(x). So not.\n- ""LEVER"" -> R eliminated? R(x) from guess1. Also, L is available? But R is not.\n- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But in this case, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know from guess2 that E is not at position 4 (because in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning it\'s not there). So if we put E at position4, it would be wrong? But if the word has two E\'s, then it might be present? However, in the feedback for BEING, we only have one E (at position2) and it was correct, but that doesn\'t tell us if there are more E\'s. But in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was present (but wrong position), and in the second guess, E at position4 was present (but wrong position). That suggests that E might be only one? Or multiple? Actually, the feedback for E in CRATE was ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position5. Similarly, in HOMES, E at position4 got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position4. Then in BEING, E at position2 got ""✓"", meaning it is at position2. So if there is only one E, then positions 4 and 5 cannot have E. But if there are two E\'s, then the other E could be at position1 or 3? But we haven\'t tested position1 or 3 for E? Actually, we haven\'t placed E at position1 or 3 yet.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for BEING, we have E at position2 correct, and the other letters (B,I,N,G) are absent. But we don\'t have any feedback about other positions for E? Because we didn\'t put E elsewhere.\n\nSo it\'s possible that there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should not assume there is only one E. But we know that position2 has E, and positions 4 and 5 do not have E? Not necessarily: we only know that when we guessed E at position4 and position5, it was not there at that time? But if there is a duplicate E, it could be at position4? However, in HOMES, we had E at position4 and it was marked ""-"", which means that either the secret word has E but not at position4, or if there is a duplicate, then one of the E\'s is at position2 (which we now know) and the other could be at position4? But then the feedback for HOMES would have shown two marks for E? But in HOMES, we only had one E? So if the secret has two E\'s, and we guess one E at position4, and the secret has E at position2 and say position3, then the feedback for HOMES would show one ""-"" for E (if the secret has two E\'s, but we only guessed one, then we get one mark). The feedback marks only the letters we guess? So if we guess one E and the secret has two E\'s, we only get one mark? Yes.\n\nSo it\'s possible that there is another E? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nHowever, to be efficient, we can assume for now that there is only one E? Or we can test? But we have limited guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have E in other positions to avoid confusion? But we are forced to have E at position2.\n\nSo for the next guess, we need to fill positions 1,3,4,5 with available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a word: [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] E [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] [D,F,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z]\n\nBut we must avoid using eliminated letters.\n\nNow, let\'s think of common words that fit.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DELLY"" -> not a word? \n- ""JELLY"" -> J,E,L,L,Y -> but L repeated? And J and Y available? But ""JELLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have E at position2? J at1, E at2, L at3, L at4, Y at5. But we have two L\'s? And we don\'t know if L is in the word? Also, we have to check if L is available? Yes, L is available.\n\nBut we have eliminated: C,R,A,T,H,O,M,S,B,I,N,G. So L is available.\n\nBut in ""JELLY"", we have L at position3 and4? So if we guess, we might get feedback on L.\n\nBut is ""JELLY"" common? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""KELLY"" -> K,E,L,L,Y -> similar.\n\nBut K is available.\n\n""DEUCE"" not because C eliminated.\n\n""LEPER"" -> R eliminated? R is eliminated.\n\n""PENNE"" -> but N eliminated? N(x) from BEING? Yes, N is eliminated? In BEING, N at position4 got x, so N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, G is eliminated, I eliminated, etc.\n\nSo we cannot use N.\n\nIn ""JELLY"", we don\'t use any eliminated letters? J, E, L, L, Y. E is fixed at2, J, L, Y are available? But we have two L\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are words without duplicates.\n\n""VELDT"" -> V,E,L,D,T -> but T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes, T eliminated.\n\n""WELCH"" -> H eliminated? H(x) from HOMES? Yes.\n\n""YELPS"" -> S eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes.\n\n""ZEBRA"" -> Z,E,B,R,A -> B, R, A eliminated? All three? Not.\n\n""QUEUE"" -> Q,U,E,U,E -> E at position2 and5? But we know position5 cannot have E? Because in CRATE, E at5 was marked ""-"", meaning E is not at5. So if we put E at5, it would be wrong? But if there is a duplicate, it might be marked? But we know E is at2, so position5 should not be E? So ""QUEUE"" has E at5, which we know is incorrect? So it would be marked x? Then we waste a letter.\n\nSo avoid putting E at positions we know it\'s not? So avoid position4 and5 for E? But in our pattern, we are not putting E at4 or5? In the word we form, we have E at2, and other positions are non-E? But we can use E again? But we don\'t have to.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we can avoid using E in other positions? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nBut for now, let\'s try to use a word without E in other positions.\n\nSo for positions 1,3,4,5: use non-E letters from available.\n\nAvailable non-E letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nNow, common words with E at2:\n\n- ""LEVY"": but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words:\n\n- ""DEVIL"": D,E,V,I,L -> but I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes, I is eliminated? In BEING, I at position3 got x, so I not in word? So cannot use I.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I and N eliminated? Not.\n\n""PECKY"": P,E,C,K,Y -> C eliminated? Not.\n\n""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> has E at position2 and4? But we know position4 is not E? From HOMES? So if we put E at4, it might be x? But if the secret has only one E, then E at4 would be x. If two, then it might be -? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s avoid putting E at4.\n\nSo ""JEWEL"" has E at4, which we suspect is not correct.\n\nSimilarly, ""NEWEL"": N,E,W,E,L -> N eliminated and E at4? Not.\n\n""REWET"": R and E at4? Not.\n\n""HEWER"": H and E at4? Not.\n\nSo let\'s avoid E at4.\n\nWhat about ""LEVER""? R eliminated? Not.\n\n""BEVEL"": B eliminated? B(x) from BEING? Yes.\n\n""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.\n\n""FEVER"": F,E,V,E,R -> R eliminated? Not.\n\n""JETTY"": J,E,T,T,Y -> T eliminated? T(x) from CRATE? Yes.\n\n""KEDGE"": K,E,D,G,E -> G eliminated?

We need to use less common letters or accept that we might have to use a word with a duplicate E or use available letters that are less common.\n\nLet\'s list all possible 5-letter words with E at position2 and using only available letters: D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and no eliminated letters.\n\nAnd avoid E in other positions? Or not? We can use E in other positions, but we know position4 and5 are not E for the secret? Not necessarily, but we have evidence that position4 and5 are not E? From previous feedback.\n\nFrom guess1: E at5 is not correct (got -), so if there is only one E, then position5 is not E. Similarly, from guess2: E at4 is not correct (got -), so if only one E, position4 is not E. But if there are two E\'s, then position4 or5 could have the second E? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose a word that has E only at position2? Or we can use a word with E at2 and another position? But it might be inefficient.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nLet\'s consider ""JEWEL"" again: J,E,W,E,L -> positions: J1, E2, W3, E4, L5. But E at4: we know from HOMES that when we put E at4, it was not correct, so if we put E at4 again, it will likely be x or -? But if the secret has a second E at4, it would be -? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid risk, let\'s try to find a word without E at4 or5.\n\nAnother word: ""LEVEE"" -> L,E,V,E,E -> E at2,4,5? But position4 and5 are E? We know position5 is not E? So not good.\n\n""PEDES"" -> P,E,D,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.\n\n""VELES"" -> V,E,L,E,S -> S eliminated? Not.\n\n""WELLY"" -> W,E,L,L,Y -> no E elsewhere? W1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. So only E at2. And letters: W, E, L, L, Y. All available? W, L, Y are available. E is fixed.\n\nSo ""WELLY"" is a word? Meaning: a waterproof boot or to beat in a contest? Yes, it\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""JELLY"" has J,E,L,L,Y -> only E at2? J1, E2, L3, L4, Y5. And J, L, Y available.\n\n""KEVEL"" -> K,E,V,E,L -> E at2 and4? Avoid.\n\n""PEWIT"" -> P,E,W,I,T -> I and T eliminated? Not.\n\n""REWIN"" -> R and I and N eliminated? Not.\n\n""SEWAN"" -> S eliminated? Not.\n\n""TEWED"" -> T eliminated? Not.\n\n""VEGAS"" -> V,E,G,A,S -> G, A, S eliminated? Not.\n\n""VELLE"" -> not common.\n\n""WEDEL"" -> W,E,D,E,L -> E at4? Avoid.\n\n""XEBEC"" -> X,E,B,E,C -> B and C eliminated? Not.\n\n""YECCH"" -> not common.\n\n""ZEBUS"" -> Z,E,B,U,S -> B and S eliminated? Not.\n\nSo ""WELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are candidates.\n\nAlso, ""DEKKO"" -> D,E,K,K,O -> O eliminated? O(x) from HOMES? Yes.\n\n""LEKKY"" -> not common.\n\n""PEKOE"" -> P,E,K,O,E -> O eliminated and E at5? Not.\n\n""TEKKE"" -> T eliminated? Not.\n\n""VELUM"" -> V,E,L,U,M -> M eliminated? M(x) from HOMES? Yes.\n\n""HELIX"" -> H eliminated? Not.\n\n""FELID"" -> F,E,L,I,D -> I eliminated? I(x) from BEING? Yes.\n\n""KELPY"" -> K,E,L,P,Y -> only E at2? K1, E2, L3, P4, Y5. And K,L,P,Y available? Yes. ""KELPY"" is a word? Meaning: a type of seaweed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""DELPY"" not common.\n\nSo we have:\n- ""WELLY"": W,E,L,L,Y\n- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y\n- ""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y\n\nAll have E at position2 and no other E.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\n""WELLY"" has two L\'s, which might be good to test L.\n\nSimilarly, ""JELLY"" has two L\'s.\n\n""KELPY"" has L and P.\n\nSince L is common, it\'s good to test.\n\nAlso, Y is common at the end.\n\nI think ""JELLY"" is a common word, so let\'s go with that.\n\nBut J is less common than W or K? But we have to use available letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""DEUCE"" is not possible.\n\nAnother word: ""LEEKY"" -> L,E,E,K,Y -> E at2 and3? But we have two E\'s? And we don\'t know if we can have duplicate E? But it\'s allowed, but we are testing.\n\nBut in ""LEEKY"", E at3 might be redundant.\n\nStick with ""JELLY"".\n\nSo guess: JELLY\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: J, E, L, L, Y. E at position2. J, L, Y are available.\n\nEliminated letters are not used.\n\nSo I think it\'s fine.\n\n<guess>JELLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRATE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  \n  - **Meaning**: C, R, A, T are **not in the word**.

We have the following feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE → C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
  - E is present but not at position 5.

Guess 2: HOMES → H(x) O(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
  - E is present but not at position 4.

Guess 3: BEING → B(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
  - E is correct at position 2.

Guess 4: JELLY → J(x) E(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)
  - J is absent (x)
  - E is correct at position 2 (✓)
  - Both L's are absent (x)
  - Y is correct at position 5 (✓)

From this, we know:
- Secret word letters and positions: E at position 2, Y at position 5. So the word is _ E _ _ Y.
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G, J, L (all marked x in at least one guess)
- Available letters: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and E is already placed so we don't need to guess it again, but Y is placed at the end).

Since Y is at position 5, and E is at position 2, the word has the form: ? E ? ? Y

We also have eliminated many letters, leaving a small set of available letters.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 from the available letters: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Moreover, since only positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown, and we know two letters (E and Y) with confidence.

Now, we must find a valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern: [D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] E [D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] [D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] Y

Let's think of common words that match this pattern.

Examples:
- ""DEWY"": but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The word must be 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = ?, E, ?, ?, Y

So for 5-letter words with E in position 2 and Y at position 5:

- ""KEY"": too short.

5-letter words:
- ""PESKY"": P E S K Y -> but S is eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes, so S cannot be used.
- ""JERKY"": J and R eliminated? J(x) and R(x)? Yes.
- ""FERNY"": F E R N Y -> R and N eliminated? R(x), N(x)? Yes.
- ""DECOY"": D E C O Y -> C and O eliminated? C(x), O(x)? Yes.
- ""DEMY"": too short? Not 5 letters.
- ""DEPLY"": not a word.
- ""KEVELY"": not a word? Too long? No, 6 letters.
- ""KEVY"": not 5.

Another: ""PEATY"": P E A T Y -> A and T eliminated? Yes.

""PECKY"": P E C K Y -> C eliminated? Yes.

""PEDDY"": not a common word? Or ""PEDDY"" might not be standard; ""PEDAL"" but A and L eliminated.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

Available: D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Possible words:
- ""DEBUY""? Not a word.
- ""DEFLY"": D E F L Y -> but L eliminated? From JELLY, L(x)? Yes, L is eliminated? So not.
- ""DEKKY""? Not common.
- ""DENY"": only 4 letters.

Hard to find. Let's list:

- ""DEXY"": too short? Think of 5-letter words ending with ""WY""? Not common.

Another idea: ""EWERY"" or ""EWERS"" but S eliminated? Not.

Perhaps ""PEWIT"" but I and T eliminated? Not.

Consider: ""QUEUE""? Q U E U E -> but then Y is not at end? We need Y at 5.

The word must end with Y.

Common words: ""FREAKY""? F R E A K Y -> R and A eliminated? Not.

""DUVET""? D U V E T -> T eliminated and E at4? Not pattern.

We need to focus on the pattern: only positions 1,3,4 and letters from available.

For example:
Position 1: must be one of D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z
Position 3: same available letters
Position 4: same

And the string must be a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: K, position 3: E, position 4: W? But ""K E W Y"" isn't a word? ""KEW"" is not in 5 letters.

""KEEWY""? Not a word.

""PREXY"": P R E X Y -> R eliminated? R(x)? Yes.

""EXURY""? Not standard.

""VEERY"": V E E R Y -> R eliminated and E at position 3? But we are putting E there? ""V E E R Y"" has positions: V1,E2,E3,R4,Y5? But R eliminated? Not.

""VEXY"": too short.

Perhaps ""WAXY"": W A X Y -> no E? We need E at2? So ""WAXY"" is W A X Y -> not the pattern.

The word must have E at position 2 and Y at position 5.

Examples of real words:
- ""BEADY"": B and A eliminated? Not.
- ""HEADY"": H and A eliminated? Not.
- ""READY"": R and A eliminated? Not.
- ""SEEDY"": S eliminated? Not.
- ""WEEDY"": W E E D Y -> we have E at position2 and3? Then D at4? So ""W E E D Y"" positions: W1,E2,E3,D4,Y5. And letters: W,E,D,Y. Available letters: W,D,Y are available? W and D are available. Also, eliminated S? Not S.

Check eliminated: W, E, D, Y. E is already known, D is available (not eliminated), W available, Y placed.

But we have two E's? Is that possible? We don't know, but feedback has not shown that E is duplicated, but it could be.

And ""WEEDY"" is a valid word? Meaning: abounding with weeds? Yes.

The pattern: W at1, E at2, E at3, D at4, Y at5. So word: W E E D Y.

But position 3 is E? And position 4 is D? Then Y at5.

Now, evaluate against feedback:

- Position 3: We haven't explicitly tested E at position 3 before? But we know E is at2, and from guess1 and guess2, E was not at4 or5. We haven't tested position 3.

Could E be at position 3? It's possible if there is a duplicate E.

Similarly, in JELLY, we guessed Y at5 confirmed.

But in ""WEEDY"", we have E at3? So if the secret has E at3, it might be present.

We do not have information about position 3 for E? So it could be.

Feedback from Jelly: J(x), E(✓), L(x), L(x), Y(✓). No information about E at other positions.

Similarly, WEEDY uses D and W? Both available.

But does WEEDY use only available letters?

Letters: W, E, E, D, Y

Available letters include D, W, Y? Yes.

E is from the known letter.

But we have two E's? That's fine.

Another word: ""DEADY""? Dead? But A eliminated.

""NEEDY""? N eliminated? N(x)? Yes.

""FEEDY""? Not common.

""PEWEE""? P E W E E -> and Y? No, not ending with Y.

We need Y at end.

""SEEDY"" eliminated S? Not.

So WEEDY is a candidate.

Other words? ""VEEZY""? Not common.

""DEKKO"" has O and only 5 letters? But O eliminated? And pattern not Y at end.

So WEEDY seems one of the few.

Or ""KEECH"": K E E C H -> C and H eliminated? Not.

So WEEDY might be the best guess.

But let's see if WEEDY fits:

Positions: W1, E2, E3, D4, Y5.

The known: E(✓) at position 2, Y(✓) at position 5.

Position 1: W, position 3: E, position 4: D.

All letters are available.

We haven't guessed W or D before? So they could be present? Or absent? We'll find out.

Eliminated letters are not used.

Therefore, WEEDY is a valid guess.

Alternative: ""PEDAL"" but A and L eliminated? Not.

Or ""FUNKY""? F U N K Y -> but needs E? At position 2? F at1, U at2? But we need E at2? Not U.

So no.

Therefore, I choose WEEDY.

But in WEEDY, we have E at position3. Since E is already at position2, we are testing for duplicate E?

But we need to guess, so this is acceptable.

Another possibility: ""KEENLY""? 6 letters? Not.

""DEEDY"": D E E D Y -> letters D,E,E,D,Y? But D at1 and D at4? Yes, and E at2 and3? So word ""DEEDY""? Is it a valid word? Meaning? It might be dialect or obsolete? Not common. But WEEDY is more common.

So stick with WEEDY.

So guess: WEEDY

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Summary of Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - E is present but not at position 5.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - E is present but not at position 4.
- **Guess 3: BEING** → B(x), E(✓), I(x), N(x), G(x)  
  - E is confirmed at position 2.
- **Guess 4: JELLY** → J(x), E(✓), L(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
  - Y is confirmed at position 5.
  - E is still confirmed at position 2.
  - J and L are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Positions**:
   - Position 2: E
   - Position 5: Y
   - Secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ Y`
2. **Eliminated Letters** (14 total): C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G, J, L (all marked ""x"").
3. **Available Letters for Positions 1, 3, and 4**: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (as they have not been tested or eliminated).
4. **Objective**: Find a valid English word that fits `_ E _ _ Y` using only available letters for positions 1, 3, and 4.
   - Position 1: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 3: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 4: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).

### Thought Process:
- The secret word must start with one of the available letters (D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z), followed by E at position 2, then two slots from the same available letters, and end with Y.
- Common words fitting this pattern are limited due to eliminated letters (e.g., ""PESKY"" is invalid because S is eliminated, ""JERKY"" has R and J eliminated).
- Possible candidate words include:
  - ""WEEDY"": Matches `W E E D Y`, where W, D, and Y are available letters. ""WEEDY"" is a valid English word (meaning overgrown with weeds). This tests W in position 1, a potential E duplicate in position 3 (unknown based on feedback), and D in position 4.
  - Other options like ""DEEDY"" (obscure/archaic) or ""KEENLY"" (6 letters) are less suitable.
- ""WEEDY"" efficiently tests:
  - Position 1: W (new letter).
  - Position 3: E (potential duplicate, unconfirmed).
  - Position 4: D (new letter).
- Feedback will refine the possibilities:
  - If any position matches, we gain exact placement.
  - If absent, we eliminate W, E (duplicate), and D.

### Decision:
""WEEDY"" is the best guess as it adheres to the pattern, uses common available letters, and maximizes information gain for the remaining positions.

From this, we know:
- Secret word letters and positions: E at position 2, Y at position 5. So the word is _ E _ _ Y.
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G, J, L (all marked x in at least one guess)
- Available letters: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and E is already placed so we don't need to guess it again, but Y is placed at the end).

Since Y is at position 5, and E is at position 2, the word has the form: ? E ? ? Y

We also have eliminated many letters, leaving a small set of available letters.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 from the available letters: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Moreover, since only positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown, and we know two letters (E and Y) with confidence.

Now, we must find a valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern: [D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] E [D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] [D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] Y

Let's think of common words that match this pattern.

Examples:
- ""DEWY"": but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The word must be 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = ?, E, ?, ?, Y

So for 5-letter words with E in position 2 and Y at position 5:

- ""KEY"": too short.

5-letter words:
- ""PESKY"": P E S K Y -> but S is eliminated? S(x) from HOMES? Yes, so S cannot be used.
- ""JERKY"": J and R eliminated? J(x) and R(x)? Yes.
- ""FERNY"": F E R N Y -> R and N eliminated? R(x), N(x)? Yes.
- ""DECOY"": D E C O Y -> C and O eliminated? C(x), O(x)? Yes.
- ""DEMY"": too short? Not 5 letters.
- ""DEPLY"": not a word.
- ""KEVELY"": not a word? Too long? No, 6 letters.
- ""KEVY"": not 5.

Another: ""PEATY"": P E A T Y -> A and T eliminated? Yes.

""PECKY"": P E C K Y -> C eliminated? Yes.

""PEDDY"": not a common word? Or ""PEDDY"" might not be standard; ""PEDAL"" but A and L eliminated.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

Available: D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Possible words:
- ""DEBUY""? Not a word.
- ""DEFLY"": D E F L Y -> but L eliminated? From JELLY, L(x)? Yes, L is eliminated? So not.
- ""DEKKY""? Not common.
- ""DENY"": only 4 letters.

Hard to find. Let's list:

- ""DEXY"": too short? Think of 5-letter words ending with ""WY""? Not common.

Another idea: ""EWERY"" or ""EWERS"" but S eliminated? Not.

Perhaps ""PEWIT"" but I and T eliminated? Not.

Consider: ""QUEUE""? Q U E U E -> but then Y is not at end? We need Y at 5.

The word must end with Y.

Common words: ""FREAKY""? F R E A K Y -> R and A eliminated? Not.

""DUVET""? D U V E T -> T eliminated and E at4? Not pattern.

We need to focus on the pattern: only positions 1,3,4 and letters from available.

For example:
Position 1: must be one of D,F,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z
Position 3: same available letters
Position 4: same

And the string must be a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: K, position 3: E, position 4: W? But ""K E W Y"" isn't a word? ""KEW"" is not in 5 letters.

""KEEWY""? Not a word.

""PREXY"": P R E X Y -> R eliminated? R(x)? Yes.

""EXURY""? Not standard.

""VEERY"": V E E R Y -> R eliminated and E at position 3? But we are putting E there? ""V E E R Y"" has positions: V1,E2,E3,R4,Y5? But R eliminated? Not.

""VEXY"": too short.

Perhaps ""WAXY"": W A X Y -> no E? We need E at2? So ""WAXY"" is W A X Y -> not the pattern.

The word must have E at position 2 and Y at position 5.

Examples of real words:
- ""BEADY"": B and A eliminated? Not.
- ""HEADY"": H and A eliminated? Not.
- ""READY"": R and A eliminated? Not.
- ""SEEDY"": S eliminated? Not.
- ""WEEDY"": W E E D Y -> we have E at position2 and3? Then D at4? So ""W E E D Y"" positions: W1,E2,E3,D4,Y5. And letters: W,E,D,Y. Available letters: W,D,Y are available? W and D are available. Also, eliminated S? Not S.

Check eliminated: W, E, D, Y. E is already known, D is available (not eliminated), W available, Y placed.

But we have two E's? Is that possible? We don't know, but feedback has not shown that E is duplicated, but it could be.

And ""WEEDY"" is a valid word? Meaning: abounding with weeds? Yes.

The pattern: W at1, E at2, E at3, D at4, Y at5. So word: W E E D Y.

But position 3 is E? And position 4 is D? Then Y at5.

Now, evaluate against feedback:

- Position 3: We haven't explicitly tested E at position 3 before? But we know E is at2, and from guess1 and guess2, E was not at4 or5. We haven't tested position 3.

Could E be at position 3? It's possible if there is a duplicate E.

Similarly, in JELLY, we guessed Y at5 confirmed.

But in ""WEEDY"", we have E at3? So if the secret has E at3, it might be present.

We do not have information about position 3 for E? So it could be.

Feedback from Jelly: J(x), E(✓), L(x), L(x), Y(✓). No information about E at other positions.

Similarly, WEEDY uses D and W? Both available.

But does WEEDY use only available letters?

Letters: W, E, E, D, Y

Available letters include D, W, Y? Yes.

E is from the known letter.

But we have two E's? That's fine.

Another word: ""DEADY""? Dead? But A eliminated.

""NEEDY""? N eliminated? N(x)? Yes.

""FEEDY""? Not common.

""PEWEE""? P E W E E -> and Y? No, not ending with Y.

We need Y at end.

""SEEDY"" eliminated S? Not.

So WEEDY is a candidate.

Other words? ""VEEZY""? Not common.

""DEKKO"" has O and only 5 letters? But O eliminated? And pattern not Y at end.

So WEEDY seems one of the few.

Or ""KEECH"": K E E C H -> C and H eliminated? Not.

So WEEDY might be the best guess.

But let's see if WEEDY fits:

Positions: W1, E2, E3, D4, Y5.

The known: E(✓) at position 2, Y(✓) at position 5.

Position 1: W, position 3: E, position 4: D.

All letters are available.

We haven't guessed W or D before? So they could be present? Or absent? We'll find out.

Eliminated letters are not used.

Therefore, WEEDY is a valid guess.

Alternative: ""PEDAL"" but A and L eliminated? Not.

Or ""FUNKY""? F U N K Y -> but needs E? At position 2? F at1, U at2? But we need E at2? Not U.

So no.

Therefore, I choose WEEDY.

But in WEEDY, we have E at position3. Since E is already at position2, we are testing for duplicate E?

But we need to guess, so this is acceptable.

Another possibility: ""KEENLY""? 6 letters? Not.

""DEEDY"": D E E D Y -> letters D,E,E,D,Y? But D at1 and D at4? Yes, and E at2 and3? So word ""DEEDY""? Is it a valid word? Meaning? It might be dialect or obsolete? Not common. But WEEDY is more common.

So stick with WEEDY.

So guess: WEEDY

### Summary of Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE** → C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - E is present but not at position 5.
- **Guess 2: HOMES** → H(x), O(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)  
  - E is present but not at position 4.
- **Guess 3: BEING** → B(x), E(✓), I(x), N(x), G(x)  
  - E is confirmed at position 2.
- **Guess 4: JELLY** → J(x), E(✓), L(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
  - Y is confirmed at position 5.
  - E is still confirmed at position 2.
  - J and L are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Positions**:
   - Position 2: E
   - Position 5: Y
   - Secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ Y`
2. **Eliminated Letters** (14 total): C, R, A, T, H, O, M, S, B, I, N, G, J, L (all marked ""x"").
3. **Available Letters for Positions 1, 3, and 4**: D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (as they have not been tested or eliminated).
4. **Objective**: Find a valid English word that fits `_ E _ _ Y` using only available letters for positions 1, 3, and 4.
   - Position 1: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 3: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).
   - Position 4: Must be from available letters (not eliminated).

### Thought Process:
- The secret word must start with one of the available letters (D, F, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z), followed by E at position 2, then two slots from the same available letters, and end with Y.
- Common words fitting this pattern are limited due to eliminated letters (e.g., ""PESKY"" is invalid because S is eliminated, ""JERKY"" has R and J eliminated).
- Possible candidate words include:
  - ""WEEDY"": Matches `W E E D Y`, where W, D, and Y are available letters. ""WEEDY"" is a valid English word (meaning overgrown with weeds). This tests W in position 1, a potential E duplicate in position 3 (unknown based on feedback), and D in position 4.
  - Other options like ""DEEDY"" (obscure/archaic) or ""KEENLY"" (6 letters) are less suitable.
- ""WEEDY"" efficiently tests:
  - Position 1: W (new letter).
  - Position 3: E (potential duplicate, unconfirmed).
  - Position 4: D (new letter).
- Feedback will refine the possibilities:
  - If any position matches, we gain exact placement.
  - If absent, we eliminate W, E (duplicate), and D.

### Decision:
""WEEDY"" is the best guess as it adheres to the pattern, uses common available letters, and maximizes information gain for the remaining positions.",Guess 5: WEEDY -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) E(✓) E(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
