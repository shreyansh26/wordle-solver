We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We start over. The feedback for the first guess ""crane"" shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This means the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since these are common letters, we need to pick a new word that avoids these letters entirely.

 Let me think of a 5-letter word that uses letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
 The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Some common letters left are: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 A good starting word might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check if it uses any disallowed letters: S, L, O, T, H -> none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}, so it's valid.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S -> also valid.

 Another common one: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L.

 But note: we want to cover more frequent letters. In English, after the ones we've eliminated, the next most common might be S, T, L, O, etc.

 According to letter frequency, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. We've eliminated E, A, O? Wait, we eliminated A and E but not O? 
 Correction: We only eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So O is still available.

 Letter frequency without the eliminated ones: 
 The top remaining letters are: O, T, I, S, H, D, L, U, M, P, etc.

 So a word that uses several of these would be good.

 Consider ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> all allowed.

 Another: ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> also good.

 Or ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same set.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are relatively common and distinct.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. U is less common than T and M, so ""MOIST"" might be better.

 Let me decide on ""MOIST"".

We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M(x), O(x), I(x) -> absent
   - S(-) -> present but in wrong position
   - T(-) -> present but in wrong position

Therefore, the secret word contains S and T, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", S was the 4th letter and T was the 5th. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

Available letters: from the alphabet, excluding {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I}. 
Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S and T are in the word, so we must include them.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and T (both present)
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I
- S is not in the 4th position, T is not in the 5th position.

We have 3 more letters to choose from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the available: S, T, L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also need to consider the positions. Since S and T are in the word but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively, we can try placing them in other positions.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th (but not 4th). However, note that in the word we choose, we can put S and T in any position except the ones that were in ""moist"" for those letters? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"" it was in 4th and got '-', meaning it's present but not there). Similarly, T is not in the 5th position.

But we don't know the positions of S and T in the secret word. So we have to try a word that has S and T in positions other than 4th for S and 5th for T.

We also have 3 other letters to choose.

Let's think of words that have S and T and three other letters from the available set.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""BUSTS"" -> but has S at the end (5th) and also has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback so far, we don't have any duplicate letters. But we must consider that the secret word might have duplicates.

But note: in ""moist"", we had one S and one T, and both were marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two S's, then the feedback might have shown two '-' for S? But in ""moist"" we only had one S, so we only get one feedback for S. Similarly for T.

So we cannot rule out duplicates, but we don't have evidence for them either.

We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Let me try to list words with S and T and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""SHUNT"" -> but H and U are available? Let's check: H and U are in the available set. However, ""SHUNT"": 
  S in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th. But wait, N is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: N is absent). So we cannot use N.

We must avoid forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

So ""SHUNT"" has N -> invalid.

Another: ""BUSTY"" -> B, U, S, T, Y. 
- B, U, Y are allowed? Yes. 
- Positions: S is 3rd, T is 4th. 
  But note: in ""moist"", S was in 4th and got '-', meaning S is not in 4th in the secret word. But in ""BUSTY"", S is in 3rd, which is okay. T is in 4th? The feedback for T in ""moist"" was that T is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th? Yes, because the feedback only said T is not in 5th. So T in 4th is allowed.

But we also have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong? Only for the specific letters: S cannot be in 4th, T cannot be in 5th. In ""BUSTY"", T is in 4th, which is not forbidden (only 5th is forbidden for T). So that's okay.

But let's check the word: B U S T Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

We need to make sure the word is valid. ""BUSTY"" is a word (meaning curvy in figure).

Another option: ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. L is allowed.

But we don't have any information about L, so it might be good to test it.

However, we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""DUTY"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""STUDY"" -> S, T, U, D, Y. 
- S in 1st, T in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th.
- This word: 
  - S is in 1st (not 4th, so okay)
  - T is in 2nd (not 5th, so okay)
  - Uses U, D, Y which are available.

""STUDY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DUSTY"" -> D, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

Both ""STUDY"" and ""DUSTY"" are options.

But note: in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try to put S and T in positions that we haven't tested. In ""moist"", we had S in 4th and T in 5th. Now we can try S in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th and T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

But we have to avoid the forbidden positions: S not 4th, T not 5th.

So for S: positions 1,2,3,5 are allowed.
For T: positions 1,2,3,4 are allowed.

We also want to test other common letters. Among the available, common consonants: L, D, P, H, U, B, etc.

Let me think of a word that uses S, T, and then L, D, or H.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but E and A are forbidden.

""LIGHT"" -> no S.

""SHIFT"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But I is forbidden (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So invalid.

""THUDS"" -> T, H, U, D, S. 
- Positions: T in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, S in 5th.
- This word: 
  - T is in 1st (allowed, since T not 5th)
  - S is in 5th (allowed, since S not 4th)
  - Uses H, U, D which are available.

""THUDS"" is a word (meaning a dull sound, like a thud).

Another: ""BLAST"" -> but A is forbidden.

""GUSTY"" -> G, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

I think ""STUDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places S and T in new positions.

But let's consider: in ""STUDY"", we have S in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word has S in 1st, we would get a check (✓) for S, and similarly for T. If not, we might get '-' or 'x'. Also, we test U, D, Y.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has S and T in positions that are less common to see if they are fixed? But that might be less efficient.

I think ""STUDY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: since we know S and T are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested and also use three new letters.

In ""moist"", we tested positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. So we have feedback for each position.

For the secret word, we know:
- Position 1: cannot be M, and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). Also, it cannot be O or I (from second guess). So position 1 must be one of the remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we know S and T are in the word, but they might be in position 1? Yes.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we don't have direct constraints on positions except that S is not in 4 and T is not in 5.

Given that, I think ""STUDY"" is a good guess.

Let me write it: S T U D Y.

But wait, in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word does not have S in 1st, we get '-' for S, and similarly for T. Also, we test U, D, Y.

We might get more information.

Another word: ""PULPS"" -> but P and L are available, but S is at the end. However, we have two P's? That might not be ideal.

I think ""STUDY"" is better.

So I'll go with ""STUDY"".

<guess>study</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- The first guess ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- The second guess ""moist"" had M, O, I marked as absent (x), and S and T marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains S and T, but S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th position.
  - The secret word does not contain M, O, I (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S and T confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and T (since they are present in the secret word).
- S cannot be in the 4th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).
- T cannot be in the 5th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).
- Avoid all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I).
- Aim for common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""study"" fits these criteria:
- Contains S (1st position) and T (2nd position), both in new positions not yet ruled out.
- Uses additional common letters: U, D, Y (all from the available set).
- Tests S in position 1 and T in position 2, which could provide valuable positional feedback.

<guess>study</guess>",study,"We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M(x), O(x), I(x) -> absent
   - S(-) -> present but in wrong position
   - T(-) -> present but in wrong position

Therefore, the secret word contains S and T, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", S was the 4th letter and T was the 5th. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

Available letters: from the alphabet, excluding {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I}. 
Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S and T are in the word, so we must include them.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and T (both present)
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I
- S is not in the 4th position, T is not in the 5th position.

We have 3 more letters to choose from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the available: S, T, L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also need to consider the positions. Since S and T are in the word but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively, we can try placing them in other positions.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th (but not 4th). However, note that in the word we choose, we can put S and T in any position except the ones that were in ""moist"" for those letters? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"" it was in 4th and got '-', meaning it's present but not there). Similarly, T is not in the 5th position.

But we don't know the positions of S and T in the secret word. So we have to try a word that has S and T in positions other than 4th for S and 5th for T.

We also have 3 other letters to choose.

Let's think of words that have S and T and three other letters from the available set.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""BUSTS"" -> but has S at the end (5th) and also has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback so far, we don't have any duplicate letters. But we must consider that the secret word might have duplicates.

But note: in ""moist"", we had one S and one T, and both were marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two S's, then the feedback might have shown two '-' for S? But in ""moist"" we only had one S, so we only get one feedback for S. Similarly for T.

So we cannot rule out duplicates, but we don't have evidence for them either.

We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Let me try to list words with S and T and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""SHUNT"" -> but H and U are available? Let's check: H and U are in the available set. However, ""SHUNT"": 
  S in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th. But wait, N is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: N is absent). So we cannot use N.

We must avoid forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

So ""SHUNT"" has N -> invalid.

Another: ""BUSTY"" -> B, U, S, T, Y. 
- B, U, Y are allowed? Yes. 
- Positions: S is 3rd, T is 4th. 
  But note: in ""moist"", S was in 4th and got '-', meaning S is not in 4th in the secret word. But in ""BUSTY"", S is in 3rd, which is okay. T is in 4th? The feedback for T in ""moist"" was that T is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th? Yes, because the feedback only said T is not in 5th. So T in 4th is allowed.

But we also have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong? Only for the specific letters: S cannot be in 4th, T cannot be in 5th. In ""BUSTY"", T is in 4th, which is not forbidden (only 5th is forbidden for T). So that's okay.

But let's check the word: B U S T Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

We need to make sure the word is valid. ""BUSTY"" is a word (meaning curvy in figure).

Another option: ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. L is allowed.

But we don't have any information about L, so it might be good to test it.

However, we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""DUTY"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""STUDY"" -> S, T, U, D, Y. 
- S in 1st, T in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th.
- This word: 
  - S is in 1st (not 4th, so okay)
  - T is in 2nd (not 5th, so okay)
  - Uses U, D, Y which are available.

""STUDY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DUSTY"" -> D, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

Both ""STUDY"" and ""DUSTY"" are options.

But note: in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try to put S and T in positions that we haven't tested. In ""moist"", we had S in 4th and T in 5th. Now we can try S in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th and T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

But we have to avoid the forbidden positions: S not 4th, T not 5th.

So for S: positions 1,2,3,5 are allowed.
For T: positions 1,2,3,4 are allowed.

We also want to test other common letters. Among the available, common consonants: L, D, P, H, U, B, etc.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but E and A are forbidden.

""LIGHT"" -> no S.

""SHIFT"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But I is forbidden (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So invalid.

""THUDS"" -> T, H, U, D, S. 
- Positions: T in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, S in 5th.
- This word: 
  - T is in 1st (allowed, since T not 5th)
  - S is in 5th (allowed, since S not 4th)
  - Uses H, U, D which are available.

""THUDS"" is a word (meaning a dull sound, like a thud).

Another: ""BLAST"" -> but A is forbidden.

""GUSTY"" -> G, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

I think ""STUDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places S and T in new positions.

- Position 1: cannot be M, and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). Also, it cannot be O or I (from second guess). So position 1 must be one of the remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we know S and T are in the word, but they might be in position 1? Yes.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we don't have direct constraints on positions except that S is not in 4 and T is not in 5.

Given that, I think ""STUDY"" is a good guess.

Let me write it: S T U D Y.

But wait, in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word does not have S in 1st, we get '-' for S, and similarly for T. Also, we test U, D, Y.

I think ""STUDY"" is better.

So I'll go with ""STUDY"".

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,gusty,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We start over. The feedback for the first guess ""crane"" shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This means the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since these are common letters, we need to pick a new word that avoids these letters entirely.

 Let me think of a 5-letter word that uses letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
 The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Some common letters left are: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 A good starting word might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check if it uses any disallowed letters: S, L, O, T, H -> none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}, so it's valid.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S -> also valid.

 Another common one: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L.

 But note: we want to cover more frequent letters. In English, after the ones we've eliminated, the next most common might be S, T, L, O, etc.

 According to letter frequency, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. We've eliminated E, A, O? Wait, we eliminated A and E but not O? 
 Correction: We only eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So O is still available.

 Letter frequency without the eliminated ones: 
 The top remaining letters are: O, T, I, S, H, D, L, U, M, P, etc.

 So a word that uses several of these would be good.

 Consider ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> all allowed.

 Another: ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> also good.

 Or ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same set.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are relatively common and distinct.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. U is less common than T and M, so ""MOIST"" might be better.

 Let me decide on ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- None of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.  
- Therefore, the secret word uses letters excluding this set.  

For the next guess, I aimed for a word with common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}, prioritizing letters like S, T, O, I, M (based on English frequency). ""Moist"" uses M, O, I, S, T—all unused letters—and provides broad new information.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M(x), O(x), I(x) -> absent
   - S(-) -> present but in wrong position
   - T(-) -> present but in wrong position

Therefore, the secret word contains S and T, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", S was the 4th letter and T was the 5th. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

Available letters: from the alphabet, excluding {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I}. 
Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S and T are in the word, so we must include them.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and T (both present)
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I
- S is not in the 4th position, T is not in the 5th position.

We have 3 more letters to choose from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the available: S, T, L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also need to consider the positions. Since S and T are in the word but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively, we can try placing them in other positions.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th (but not 4th). However, note that in the word we choose, we can put S and T in any position except the ones that were in ""moist"" for those letters?

We must avoid forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

So ""SHUNT"" has N -> invalid.

Another: ""BUSTY"" -> B, U, S, T, Y. 
- B, U, Y are allowed? Yes. 
- Positions: S is 3rd, T is 4th. 
  But note: in ""moist"", S was in 4th and got '-', meaning S is not in 4th in the secret word. But in ""BUSTY"", S is in 3rd, which is okay. T is in 4th?

We need to make sure the word is valid. ""BUSTY"" is a word (meaning curvy in figure).

Another option: ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. L is allowed.

But we don't have any information about L, so it might be good to test it.

However, we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""DUTY"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""STUDY"" -> S, T, U, D, Y. 
- S in 1st, T in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th.
- This word: 
  - S is in 1st (not 4th, so okay)
  - T is in 2nd (not 5th, so okay)
  - Uses U, D, Y which are available.

""STUDY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DUSTY"" -> D, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

Both ""STUDY"" and ""DUSTY"" are options.

But note: in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has S and T in positions that are less common to see if they are fixed? But that might be less efficient.

I think ""STUDY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: since we know S and T are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested and also use three new letters.

In ""moist"", we tested positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. So we have feedback for each position.

For the secret word, we know:
- Position 1: cannot be M, and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). Also, it cannot be O or I (from second guess). So position 1 must be one of the remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we know S and T are in the word, but they might be in position 1? Yes.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we don't have direct constraints on positions except that S is not in 4 and T is not in 5.

Given that, I think ""STUDY"" is a good guess.

Let me write it: S T U D Y.

But wait, in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word does not have S in 1st, we get '-' for S, and similarly for T. Also, we test U, D, Y.

We might get more information.

Another word: ""PULPS"" -> but P and L are available, but S is at the end. However, we have two P's? That might not be ideal.

I think ""STUDY"" is better.

So I'll go with ""STUDY"".

<guess>study</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- The first guess ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- The second guess ""moist"" had M, O, I marked as absent (x), and S and T marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains S and T, but S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th position.
  - The secret word does not contain M, O, I (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S and T confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and T (since they are present in the secret word).
- S cannot be in the 4th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).
- T cannot be in the 5th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).
- Avoid all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I).
- Aim for common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""study"" fits these criteria:
- Contains S (1st position) and T (2nd position), both in new positions not yet ruled out.
- Uses additional common letters: U, D, Y (all from the available set).
- Tests S in position 1 and T in position 2, which could provide valuable positional feedback.

In ""moist"", S was the 4th letter and T was the 5th. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.\n\nAvailable letters: from the alphabet, excluding {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I}. \nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: S and T are in the word, so we must include them.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains S and T (both present)\n- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I\n- S is not in the 4th position, T is not in the 5th position.\n\nWe have 3 more letters to choose from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters among the available: S, T, L, D, U, P, H, etc.\n\nWe also need to consider the positions.

However, note that in the word we choose, we can put S and T in any position except the ones that were in ""moist"" for those letters? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"" it was in 4th and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there). Similarly, T is not in the 5th position.\n\nBut we don\'t know the positions of S and T in the secret word. So we have to try a word that has S and T in positions other than 4th for S and 5th for T.\n\nWe also have 3 other letters to choose.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S and T and three other letters from the available set.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""BUSTS"" -> but has S at the end (5th) and also has two S\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback so far, we don\'t have any duplicate letters. But we must consider that the secret word might have duplicates.\n\nBut note: in ""moist"", we had one S and one T, and both were marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two S\'s, then the feedback might have shown two \'-\' for S? But in ""moist"" we only had one S, so we only get one feedback for S. Similarly for T.\n\nSo we cannot rule out duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence for them either.\n\nWe should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nLet me try to list words with S and T and three other distinct letters from the available set.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SHUNT"" -> but H and U are available? Let\'s check: H and U are in the available set. However, ""SHUNT"": \n  S in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th. But wait, N is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: N is absent). So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.\n\nSo ""SHUNT"" has N -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""BUSTY"" -> B, U, S, T, Y. \n- B, U, Y are allowed? Yes. \n- Positions: S is 3rd, T is 4th. \n  But note: in ""moist"", S was in 4th and got \'-\', meaning S is not in 4th in the secret word. But in ""BUSTY"", S is in 3rd, which is okay. T is in 4th? The feedback for T in ""moist"" was that T is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th? Yes, because the feedback only said T is not in 5th. So T in 4th is allowed.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong? Only for the specific letters: S cannot be in 4th, T cannot be in 5th. In ""BUSTY"", T is in 4th, which is not forbidden (only 5th is forbidden for T). So that\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s check the word: B U S T Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\nWe need to make sure the word is valid. ""BUSTY"" is a word (meaning curvy in figure).\n\nAnother option: ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. L is allowed.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about L, so it might be good to test it.\n\nHowever, we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""DUTY"" -> but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""STUDY"" -> S, T, U, D, Y. \n- S in 1st, T in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th.\n- This word: \n  - S is in 1st (not 4th, so okay)\n  - T is in 2nd (not 5th, so okay)\n  - Uses U, D, Y which are available.\n\n""STUDY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""DUSTY"" -> D, U, S, T, Y. \n- S in 3rd, T in 4th.\n\nBoth ""STUDY"" and ""DUSTY"" are options.\n\nBut note: in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put S and T in positions that we haven\'t tested. In ""moist"", we had S in 4th and T in 5th. Now we can try S in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th and T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden positions: S not 4th, T not 5th.\n\nSo for S: positions 1,2,3,5 are allowed.\nFor T: positions 1,2,3,4 are allowed.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters. Among the available, common consonants: L, D, P, H, U, B, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word that uses S, T, and then L, D, or H.\n\nFor example: ""SLATE"" -> but E and A are forbidden.\n\n""LIGHT"" -> no S.\n\n""SHIFT"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But I is forbidden (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So invalid.\n\n""THUDS"" -> T, H, U, D, S. \n- Positions: T in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, S in 5th.\n- This word: \n  - T is in 1st (allowed, since T not 5th)\n  - S is in 5th (allowed, since S not 4th)\n  - Uses H, U, D which are available.\n\n""THUDS"" is a word (meaning a dull sound, like a thud).\n\nAnother: ""BLAST"" -> but A is forbidden.\n\n""GUSTY"" -> G, U, S, T, Y. \n- S in 3rd, T in 4th.\n\nI think ""STUDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places S and T in new positions.\n\nBut let\'s consider: in ""STUDY"", we have S in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word has S in 1st, we would get a check (✓) for S, and similarly for T. If not, we might get \'-\' or \'x\'. Also, we test U, D, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has S and T in positions that are less common to see if they are fixed? But that might be less efficient.\n\nI think ""STUDY"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: since we know S and T are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven\'t tested and also use three new letters.\n\nIn ""moist"", we tested positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T.

Yes.\n- Similarly for other positions.\n\nBut we don\'t have direct constraints on positions except that S is not in 4 and T is not in 5.\n\nGiven that, I think ""STUDY"" is a good guess.\n\nLet me write it: S T U D Y.\n\nBut wait, in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd.

We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": All letters absent → Secret word has no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I absent; S and T present but wrong position (S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
3. ""study"": S(-) meaning S is present but not in position 1, T(-) present but not in position 2, U(-) present but wrong position, D(x) absent, Y(✓) meaning Y is correct and in position 5.

Key deductions:
- Y is in the secret word and position 5 is correct → Secret word ends with Y.
- S, T, U are present in the secret word, but:
  - S is not in position 1 (from ""study"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist"") → possible positions: 2,3
  - T is not in position 2 (from ""study"") and not in position 5 (from ""moist"") → possible positions: 1,3,4
  - U is present but not in position 3 (from ""study"") → possible positions: 1,2,4
- D is absent → Secret word has no D.
- Additional absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D

Present letters: S, T, U, Y (with Y fixed at position 5).

Since Y is fixed at the end, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ Y

Now, letters we must include: S, T, U (each at least once). And no other letters from the absent set.

Available letters: From the alphabet, excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D → Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and we have S,T,U,Y confirmed).

But note: We might have duplicate letters? Not ruled out, but in our feedback so far, all letters tested were single, so assume no duplicates for now to minimize complexity.

So, the secret word has 4 distinct known letters: S,T,U,Y plus one more. But we have 5 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 5 being Y.

The missing letter (for position 4? or others) must be from available consonants: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

We have constraints on positions:
- S: not pos1 (from ""study""), not pos4 (from ""moist"") → so must be in 2 or 3.
- T: not pos2 (from ""study""), not pos5 (from ""moist"") → so must be in 1,3,4.
- U: not pos3 (from ""study"") → so must be in 1,2,4.

Also, position 5 is Y.

Furthermore, from ""study"", the feedback was:
- S: present but not pos1 → and we place S in 1 in ""study"", so not there.
- T: present but not pos2 → we had T in pos2, so not there.
- U: present but not pos3 → we had U in pos3, so not there.
- D: absent
- Y: correct at pos5.

We need to form a word of the form: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] [pos4] Y

With S in {2,3}, T in {1,3,4}, U in {1,2,4}.

And the letters must include S,T,U,Y and one more letter.

Now, let's consider possible positions:

Case 1: S in position 2.
Then, position 2 is S. Then:
- U cannot be in position 2? Wait, position 2 is occupied by S, so U must be in 1 or 4.
- T must be in 1,3,4.

But position 2 is S, so U cannot be there anyway.

Subcases:
- If S is in 2: then word: [1] S [3] [4] Y
  Then T and U must be in the remaining positions: 1,3,4.

Possible:
  - T in 1 → then U must be in 4 (since U cannot be in 3, because U cannot be in 3 per feedback? No: U cannot be in pos3, so if T is in 1, U must be in 4. Then position 3 is free for another letter.
  - T in 3 → then U must be in 1 or 4. But if U in 1, then position 3 is T, which is okay? Position 3: if T is there, no problem. But U cannot be in 3, but T can be in 3. Then U in 1 or 4.
  - T in 4 → then U must be in 1 (since U cannot be in 3) and position 3 is free.

Case 2: S in position 3.
Then word: [1] [2] S [4] Y
- U cannot be in 3 (occupied by S) so U in 1,2, or 4? But U cannot be in 3 and 3 is occupied, so U in 1,2, or 4 — but no conflict because U just can't be in pos3, and pos3 isn't U.
- T in 1,3,4 — but pos3 is S, so T in 1 or 4.

Then:
- U in any position except 3 (but 3 is taken) so U in 1,2,4.
- T in 1 or 4.

But also, if T in 1, U can be in 2 or 4. If T in 4, U can be in 1 or 2.

Now, we need to choose which case and pick a word.

But we also have to include the missing letter.

Moreover, we want to test possibilities to narrow down.

Since Y is fixed at the end and we have S,T,U,Y, we can aim to form a word with one more letter.

List possible words:

First, with S in position 2: then word: _ S _ _ Y
Then:
- T in 1: then T S _ U Y → but position 4 must be U? Or could be the missing letter? Wait, we have S in 2 and T in 1 fixed? Then positions 3 and 4 are free for U and the missing letter? But U must be in the word. So if T is in 1 and S in 2, then U can be in position 4? Then word: T S ? U Y, but position 3 must be the missing letter.

Words like ""TSU?Y"" — but that's not standard.

What words end with ""UY""? Not common. U before Y? Actually, almost no English words have ""U"" directly before ""Y"" at the end. Words ending in ""Y"" rarely have U directly before? Like ""buy"", ""guy"", etc., but that's a different vowel. Not U.

Hence, U cannot be in position 4 if position 5 is Y? Because position 4 is U and then ""UY"" — not common. Although there is ""glugy""? Not a word. So probably not.

Similarly, if U is in position 4: [1] [2] S U Y → but ends with ""SUY""? Not plausible.

Therefore, case S in position 2 might be difficult because U cannot be in position 4 without creating an awkward ending.

Hence, let's focus on S in position 3: word: [1] [2] S [4] Y

Then U can be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 3 is S.

T can be in position 1 or 4.

Possible configurations:

Option A: T in position 1, then word: T [2] S [4] Y
- U must be in position 2 or 4? But if U in position 2: word: T U S [4] Y, which is like ""TUS?Y"" — possible? English words: ""tushy"" exists? Informal for buttocks, so T U S H Y → word ""tushy"", but H is allowed? Available letters: H is not excluded, yes. 
  Positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). 
  Check U position: U is in pos2, which is allowed (not pos3). T in pos1, which is allowed (not pos2 or5). S in pos3, which is allowed (not pos1 or4).

Option B: U in position 1, then word: U [2] S [4] Y
- T must be in position 4? Since T can be in 1 or4, but U is in1 so T in4: U [2] S T Y. 
  Words: ? Like ""JUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"", but ""GUSTY"" has G,U,S,T,Y. 
  U at pos1? Then word: U ? S T Y. 
  If position 2 is G? Then ""UGSTY""? Not a word. Maybe ""busky""? No.

Better to list real words.

Alternative: T in position 4, then word: [1] [2] S T Y
- Then U must be in position 1 or 2? 
  If U in position 1: U [2] S T Y → like ""BUSTY"" but A,B? ""BUSTY"" is a word: B U S T Y → positions: B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). 
  Check constraints: 
    - S is in pos3? Yes, allowed (not 1 or4).
    - T is in pos4? Yes, allowed (not 2 or5).
    - U is in pos2? Yes, allowed (not pos3).

But ""BUSTY"" uses B and U,S,T,Y — and B is available? Yes.

Or position 1 could be F: ""FUSTY"" → which means musty. F U S T Y.

Similarly, position 1 could be L: ""LUSTY"".

Now, from our case: if S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5, then U must be in 1 or 2? Above has U in2.

If U in position 1: then U at1, and position2 is the missing letter? Then U [2] S T Y → for [2] to be a letter. For example, ""J"" -> ""JUSTY""? Not a word. ""GUSTY"" has U in2? No ""GUSTY"" is G(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). So U is in position2.

Actually, in ""GUSTY"", U is in position2, not position1.

Can we have a word with U in position1? Like ""USTY""? No, not a word. So English words don't start with ""UY"" or similar? Probably not, so U cannot be in position1 if we have ""U.STY"" pattern? Indeed, no common words, so U must be in position2 when T is in4 and S in3? So word: [1] U S T Y

Then we need a consonant at the beginning: BUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY, etc.

Now, back to possible words:

1. Pattern with S in pos3: 
   - With T in pos1: then word T [2] S [4] Y. U must be in pos2 or pos4? But if U in pos4: T [2] S U Y → ends with ""SUY""? Unlikely. So assume U in pos2: T U S [4] Y. Then we need a letter for pos4: any consonant? For example, H: ""tushy"". Valid word.
   - With T in pos4: then [1] U S T Y → word must be ? U S T Y, like BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY.

2. Pattern with S in pos2: but earlier we saw it leads to U in pos4? Which conflicts with Y? Unless U is not directly before Y? But if S in pos2 and U in pos4: then word [1] S [3] U Y — then [3] must be a letter? And U is in pos4? Ends with ""UY"". Again, rare. Only one I can think of: ""saucy""? But A is excluded. ""spumy""? Not common and M? M is excluded. So unlikely.

Therefore, focus on S in pos3.

So possible words:
- Type A: T U S ? Y → ""tushy"" (if ?=H)
- Type B: ? U S T Y → e.g., ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"", etc.

In ""tushy"": positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). 
Check constraints: 
- U is in pos2: allowed? From feedback, U cannot be in pos3? Yes, so pos2 is okay.
- Also, we have S in pos3: not pos1 or4, okay.
- T in pos1: not pos2 or5? Feedback said T not in pos2 (from study) and not in pos5 (from moist), so pos1 is okay.

Similarly, for ""busty"": B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). 
T in pos4: okay? Yes, since T not forbidden in pos4.

But in both patterns, we are testing the positions. We need to guess a word that uses these.

Consider the feedback we have: with Y at end fixed, and we need to determine the other positions.

We also know U is present but not in pos3, yet we have S in3? So U must be elsewhere.

We don't know the middle letter? So we have to pick a word that fits.

Possible words:
- ""TUSHY"" 
- ""BUSTY""
- ""GUSTY""
- ""LUSTY""
- ""FUSTY""

But we have only one guess for now? Actually, we are making one guess.

We need to choose one to get more information.

Also, note that in ""study"", U was present and we got ""-"" meaning wrong position. In ""tushy"", U is in pos2? In ""study"", U was in pos3? But in ""tushy"", U is in pos2 which hasn't been tested before? Similarly, in ""busty"", U is also in pos2? In ""study"", we tried U in pos3, which was wrong.

Position for U: it cannot be pos3, but other positions are possible.

In both options, U is in pos2? For type B and type A? Not exactly:

- In ""tushy"": U is in pos2.
- In ""busty"": U is in pos2? ""B U S T Y"" — yes, pos2.

In fact, all these words have U in pos2 and S in pos3? Not necessarily.

""TUSHY"": T U S H Y → pos2:U, pos3:S.
""BUSTY"": B U S T Y → same pattern: pos2:U, pos3:S, then pos4:T.

In ""BUSTY"", S is in pos3, T in pos4, Y in5.

In ""TUSHY"", T in1, U in2, S in3, H in4, Y in5.

Pattern: both have U in position2? That might be a coincidence? Or not.

Is there a word with U in pos4? For example, with T in pos1 and U in pos4: T _ S U Y? But ""_"" must be a vowel? Or consonant? And then ""SUY"" ending — I can't find an English word. So perhaps U is always in pos2 in this pattern? Then position1 and position4 vary.

So the pattern is: [consonant] U S T Y → like BUSTY, etc., 
or T U S [consonant] Y → TUSHY.

Now, we have feedback that from ""study"", D is absent? But we might need to test other letters.

To choose a guess, we can pick a common word.

But note: in ""study"", we guessed D and it was absent, so avoid D? We already avoid.

Also, we need to use letters that could be present? Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

For example:
- ""LUSTY"" is common.
- ""GUSTY"" is common.

We already know Y is at5, so the word ends with STY? or not? In ""busty"", it ends with T Y, but the pattern is ...STY? Busty: B-U-S-T-Y, so the last two are T-Y, with S at position3.

We can choose ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.

Check:
- L: not tested before, common letter.
- Positions: S in pos3, T in pos4? Both allowed.

Alternatively, ""TUSHY"" uses H, which is common.

But let's see what information we get.

If we guess ""LUSTY"", letters: L,U,S,T,Y → all correct? Or not? We would get feedback on each.

But specifically:
- If L is present and correct? Or not? We don't know.

Similarly, U in pos2: if correct we get ✓ for U? Etc.

But we are on the fourth guess? We have more chances? We started with three guesses done? Guess 1,2,3 → this is guess 4.

So we can take a risk.

But to maximize information, we might want to cover more letters.

However, given the constraints, ""LUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"" seem reasonable.

We can also choose a word that has U in a different position? But we argued U in pos1 doesn't work, and U in pos4 unlikely.

So focus on U in pos2.

Guess ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.

Potential feedback:
- If L is in the word? If not, then we know only S,T,U,Y are present? Then the word must be like ""TUSHY"" with H.

But since we have only one missing letter? In the secret word, yes, because we have 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 and pos5=Y, pos3=S? Not necessarily fixed? Our guess could be wrong.

Actually, in our guess ""LUSTY"", we are assuming S in pos3 and U in pos2? But it might not be.

For example, if the secret word has U in pos4? But then pattern different? But we don't know.

Anyway, we need to guess.

I think ""LUSTY"" is a good choice.

Or ""busky""? Not a word.

Actually, let's list all common words that fit the pattern:
- With U in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, like ""BUSTY"", ""GUSTY"", ""LUSTY"".
- Or with T in pos1, U in pos2, S in pos3, and H in pos4: ""TUSHY"".

We can choose ""GUSTY"" to cover G? Or ""BUSTY"" for B.

But no strong preference.

I'll go with ""LUSTY"".

But note: ""lusty"" means strong and healthy? Yes.

So guess: ""LUSTY"".

Alternatively, consider that in ""study"", we had U in pos3 which was wrong, but if we put U in pos2 in this guess, it might be right.

But we don't know.

Process of elimination? We have limited time.

To be systematic, we can guess ""TUSHY"" to test the H? But H is a common letter.

But if ""tushy"" is not the word, we might waste a guess.

Similarly, guessing ""LUSTY"" tests L.

Same idea.

So guess ""LUSTY"".

<guess>lusty</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **First Guess (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), ruling out these letters.
- **Second Guess (""moist"")**: M, O, I absent (x); S and T present (-) but in wrong positions. S cannot be in position 4, T cannot be in position 5.
- **Third Guess (""study"")**: 
  - S absent from position 1 (-), T absent from position 2 (-), U present but not in position 3 (-), D absent (x), Y correct in position 5 (✓). 
  - This confirms Y is the last letter, and S, T, U are present but not in positions 1 (for S), 2 (for T), or 3 (for U). D is now ruled out.

From this:
- **Secret word ends with Y**: Pattern is `_ _ _ _ Y`.
- **Confirmed letters**: S, T, U, Y must appear, with Y fixed at position 5.
- **S position constraints**: Not in position 1 or 4 → S must be in position 2 or 3.
- **T position constraints**: Not in position 2 or 5 → T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **U position constraints**: Not in position 3 → U must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D → Available letters include B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Given these constraints, possible words must place S in position 2 or 3, with U and T in valid positions. Common word patterns:
- With S in position 3 and U in position 2 (e.g., `_ U S T Y` or `T U S _ Y`).
- Considering available letters and word validity (e.g., ""tushy"", ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"").

""Lusty"" fits:
- Positions: L(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) → S in position 3 (allowed), U in position 2 (allowed, not position 3), T in position 4 (allowed, not position 2 or 5).
- Tests L as a new common consonant.
- Maximizes information: Covers critical positions for S, T, U while introducing a new letter (L) for feedback.

<guess>lusty</guess>",lusty,"We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": All letters absent → Secret word has no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I absent; S and T present but wrong position (S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
3. ""study"": S(-) meaning S is present but not in position 1, T(-) present but not in position 2, U(-) present but wrong position, D(x) absent, Y(✓) meaning Y is correct and in position 5.

Key deductions:
- Y is in the secret word and position 5 is correct → Secret word ends with Y.
- S, T, U are present in the secret word, but:
  - S is not in position 1 (from ""study"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist"") → possible positions: 2,3
  - T is not in position 2 (from ""study"") and not in position 5 (from ""moist"") → possible positions: 1,3,4
  - U is present but not in position 3 (from ""study"") → possible positions: 1,2,4
- D is absent → Secret word has no D.
- Additional absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D

Present letters: S, T, U, Y (with Y fixed at position 5).

Since Y is fixed at the end, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ Y

Now, letters we must include: S, T, U (each at least once). And no other letters from the absent set.

Available letters: From the alphabet, excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D → Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and we have S,T,U,Y confirmed).

But note: We might have duplicate letters? Not ruled out, but in our feedback so far, all letters tested were single, so assume no duplicates for now to minimize complexity.

So, the secret word has 4 distinct known letters: S,T,U,Y plus one more. But we have 5 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 5 being Y.

The missing letter (for position 4? or others) must be from available consonants: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

We have constraints on positions:
- S: not pos1 (from ""study""), not pos4 (from ""moist"") → so must be in 2 or 3.
- T: not pos2 (from ""study""), not pos5 (from ""moist"") → so must be in 1,3,4.
- U: not pos3 (from ""study"") → so must be in 1,2,4.

Also, position 5 is Y.

Furthermore, from ""study"", the feedback was:
- S: present but not pos1 → and we place S in 1 in ""study"", so not there.
- T: present but not pos2 → we had T in pos2, so not there.
- U: present but not pos3 → we had U in pos3, so not there.
- D: absent
- Y: correct at pos5.

We need to form a word of the form: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] [pos4] Y

With S in {2,3}, T in {1,3,4}, U in {1,2,4}.

And the letters must include S,T,U,Y and one more letter.

Now, let's consider possible positions:

Case 1: S in position 2.
Then, position 2 is S. Then:
- U cannot be in position 2? Wait, position 2 is occupied by S, so U must be in 1 or 4.
- T must be in 1,3,4.

But position 2 is S, so U cannot be there anyway.

Subcases:
- If S is in 2: then word: [1] S [3] [4] Y
  Then T and U must be in the remaining positions: 1,3,4.

Possible:
  - T in 1 → then U must be in 4 (since U cannot be in 3, because U cannot be in 3 per feedback? No: U cannot be in pos3, so if T is in 1, U must be in 4. Then position 3 is free for another letter.
  - T in 3 → then U must be in 1 or 4. But if U in 1, then position 3 is T, which is okay? Position 3: if T is there, no problem. But U cannot be in 3, but T can be in 3. Then U in 1 or 4.
  - T in 4 → then U must be in 1 (since U cannot be in 3) and position 3 is free.

Case 2: S in position 3.
Then word: [1] [2] S [4] Y
- U cannot be in 3 (occupied by S) so U in 1,2, or 4? But U cannot be in 3 and 3 is occupied, so U in 1,2, or 4 — but no conflict because U just can't be in pos3, and pos3 isn't U.
- T in 1,3,4 — but pos3 is S, so T in 1 or 4.

Then:
- U in any position except 3 (but 3 is taken) so U in 1,2,4.
- T in 1 or 4.

But also, if T in 1, U can be in 2 or 4. If T in 4, U can be in 1 or 2.

Now, we need to choose which case and pick a word.

But we also have to include the missing letter.

Moreover, we want to test possibilities to narrow down.

Since Y is fixed at the end and we have S,T,U,Y, we can aim to form a word with one more letter.

List possible words:

First, with S in position 2: then word: _ S _ _ Y
Then:
- T in 1: then T S _ U Y → but position 4 must be U? Or could be the missing letter? Wait, we have S in 2 and T in 1 fixed? Then positions 3 and 4 are free for U and the missing letter? But U must be in the word. So if T is in 1 and S in 2, then U can be in position 4? Then word: T S ? U Y, but position 3 must be the missing letter.

Words like ""TSU?Y"" — but that's not standard.

What words end with ""UY""? Not common. U before Y? Actually, almost no English words have ""U"" directly before ""Y"" at the end. Words ending in ""Y"" rarely have U directly before? Like ""buy"", ""guy"", etc., but that's a different vowel. Not U.

Hence, U cannot be in position 4 if position 5 is Y? Because position 4 is U and then ""UY"" — not common. Although there is ""glugy""? Not a word. So probably not.

Similarly, if U is in position 4: [1] [2] S U Y → but ends with ""SUY""? Not plausible.

Therefore, case S in position 2 might be difficult because U cannot be in position 4 without creating an awkward ending.

Hence, let's focus on S in position 3: word: [1] [2] S [4] Y

Then U can be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 3 is S.

T can be in position 1 or 4.

Possible configurations:

Option A: T in position 1, then word: T [2] S [4] Y
- U must be in position 2 or 4? But if U in position 2: word: T U S [4] Y, which is like ""TUS?Y"" — possible? English words: ""tushy"" exists? Informal for buttocks, so T U S H Y → word ""tushy"", but H is allowed? Available letters: H is not excluded, yes. 
  Positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). 
  Check U position: U is in pos2, which is allowed (not pos3). T in pos1, which is allowed (not pos2 or5). S in pos3, which is allowed (not pos1 or4).

Option B: U in position 1, then word: U [2] S [4] Y
- T must be in position 4? Since T can be in 1 or4, but U is in1 so T in4: U [2] S T Y. 
  Words: ? Like ""JUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"", but ""GUSTY"" has G,U,S,T,Y. 
  U at pos1? Then word: U ? S T Y. 
  If position 2 is G? Then ""UGSTY""? Not a word. Maybe ""busky""? No.

Better to list real words.

Alternative: T in position 4, then word: [1] [2] S T Y
- Then U must be in position 1 or 2? 
  If U in position 1: U [2] S T Y → like ""BUSTY"" but A,B? ""BUSTY"" is a word: B U S T Y → positions: B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). 
  Check constraints: 
    - S is in pos3? Yes, allowed (not 1 or4).
    - T is in pos4? Yes, allowed (not 2 or5).
    - U is in pos2? Yes, allowed (not pos3).

But ""BUSTY"" uses B and U,S,T,Y — and B is available? Yes.

Or position 1 could be F: ""FUSTY"" → which means musty. F U S T Y.

Similarly, position 1 could be L: ""LUSTY"".

Now, from our case: if S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5, then U must be in 1 or 2? Above has U in2.

If U in position 1: then U at1, and position2 is the missing letter? Then U [2] S T Y → for [2] to be a letter. For example, ""J"" -> ""JUSTY""? Not a word. ""GUSTY"" has U in2? No ""GUSTY"" is G(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). So U is in position2.

Actually, in ""GUSTY"", U is in position2, not position1.

Can we have a word with U in position1? Like ""USTY""? No, not a word. So English words don't start with ""UY"" or similar? Probably not, so U cannot be in position1 if we have ""U.STY"" pattern? Indeed, no common words, so U must be in position2 when T is in4 and S in3? So word: [1] U S T Y

Then we need a consonant at the beginning: BUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY, etc.

Now, back to possible words:

1. Pattern with S in pos3: 
   - With T in pos1: then word T [2] S [4] Y. U must be in pos2 or pos4? But if U in pos4: T [2] S U Y → ends with ""SUY""? Unlikely. So assume U in pos2: T U S [4] Y. Then we need a letter for pos4: any consonant? For example, H: ""tushy"". Valid word.
   - With T in pos4: then [1] U S T Y → word must be ? U S T Y, like BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY.

2. Pattern with S in pos2: but earlier we saw it leads to U in pos4? Which conflicts with Y? Unless U is not directly before Y? But if S in pos2 and U in pos4: then word [1] S [3] U Y — then [3] must be a letter? And U is in pos4? Ends with ""UY"". Again, rare. Only one I can think of: ""saucy""? But A is excluded. ""spumy""? Not common and M? M is excluded. So unlikely.

Therefore, focus on S in pos3.

So possible words:
- Type A: T U S ? Y → ""tushy"" (if ?=H)
- Type B: ? U S T Y → e.g., ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"", etc.

In ""tushy"": positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). 
Check constraints: 
- U is in pos2: allowed? From feedback, U cannot be in pos3? Yes, so pos2 is okay.
- Also, we have S in pos3: not pos1 or4, okay.
- T in pos1: not pos2 or5? Feedback said T not in pos2 (from study) and not in pos5 (from moist), so pos1 is okay.

Similarly, for ""busty"": B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). 
T in pos4: okay? Yes, since T not forbidden in pos4.

But in both patterns, we are testing the positions. We need to guess a word that uses these.

Consider the feedback we have: with Y at end fixed, and we need to determine the other positions.

We also know U is present but not in pos3, yet we have S in3? So U must be elsewhere.

We don't know the middle letter? So we have to pick a word that fits.

Possible words:
- ""TUSHY"" 
- ""BUSTY""
- ""GUSTY""
- ""LUSTY""
- ""FUSTY""

But we have only one guess for now? Actually, we are making one guess.

We need to choose one to get more information.

Also, note that in ""study"", U was present and we got ""-"" meaning wrong position. In ""tushy"", U is in pos2? In ""study"", U was in pos3? But in ""tushy"", U is in pos2 which hasn't been tested before? Similarly, in ""busty"", U is also in pos2? In ""study"", we tried U in pos3, which was wrong.

Position for U: it cannot be pos3, but other positions are possible.

In both options, U is in pos2? For type B and type A? Not exactly:

- In ""tushy"": U is in pos2.
- In ""busty"": U is in pos2? ""B U S T Y"" — yes, pos2.

In fact, all these words have U in pos2 and S in pos3? Not necessarily.

""TUSHY"": T U S H Y → pos2:U, pos3:S.
""BUSTY"": B U S T Y → same pattern: pos2:U, pos3:S, then pos4:T.

In ""BUSTY"", S is in pos3, T in pos4, Y in5.

In ""TUSHY"", T in1, U in2, S in3, H in4, Y in5.

Pattern: both have U in position2? That might be a coincidence? Or not.

Is there a word with U in pos4? For example, with T in pos1 and U in pos4: T _ S U Y? But ""_"" must be a vowel? Or consonant? And then ""SUY"" ending — I can't find an English word. So perhaps U is always in pos2 in this pattern? Then position1 and position4 vary.

So the pattern is: [consonant] U S T Y → like BUSTY, etc., 
or T U S [consonant] Y → TUSHY.

Now, we have feedback that from ""study"", D is absent? But we might need to test other letters.

To choose a guess, we can pick a common word.

But note: in ""study"", we guessed D and it was absent, so avoid D? We already avoid.

Also, we need to use letters that could be present? Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

For example:
- ""LUSTY"" is common.
- ""GUSTY"" is common.

We already know Y is at5, so the word ends with STY? or not? In ""busty"", it ends with T Y, but the pattern is ...STY? Busty: B-U-S-T-Y, so the last two are T-Y, with S at position3.

We can choose ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.

Check:
- L: not tested before, common letter.
- Positions: S in pos3, T in pos4? Both allowed.

Alternatively, ""TUSHY"" uses H, which is common.

But let's see what information we get.

If we guess ""LUSTY"", letters: L,U,S,T,Y → all correct? Or not? We would get feedback on each.

But specifically:
- If L is present and correct? Or not? We don't know.

Similarly, U in pos2: if correct we get ✓ for U? Etc.

But we are on the fourth guess? We have more chances? We started with three guesses done? Guess 1,2,3 → this is guess 4.

So we can take a risk.

But to maximize information, we might want to cover more letters.

However, given the constraints, ""LUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"" seem reasonable.

We can also choose a word that has U in a different position? But we argued U in pos1 doesn't work, and U in pos4 unlikely.

So focus on U in pos2.

Guess ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.

Potential feedback:
- If L is in the word? If not, then we know only S,T,U,Y are present? Then the word must be like ""TUSHY"" with H.

But since we have only one missing letter? In the secret word, yes, because we have 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 and pos5=Y, pos3=S? Not necessarily fixed? Our guess could be wrong.

Actually, in our guess ""LUSTY"", we are assuming S in pos3 and U in pos2? But it might not be.

For example, if the secret word has U in pos4? But then pattern different? But we don't know.

Anyway, we need to guess.

I think ""LUSTY"" is a good choice.

Or ""busky""? Not a word.

Actually, let's list all common words that fit the pattern:
- With U in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, like ""BUSTY"", ""GUSTY"", ""LUSTY"".
- Or with T in pos1, U in pos2, S in pos3, and H in pos4: ""TUSHY"".

We can choose ""GUSTY"" to cover G? Or ""BUSTY"" for B.

But no strong preference.

I'll go with ""LUSTY"".

But note: ""lusty"" means strong and healthy? Yes.

So guess: ""LUSTY"".

Alternatively, consider that in ""study"", we had U in pos3 which was wrong, but if we put U in pos2 in this guess, it might be right.

But we don't know.

Process of elimination? We have limited time.

To be systematic, we can guess ""TUSHY"" to test the H? But H is a common letter.

But if ""tushy"" is not the word, we might waste a guess.

Similarly, guessing ""LUSTY"" tests L.

Same idea.

So guess ""LUSTY"".

<guess>lusty</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **First Guess (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), ruling out these letters.
- **Second Guess (""moist"")**: M, O, I absent (x); S and T present (-) but in wrong positions. S cannot be in position 4, T cannot be in position 5.
- **Third Guess (""study"")**: 
  - S absent from position 1 (-), T absent from position 2 (-), U present but not in position 3 (-), D absent (x), Y correct in position 5 (✓). 
  - This confirms Y is the last letter, and S, T, U are present but not in positions 1 (for S), 2 (for T), or 3 (for U). D is now ruled out.

From this:
- **Secret word ends with Y**: Pattern is `_ _ _ _ Y`.
- **Confirmed letters**: S, T, U, Y must appear, with Y fixed at position 5.
- **S position constraints**: Not in position 1 or 4 → S must be in position 2 or 3.
- **T position constraints**: Not in position 2 or 5 → T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **U position constraints**: Not in position 3 → U must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D → Available letters include B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Given these constraints, possible words must place S in position 2 or 3, with U and T in valid positions. Common word patterns:
- With S in position 3 and U in position 2 (e.g., `_ U S T Y` or `T U S _ Y`).
- Considering available letters and word validity (e.g., ""tushy"", ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"").

""Lusty"" fits:
- Positions: L(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) → S in position 3 (allowed), U in position 2 (allowed, not position 3), T in position 4 (allowed, not position 2 or 5).
- Tests L as a new common consonant.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We start over. The feedback for the first guess ""crane"" shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This means the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since these are common letters, we need to pick a new word that avoids these letters entirely.

 Let me think of a 5-letter word that uses letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
 The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Some common letters left are: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 A good starting word might be ""SLOTH"", but let's check if it uses any disallowed letters: S, L, O, T, H -> none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}, so it's valid.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S -> also valid.

 Another common one: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L.

 But note: we want to cover more frequent letters. In English, after the ones we've eliminated, the next most common might be S, T, L, O, etc.

 According to letter frequency, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. We've eliminated E, A, O? Wait, we eliminated A and E but not O? 
 Correction: We only eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So O is still available.

 Letter frequency without the eliminated ones: 
 The top remaining letters are: O, T, I, S, H, D, L, U, M, P, etc.

 So a word that uses several of these would be good.

 Consider ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> all allowed.

 Another: ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> also good.

 Or ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same set.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are relatively common and distinct.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. U is less common than T and M, so ""MOIST"" might be better.

 Let me decide on ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- None of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.  
- Therefore, the secret word uses letters excluding this set.  

For the next guess, I aimed for a word with common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}, prioritizing letters like S, T, O, I, M (based on English frequency). ""Moist"" uses M, O, I, S, T—all unused letters—and provides broad new information.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M(x), O(x), I(x) -> absent
   - S(-) -> present but in wrong position
   - T(-) -> present but in wrong position

Therefore, the secret word contains S and T, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", S was the 4th letter and T was the 5th. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

Available letters: from the alphabet, excluding {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I}. 
Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S and T are in the word, so we must include them.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and T (both present)
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I
- S is not in the 4th position, T is not in the 5th position.

We have 3 more letters to choose from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the available: S, T, L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also need to consider the positions. Since S and T are in the word but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively, we can try placing them in other positions.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th (but not 4th). However, note that in the word we choose, we can put S and T in any position except the ones that were in ""moist"" for those letters? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"" it was in 4th and got '-', meaning it's present but not there). Similarly, T is not in the 5th position.

But we don't know the positions of S and T in the secret word. So we have to try a word that has S and T in positions other than 4th for S and 5th for T.

We also have 3 other letters to choose.

Let's think of words that have S and T and three other letters from the available set.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""BUSTS"" -> but has S at the end (5th) and also has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback so far, we don't have any duplicate letters. But we must consider that the secret word might have duplicates.

But note: in ""moist"", we had one S and one T, and both were marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two S's, then the feedback might have shown two '-' for S? But in ""moist"" we only had one S, so we only get one feedback for S. Similarly for T.

So we cannot rule out duplicates, but we don't have evidence for them either.

We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Let me try to list words with S and T and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""SHUNT"" -> but H and U are available? Let's check: H and U are in the available set. However, ""SHUNT"": 
  S in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th. But wait, N is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: N is absent). So we cannot use N.

We must avoid forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.

So ""SHUNT"" has N -> invalid.

Another: ""BUSTY"" -> B, U, S, T, Y. 
- B, U, Y are allowed? Yes. 
- Positions: S is 3rd, T is 4th. 
  But note: in ""moist"", S was in 4th and got '-', meaning S is not in 4th in the secret word. But in ""BUSTY"", S is in 3rd, which is okay. T is in 4th? The feedback for T in ""moist"" was that T is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th? Yes, because the feedback only said T is not in 5th. So T in 4th is allowed.

But we also have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong? Only for the specific letters: S cannot be in 4th, T cannot be in 5th. In ""BUSTY"", T is in 4th, which is not forbidden (only 5th is forbidden for T). So that's okay.

But let's check the word: B U S T Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.

We need to make sure the word is valid. ""BUSTY"" is a word (meaning curvy in figure).

Another option: ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. L is allowed.

But we don't have any information about L, so it might be good to test it.

However, we also want to cover more common letters.

Another common word: ""DUTY"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""STUDY"" -> S, T, U, D, Y. 
- S in 1st, T in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th.
- This word: 
  - S is in 1st (not 4th, so okay)
  - T is in 2nd (not 5th, so okay)
  - Uses U, D, Y which are available.

""STUDY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DUSTY"" -> D, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

Both ""STUDY"" and ""DUSTY"" are options.

But note: in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try to put S and T in positions that we haven't tested. In ""moist"", we had S in 4th and T in 5th. Now we can try S in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th and T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

But we have to avoid the forbidden positions: S not 4th, T not 5th.

So for S: positions 1,2,3,5 are allowed.
For T: positions 1,2,3,4 are allowed.

We also want to test other common letters. Among the available, common consonants: L, D, P, H, U, B, etc.

Let me think of a word that uses S, T, and then L, D, or H.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but E and A are forbidden.

""LIGHT"" -> no S.

""SHIFT"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But I is forbidden (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So invalid.

""THUDS"" -> T, H, U, D, S. 
- Positions: T in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, S in 5th.
- This word: 
  - T is in 1st (allowed, since T not 5th)
  - S is in 5th (allowed, since S not 4th)
  - Uses H, U, D which are available.

""THUDS"" is a word (meaning a dull sound, like a thud).

Another: ""BLAST"" -> but A is forbidden.

""GUSTY"" -> G, U, S, T, Y. 
- S in 3rd, T in 4th.

I think ""STUDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places S and T in new positions.

But let's consider: in ""STUDY"", we have S in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word has S in 1st, we would get a check (✓) for S, and similarly for T. If not, we might get '-' or 'x'. Also, we test U, D, Y.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has S and T in positions that are less common to see if they are fixed? But that might be less efficient.

I think ""STUDY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: since we know S and T are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested and also use three new letters.

In ""moist"", we tested positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. So we have feedback for each position.

For the secret word, we know:
- Position 1: cannot be M, and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). Also, it cannot be O or I (from second guess). So position 1 must be one of the remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we know S and T are in the word, but they might be in position 1? Yes.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we don't have direct constraints on positions except that S is not in 4 and T is not in 5.

Given that, I think ""STUDY"" is a good guess.

Let me write it: S T U D Y.

But wait, in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word does not have S in 1st, we get '-' for S, and similarly for T. Also, we test U, D, Y.

We might get more information.

Another word: ""PULPS"" -> but P and L are available, but S is at the end. However, we have two P's? That might not be ideal.

I think ""STUDY"" is better.

So I'll go with ""STUDY"".

<guess>study</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- The first guess ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- The second guess ""moist"" had M, O, I marked as absent (x), and S and T marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains S and T, but S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th position.
  - The secret word does not contain M, O, I (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S and T confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and T (since they are present in the secret word).
- S cannot be in the 4th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).
- T cannot be in the 5th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).
- Avoid all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I).
- Aim for common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""study"" fits these criteria:
- Contains S (1st position) and T (2nd position), both in new positions not yet ruled out.
- Uses additional common letters: U, D, Y (all from the available set).
- Tests S in position 1 and T in position 2, which could provide valuable positional feedback.

<guess>study</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(-)
Guess 3: study -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) D(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": All letters absent → Secret word has no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I absent; S and T present but wrong position (S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
3. ""study"": S(-) meaning S is present but not in position 1, T(-) present but not in position 2, U(-) present but wrong position, D(x) absent, Y(✓) meaning Y is correct and in position 5.

Key deductions:
- Y is in the secret word and position 5 is correct → Secret word ends with Y.
- S, T, U are present in the secret word, but:
  - S is not in position 1 (from ""study"") and not in position 4 (from ""moist"") → possible positions: 2,3
  - T is not in position 2 (from ""study"") and not in position 5 (from ""moist"") → possible positions: 1,3,4
  - U is present but not in position 3 (from ""study"") → possible positions: 1,2,4
- D is absent → Secret word has no D.
- Additional absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D

Present letters: S, T, U, Y (with Y fixed at position 5).

Since Y is fixed at the end, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ Y

Now, letters we must include: S, T, U (each at least once). And no other letters from the absent set.

Available letters: From the alphabet, excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D → Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and we have S,T,U,Y confirmed).

But note: We might have duplicate letters? Not ruled out, but in our feedback so far, all letters tested were single, so assume no duplicates for now to minimize complexity.

So, the secret word has 4 distinct known letters: S,T,U,Y plus one more. But we have 5 positions: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 5 being Y.

The missing letter (for position 4? or others) must be from available consonants: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

We have constraints on positions:
- S: not pos1 (from ""study""), not pos4 (from ""moist"") → so must be in 2 or 3.
- T: not pos2 (from ""study""), not pos5 (from ""moist"") → so must be in 1,3,4.
- U: not pos3 (from ""study"") → so must be in 1,2,4.

Also, position 5 is Y.

Furthermore, from ""study"", the feedback was:
- S: present but not pos1 → and we place S in 1 in ""study"", so not there.
- T: present but not pos2 → we had T in pos2, so not there.
- U: present but not pos3 → we had U in pos3, so not there.
- D: absent
- Y: correct at pos5.

We need to form a word of the form: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] [pos4] Y

With S in {2,3}, T in {1,3,4}, U in {1,2,4}.

And the letters must include S,T,U,Y and one more letter.

Now, let's consider possible positions:

Case 1: S in position 2.
Then, position 2 is S. Then:
- U cannot be in position 2? Wait, position 2 is occupied by S, so U must be in 1 or 4.
- T must be in 1,3,4.

But position 2 is S, so U cannot be there anyway.

Subcases:
- If S is in 2: then word: [1] S [3] [4] Y
  Then T and U must be in the remaining positions: 1,3,4.

Possible:
  - T in 1 → then U must be in 4 (since U cannot be in 3, because U cannot be in 3 per feedback? No: U cannot be in pos3, so if T is in 1, U must be in 4. Then position 3 is free for another letter.
  - T in 3 → then U must be in 1 or 4. But if U in 1, then position 3 is T, which is okay? Position 3: if T is there, no problem. But U cannot be in 3, but T can be in 3. Then U in 1 or 4.
  - T in 4 → then U must be in 1 (since U cannot be in 3) and position 3 is free.

Case 2: S in position 3.
Then word: [1] [2] S [4] Y
- U cannot be in 3 (occupied by S) so U in 1,2, or 4? But U cannot be in 3 and 3 is occupied, so U in 1,2, or 4 — but no conflict because U just can't be in pos3, and pos3 isn't U.
- T in 1,3,4 — but pos3 is S, so T in 1 or 4.

Then:
- U in any position except 3 (but 3 is taken) so U in 1,2,4.
- T in 1 or 4.

But also, if T in 1, U can be in 2 or 4. If T in 4, U can be in 1 or 2.

Now, we need to choose which case and pick a word.

But we also have to include the missing letter.

Moreover, we want to test possibilities to narrow down.

Since Y is fixed at the end and we have S,T,U,Y, we can aim to form a word with one more letter.

List possible words:

First, with S in position 2: then word: _ S _ _ Y
Then:
- T in 1: then T S _ U Y → but position 4 must be U? Or could be the missing letter? Wait, we have S in 2 and T in 1 fixed? Then positions 3 and 4 are free for U and the missing letter? But U must be in the word. So if T is in 1 and S in 2, then U can be in position 4? Then word: T S ? U Y, but position 3 must be the missing letter.

Words like ""TSU?Y"" — but that's not standard.

What words end with ""UY""? Not common. U before Y? Actually, almost no English words have ""U"" directly before ""Y"" at the end. Words ending in ""Y"" rarely have U directly before? Like ""buy"", ""guy"", etc., but that's a different vowel. Not U.

Hence, U cannot be in position 4 if position 5 is Y? Because position 4 is U and then ""UY"" — not common. Although there is ""glugy""? Not a word. So probably not.

Similarly, if U is in position 4: [1] [2] S U Y → but ends with ""SUY""? Not plausible.

Therefore, case S in position 2 might be difficult because U cannot be in position 4 without creating an awkward ending.

Hence, let's focus on S in position 3: word: [1] [2] S [4] Y

Then U can be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 3 is S.

T can be in position 1 or 4.

Possible configurations:

Option A: T in position 1, then word: T [2] S [4] Y
- U must be in position 2 or 4? But if U in position 2: word: T U S [4] Y, which is like ""TUS?Y"" — possible? English words: ""tushy"" exists? Informal for buttocks, so T U S H Y → word ""tushy"", but H is allowed? Available letters: H is not excluded, yes. 
  Positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). 
  Check U position: U is in pos2, which is allowed (not pos3). T in pos1, which is allowed (not pos2 or5). S in pos3, which is allowed (not pos1 or4).

Option B: U in position 1, then word: U [2] S [4] Y
- T must be in position 4? Since T can be in 1 or4, but U is in1 so T in4: U [2] S T Y. 
  Words: ? Like ""JUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"", but ""GUSTY"" has G,U,S,T,Y. 
  U at pos1? Then word: U ? S T Y. 
  If position 2 is G? Then ""UGSTY""? Not a word. Maybe ""busky""? No.

Better to list real words.

Alternative: T in position 4, then word: [1] [2] S T Y
- Then U must be in position 1 or 2? 
  If U in position 1: U [2] S T Y → like ""BUSTY"" but A,B? ""BUSTY"" is a word: B U S T Y → positions: B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). 
  Check constraints: 
    - S is in pos3? Yes, allowed (not 1 or4).
    - T is in pos4? Yes, allowed (not 2 or5).
    - U is in pos2? Yes, allowed (not pos3).

But ""BUSTY"" uses B and U,S,T,Y — and B is available? Yes.

Or position 1 could be F: ""FUSTY"" → which means musty. F U S T Y.

Similarly, position 1 could be L: ""LUSTY"".

Now, from our case: if S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5, then U must be in 1 or 2? Above has U in2.

If U in position 1: then U at1, and position2 is the missing letter? Then U [2] S T Y → for [2] to be a letter. For example, ""J"" -> ""JUSTY""? Not a word. ""GUSTY"" has U in2? No ""GUSTY"" is G(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). So U is in position2.

Actually, in ""GUSTY"", U is in position2, not position1.

Can we have a word with U in position1? Like ""USTY""? No, not a word. So English words don't start with ""UY"" or similar? Probably not, so U cannot be in position1 if we have ""U.STY"" pattern? Indeed, no common words, so U must be in position2 when T is in4 and S in3? So word: [1] U S T Y

Then we need a consonant at the beginning: BUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY, etc.

Now, back to possible words:

1. Pattern with S in pos3: 
   - With T in pos1: then word T [2] S [4] Y. U must be in pos2 or pos4? But if U in pos4: T [2] S U Y → ends with ""SUY""? Unlikely. So assume U in pos2: T U S [4] Y. Then we need a letter for pos4: any consonant? For example, H: ""tushy"". Valid word.
   - With T in pos4: then [1] U S T Y → word must be ? U S T Y, like BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY.

2. Pattern with S in pos2: but earlier we saw it leads to U in pos4? Which conflicts with Y? Unless U is not directly before Y? But if S in pos2 and U in pos4: then word [1] S [3] U Y — then [3] must be a letter? And U is in pos4? Ends with ""UY"". Again, rare. Only one I can think of: ""saucy""? But A is excluded. ""spumy""? Not common and M? M is excluded. So unlikely.

Therefore, focus on S in pos3.

So possible words:
- Type A: T U S ? Y → ""tushy"" (if ?=H)
- Type B: ? U S T Y → e.g., ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"", etc.

In ""tushy"": positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). 
Check constraints: 
- U is in pos2: allowed? From feedback, U cannot be in pos3? Yes, so pos2 is okay.
- Also, we have S in pos3: not pos1 or4, okay.
- T in pos1: not pos2 or5? Feedback said T not in pos2 (from study) and not in pos5 (from moist), so pos1 is okay.

Similarly, for ""busty"": B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). 
T in pos4: okay? Yes, since T not forbidden in pos4.

But in both patterns, we are testing the positions. We need to guess a word that uses these.

Consider the feedback we have: with Y at end fixed, and we need to determine the other positions.

We also know U is present but not in pos3, yet we have S in3? So U must be elsewhere.

We don't know the middle letter? So we have to pick a word that fits.

Possible words:
- ""TUSHY"" 
- ""BUSTY""
- ""GUSTY""
- ""LUSTY""
- ""FUSTY""

But we have only one guess for now? Actually, we are making one guess.

We need to choose one to get more information.

Also, note that in ""study"", U was present and we got ""-"" meaning wrong position. In ""tushy"", U is in pos2? In ""study"", U was in pos3? But in ""tushy"", U is in pos2 which hasn't been tested before? Similarly, in ""busty"", U is also in pos2? In ""study"", we tried U in pos3, which was wrong.

Position for U: it cannot be pos3, but other positions are possible.

In both options, U is in pos2? For type B and type A? Not exactly:

- In ""tushy"": U is in pos2.
- In ""busty"": U is in pos2? ""B U S T Y"" — yes, pos2.

In fact, all these words have U in pos2 and S in pos3? Not necessarily.

""TUSHY"": T U S H Y → pos2:U, pos3:S.
""BUSTY"": B U S T Y → same pattern: pos2:U, pos3:S, then pos4:T.

In ""BUSTY"", S is in pos3, T in pos4, Y in5.

In ""TUSHY"", T in1, U in2, S in3, H in4, Y in5.

Pattern: both have U in position2? That might be a coincidence? Or not.

Is there a word with U in pos4? For example, with T in pos1 and U in pos4: T _ S U Y? But ""_"" must be a vowel? Or consonant? And then ""SUY"" ending — I can't find an English word. So perhaps U is always in pos2 in this pattern? Then position1 and position4 vary.

So the pattern is: [consonant] U S T Y → like BUSTY, etc., 
or T U S [consonant] Y → TUSHY.

Now, we have feedback that from ""study"", D is absent? But we might need to test other letters.

To choose a guess, we can pick a common word.

But note: in ""study"", we guessed D and it was absent, so avoid D? We already avoid.

Also, we need to use letters that could be present? Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

For example:
- ""LUSTY"" is common.
- ""GUSTY"" is common.

We already know Y is at5, so the word ends with STY? or not? In ""busty"", it ends with T Y, but the pattern is ...STY? Busty: B-U-S-T-Y, so the last two are T-Y, with S at position3.

We can choose ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.

Check:
- L: not tested before, common letter.
- Positions: S in pos3, T in pos4? Both allowed.

Alternatively, ""TUSHY"" uses H, which is common.

But let's see what information we get.

If we guess ""LUSTY"", letters: L,U,S,T,Y → all correct? Or not? We would get feedback on each.

But specifically:
- If L is present and correct? Or not? We don't know.

Similarly, U in pos2: if correct we get ✓ for U? Etc.

But we are on the fourth guess? We have more chances? We started with three guesses done? Guess 1,2,3 → this is guess 4.

So we can take a risk.

But to maximize information, we might want to cover more letters.

However, given the constraints, ""LUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"" seem reasonable.

We can also choose a word that has U in a different position? But we argued U in pos1 doesn't work, and U in pos4 unlikely.

So focus on U in pos2.

Guess ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.

Potential feedback:
- If L is in the word? If not, then we know only S,T,U,Y are present? Then the word must be like ""TUSHY"" with H.

But since we have only one missing letter? In the secret word, yes, because we have 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 and pos5=Y, pos3=S? Not necessarily fixed? Our guess could be wrong.

Actually, in our guess ""LUSTY"", we are assuming S in pos3 and U in pos2? But it might not be.

For example, if the secret word has U in pos4? But then pattern different? But we don't know.

Anyway, we need to guess.

I think ""LUSTY"" is a good choice.

Or ""busky""? Not a word.

Actually, let's list all common words that fit the pattern:
- With U in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, like ""BUSTY"", ""GUSTY"", ""LUSTY"".
- Or with T in pos1, U in pos2, S in pos3, and H in pos4: ""TUSHY"".

We can choose ""GUSTY"" to cover G? Or ""BUSTY"" for B.

But no strong preference.

I'll go with ""LUSTY"".

But note: ""lusty"" means strong and healthy? Yes.

So guess: ""LUSTY"".

Alternatively, consider that in ""study"", we had U in pos3 which was wrong, but if we put U in pos2 in this guess, it might be right.

But we don't know.

Process of elimination? We have limited time.

To be systematic, we can guess ""TUSHY"" to test the H? But H is a common letter.

But if ""tushy"" is not the word, we might waste a guess.

Similarly, guessing ""LUSTY"" tests L.

Same idea.

So guess ""LUSTY"".

<guess>lusty</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **First Guess (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), ruling out these letters.
- **Second Guess (""moist"")**: M, O, I absent (x); S and T present (-) but in wrong positions. S cannot be in position 4, T cannot be in position 5.
- **Third Guess (""study"")**: 
  - S absent from position 1 (-), T absent from position 2 (-), U present but not in position 3 (-), D absent (x), Y correct in position 5 (✓). 
  - This confirms Y is the last letter, and S, T, U are present but not in positions 1 (for S), 2 (for T), or 3 (for U). D is now ruled out.

From this:
- **Secret word ends with Y**: Pattern is `_ _ _ _ Y`.
- **Confirmed letters**: S, T, U, Y must appear, with Y fixed at position 5.
- **S position constraints**: Not in position 1 or 4 → S must be in position 2 or 3.
- **T position constraints**: Not in position 2 or 5 → T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **U position constraints**: Not in position 3 → U must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D → Available letters include B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Given these constraints, possible words must place S in position 2 or 3, with U and T in valid positions. Common word patterns:
- With S in position 3 and U in position 2 (e.g., `_ U S T Y` or `T U S _ Y`).
- Considering available letters and word validity (e.g., ""tushy"", ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"").

""Lusty"" fits:
- Positions: L(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) → S in position 3 (allowed), U in position 2 (allowed, not position 3), T in position 4 (allowed, not position 2 or 5).
- Tests L as a new common consonant.
- Maximizes information: Covers critical positions for S, T, U while introducing a new letter (L) for feedback.

From ""moist"": \n   - M(x), O(x), I(x) -> absent\n   - S(-) -> present but in wrong position\n   - T(-) -> present but in wrong position\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains S and T, but not in the positions they were in ""moist"". In ""moist"", S was the 4th letter and T was the 5th. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.\n\nAvailable letters: from the alphabet, excluding {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I}. \nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: S and T are in the word, so we must include them.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains S and T (both present)\n- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I\n- S is not in the 4th position, T is not in the 5th position.\n\nWe have 3 more letters to choose from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters among the available: S, T, L, D, U, P, H, etc.\n\nWe also need to consider the positions. Since S and T are in the word but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively, we can try placing them in other positions.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th (but not 4th). However, note that in the word we choose, we can put S and T in any position except the ones that were in ""moist"" for those letters? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"" it was in 4th and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there). Similarly, T is not in the 5th position.\n\nBut we don\'t know the positions of S and T in the secret word. So we have to try a word that has S and T in positions other than 4th for S and 5th for T.\n\nWe also have 3 other letters to choose.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S and T and three other letters from the available set.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""BUSTS"" -> but has S at the end (5th) and also has two S\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback so far, we don\'t have any duplicate letters. But we must consider that the secret word might have duplicates.\n\nBut note: in ""moist"", we had one S and one T, and both were marked as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two S\'s, then the feedback might have shown two \'-\' for S? But in ""moist"" we only had one S, so we only get one feedback for S. Similarly for T.\n\nSo we cannot rule out duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence for them either.\n\nWe should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nLet me try to list words with S and T and three other distinct letters from the available set.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SHUNT"" -> but H and U are available? Let\'s check: H and U are in the available set. However, ""SHUNT"": \n  S in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th. But wait, N is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: N is absent). So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I.\n\nSo ""SHUNT"" has N -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""BUSTY"" -> B, U, S, T, Y. \n- B, U, Y are allowed? Yes. \n- Positions: S is 3rd, T is 4th. \n  But note: in ""moist"", S was in 4th and got \'-\', meaning S is not in 4th in the secret word. But in ""BUSTY"", S is in 3rd, which is okay. T is in 4th? The feedback for T in ""moist"" was that T is not in 5th, but it could be in 4th? Yes, because the feedback only said T is not in 5th. So T in 4th is allowed.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong? Only for the specific letters: S cannot be in 4th, T cannot be in 5th. In ""BUSTY"", T is in 4th, which is not forbidden (only 5th is forbidden for T). So that\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s check the word: B U S T Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\nWe need to make sure the word is valid. ""BUSTY"" is a word (meaning curvy in figure).\n\nAnother option: ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. L is allowed.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about L, so it might be good to test it.\n\nHowever, we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""DUTY"" -> but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""STUDY"" -> S, T, U, D, Y. \n- S in 1st, T in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th.\n- This word: \n  - S is in 1st (not 4th, so okay)\n  - T is in 2nd (not 5th, so okay)\n  - Uses U, D, Y which are available.\n\n""STUDY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""DUSTY"" -> D, U, S, T, Y. \n- S in 3rd, T in 4th.\n\nBoth ""STUDY"" and ""DUSTY"" are options.\n\nBut note: in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put S and T in positions that we haven\'t tested. In ""moist"", we had S in 4th and T in 5th. Now we can try S in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th and T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden positions: S not 4th, T not 5th.\n\nSo for S: positions 1,2,3,5 are allowed.\nFor T: positions 1,2,3,4 are allowed.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters. Among the available, common consonants: L, D, P, H, U, B, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word that uses S, T, and then L, D, or H.\n\nFor example: ""SLATE"" -> but E and A are forbidden.\n\n""LIGHT"" -> no S.\n\n""SHIFT"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But I is forbidden (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So invalid.\n\n""THUDS"" -> T, H, U, D, S. \n- Positions: T in 1st, H in 2nd, U in 3rd, D in 4th, S in 5th.\n- This word: \n  - T is in 1st (allowed, since T not 5th)\n  - S is in 5th (allowed, since S not 4th)\n  - Uses H, U, D which are available.\n\n""THUDS"" is a word (meaning a dull sound, like a thud).\n\nAnother: ""BLAST"" -> but A is forbidden.\n\n""GUSTY"" -> G, U, S, T, Y. \n- S in 3rd, T in 4th.\n\nI think ""STUDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places S and T in new positions.\n\nBut let\'s consider: in ""STUDY"", we have S in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word has S in 1st, we would get a check (✓) for S, and similarly for T. If not, we might get \'-\' or \'x\'. Also, we test U, D, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has S and T in positions that are less common to see if they are fixed? But that might be less efficient.\n\nI think ""STUDY"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: since we know S and T are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven\'t tested and also use three new letters.\n\nIn ""moist"", we tested positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T. So we have feedback for each position.\n\nFor the secret word, we know:\n- Position 1: cannot be M, and cannot be C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). Also, it cannot be O or I (from second guess). So position 1 must be one of the remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we know S and T are in the word, but they might be in position 1? Yes.\n- Similarly for other positions.\n\nBut we don\'t have direct constraints on positions except that S is not in 4 and T is not in 5.\n\nGiven that, I think ""STUDY"" is a good guess.\n\nLet me write it: S T U D Y.\n\nBut wait, in ""STUDY"", S is in 1st and T in 2nd. If the secret word does not have S in 1st, we get \'-\' for S, and similarly for T. Also, we test U, D, Y.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""PULPS"" -> but P and L are available, but S is at the end. However, we have two P\'s? That might not be ideal.\n\nI think ""STUDY"" is better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STUDY"".\n\n<guess>study</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- The first guess ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.\n- The second guess ""moist"" had M, O, I marked as absent (x), and S and T marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:\n  - The secret word contains S and T, but S is not in the 4th position and T is not in the 5th position.\n  - The secret word does not contain M, O, I (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).\n\nThe remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S and T confirmed present).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include S and T (since they are present in the secret word).\n- S cannot be in the 4th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).\n- T cannot be in the 5th position (as per ""moist"" feedback).\n- Avoid all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I).\n- Aim for common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""study"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains S (1st position) and T (2nd position), both in new positions not yet ruled out.\n- Uses additional common letters: U, D, Y (all from the available set).\n- Tests S in position 1 and T in position 2, which could provide valuable positional feedback.\n\n<guess>study</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: study -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:\n1.

Wait, position 2 is occupied by S, so U must be in 1 or 4.\n- T must be in 1,3,4.\n\nBut position 2 is S, so U cannot be there anyway.\n\nSubcases:\n- If S is in 2: then word: [1] S [3] [4] Y\n  Then T and U must be in the remaining positions: 1,3,4.\n\nPossible:\n  - T in 1 → then U must be in 4 (since U cannot be in 3, because U cannot be in 3 per feedback? No: U cannot be in pos3, so if T is in 1, U must be in 4. Then position 3 is free for another letter.\n  - T in 3 → then U must be in 1 or 4. But if U in 1, then position 3 is T, which is okay? Position 3: if T is there, no problem. But U cannot be in 3, but T can be in 3. Then U in 1 or 4.\n  - T in 4 → then U must be in 1 (since U cannot be in 3) and position 3 is free.\n\nCase 2: S in position 3.\nThen word: [1] [2] S [4] Y\n- U cannot be in 3 (occupied by S) so U in 1,2, or 4? But U cannot be in 3 and 3 is occupied, so U in 1,2, or 4 — but no conflict because U just can\'t be in pos3, and pos3 isn\'t U.\n- T in 1,3,4 — but pos3 is S, so T in 1 or 4.\n\nThen:\n- U in any position except 3 (but 3 is taken) so U in 1,2,4.\n- T in 1 or 4.\n\nBut also, if T in 1, U can be in 2 or 4. If T in 4, U can be in 1 or 2.\n\nNow, we need to choose which case and pick a word.\n\nBut we also have to include the missing letter.\n\nMoreover, we want to test possibilities to narrow down.\n\nSince Y is fixed at the end and we have S,T,U,Y, we can aim to form a word with one more letter.\n\nList possible words:\n\nFirst, with S in position 2: then word: _ S _ _ Y\nThen:\n- T in 1: then T S _ U Y → but position 4 must be U? Or could be the missing letter? Wait, we have S in 2 and T in 1 fixed? Then positions 3 and 4 are free for U and the missing letter? But U must be in the word. So if T is in 1 and S in 2, then U can be in position 4? Then word: T S ? U Y, but position 3 must be the missing letter.\n\nWords like ""TSU?Y"" — but that\'s not standard.\n\nWhat words end with ""UY""? Not common. U before Y? Actually, almost no English words have ""U"" directly before ""Y"" at the end. Words ending in ""Y"" rarely have U directly before? Like ""buy"", ""guy"", etc., but that\'s a different vowel. Not U.\n\nHence, U cannot be in position 4 if position 5 is Y? Because position 4 is U and then ""UY"" — not common. Although there is ""glugy""? Not a word. So probably not.\n\nSimilarly, if U is in position 4: [1] [2] S U Y → but ends with ""SUY""? Not plausible.\n\nTherefore, case S in position 2 might be difficult because U cannot be in position 4 without creating an awkward ending.\n\nHence, let\'s focus on S in position 3: word: [1] [2] S [4] Y\n\nThen U can be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 3 is S.\n\nT can be in position 1 or 4.\n\nPossible configurations:\n\nOption A: T in position 1, then word: T [2] S [4] Y\n- U must be in position 2 or 4? But if U in position 2: word: T U S [4] Y, which is like ""TUS?Y"" — possible? English words: ""tushy"" exists? Informal for buttocks, so T U S H Y → word ""tushy"", but H is allowed? Available letters: H is not excluded, yes. \n  Positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). \n  Check U position: U is in pos2, which is allowed (not pos3). T in pos1, which is allowed (not pos2 or5). S in pos3, which is allowed (not pos1 or4).\n\nOption B: U in position 1, then word: U [2] S [4] Y\n- T must be in position 4? Since T can be in 1 or4, but U is in1 so T in4: U [2] S T Y. \n  Words: ? Like ""JUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"", but ""GUSTY"" has G,U,S,T,Y. \n  U at pos1? Then word: U ? S T Y. \n  If position 2 is G? Then ""UGSTY""? Not a word. Maybe ""busky""? No.\n\nBetter to list real words.\n\nAlternative: T in position 4, then word: [1] [2] S T Y\n- Then U must be in position 1 or 2? \n  If U in position 1: U [2] S T Y → like ""BUSTY"" but A,B? ""BUSTY"" is a word: B U S T Y → positions: B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). \n  Check constraints: \n    - S is in pos3? Yes, allowed (not 1 or4).\n    - T is in pos4? Yes, allowed (not 2 or5).\n    - U is in pos2? Yes, allowed (not pos3).\n\nBut ""BUSTY"" uses B and U,S,T,Y — and B is available? Yes.\n\nOr position 1 could be F: ""FUSTY"" → which means musty. F U S T Y.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 could be L: ""LUSTY"".\n\nNow, from our case: if S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5, then U must be in 1 or 2? Above has U in2.\n\nIf U in position 1: then U at1, and position2 is the missing letter? Then U [2] S T Y → for [2] to be a letter. For example, ""J"" -> ""JUSTY""? Not a word. ""GUSTY"" has U in2? No ""GUSTY"" is G(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). So U is in position2.\n\nActually, in ""GUSTY"", U is in position2, not position1.\n\nCan we have a word with U in position1? Like ""USTY""? No, not a word. So English words don\'t start with ""UY"" or similar? Probably not, so U cannot be in position1 if we have ""U.STY"" pattern? Indeed, no common words, so U must be in position2 when T is in4 and S in3? So word: [1] U S T Y\n\nThen we need a consonant at the beginning: BUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY, etc.\n\nNow, back to possible words:\n\n1. Pattern with S in pos3: \n   - With T in pos1: then word T [2] S [4] Y. U must be in pos2 or pos4? But if U in pos4: T [2] S U Y → ends with ""SUY""? Unlikely. So assume U in pos2: T U S [4] Y. Then we need a letter for pos4: any consonant? For example, H: ""tushy"". Valid word.\n   - With T in pos4: then [1] U S T Y → word must be ? U S T Y, like BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY, LUSTY.\n\n2. Pattern with S in pos2: but earlier we saw it leads to U in pos4? Which conflicts with Y? Unless U is not directly before Y? But if S in pos2 and U in pos4: then word [1] S [3] U Y — then [3] must be a letter? And U is in pos4? Ends with ""UY"". Again, rare. Only one I can think of: ""saucy""? But A is excluded. ""spumy""? Not common and M? M is excluded. So unlikely.\n\nTherefore, focus on S in pos3.\n\nSo possible words:\n- Type A: T U S ? Y → ""tushy"" (if ?=H)\n- Type B: ? U S T Y → e.g., ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"", etc.\n\nIn ""tushy"": positions: T(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). \nCheck constraints: \n- U is in pos2: allowed? From feedback, U cannot be in pos3? Yes, so pos2 is okay.\n- Also, we have S in pos3: not pos1 or4, okay.\n- T in pos1: not pos2 or5? Feedback said T not in pos2 (from study) and not in pos5 (from moist), so pos1 is okay.\n\nSimilarly, for ""busty"": B(1),U(2),S(3),T(4),Y(5). \nT in pos4: okay? Yes, since T not forbidden in pos4.\n\nBut in both patterns, we are testing the positions. We need to guess a word that uses these.\n\nConsider the feedback we have: with Y at end fixed, and we need to determine the other positions.\n\nWe also know U is present but not in pos3, yet we have S in3? So U must be elsewhere.\n\nWe don\'t know the middle letter? So we have to pick a word that fits.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""TUSHY"" \n- ""BUSTY""\n- ""GUSTY""\n- ""LUSTY""\n- ""FUSTY""\n\nBut we have only one guess for now? Actually, we are making one guess.\n\nWe need to choose one to get more information.\n\nAlso, note that in ""study"", U was present and we got ""-"" meaning wrong position. In ""tushy"", U is in pos2? In ""study"", U was in pos3? But in ""tushy"", U is in pos2 which hasn\'t been tested before? Similarly, in ""busty"", U is also in pos2? In ""study"", we tried U in pos3, which was wrong.\n\nPosition for U: it cannot be pos3, but other positions are possible.\n\nIn both options, U is in pos2? For type B and type A? Not exactly:\n\n- In ""tushy"": U is in pos2.\n- In ""busty"": U is in pos2? ""B U S T Y"" — yes, pos2.\n\nIn fact, all these words have U in pos2 and S in pos3? Not necessarily.\n\n""TUSHY"": T U S H Y → pos2:U, pos3:S.\n""BUSTY"": B U S T Y → same pattern: pos2:U, pos3:S, then pos4:T.\n\nIn ""BUSTY"", S is in pos3, T in pos4, Y in5.\n\nIn ""TUSHY"", T in1, U in2, S in3, H in4, Y in5.\n\nPattern: both have U in position2? That might be a coincidence? Or not.\n\nIs there a word with U in pos4? For example, with T in pos1 and U in pos4: T _ S U Y? But ""_"" must be a vowel? Or consonant? And then ""SUY"" ending — I can\'t find an English word. So perhaps U is always in pos2 in this pattern? Then position1 and position4 vary.\n\nSo the pattern is: [consonant] U S T Y → like BUSTY, etc., \nor T U S [consonant] Y → TUSHY.\n\nNow, we have feedback that from ""study"", D is absent? But we might need to test other letters.\n\nTo choose a guess, we can pick a common word.\n\nBut note: in ""study"", we guessed D and it was absent, so avoid D? We already avoid.\n\nAlso, we need to use letters that could be present? Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.\n\nFor example:\n- ""LUSTY"" is common.\n- ""GUSTY"" is common.\n\nWe already know Y is at5, so the word ends with STY? or not? In ""busty"", it ends with T Y, but the pattern is ...STY? Busty: B-U-S-T-Y, so the last two are T-Y, with S at position3.\n\nWe can choose ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.\n\nCheck:\n- L: not tested before, common letter.\n- Positions: S in pos3, T in pos4? Both allowed.\n\nAlternatively, ""TUSHY"" uses H, which is common.\n\nBut let\'s see what information we get.\n\nIf we guess ""LUSTY"", letters: L,U,S,T,Y → all correct? Or not? We would get feedback on each.\n\nBut specifically:\n- If L is present and correct? Or not? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, U in pos2: if correct we get ✓ for U? Etc.\n\nBut we are on the fourth guess? We have more chances? We started with three guesses done? Guess 1,2,3 → this is guess 4.\n\nSo we can take a risk.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might want to cover more letters.\n\nHowever, given the constraints, ""LUSTY"" or ""GUSTY"" seem reasonable.\n\nWe can also choose a word that has U in a different position? But we argued U in pos1 doesn\'t work, and U in pos4 unlikely.\n\nSo focus on U in pos2.\n\nGuess ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y.\n\nPotential feedback:\n- If L is in the word? If not, then we know only S,T,U,Y are present? Then the word must be like ""TUSHY"" with H.\n\nBut since we have only one missing letter? In the secret word, yes, because we have 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 and pos5=Y, pos3=S? Not necessarily fixed? Our guess could be wrong.\n\nActually, in our guess ""LUSTY"", we are assuming S in pos3 and U in pos2? But it might not be.\n\nFor example, if the secret word has U in pos4? But then pattern different? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnyway, we need to guess.\n\nI think ""LUSTY"" is a good choice.\n\nOr ""busky""? Not a word.\n\nActually, let\'s list all common words that fit the pattern:\n- With U in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, like ""BUSTY"", ""GUSTY"", ""LUSTY"".\n- Or with T in pos1, U in pos2, S in pos3, and H in pos4: ""TUSHY"".\n\nWe can choose ""GUSTY"" to cover G? Or ""BUSTY"" for B.\n\nBut no strong preference.\n\nI\'ll go with ""LUSTY"".\n\nBut note: ""lusty"" means strong and healthy? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""LUSTY"".\n\nAlternatively, consider that in ""study"", we had U in pos3 which was wrong, but if we put U in pos2 in this guess, it might be right.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nProcess of elimination? We have limited time.\n\nTo be systematic, we can guess ""TUSHY"" to test the H? But H is a common letter.\n\nBut if ""tushy"" is not the word, we might waste a guess.\n\nSimilarly, guessing ""LUSTY"" tests L.\n\nSame idea.\n\nSo guess ""LUSTY"".\n\n<guess>lusty</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- **First Guess (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), ruling out these letters.\n- **Second Guess (""moist"")**: M, O, I absent (x); S and T present (-) but in wrong positions. S cannot be in position 4, T cannot be in position 5.\n- **Third Guess (""study"")**: \n  - S absent from position 1 (-), T absent from position 2 (-), U present but not in position 3 (-), D absent (x), Y correct in position 5 (✓). \n  - This confirms Y is the last letter, and S, T, U are present but not in positions 1 (for S), 2 (for T), or 3 (for U). D is now ruled out.\n\nFrom this:\n- **Secret word ends with Y**: Pattern is `_ _ _ _ Y`.\n- **Confirmed letters**: S, T, U, Y must appear, with Y fixed at position 5.\n- **S position constraints**: Not in position 1 or 4 → S must be in position 2 or 3.\n- **T position constraints**: Not in position 2 or 5 → T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- **U position constraints**: Not in position 3 → U must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D → Available letters include B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nGiven these constraints, possible words must place S in position 2 or 3, with U and T in valid positions. Common word patterns:\n- With S in position 3 and U in position 2 (e.g., `_ U S T Y` or `T U S _ Y`).\n- Considering available letters and word validity (e.g., ""tushy"", ""busty"", ""gusty"", ""lusty"").\n\n""Lusty"" fits:\n- Positions: L(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) → S in position 3 (allowed), U in position 2 (allowed, not position 3), T in position 4 (allowed, not position 2 or 5).\n- Tests L as a new common consonant.\n- Maximizes information: Covers critical positions for S, T, U while introducing a new letter (L) for feedback.\n\n<guess>lusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: study -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) D(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: lusty -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 4: lusty -> L(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
 This means:
  - U is in the correct position: position 2 (since in ""lusty"", U was second letter) → the secret word has U as the second letter.
  - S is in the correct position: position 3 (since in ""lusty"", S was third letter) → the secret word has S as the third letter.
  - T is in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""lusty"", T was fourth letter) → the secret word has T as the fourth letter.
  - Y is in the correct position: position 5 (already known) → the secret word has Y as the fifth letter.
  - L is absent: so L is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 1: unknown (but must be one of the remaining letters) 
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: Y

So the pattern is: ? U S T Y

We also know that L is absent (so secret word has no L) and continues to have none of the previously absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D,L (adding L).

The letter in position 1 must be from the remaining available letters. The available letters are those not excluded: 
Originally excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D,L. 
So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D,L.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and we know no duplicates because we have U,S,T,Y in positions 2,3,4,5 and no feedback suggests duplicates).

Therefore, we must choose a letter from [B,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z] for position 1 to form a valid English word of the form ? U S T Y.

What words have this pattern? 
Common words: 
- ""BUSTY"" (if B is used) → ""B U S T Y""
- ""GUSTY"" (if G is used) → ""G U S T Y""
- ""JUSTY"" → not a word (justice? not 5 letters).
- ""BUSHY"" → but H? And S? But in our pattern position 3 is S, and ""BUSHY"" has S at position 3: B U S H Y → that's a word.

Other possibilities:
- ""FUSTY"" (if F is used) → F U S T Y → means musty
- ""HUSKY"" → H U S K Y → but position 4 is K? Not T? So no, because we need position 4 to be T.

The word must end with ""STY"" because positions 3=S, 4=T, 5=Y? So the last three letters are ""STY"".

Words ending with ""STY"": 
- ""BUSTY"", ""GUSTY"", ""FUSTY"", ""MUSTY"" (but M is excluded), ""RUSTY"" (R excluded), ""DUSTY"" (D excluded), ""JUSTY"" not a word, ""PUSTY"" not common, ""TUSTY"" not a word, ""WUSTY"" not a word.

So valid words: BUSTY, GUSTY, FUSTY (and previously considered LUSTY but L excluded).

But ""BUSHY"": B U S H Y → ends with SHY? No, positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y → so not ending with STY? Because position 3=S, position 4=H? Not T. So ""BUSHY"" does not fit our pattern because position 4 must be T.

Therefore, only words with pattern ? U S T Y.

Now, from the available letters:
- B: ""BUSTY"" → valid word
- F: ""FUSTY"" → valid word
- G: ""GUSTY"" → valid word
- H: ""HUSTY"" → not a word? Not common.
- J: ""JUSTY"" → not a word
- K: ""KUSTY"" → not a word
- P: ""PUSTY"" → not common (archaic for empty)
- Q: ""QUSTY"" → no
- V: ""VUSTY"" → no
- W: ""WUSTY"" → no
- X: ""XUSTY"" → no
- Z: ""ZUSTY"" → no

So the only valid candidates are: BUSTY, GUSTY, FUSTY.

Note: We already excluded L (from lusty feedback, L is absent) so LUSTY is not possible.

We have three possible words: BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY.

We need to guess one? But we have two more guesses? No, we are at guess 5 now? Since we have had four guesses so far? We have to make the fifth guess.

The game gives 6 tries, so we have two left? But we are to make one guess now.

We can guess any of these? For example, ""GUSTY"" to check G? Then if correct, we win? Or if wrong, then we know G is absent and we choose between B and F for the last guess.

So it doesn't matter which one we pick? We can pick one arbitrarily.

But to be systematic? We can choose the most common word: GUSTY.

""Busty"" also common? But gusty might be more frequent? No matter.

Alternatively, we can choose one that hasn't been partially tested? None have.

They all have U,S,T,Y fixed? So only position1 differs.

Let's choose ""GUSTY"".

But note: we haven't gussed G, B, F? So we need to test one? Then the next guess only has two options left.

So guess ""GUSTY"".

If G is correct? Then we get all ✓ and win? If not, then we know G is absent? Then the secret word must be either BUSTY or FUSTY? Then for guess 6 we choose accordingly? Or we can eliminate.

But if we guess ""GUSTY"" and get:
- If G(✓) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓) → win.
- Else, if G(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓) → then G absent? But then positions 2-5 are correct? We must have a different letter at position1: so either B or F? Then we can guess BUSTY next? If wrong, then FUSTY? But we have only one guess left? So if we guess GUSTY and it fails, we lose if we guess BUSTY wrong? We have only guess 6? So two possibilities: if GUSTY is not correct, then the secret word is either BUSTY or FUSTY? So we can guess BUSTY? If BUSTY correct, win? If not, then it must be FUSTY? But we have no more guess? So we might fail.

Alternative: we might guess a word that tests multiple? But the pattern is fixed? Because U,S,T,Y are fixed? We can only choose the first letter? And it must be B,F, or G? But we have no word that has ...? Like ""GUZZY""? Not a word.

We can only form words by changing the first letter? So we must guess one of BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY? But probably ""GUSTY"" is a good guess? Or choose something else? But no other words.

Therefore, I'll guess ""GUSTY"".

If we are wrong, then we know it's either B or F, and we can hope? But guess 6: if we guess GUSTY and it fails, we have one guess? Then we guess randomly? But worst case.

We might also consider that in our previous feedback, we never tested B or F? So no information.

But since there are three possibilities and we have two guesses? We can guess one? Then if wrong, guess the next? But if we guess GUSTY now? Then:
- If correct, win.
- If not, then we know the missing letter is not G? Then it must be B or F? Then for guess 6? We guess BUSTY? If correct, win? If wrong, then FUSTY? But we don't get to guess after? Because only 6 guesses? So if we guess BUSTY on guess6 and it's wrong, we lose without guessing FUSTY? Unless we can infer.

So better to guess a word that uses a letter that helps differentiate? But we are constrained: the word must be ?USTY? With ? from B,F,G? There's no word that has additional information? Because the rest are fixed? We cannot form such a word? Because positions 2-5 are fixed? Only position1 varies? So we have to brute-force.

We can only guess one of the three.

Therefore, randomly pick ""GUSTY"".

But note: ""gusty"" is the most common? We'll use that.

So guess: GUSTY

<guess>gusty</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), eliminating these letters.
- **Guess 2 (""moist""):** M, O, I are absent (x); S and T are present (-) but in the wrong positions (S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
- **Guess 3 (""study""):** S and T are present but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (-); U is present but not in position 3 (-); D is absent (x); Y is correct in position 5 (✓).
- **Guess 4 (""lusty""):** L is absent (x); U, S, T, and Y are correct in their positions (U in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5) (✓).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern:**  
   - Position 2 = U (fixed)  
   - Position 3 = S (fixed)  
   - Position 4 = T (fixed)  
   - Position 5 = Y (fixed)  
   - Position 1 is unknown but must be from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D, L are excluded).
   
2. **Valid words fitting the pattern ""? U S T Y"":**  
   After cross-checking with English words, only the following are valid:  
   - **BUSTY**: B at position 1  
   - **GUSTY**: G at position 1  
   - **FUSTY**: F at position 1  

3. **Strategy for this guess (5th attempt):**  
   With 6 total guesses allowed, we have two remaining tries. The best approach is to guess one of the valid words to test position 1:  
   - If correct, the game is won.  
   - If incorrect, the absent feedback for the first letter narrows it to the other two options for the final guess.  
   ""GUSTY"" is selected as a common word to prioritize testing the letter G.  

<guess>gusty</guess>",gusty,"We have feedback from Guess 4: lusty -> L(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
 This means:
  - U is in the correct position: position 2 (since in ""lusty"", U was second letter) → the secret word has U as the second letter.
  - S is in the correct position: position 3 (since in ""lusty"", S was third letter) → the secret word has S as the third letter.
  - T is in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""lusty"", T was fourth letter) → the secret word has T as the fourth letter.
  - Y is in the correct position: position 5 (already known) → the secret word has Y as the fifth letter.
  - L is absent: so L is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 1: unknown (but must be one of the remaining letters) 
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: Y

So the pattern is: ? U S T Y

We also know that L is absent (so secret word has no L) and continues to have none of the previously absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D,L (adding L).

The letter in position 1 must be from the remaining available letters. The available letters are those not excluded: 
Originally excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D,L. 
So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,D,L.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and we know no duplicates because we have U,S,T,Y in positions 2,3,4,5 and no feedback suggests duplicates).

Therefore, we must choose a letter from [B,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z] for position 1 to form a valid English word of the form ? U S T Y.

What words have this pattern? 
Common words: 
- ""BUSTY"" (if B is used) → ""B U S T Y""
- ""GUSTY"" (if G is used) → ""G U S T Y""
- ""JUSTY"" → not a word (justice? not 5 letters).
- ""BUSHY"" → but H? And S? But in our pattern position 3 is S, and ""BUSHY"" has S at position 3: B U S H Y → that's a word.

Other possibilities:
- ""FUSTY"" (if F is used) → F U S T Y → means musty
- ""HUSKY"" → H U S K Y → but position 4 is K? Not T? So no, because we need position 4 to be T.

The word must end with ""STY"" because positions 3=S, 4=T, 5=Y? So the last three letters are ""STY"".

Words ending with ""STY"": 
- ""BUSTY"", ""GUSTY"", ""FUSTY"", ""MUSTY"" (but M is excluded), ""RUSTY"" (R excluded), ""DUSTY"" (D excluded), ""JUSTY"" not a word, ""PUSTY"" not common, ""TUSTY"" not a word, ""WUSTY"" not a word.

So valid words: BUSTY, GUSTY, FUSTY (and previously considered LUSTY but L excluded).

But ""BUSHY"": B U S H Y → ends with SHY? No, positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y → so not ending with STY? Because position 3=S, position 4=H? Not T. So ""BUSHY"" does not fit our pattern because position 4 must be T.

Therefore, only words with pattern ? U S T Y.

Now, from the available letters:
- B: ""BUSTY"" → valid word
- F: ""FUSTY"" → valid word
- G: ""GUSTY"" → valid word
- H: ""HUSTY"" → not a word? Not common.
- J: ""JUSTY"" → not a word
- K: ""KUSTY"" → not a word
- P: ""PUSTY"" → not common (archaic for empty)
- Q: ""QUSTY"" → no
- V: ""VUSTY"" → no
- W: ""WUSTY"" → no
- X: ""XUSTY"" → no
- Z: ""ZUSTY"" → no

So the only valid candidates are: BUSTY, GUSTY, FUSTY.

Note: We already excluded L (from lusty feedback, L is absent) so LUSTY is not possible.

We have three possible words: BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY.

We need to guess one? But we have two more guesses? No, we are at guess 5 now? Since we have had four guesses so far? We have to make the fifth guess.

The game gives 6 tries, so we have two left? But we are to make one guess now.

We can guess any of these? For example, ""GUSTY"" to check G? Then if correct, we win? Or if wrong, then we know G is absent and we choose between B and F for the last guess.

So it doesn't matter which one we pick? We can pick one arbitrarily.

But to be systematic? We can choose the most common word: GUSTY.

""Busty"" also common? But gusty might be more frequent? No matter.

Alternatively, we can choose one that hasn't been partially tested? None have.

They all have U,S,T,Y fixed? So only position1 differs.

Let's choose ""GUSTY"".

But note: we haven't gussed G, B, F? So we need to test one? Then the next guess only has two options left.

So guess ""GUSTY"".

If G is correct? Then we get all ✓ and win? If not, then we know G is absent? Then the secret word must be either BUSTY or FUSTY? Then for guess 6 we choose accordingly? Or we can eliminate.

But if we guess ""GUSTY"" and get:
- If G(✓) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓) → win.
- Else, if G(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓) → then G absent? But then positions 2-5 are correct? We must have a different letter at position1: so either B or F? Then we can guess BUSTY next? If wrong, then FUSTY? But we have only one guess left? So if we guess GUSTY and it fails, we lose if we guess BUSTY wrong? We have only guess 6? So two possibilities: if GUSTY is not correct, then the secret word is either BUSTY or FUSTY? So we can guess BUSTY? If BUSTY correct, win? If not, then it must be FUSTY? But we have no more guess? So we might fail.

Alternative: we might guess a word that tests multiple? But the pattern is fixed? Because U,S,T,Y are fixed? We can only choose the first letter? And it must be B,F, or G? But we have no word that has ...? Like ""GUZZY""? Not a word.

We can only form words by changing the first letter? So we must guess one of BUSTY, FUSTY, GUSTY? But probably ""GUSTY"" is a good guess? Or choose something else? But no other words.

Therefore, I'll guess ""GUSTY"".

If we are wrong, then we know it's either B or F, and we can hope? But guess 6: if we guess GUSTY and it fails, we have one guess? Then we guess randomly? But worst case.

We might also consider that in our previous feedback, we never tested B or F? So no information.

But since there are three possibilities and we have two guesses? We can guess one? Then if wrong, guess the next? But if we guess GUSTY now? Then:
- If correct, win.
- If not, then we know the missing letter is not G? Then it must be B or F? Then for guess 6? We guess BUSTY? If correct, win? If wrong, then FUSTY? But we don't get to guess after? Because only 6 guesses? So if we guess BUSTY on guess6 and it's wrong, we lose without guessing FUSTY? Unless we can infer.

So better to guess a word that uses a letter that helps differentiate? But we are constrained: the word must be ?USTY? With ? from B,F,G? There's no word that has additional information? Because the rest are fixed? We cannot form such a word? Because positions 2-5 are fixed? Only position1 varies? So we have to brute-force.

We can only guess one of the three.

Therefore, randomly pick ""GUSTY"".

But note: ""gusty"" is the most common? We'll use that.

So guess: GUSTY

<guess>gusty</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), eliminating these letters.
- **Guess 2 (""moist""):** M, O, I are absent (x); S and T are present (-) but in the wrong positions (S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
- **Guess 3 (""study""):** S and T are present but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively (-); U is present but not in position 3 (-); D is absent (x); Y is correct in position 5 (✓).
- **Guess 4 (""lusty""):** L is absent (x); U, S, T, and Y are correct in their positions (U in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5) (✓).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern:**  
   - Position 2 = U (fixed)  
   - Position 3 = S (fixed)  
   - Position 4 = T (fixed)  
   - Position 5 = Y (fixed)  
   - Position 1 is unknown but must be from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, D, L are excluded).
   
2. **Valid words fitting the pattern ""? U S T Y"":**  
   After cross-checking with English words, only the following are valid:  
   - **BUSTY**: B at position 1  
   - **GUSTY**: G at position 1  
   - **FUSTY**: F at position 1  

3. **Strategy for this guess (5th attempt):**  
   With 6 total guesses allowed, we have two remaining tries. The best approach is to guess one of the valid words to test position 1:  
   - If correct, the game is won.  
   - If incorrect, the absent feedback for the first letter narrows it to the other two options for the final guess.  
   ""GUSTY"" is selected as a common word to prioritize testing the letter G.",Guess 5: gusty -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
