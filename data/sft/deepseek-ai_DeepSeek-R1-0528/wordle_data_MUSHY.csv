We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given that the first guess ""crane"" got all feedback as (x), meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

Looking at common English letters, we can try using other vowels and consonants.
Vowels we haven't used: O, U, I (sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good starting word might be something like ""TULIP"" or ""SPOIL"", but we must make sure it doesn't have any forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLOTH"", but let's check:

We need a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words:
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> no forbidden letters? L, I, G, H, T are all not in the forbidden set. But let me confirm: forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E -> so L,I,G,H,T are allowed.
- Other options: ""PIOUS"", ""MUSIC"" (but M,U,S,I,C -> C is forbidden). So ""MUSIC"" is invalid because C is forbidden.
- ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E is forbidden, so invalid.

Let me think of a word that avoids C,R,A,N,E and has a good mix of common letters.

One popular choice is ""OUPHE"" but that might be too obscure.

Another common Wordle starting word is ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y -> letters: T,I,P,S,Y. Check: T (allowed), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed), Y (allowed). And none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}. So ""TIPSY"" is valid.

But perhaps we can do better. We know that the secret word has none of the letters C,R,A,N,E, so we can use any other letters.

We could try to cover more frequent letters. According to English letter frequency, after vowels (we've tested A and E, which are very common, but they are absent), we have S, T, U, etc.

Let's choose a word that uses S, T, U, O, and another common consonant.

Word: ""STOMP"" -> S,T,O,M,P -> no C,R,A,N,E -> allowed.

Word: ""SLUMP"" -> S,L,U,M,P -> also allowed.

But we already know E is missing, so we might try to use O and U as vowels.

Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> allowed.

But let's go for maximum coverage of common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. Since E,A,R,N are eliminated (from our first guess), we have T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We should try to include as many of these as possible in one guess.

Possible words:
- ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S -> all allowed, and covers T, O, I, L, S.
- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D -> also covers D.
- ""LOUIS"" -> proper noun? might not be valid. So avoid.
- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> B is less common, but has D,O,U,T.

I think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and not excluded.

Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T -> has H and U, which are also common.

But ""TOILS"" seems better because it has I (a vowel) and S.

We could also consider ""AUDIO"" but A is forbidden (and we already know A is not in the word) so that's out.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" is not standard and has A.

So, I'll go with ""TOILS"".

But wait, let me double-check: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}? Yes.

So the next guess: ""TOILS"".

We'll get feedback and then adjust from there.
</think>
After the first guess ""CRANE"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, our next guess must avoid these letters entirely.

To maximize information gain, we should focus on common unused letters like S, T, O, I, L, H, and U. A strong second guess should cover multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any from the previous guess.

The word ""TOILS"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 new letters: T, O, I, L, S (all absent from ""CRANE"").
- It includes common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S).
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This approach helps test frequent letters efficiently and narrow down possibilities faster.

So avoid.\n- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> B is less common, but has D,O,U,T.\n\nI think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T -> has H and U, which are also common.\n\nBut ""TOILS"" seems better because it has I (a vowel) and S.\n\nWe could also consider ""AUDIO"" but A is forbidden (and we already know A is not in the word) so that\'s out.\n\nAnother word: ""OUIJA"" is not standard and has A.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TOILS"".\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}? Yes.\n\nSo the next guess: ""TOILS"".\n\nWe\'ll get feedback and then adjust from there.After the first guess ""CRANE"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, our next guess must avoid these letters entirely.\n\nTo maximize information gain, we should focus on common unused letters like S, T, O, I, L, H, and U. A strong second guess should cover multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any from the previous guess.\n\nThe word ""TOILS"" is an excellent choice because:\n- It uses 5 new letters: T, O, I, L, S (all absent from ""CRANE"").\n- It includes common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S).\n- It\'s a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis approach helps test frequent letters efficiently and narrow down possibilities faster.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""toils"" -> T(x), O(x), I(x), L(x), S(-)

The feedback for ""toils"" tells us:
- T, O, I, L are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 5th position (since in ""toils"" it was the last letter and got a minus).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, S (but S is present, so we know it's in the word).

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L. The remaining consonants and vowels are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)

We also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not at the end)
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L)
- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.

Since S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the available set: H, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try to think of words that start with S and use other available letters.

For example:
- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let's check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

We must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.

We need to avoid O as well.

What about ""SUMPH""? Not common.

Let's think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And S must be included.

Let's try S at the beginning:

- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S's? We don't know if the word has two S's. But it's allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S's? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"", we only got one S marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's only one S. It could be that there is another S that we didn't guess. But in ""toils"", we only had one S and it was in the wrong position. So if there were two S's, we might have gotten two minuses? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the ones that are present. But in Wordle, if there is one S and we have one S, we get one minus. If there are two S's and we have one S, we still get one minus. If we have two S's and the word has two, we get two minuses. But in ""toils"" we had only one S and got one minus, so the word has at least one S. It could have more.

But for now, we can try words with one S or two S's.

But to be safe, let's assume we are testing for one S for now.

Back to ""SUDSY"": letters S, U, D, S, Y. But we have two S's. The available letters are fine: U, D, Y are allowed. But is ""SUDSY"" a word? It means something foamy or suds-like, but it might be accepted. However, we have S in position 1 and 4. We know that S is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""toils""), but position 4 might be possible? We don't know yet.

But we need to avoid using too many rare letters.

Another word: ""SHULY"" - not common.

Perhaps ""SUGHS"": S, U, G, H, S -> again two S's. And U, G, H are allowed.

But let's look for words without double S to avoid complexity.

What about S in the middle?

For example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.

But we can try S in position 1.

Let me list some words starting with S and using available letters:

- ""SUMPH"" - not common.
- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.
- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it's a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.

""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.

We know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.

Similarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.

Another word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

""DUMPY"": but no S.

We must include S.

""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.

""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let's see if it's in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.

But we can choose a more common word.

""HUMPH"": but no S.

""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M's. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).

But let's see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don't know.

Another common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.

""PUSHY"" is a common word.

We could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

But let's choose one.

We also have the option to put S in a position we haven't tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven't tried S in 1,2,3,4.

To maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.

But we also need to test other common letters.

Available common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.

But P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.

""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S's. But K is allowed.

""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).

But let's avoid double S for simplicity.

So, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.

But we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.

We could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.

Another idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.

""MUMMY"" - no S.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.

All are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.

S is included, and we are putting it in position 3.

So, we can guess ""PUSHY"".

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's elsewhere.

We are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.

In the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.

But we have no information about Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.

For example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.

""SHULN"" - not a word.

""SUQHS"" - not common.

""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").

N is forbidden.

Another common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.

So invalid.

""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.

We must have S.

""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S's. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.
3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.
   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.

### Why ""PUSHY""?
- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.
  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).
  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.
  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).
- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.
- **Information gain**: This guess tests:
  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).
  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).
  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.

<guess>pushy</guess>",pushy,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""toils"" -> T(x), O(x), I(x), L(x), S(-)

The feedback for ""toils"" tells us:
- T, O, I, L are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 5th position (since in ""toils"" it was the last letter and got a minus).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, S (but S is present, so we know it's in the word).

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L. The remaining consonants and vowels are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)

We also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.

- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.

Since S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

For example:
- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let's check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

We must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.

We need to avoid O as well.

What about ""SUMPH""? Not common.

Let's think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And S must be included.

Let's try S at the beginning:

- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S's? We don't know if the word has two S's. But it's allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S's? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5.

 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

A good starting word might be something like ""TULIP"" or ""SPOIL"", but we must make sure it doesn't have any forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLOTH"", but let's check:

We need a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words:
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> no forbidden letters? L, I, G, H, T are all not in the forbidden set. But let me confirm: forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E -> so L,I,G,H,T are allowed.
- Other options: ""PIOUS"", ""MUSIC"" (but M,U,S,I,C -> C is forbidden). So ""MUSIC"" is invalid because C is forbidden.
- ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E is forbidden, so invalid.

Let me think of a word that avoids C,R,A,N,E and has a good mix of common letters.

One popular choice is ""OUPHE"" but that might be too obscure.

Another common Wordle starting word is ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y -> letters: T,I,P,S,Y. Check: T (allowed), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed), Y (allowed). And none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}. So ""TIPSY"" is valid.

But perhaps we can do better. We know that the secret word has none of the letters C,R,A,N,E, so we can use any other letters.

We could try to cover more frequent letters. According to English letter frequency, after vowels (we've tested A and E, which are very common, but they are absent), we have S, T, U, etc.

Let's choose a word that uses S, T, U, O, and another common consonant.

Word: ""STOMP"" -> S,T,O,M,P -> no C,R,A,N,E -> allowed.

Word: ""SLUMP"" -> S,L,U,M,P -> also allowed.

But we already know E is missing, so we might try to use O and U as vowels.

Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> allowed.

But let's go for maximum coverage of common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. Since E,A,R,N are eliminated (from our first guess), we have T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We should try to include as many of these as possible in one guess.

Possible words:
- ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S -> all allowed, and covers T, O, I, L, S.
- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D -> also covers D.
- ""LOUIS"" -> proper noun? might not be valid. So avoid.
- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> B is less common, but has D,O,U,T.

I think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and not excluded.

Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T -> has H and U, which are also common.

But ""TOILS"" seems better because it has I (a vowel) and S.

We could also consider ""AUDIO"" but A is forbidden (and we already know A is not in the word) so that's out.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" is not standard and has A.

So, I'll go with ""TOILS"".

But wait, let me double-check: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}? Yes.

So the next guess: ""TOILS"".

We'll get feedback and then adjust from there.After the first guess ""CRANE"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, our next guess must avoid these letters entirely.

To maximize information gain, we should focus on common unused letters like S, T, O, I, L, H, and U. A strong second guess should cover multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any from the previous guess.

The word ""TOILS"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 new letters: T, O, I, L, S (all absent from ""CRANE"").
- It includes common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S).
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This approach helps test frequent letters efficiently and narrow down possibilities faster.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""toils"" -> T(x), O(x), I(x), L(x), S(-)

The feedback for ""toils"" tells us:
- T, O, I, L are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 5th position (since in ""toils"" it was the last letter and got a minus).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, S (but S is present, so we know it's in the word).

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L. The remaining consonants and vowels are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)

We also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not at the end)
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L)
- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.

Since S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the available set: H, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try to think of words that start with S and use other available letters.

For example:
- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let's check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

We must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.

We need to avoid O as well.

What about ""SUMPH""? Not common.

Let's think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And S must be included.

Let's try S at the beginning:

- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S's? We don't know if the word has two S's. But it's allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S's? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"", we only got one S marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's only one S. It could be that there is another S that we didn't guess. But in ""toils"", we only had one S and it was in the wrong position. So if there were two S's, we might have gotten two minuses? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the ones that are present. But in Wordle, if there is one S and we have one S, we get one minus. If there are two S's and we have one S, we still get one minus. If we have two S's and the word has two, we get two minuses. But in ""toils"" we had only one S and got one minus, so the word has at least one S. It could have more.

But for now, we can try words with one S or two S's.

But to be safe, let's assume we are testing for one S for now.

Back to ""SUDSY"": letters S, U, D, S, Y. But we have two S's. The available letters are fine: U, D, Y are allowed. But is ""SUDSY"" a word? It means something foamy or suds-like, but it might be accepted. However, we have S in position 1 and 4. We know that S is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""toils""), but position 4 might be possible? We don't know yet.

But we need to avoid using too many rare letters.

Another word: ""SHULY"" - not common.

Perhaps ""SUGHS"": S, U, G, H, S -> again two S's. And U, G, H are allowed.

But let's look for words without double S to avoid complexity.

What about S in the middle?

For example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.

But we can try S in position 1.

Let me list some words starting with S and using available letters:

- ""SUMPH"" - not common.
- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.
- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it's a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.

""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.

We know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.

Similarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.

Another word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

""DUMPY"": but no S.

We must include S.

""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.

""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let's see if it's in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.

But we can choose a more common word.

""HUMPH"": but no S.

""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M's. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).

But let's see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don't know.

Another common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.

""PUSHY"" is a common word.

We could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

But let's choose one.

We also have the option to put S in a position we haven't tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven't tried S in 1,2,3,4.

To maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.

But we also need to test other common letters.

Available common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.

But P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.

""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S's. But K is allowed.

""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).

But let's avoid double S for simplicity.

So, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.

But we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.

We could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.

Another idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.

""MUMMY"" - no S.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.

All are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.

S is included, and we are putting it in position 3.

So, we can guess ""PUSHY"".

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's elsewhere.

We are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.

In the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.

But we have no information about Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.

For example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.

""SHULN"" - not a word.

""SUQHS"" - not common.

""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").

N is forbidden.

Another common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.

So invalid.

""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.

We must have S.

""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S's. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

<guess>pushy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.
3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.
   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.

### Why ""PUSHY""?
- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.
  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).
  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.
  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).
- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.
- **Information gain**: This guess tests:
  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).
  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).
  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.

And U, G, H are allowed.\n\nBut let\'s look for words without double S to avoid complexity.\n\nWhat about S in the middle?\n\nFor example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.\n\nBut we can try S in position 1.\n\nLet me list some words starting with S and using available letters:\n\n- ""SUMPH"" - not common.\n- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.\n- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it\'s a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.\n\n""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.\n\nWe know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.\n\nAnother word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.\n\n""DUMPY"": but no S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\n""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.\n\n""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let\'s see if it\'s in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.\n\nBut we can choose a more common word.\n\n""HUMPH"": but no S.\n\n""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M\'s. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).\n\nBut let\'s see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.\n\n""PUSHY"" is a common word.\n\nWe could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nWe also have the option to put S in a position we haven\'t tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven\'t tried S in 1,2,3,4.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.\n\nBut we also need to test other common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.\n\nBut P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.\n\n""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S\'s. But K is allowed.\n\n""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).\n\nBut let\'s avoid double S for simplicity.\n\nSo, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.\n\nWe could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.\n\n""MUMMY"" - no S.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.\n\nAll are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.\n\nS is included, and we are putting it in position 3.\n\nSo, we can guess ""PUSHY"".\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s elsewhere.\n\nWe are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nIn the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.\n\nBut we have no information about Y.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.\n\nFor example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.\n\n""SHULN"" - not a word.\n\n""SUQHS"" - not common.\n\n""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").\n\nN is forbidden.\n\nAnother common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.\n\nWe must have S.\n\n""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S\'s. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PUSHY"".\n\n<guess>pushy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").\n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.\n3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n4. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.\n   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.\n   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.\n\n### Why ""PUSHY""?\n- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.\n  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).\n  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.\n  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).\n- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n- **Information gain**: This guess tests:\n  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).\n  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).\n  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).\n  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.\n\n<guess>pushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> T, O, I, L absent, and S present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 5).
Guess 3: ""pushy"" -> P absent, and U, S, H, Y are correct and in the right positions? Let's see the feedback: U(✓), S(✓), H(✓), Y(✓). That means U, S, H, Y are in the word and in the correct positions.

The feedback for ""pushy"":
- P(x) -> P is not in the word.
- U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- H(✓) -> H is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this, we know that the secret word has:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: Y

And we also know that the first letter is not P, and not any of the previously excluded letters.

Now, what about position 1? We don't know the first letter yet.

We know the word is _ U S H Y

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? U S H Y.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.

And we have confirmed that U, S, H, Y are in the word and in these positions.

Now, what letters are possible for the first position? It must be a letter not in the excluded list and not P (since P is absent).

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).

We need to find a word that starts with one of these and is followed by ""USHY"".

Let's think of common words ending with ""USHY"". Actually, the word is ?USHY.

What words end with ""USHY""? Not many. The most common one is ""GUSHY"", but we already used ""PUSHY"" and it had P which is absent. ""GUSHY"" would be G U S H Y.

G is not excluded, so it's a candidate.

Other possibilities? ""MUSHY"" but M U S H Y. M is allowed.

""BUSHY"" but B U S H Y. B is allowed.

Let's list:

- BUSHY: B U S H Y
- GUSHY: G U S H Y
- MUSHY: M U S H Y
- Also, ""RUSHY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"").
- ""PUSHY"" we tried and P is excluded.

So the main candidates are BUSHY, GUSHY, MUSHY.

But we need to check if they are valid words.

- BUSHY: meaning full of bushes, like a bushy tail.
- GUSHY: meaning effusively sentimental.
- MUSHY: meaning soft and pulpy, or emotionally sentimental.

All are valid.

Now, we have to choose one. But note that in our feedback for ""pushy"", we got U, S, H, Y all correct. That means the secret word has U in position 2, S in 3, H in 4, Y in 5. So the only position we don't know is the first.

And we have three candidates: B, G, M for the first letter.

We can guess any of them, but we need to pick one.

Since we have no more information, we can make a guess and see.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4. We can try one of these.

To be systematic, we can choose the most common one or one that might give more information, but in this case, since we know the last four letters are fixed, any guess will tell us if the first letter is correct or not.

If we guess one and it's wrong, we still have two more tries (guesses 5 and 6) to try the other two.

But let's see the frequency or commonness.

""Bushy"" is a common word, as is ""mushy"". ""Gushy"" is less common.

But we don't know the word list.

We could also consider if there are other possibilities? What about ""CUSHY""? But C is excluded.

""JUSHY"" - not a word.

""FUSHY"" - not a word.

""HUSHY"" - not common, and H is already in position 4, but we can't have H in position 1? The word is ?USHY, so position 1 is separate. But ""hushy"" isn't standard.

""TUSHY"" - informal, might not be in word list.

So probably the main ones are BUSHY, MUSHY, GUSHY.

Now, we have to pick one. Let's go with ""BUSHY"" as it's a common word.

But note: in the feedback for ""pushy"", we had U, S, H, Y correct, so if we guess ""bushy"", it should be all correct if B is the first letter.

Similarly for the others.

So, I'll guess ""BUSHY"".

But let's double-check the excluded letters: B is not excluded, yes.

So, <guess>bushy</guess>

But we must be cautious: is there a chance that the word has a double letter? For example, could it be ""GUSHY"" with G, but we don't have any indication of double letters. In ""pushy"", we had only one S and one H, but in the secret word, since S and H are in the same positions, and we have them correct, it doesn't suggest double letters.

Moreover, in position 1, it's a single letter.

So, I think it's safe to guess one of the candidates.

Alternatively, we could think if there are other words. For example, ""WUSHU"" but that doesn't end with Y, and positions don't match.

No, the word must end with USHY.

So, I'll go with ""BUSHY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → T, O, I, L are absent (x), and S is present but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 5 and marked `-`, it cannot be in position 5 in the secret word.
- **Guess 3: ""pushy""** → P is absent (x), while U, S, H, and Y are correct and in the right positions (✓). This means:
  - Position 2 must be U.
  - Position 3 must be S.
  - Position 4 must be H.
  - Position 5 must be Y.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the form `_ U S H Y` (first letter unknown, followed by ""USHY"").
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the word.
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (since U, S, H, Y are already confirmed in positions 2–5).
- **Possible words**: The only common 5-letter English words matching `_USHY` are:
  - **BUSHY** (meaning overgrown with bushes)
  - **MUSHY** (meaning soft or sentimental)
  - **GUSHY** (meaning effusively sentimental)

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Since the last 4 letters are confirmed, the only unknown is position 1. We need to test one of the candidate words to identify the first letter.
- **BUSHY** is selected as the guess because it is a common word and tests the letter B, which is a high-frequency consonant. If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, the feedback will eliminate B, narrowing the options to MUSHY or GUSHY for subsequent guesses.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess ""crane"" got all feedback as (x), meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

Looking at common English letters, we can try using other vowels and consonants.
Vowels we haven't used: O, U, I (sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good starting word might be something like ""TULIP"" or ""SPOIL"", but we must make sure it doesn't have any forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLOTH"", but let's check:

We need a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words:
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> no forbidden letters? L, I, G, H, T are all not in the forbidden set. But let me confirm: forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E -> so L,I,G,H,T are allowed.
- Other options: ""PIOUS"", ""MUSIC"" (but M,U,S,I,C -> C is forbidden). So ""MUSIC"" is invalid because C is forbidden.
- ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E is forbidden, so invalid.

Let me think of a word that avoids C,R,A,N,E and has a good mix of common letters.

One popular choice is ""OUPHE"" but that might be too obscure.

Another common Wordle starting word is ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y -> letters: T,I,P,S,Y. Check: T (allowed), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed), Y (allowed). And none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}. So ""TIPSY"" is valid.

But perhaps we can do better. We know that the secret word has none of the letters C,R,A,N,E, so we can use any other letters.

We could try to cover more frequent letters. According to English letter frequency, after vowels (we've tested A and E, which are very common, but they are absent), we have S, T, U, etc.

Let's choose a word that uses S, T, U, O, and another common consonant.

Word: ""STOMP"" -> S,T,O,M,P -> no C,R,A,N,E -> allowed.

Word: ""SLUMP"" -> S,L,U,M,P -> also allowed.

But we already know E is missing, so we might try to use O and U as vowels.

Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> allowed.

But let's go for maximum coverage of common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. Since E,A,R,N are eliminated (from our first guess), we have T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We should try to include as many of these as possible in one guess.

Possible words:
- ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S -> all allowed, and covers T, O, I, L, S.
- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D -> also covers D.
- ""LOUIS"" -> proper noun? might not be valid. So avoid.
- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> B is less common, but has D,O,U,T.

I think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and not excluded.

Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T -> has H and U, which are also common.

But ""TOILS"" seems better because it has I (a vowel) and S.

We could also consider ""AUDIO"" but A is forbidden (and we already know A is not in the word) so that's out.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" is not standard and has A.

So, I'll go with ""TOILS"".

But wait, let me double-check: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}? Yes.

So the next guess: ""TOILS"".

We'll get feedback and then adjust from there.After the first guess ""CRANE"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, our next guess must avoid these letters entirely.

To maximize information gain, we should focus on common unused letters like S, T, O, I, L, H, and U. A strong second guess should cover multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any from the previous guess.

The word ""TOILS"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 new letters: T, O, I, L, S (all absent from ""CRANE"").
- It includes common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S).
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This approach helps test frequent letters efficiently and narrow down possibilities faster.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""toils"" -> T(x), O(x), I(x), L(x), S(-)

The feedback for ""toils"" tells us:
- T, O, I, L are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 5th position (since in ""toils"" it was the last letter and got a minus).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, S (but S is present, so we know it's in the word).

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L. The remaining consonants and vowels are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)

We also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not at the end)
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L)
- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.

Since S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the available set: H, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try to think of words that start with S and use other available letters.

For example:
- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let's check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

We must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.

We need to avoid O as well.

What about ""SUMPH""? Not common.

Let's think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And S must be included.

Let's try S at the beginning:

- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S's? We don't know if the word has two S's. But it's allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S's? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"", we only got one S marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's only one S. It could be that there is another S that we didn't guess. But in ""toils"", we only had one S and it was in the wrong position. So if there were two S's, we might have gotten two minuses? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the ones that are present. But in Wordle, if there is one S and we have one S, we get one minus. If there are two S's and we have one S, we still get one minus. If we have two S's and the word has two, we get two minuses. But in ""toils"" we had only one S and got one minus, so the word has at least one S. It could have more.

But for now, we can try words with one S or two S's.

But to be safe, let's assume we are testing for one S for now.

Back to ""SUDSY"": letters S, U, D, S, Y. But we have two S's. The available letters are fine: U, D, Y are allowed. But is ""SUDSY"" a word? It means something foamy or suds-like, but it might be accepted. However, we have S in position 1 and 4. We know that S is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""toils""), but position 4 might be possible? We don't know yet.

But we need to avoid using too many rare letters.

Another word: ""SHULY"" - not common.

Perhaps ""SUGHS"": S, U, G, H, S -> again two S's. And U, G, H are allowed.

But let's look for words without double S to avoid complexity.

What about S in the middle?

For example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.

But we can try S in position 1.

Let me list some words starting with S and using available letters:

- ""SUMPH"" - not common.
- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.
- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it's a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.

""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.

We know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.

Similarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.

Another word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

""DUMPY"": but no S.

We must include S.

""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.

""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let's see if it's in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.

But we can choose a more common word.

""HUMPH"": but no S.

""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M's. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).

But let's see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don't know.

Another common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.

""PUSHY"" is a common word.

We could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

But let's choose one.

We also have the option to put S in a position we haven't tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven't tried S in 1,2,3,4.

To maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.

But we also need to test other common letters.

Available common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.

But P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.

""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S's. But K is allowed.

""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).

But let's avoid double S for simplicity.

So, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.

But we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.

We could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.

Another idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.

""MUMMY"" - no S.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.

All are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.

S is included, and we are putting it in position 3.

So, we can guess ""PUSHY"".

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's elsewhere.

We are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.

In the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.

But we have no information about Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.

For example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.

""SHULN"" - not a word.

""SUQHS"" - not common.

""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").

N is forbidden.

Another common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.

So invalid.

""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.

We must have S.

""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S's. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

<guess>pushy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.
3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.
   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.

### Why ""PUSHY""?
- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.
  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).
  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.
  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).
- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.
- **Information gain**: This guess tests:
  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).
  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).
  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.

<guess>pushy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Guess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> T, O, I, L absent, and S present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 5).
Guess 3: ""pushy"" -> P absent, and U, S, H, Y are correct and in the right positions? Let's see the feedback: U(✓), S(✓), H(✓), Y(✓). That means U, S, H, Y are in the word and in the correct positions.

The feedback for ""pushy"":
- P(x) -> P is not in the word.
- U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- H(✓) -> H is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this, we know that the secret word has:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: Y

And we also know that the first letter is not P, and not any of the previously excluded letters.

Now, what about position 1? We don't know the first letter yet.

We know the word is _ U S H Y

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? U S H Y.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.

And we have confirmed that U, S, H, Y are in the word and in these positions.

Now, what letters are possible for the first position? It must be a letter not in the excluded list and not P (since P is absent).

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).

We need to find a word that starts with one of these and is followed by ""USHY"".

Let's think of common words ending with ""USHY"". Actually, the word is ?USHY.

What words end with ""USHY""? Not many. The most common one is ""GUSHY"", but we already used ""PUSHY"" and it had P which is absent. ""GUSHY"" would be G U S H Y.

G is not excluded, so it's a candidate.

Other possibilities? ""MUSHY"" but M U S H Y. M is allowed.

""BUSHY"" but B U S H Y. B is allowed.

Let's list:

- BUSHY: B U S H Y
- GUSHY: G U S H Y
- MUSHY: M U S H Y
- Also, ""RUSHY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"").
- ""PUSHY"" we tried and P is excluded.

So the main candidates are BUSHY, GUSHY, MUSHY.

But we need to check if they are valid words.

- BUSHY: meaning full of bushes, like a bushy tail.
- GUSHY: meaning effusively sentimental.
- MUSHY: meaning soft and pulpy, or emotionally sentimental.

All are valid.

Now, we have to choose one. But note that in our feedback for ""pushy"", we got U, S, H, Y all correct. That means the secret word has U in position 2, S in 3, H in 4, Y in 5. So the only position we don't know is the first.

And we have three candidates: B, G, M for the first letter.

We can guess any of them, but we need to pick one.

Since we have no more information, we can make a guess and see.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4. We can try one of these.

To be systematic, we can choose the most common one or one that might give more information, but in this case, since we know the last four letters are fixed, any guess will tell us if the first letter is correct or not.

If we guess one and it's wrong, we still have two more tries (guesses 5 and 6) to try the other two.

But let's see the frequency or commonness.

""Bushy"" is a common word, as is ""mushy"". ""Gushy"" is less common.

But we don't know the word list.

We could also consider if there are other possibilities? What about ""CUSHY""? But C is excluded.

""JUSHY"" - not a word.

""FUSHY"" - not a word.

""HUSHY"" - not common, and H is already in position 4, but we can't have H in position 1? The word is ?USHY, so position 1 is separate. But ""hushy"" isn't standard.

""TUSHY"" - informal, might not be in word list.

So probably the main ones are BUSHY, MUSHY, GUSHY.

Now, we have to pick one. Let's go with ""BUSHY"" as it's a common word.

But note: in the feedback for ""pushy"", we had U, S, H, Y correct, so if we guess ""bushy"", it should be all correct if B is the first letter.

Similarly for the others.

So, I'll guess ""BUSHY"".

But let's double-check the excluded letters: B is not excluded, yes.

So, <guess>bushy</guess>

But we must be cautious: is there a chance that the word has a double letter? For example, could it be ""GUSHY"" with G, but we don't have any indication of double letters. In ""pushy"", we had only one S and one H, but in the secret word, since S and H are in the same positions, and we have them correct, it doesn't suggest double letters.

Moreover, in position 1, it's a single letter.

So, I think it's safe to guess one of the candidates.

Alternatively, we could think if there are other words. For example, ""WUSHU"" but that doesn't end with Y, and positions don't match.

No, the word must end with USHY.

So, I'll go with ""BUSHY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → T, O, I, L are absent (x), and S is present but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 5 and marked `-`, it cannot be in position 5 in the secret word.
- **Guess 3: ""pushy""** → P is absent (x), while U, S, H, and Y are correct and in the right positions (✓). This means:
  - Position 2 must be U.
  - Position 3 must be S.
  - Position 4 must be H.
  - Position 5 must be Y.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the form `_ U S H Y` (first letter unknown, followed by ""USHY"").
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the word.
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (since U, S, H, Y are already confirmed in positions 2–5).
- **Possible words**: The only common 5-letter English words matching `_USHY` are:
  - **BUSHY** (meaning overgrown with bushes)
  - **MUSHY** (meaning soft or sentimental)
  - **GUSHY** (meaning effusively sentimental)

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Since the last 4 letters are confirmed, the only unknown is position 1. We need to test one of the candidate words to identify the first letter.
- **BUSHY** is selected as the guess because it is a common word and tests the letter B, which is a high-frequency consonant. If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, the feedback will eliminate B, narrowing the options to MUSHY or GUSHY for subsequent guesses.

The remaining consonants and vowels are:\nConsonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\nVowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)\n\nWe also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains S (but not at the end)\n- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L)\n- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S and use the available letters.\n\nCommon positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.\n\nSince S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the available set: H, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that start with S and use other available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let\'s check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.\n\nWe must avoid L.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid O as well.\n\nWhat about ""SUMPH""? Not common.\n\nLet\'s think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L\n\nSo available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAnd S must be included.\n\nLet\'s try S at the beginning:\n\n- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. But it\'s allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S\'s? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5. But we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"", we only got one S marked, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean there\'s only one S. It could be that there is another S that we didn\'t guess. But in ""toils"", we only had one S and it was in the wrong position. So if there were two S\'s, we might have gotten two minuses? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the ones that are present. But in Wordle, if there is one S and we have one S, we get one minus. If there are two S\'s and we have one S, we still get one minus. If we have two S\'s and the word has two, we get two minuses. But in ""toils"" we had only one S and got one minus, so the word has at least one S. It could have more.\n\nBut for now, we can try words with one S or two S\'s.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s assume we are testing for one S for now.\n\nBack to ""SUDSY"": letters S, U, D, S, Y. But we have two S\'s. The available letters are fine: U, D, Y are allowed. But is ""SUDSY"" a word? It means something foamy or suds-like, but it might be accepted. However, we have S in position 1 and 4. We know that S is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""toils""), but position 4 might be possible? We don\'t know yet.\n\nBut we need to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SHULY"" - not common.\n\nPerhaps ""SUGHS"": S, U, G, H, S -> again two S\'s. And U, G, H are allowed.\n\nBut let\'s look for words without double S to avoid complexity.\n\nWhat about S in the middle?\n\nFor example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.\n\nBut we can try S in position 1.\n\nLet me list some words starting with S and using available letters:\n\n- ""SUMPH"" - not common.\n- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.\n- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it\'s a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.\n\n""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.\n\nWe know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.\n\nAnother word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.\n\n""DUMPY"": but no S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\n""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.\n\n""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let\'s see if it\'s in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.\n\nBut we can choose a more common word.\n\n""HUMPH"": but no S.\n\n""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M\'s. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).\n\nBut let\'s see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.\n\n""PUSHY"" is a common word.\n\nWe could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nWe also have the option to put S in a position we haven\'t tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven\'t tried S in 1,2,3,4.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.\n\nBut we also need to test other common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.\n\nBut P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.\n\n""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S\'s. But K is allowed.\n\n""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).\n\nBut let\'s avoid double S for simplicity.\n\nSo, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.\n\nWe could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.\n\n""MUMMY"" - no S.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.\n\nAll are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.\n\nS is included, and we are putting it in position 3.\n\nSo, we can guess ""PUSHY"".\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s elsewhere.\n\nWe are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nIn the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.\n\nBut we have no information about Y.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.\n\nFor example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.\n\n""SHULN"" - not a word.\n\n""SUQHS"" - not common.\n\n""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").\n\nN is forbidden.\n\nAnother common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.\n\nWe must have S.\n\n""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S\'s. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PUSHY"".\n\n<guess>pushy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").\n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.\n3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n4. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.\n   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.\n   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.\n\n### Why ""PUSHY""?\n- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.\n  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).\n  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.\n  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).\n- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n- **Information gain**: This guess tests:\n  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).\n  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).\n  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).\n  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.\n\n<guess>pushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\nGuess 2: ""toils"" -> T, O, I, L absent, and S present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 5).\nGuess 3: ""pushy"" -> P absent, and U, S, H, Y are correct and in the right positions?

U S H Y.\n\nAlso, from previous feedback, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.\n\nAnd we have confirmed that U, S, H, Y are in the word and in these positions.\n\nNow, what letters are possible for the first position? It must be a letter not in the excluded list and not P (since P is absent).\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).\n\nWe need to find a word that starts with one of these and is followed by ""USHY"".\n\nLet\'s think of common words ending with ""USHY"". Actually, the word is ?USHY.\n\nWhat words end with ""USHY""? Not many. The most common one is ""GUSHY"", but we already used ""PUSHY"" and it had P which is absent. ""GUSHY"" would be G U S H Y.\n\nG is not excluded, so it\'s a candidate.\n\nOther possibilities? ""MUSHY"" but M U S H Y. M is allowed.\n\n""BUSHY"" but B U S H Y. B is allowed.\n\nLet\'s list:\n\n- BUSHY: B U S H Y\n- GUSHY: G U S H Y\n- MUSHY: M U S H Y\n- Also, ""RUSHY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"").\n- ""PUSHY"" we tried and P is excluded.\n\nSo the main candidates are BUSHY, GUSHY, MUSHY.\n\nBut we need to check if they are valid words.\n\n- BUSHY: meaning full of bushes, like a bushy tail.\n- GUSHY: meaning effusively sentimental.\n- MUSHY: meaning soft and pulpy, or emotionally sentimental.\n\nAll are valid.\n\nNow, we have to choose one. But note that in our feedback for ""pushy"", we got U, S, H, Y all correct. That means the secret word has U in position 2, S in 3, H in 4, Y in 5. So the only position we don\'t know is the first.\n\nAnd we have three candidates: B, G, M for the first letter.\n\nWe can guess any of them, but we need to pick one.\n\nSince we have no more information, we can make a guess and see.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4. We can try one of these.\n\nTo be systematic, we can choose the most common one or one that might give more information, but in this case, since we know the last four letters are fixed, any guess will tell us if the first letter is correct or not.\n\nIf we guess one and it\'s wrong, we still have two more tries (guesses 5 and 6) to try the other two.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency or commonness.\n\n""Bushy"" is a common word, as is ""mushy"". ""Gushy"" is less common.\n\nBut we don\'t know the word list.\n\nWe could also consider if there are other possibilities? What about ""CUSHY""? But C is excluded.\n\n""JUSHY"" - not a word.\n\n""FUSHY"" - not a word.\n\n""HUSHY"" - not common, and H is already in position 4, but we can\'t have H in position 1? The word is ?USHY, so position 1 is separate. But ""hushy"" isn\'t standard.\n\n""TUSHY"" - informal, might not be in word list.\n\nSo probably the main ones are BUSHY, MUSHY, GUSHY.\n\nNow, we have to pick one. Let\'s go with ""BUSHY"" as it\'s a common word.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""pushy"", we had U, S, H, Y correct, so if we guess ""bushy"", it should be all correct if B is the first letter.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""BUSHY"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the excluded letters: B is not excluded, yes.\n\nSo, <guess>bushy</guess>\n\nBut we must be cautious: is there a chance that the word has a double letter? For example, could it be ""GUSHY"" with G, but we don\'t have any indication of double letters. In ""pushy"", we had only one S and one H, but in the secret word, since S and H are in the same positions, and we have them correct, it doesn\'t suggest double letters.\n\nMoreover, in position 1, it\'s a single letter.\n\nSo, I think it\'s safe to guess one of the candidates.\n\nAlternatively, we could think if there are other words. For example, ""WUSHU"" but that doesn\'t end with Y, and positions don\'t match.\n\nNo, the word must end with USHY.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""BUSHY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.\n- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → T, O, I, L are absent (x), and S is present but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 5 and marked `-`, it cannot be in position 5 in the secret word.\n- **Guess 3: ""pushy""** → P is absent (x), while U, S, H, and Y are correct and in the right positions (✓). This means:\n  - Position 2 must be U.\n  - Position 3 must be S.\n  - Position 4 must be H.\n  - Position 5 must be Y.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the form `_ U S H Y` (first letter unknown, followed by ""USHY"").\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the word.\n- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (since U, S, H, Y are already confirmed in positions 2–5).\n- **Possible words**: The only common 5-letter English words matching `_USHY` are:\n  - **BUSHY** (meaning overgrown with bushes)\n  - **MUSHY** (meaning soft or sentimental)\n  - **GUSHY** (meaning effusively sentimental)\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Since the last 4 letters are confirmed, the only unknown is position 1. We need to test one of the candidate words to identify the first letter.\n- **BUSHY** is selected as the guess because it is a common word and tests the letter B, which is a high-frequency consonant. If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, the feedback will eliminate B, narrowing the options to MUSHY or GUSHY for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>bushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess ""crane"" got all feedback as (x), meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

Looking at common English letters, we can try using other vowels and consonants.
Vowels we haven't used: O, U, I (sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good starting word might be something like ""TULIP"" or ""SPOIL"", but we must make sure it doesn't have any forbidden letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLOTH"", but let's check:

We need a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words:
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> no forbidden letters? L, I, G, H, T are all not in the forbidden set. But let me confirm: forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E -> so L,I,G,H,T are allowed.
- Other options: ""PIOUS"", ""MUSIC"" (but M,U,S,I,C -> C is forbidden). So ""MUSIC"" is invalid because C is forbidden.
- ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E is forbidden, so invalid.

Let me think of a word that avoids C,R,A,N,E and has a good mix of common letters.

One popular choice is ""OUPHE"" but that might be too obscure.

Another common Wordle starting word is ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y -> letters: T,I,P,S,Y. Check: T (allowed), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed), Y (allowed). And none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}. So ""TIPSY"" is valid.

But perhaps we can do better. We know that the secret word has none of the letters C,R,A,N,E, so we can use any other letters.

We could try to cover more frequent letters. According to English letter frequency, after vowels (we've tested A and E, which are very common, but they are absent), we have S, T, U, etc.

Let's choose a word that uses S, T, U, O, and another common consonant.

Word: ""STOMP"" -> S,T,O,M,P -> no C,R,A,N,E -> allowed.

Word: ""SLUMP"" -> S,L,U,M,P -> also allowed.

But we already know E is missing, so we might try to use O and U as vowels.

Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> allowed.

But let's go for maximum coverage of common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. Since E,A,R,N are eliminated (from our first guess), we have T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

We should try to include as many of these as possible in one guess.

Possible words:
- ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S -> all allowed, and covers T, O, I, L, S.
- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D -> also covers D.
- ""LOUIS"" -> proper noun? might not be valid. So avoid.
- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> B is less common, but has D,O,U,T.

I think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and not excluded.

Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T -> has H and U, which are also common.

But ""TOILS"" seems better because it has I (a vowel) and S.

We could also consider ""AUDIO"" but A is forbidden (and we already know A is not in the word) so that's out.

Another word: ""OUIJA"" is not standard and has A.

So, I'll go with ""TOILS"".

But wait, let me double-check: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}? Yes.

So the next guess: ""TOILS"".

We'll get feedback and then adjust from there.After the first guess ""CRANE"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, our next guess must avoid these letters entirely.

To maximize information gain, we should focus on common unused letters like S, T, O, I, L, H, and U. A strong second guess should cover multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any from the previous guess.

The word ""TOILS"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 new letters: T, O, I, L, S (all absent from ""CRANE"").
- It includes common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S).
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This approach helps test frequent letters efficiently and narrow down possibilities faster.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""toils"" -> T(x), O(x), I(x), L(x), S(-)

The feedback for ""toils"" tells us:
- T, O, I, L are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 5th position (since in ""toils"" it was the last letter and got a minus).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, S (but S is present, so we know it's in the word).

Available letters: We must avoid C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L. The remaining consonants and vowels are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)

We also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not at the end)
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L)
- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.

Since S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the available set: H, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try to think of words that start with S and use other available letters.

For example:
- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let's check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

We must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.

We need to avoid O as well.

What about ""SUMPH""? Not common.

Let's think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And S must be included.

Let's try S at the beginning:

- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S's? We don't know if the word has two S's. But it's allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S's? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"", we only got one S marked, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's only one S. It could be that there is another S that we didn't guess. But in ""toils"", we only had one S and it was in the wrong position. So if there were two S's, we might have gotten two minuses? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the ones that are present. But in Wordle, if there is one S and we have one S, we get one minus. If there are two S's and we have one S, we still get one minus. If we have two S's and the word has two, we get two minuses. But in ""toils"" we had only one S and got one minus, so the word has at least one S. It could have more.

But for now, we can try words with one S or two S's.

But to be safe, let's assume we are testing for one S for now.

Back to ""SUDSY"": letters S, U, D, S, Y. But we have two S's. The available letters are fine: U, D, Y are allowed. But is ""SUDSY"" a word? It means something foamy or suds-like, but it might be accepted. However, we have S in position 1 and 4. We know that S is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""toils""), but position 4 might be possible? We don't know yet.

But we need to avoid using too many rare letters.

Another word: ""SHULY"" - not common.

Perhaps ""SUGHS"": S, U, G, H, S -> again two S's. And U, G, H are allowed.

But let's look for words without double S to avoid complexity.

What about S in the middle?

For example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.

But we can try S in position 1.

Let me list some words starting with S and using available letters:

- ""SUMPH"" - not common.
- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.
- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it's a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.

""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.

We know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.

Similarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.

Another word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.

""DUMPY"": but no S.

We must include S.

""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.

""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let's see if it's in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.

But we can choose a more common word.

""HUMPH"": but no S.

""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M's. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).

But let's see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don't know.

Another common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.

""PUSHY"" is a common word.

We could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

But let's choose one.

We also have the option to put S in a position we haven't tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven't tried S in 1,2,3,4.

To maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.

But we also need to test other common letters.

Available common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.

But P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.

""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S's. But K is allowed.

""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).

But let's avoid double S for simplicity.

So, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.

But we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.

We could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.

Another idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.

""MUMMY"" - no S.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.

All are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.

S is included, and we are putting it in position 3.

So, we can guess ""PUSHY"".

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's elsewhere.

We are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.

In the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.

But we have no information about Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.

For example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.

""SHULN"" - not a word.

""SUQHS"" - not common.

""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").

N is forbidden.

Another common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.

So invalid.

""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.

We must have S.

""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S's. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

<guess>pushy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.
3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.
   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.

### Why ""PUSHY""?
- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.
  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).
  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.
  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).
- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.
- **Information gain**: This guess tests:
  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).
  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).
  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.

<guess>pushy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Guess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> T, O, I, L absent, and S present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 5).
Guess 3: ""pushy"" -> P absent, and U, S, H, Y are correct and in the right positions? Let's see the feedback: U(✓), S(✓), H(✓), Y(✓). That means U, S, H, Y are in the word and in the correct positions.

The feedback for ""pushy"":
- P(x) -> P is not in the word.
- U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- H(✓) -> H is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this, we know that the secret word has:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: Y

And we also know that the first letter is not P, and not any of the previously excluded letters.

Now, what about position 1? We don't know the first letter yet.

We know the word is _ U S H Y

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? U S H Y.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.

And we have confirmed that U, S, H, Y are in the word and in these positions.

Now, what letters are possible for the first position? It must be a letter not in the excluded list and not P (since P is absent).

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).

We need to find a word that starts with one of these and is followed by ""USHY"".

Let's think of common words ending with ""USHY"". Actually, the word is ?USHY.

What words end with ""USHY""? Not many. The most common one is ""GUSHY"", but we already used ""PUSHY"" and it had P which is absent. ""GUSHY"" would be G U S H Y.

G is not excluded, so it's a candidate.

Other possibilities? ""MUSHY"" but M U S H Y. M is allowed.

""BUSHY"" but B U S H Y. B is allowed.

Let's list:

- BUSHY: B U S H Y
- GUSHY: G U S H Y
- MUSHY: M U S H Y
- Also, ""RUSHY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"").
- ""PUSHY"" we tried and P is excluded.

So the main candidates are BUSHY, GUSHY, MUSHY.

But we need to check if they are valid words.

- BUSHY: meaning full of bushes, like a bushy tail.
- GUSHY: meaning effusively sentimental.
- MUSHY: meaning soft and pulpy, or emotionally sentimental.

All are valid.

Now, we have to choose one. But note that in our feedback for ""pushy"", we got U, S, H, Y all correct. That means the secret word has U in position 2, S in 3, H in 4, Y in 5. So the only position we don't know is the first.

And we have three candidates: B, G, M for the first letter.

We can guess any of them, but we need to pick one.

Since we have no more information, we can make a guess and see.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4. We can try one of these.

To be systematic, we can choose the most common one or one that might give more information, but in this case, since we know the last four letters are fixed, any guess will tell us if the first letter is correct or not.

If we guess one and it's wrong, we still have two more tries (guesses 5 and 6) to try the other two.

But let's see the frequency or commonness.

""Bushy"" is a common word, as is ""mushy"". ""Gushy"" is less common.

But we don't know the word list.

We could also consider if there are other possibilities? What about ""CUSHY""? But C is excluded.

""JUSHY"" - not a word.

""FUSHY"" - not a word.

""HUSHY"" - not common, and H is already in position 4, but we can't have H in position 1? The word is ?USHY, so position 1 is separate. But ""hushy"" isn't standard.

""TUSHY"" - informal, might not be in word list.

So probably the main ones are BUSHY, MUSHY, GUSHY.

Now, we have to pick one. Let's go with ""BUSHY"" as it's a common word.

But note: in the feedback for ""pushy"", we had U, S, H, Y correct, so if we guess ""bushy"", it should be all correct if B is the first letter.

Similarly for the others.

So, I'll guess ""BUSHY"".

But let's double-check the excluded letters: B is not excluded, yes.

So, <guess>bushy</guess>

But we must be cautious: is there a chance that the word has a double letter? For example, could it be ""GUSHY"" with G, but we don't have any indication of double letters. In ""pushy"", we had only one S and one H, but in the secret word, since S and H are in the same positions, and we have them correct, it doesn't suggest double letters.

Moreover, in position 1, it's a single letter.

So, I think it's safe to guess one of the candidates.

Alternatively, we could think if there are other words. For example, ""WUSHU"" but that doesn't end with Y, and positions don't match.

No, the word must end with USHY.

So, I'll go with ""BUSHY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → T, O, I, L are absent (x), and S is present but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 5 and marked `-`, it cannot be in position 5 in the secret word.
- **Guess 3: ""pushy""** → P is absent (x), while U, S, H, and Y are correct and in the right positions (✓). This means:
  - Position 2 must be U.
  - Position 3 must be S.
  - Position 4 must be H.
  - Position 5 must be Y.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the form `_ U S H Y` (first letter unknown, followed by ""USHY"").
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the word.
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (since U, S, H, Y are already confirmed in positions 2–5).
- **Possible words**: The only common 5-letter English words matching `_USHY` are:
  - **BUSHY** (meaning overgrown with bushes)
  - **MUSHY** (meaning soft or sentimental)
  - **GUSHY** (meaning effusively sentimental)

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Since the last 4 letters are confirmed, the only unknown is position 1. We need to test one of the candidate words to identify the first letter.
- **BUSHY** is selected as the guess because it is a common word and tests the letter B, which is a high-frequency consonant. If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, the feedback will eliminate B, narrowing the options to MUSHY or GUSHY for subsequent guesses.

<guess>bushy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Guess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 4: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback up to Guess 4:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" had all (x) → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""toils"" had T, O, I, L as (x) and S as (-) → T, O, I, L are not in the word; S is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 3: ""pushy"" had P as (x) and U, S, H, Y all (✓) → P is not in the word; U is in position 2, S in position 3, H in position 4, Y in position 5. Therefore, the word is ? U S H Y.
- Guess 4: ""bushy"" had B as (x) and U, S, H, Y all (✓) → B is not in the word; U, S, H, Y are confirmed in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.

So, the secret word is of the form _ U S H Y, and we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P, B.

That leaves available letters for position 1: D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

From common word knowledge, possible candidates are:
- ""MUSHY"": meaning soft or overly sentimental.
- ""GUSHY"": meaning effusively sentimental.

Other possibilities might be rare or not standard English words. For example, ""WUSHY"" is not a word, ""JUSHY"" doesn't exist, ""FUSHY"" isn't common, etc.

So, the two main candidates are ""GUSHY"" and ""MUSHY"".

We have two guesses left (since this is guess 5, and we get 6 total). We can pick one of these.

Let's choose ""GUSHY"" as the next guess. If it's correct, we win. If not, we'll know it must be ""MUSHY"".

Alternatively, we could pick ""MUSHY"" first. Since both are equally plausible, we can choose arbitrarily.

I'll go with ""GUSHY"" for guess 5.

<guess>gushy</guess>The feedback reveals that all letters except the first are confirmed:
- **Position 2: U** (✓)
- **Position 3: S** (✓)
- **Position 4: H** (✓)
- **Position 5: Y** (✓)  
Thus, the word pattern is `_ U S H Y`.

**Excluded letters** (from all past feedback):
- **C, R, A, N, E** (from ""crane"" all ❌)
- **T, O, I, L** (from ""toils"" all ❌)
- **P** (from ""pushy"" position 1 ❌)
- **B** (from ""bushy"" position 1 ❌)  
This leaves possible first letters: **D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z**.

**Possible words** fitting `_USHY`:
- **GUSHY** (effusively sentimental)
- **MUSHY** (soft/sentimental)  
Others like ""FUSHY"", ""JUSHY"", or ""WUSHY"" are invalid/obscure.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Test **""GUSHY""** to cover the letter **G** (common untested letter). If correct, solved. If ❌, ""MUSHY"" is the only remaining common word for guess 6.

L, I, G, H, T are all not in the forbidden set. But let me confirm: forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E -> so L,I,G,H,T are allowed.\n- Other options: ""PIOUS"", ""MUSIC"" (but M,U,S,I,C -> C is forbidden). So ""MUSIC"" is invalid because C is forbidden.\n- ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E is forbidden, so invalid.\n\nLet me think of a word that avoids C,R,A,N,E and has a good mix of common letters.\n\nOne popular choice is ""OUPHE"" but that might be too obscure.\n\nAnother common Wordle starting word is ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y -> letters: T,I,P,S,Y. Check: T (allowed), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed), Y (allowed). And none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}. So ""TIPSY"" is valid.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better. We know that the secret word has none of the letters C,R,A,N,E, so we can use any other letters.\n\nWe could try to cover more frequent letters. According to English letter frequency, after vowels (we\'ve tested A and E, which are very common, but they are absent), we have S, T, U, etc.\n\nLet\'s choose a word that uses S, T, U, O, and another common consonant.\n\nWord: ""STOMP"" -> S,T,O,M,P -> no C,R,A,N,E -> allowed.\n\nWord: ""SLUMP"" -> S,L,U,M,P -> also allowed.\n\nBut we already know E is missing, so we might try to use O and U as vowels.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> allowed.\n\nBut let\'s go for maximum coverage of common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. Since E,A,R,N are eliminated (from our first guess), we have T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\nWe should try to include as many of these as possible in one guess.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S -> all allowed, and covers T, O, I, L, S.\n- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D -> also covers D.\n- ""LOUIS"" -> proper noun? might not be valid. So avoid.\n- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> B is less common, but has D,O,U,T.\n\nI think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T -> has H and U, which are also common.\n\nBut ""TOILS"" seems better because it has I (a vowel) and S.\n\nWe could also consider ""AUDIO"" but A is forbidden (and we already know A is not in the word) so that\'s out.\n\nAnother word: ""OUIJA"" is not standard and has A.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TOILS"".\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in {C,R,A,N,E}? Yes.\n\nSo the next guess: ""TOILS"".\n\nWe\'ll get feedback and then adjust from there.After the first guess ""CRANE"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, our next guess must avoid these letters entirely.\n\nTo maximize information gain, we should focus on common unused letters like S, T, O, I, L, H, and U. A strong second guess should cover multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any from the previous guess.\n\nThe word ""TOILS"" is an excellent choice because:\n- It uses 5 new letters: T, O, I, L, S (all absent from ""CRANE"").\n- It includes common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S).\n- It\'s a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis approach helps test frequent letters efficiently and narrow down possibilities faster.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

The remaining consonants and vowels are:\nConsonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\nVowels: U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel)\n\nWe also know that S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 5th position.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains S (but not at the end)\n- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L)\n- We can use Y as a vowel if needed.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S and use the available letters.\n\nCommon positions for S: it can be at the beginning, or in the middle.\n\nSince S is not in the 5th position in the secret word, we should try S in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the available set: H, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that start with S and use other available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""SHYLY"": but that has Y and H. But let\'s check: S (must include, and at start), H, Y, L -> but L is forbidden! We cannot use L because it was in ""toils"" and got (x), so L is not in the word. So ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.\n\nWe must avoid L.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is forbidden (from ""toils"", O got x). So invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid O as well.\n\nWhat about ""SUMPH""? Not common.\n\nLet\'s think of words with S and without the forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L\n\nSo available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAnd S must be included.\n\nLet\'s try S at the beginning:\n\n- ""SUDSY"": S,U,D,S,Y -> but has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. But it\'s allowed. Letters: S, U, D, Y. But we have two S\'s? The word is S-U-D-S-Y, so positions: S1, U2, D3, S4, Y5. But we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, in the feedback for ""toils"", we only got one S marked, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean there\'s only one S. It could be that there is another S that we didn\'t guess. But in ""toils"", we only had one S and it was in the wrong position. So if there were two S\'s, we might have gotten two minuses? Not necessarily, because the feedback only marks the ones that are present. But in Wordle, if there is one S and we have one S, we get one minus. If there are two S\'s and we have one S, we still get one minus. If we have two S\'s and the word has two, we get two minuses. But in ""toils"" we had only one S and got one minus, so the word has at least one S. It could have more.\n\nBut for now, we can try words with one S or two S\'s.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s assume we are testing for one S for now.\n\nBack to ""SUDSY"": letters S, U, D, S, Y. But we have two S\'s. The available letters are fine: U, D, Y are allowed. But is ""SUDSY"" a word? It means something foamy or suds-like, but it might be accepted. However, we have S in position 1 and 4. We know that S is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""toils""), but position 4 might be possible? We don\'t know yet.\n\nBut we need to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SHULY"" - not common.\n\nPerhaps ""SUGHS"": S, U, G, H, S -> again two S\'s. And U, G, H are allowed.\n\nBut let\'s look for words without double S to avoid complexity.\n\nWhat about S in the middle?\n\nFor example, words with S in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: we know that in ""toils"" S was in position 5 and was wrong, so position 4 might be possible.\n\nBut we can try S in position 1.\n\nLet me list some words starting with S and using available letters:\n\n- ""SUMPH"" - not common.\n- ""SYKES"" - proper noun? Not good.\n- ""SPUMY"" - S, P, U, M, Y -> all allowed. And it\'s a word (meaning frothy). But we have S in position 1.\n\n""SPUMY"": S1, P2, U3, M4, Y5.\n\nWe know that S is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Either way, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing P, U, M, Y.\n\nAnother word: ""SHYLY"" is invalid because of L.\n\n""DUMPY"": but no S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\n""BUSKY"": B,U,S,K,Y -> S is in position 3. Letters: B, U, S, K, Y. All allowed? B, U, S, K, Y are not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L, so yes.\n\n""BUSKY"" is a word? It might be archaic, meaning drunk, but let\'s see if it\'s in the Wordle dictionary. We can assume it might be.\n\nBut we can choose a more common word.\n\n""HUMPH"": but no S.\n\n""MUMSY"": M,U,M,S,Y -> has two M\'s. And S in position 4. Letters: M, U, S, Y. All allowed. ""MUMSY"" is a word (meaning dull or ordinary).\n\nBut let\'s see: we have S in position 4. In the previous guess, S was in position 5 and got minus, so position 4 might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother common word: ""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> S in position 3. Letters P,U,S,H,Y all allowed.\n\n""PUSHY"" is a common word.\n\nWe could also do ""GUSHY"": G,U,S,H,Y -> similar.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nWe also have the option to put S in a position we haven\'t tried. In ""toils"", S was in position 5. We haven\'t tried S in 1,2,3,4.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to try S in a different position.\n\nBut we also need to test other common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: S (must include), and then H, U, D, P, M, Y, B, etc.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: it has P, U, S, H, Y. All new letters except S, and S is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUSHY"" has G instead of P.\n\nBut P is more common than G, so ""PUSHY"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""BUSH"" is 4 letters, too short.\n\n""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> two S\'s. But K is allowed.\n\n""BUSKS"" is a word (third person of busk).\n\nBut let\'s avoid double S for simplicity.\n\nSo, I think ""PUSHY"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut we must consider that Y is at the end. Y can be a vowel.\n\nWe could also try ""SHOWY"" but O is forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""SUDDS"" - double D and S, not good.\n\n""MUMMY"" - no S.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: P, U, S, H, Y.\n\nAll are not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,I,L are forbidden, and P,U,S,H,Y are not among them.\n\nS is included, and we are putting it in position 3.\n\nSo, we can guess ""PUSHY"".\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s elsewhere.\n\nWe are also testing U in position 2, H in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nIn the previous feedback, we know that S is not in position 5, so if we put Y in position 5, it might be correct or not.\n\nBut we have no information about Y.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word with S at the beginning to test position 1.\n\nFor example, ""SPUMY"" as I thought earlier, but ""SPUMY"" is less common.\n\n""SHULN"" - not a word.\n\n""SUQHS"" - not common.\n\n""SYNTH"" - but N is forbidden (from ""crane"").\n\nN is forbidden.\n\nAnother common word: ""DUCHY"" - D,U,C,H,Y -> C is forbidden! C is in the forbidden list.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> all allowed? P, U, D, G, Y. Yes, and no S. But we must include S.\n\nWe must have S.\n\n""GUSSY"" - G,U,S,S,Y -> two S\'s. S in position 3 and 4? G1, U2, S3, S4, Y5. But we are testing S in two positions. It might be okay, but we might get less information if we use duplicate letters.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PUSHY"".\n\n<guess>pushy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so these letters are not in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2: ""toils"" → T, O, I, L are absent (x), but S is present in the word but wrong position (-)**.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **S is in the secret word**, but not in the 5th position (since it was marked `-` in position 5 of ""toils"").\n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the secret word.\n3. **Available letters**: The secret word must use only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n4. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include **S** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.\n   - Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, H, U, P, Y) to maximize information gain.\n   - Avoid positions where S was previously incorrect (position 5), so test S in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n   - Ideal words should cover multiple new high-frequency letters (like H, U, P, Y) to narrow down possibilities faster.\n\n### Why ""PUSHY""?\n- **Letters**: P, U, S, H, Y.\n  - All letters are from the available set (no excluded letters).\n  - Includes **S** (required) in position 3, testing a new position not tried before.\n  - Covers other common letters: P, U, H, Y (all untested so far).\n- **Word validity**: ""PUSHY"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n- **Information gain**: This guess tests:\n  - S in position 3 (could be correct or reveal a new position).\n  - U in position 2, H in position 4, and Y in position 5 (all new positions).\n  - If S is correct (✓), we lock in position 3. If not (-), we learn S is in another position (1, 2, or 4).\n  - Feedback on P, U, H, Y will help eliminate or confirm these letters.\n\n<guess>pushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: pushy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\nGuess 2: ""toils"" -> T, O, I, L absent, and S present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 5).\nGuess 3: ""pushy"" -> P absent, and U, S, H, Y are correct and in the right positions? Let\'s see the feedback: U(✓), S(✓), H(✓), Y(✓). That means U, S, H, Y are in the word and in the correct positions.\n\nThe feedback for ""pushy"":\n- P(x) -> P is not in the word.\n- U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- H(✓) -> H is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n- Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo, from this, we know that the secret word has:\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: H\n- Position 5: Y\n\nAnd we also know that the first letter is not P, and not any of the previously excluded letters.\n\nNow, what about position 1? We don\'t know the first letter yet.\n\nWe know the word is _ U S H Y\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? U S H Y.\n\nAlso, from previous feedback, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.\n\nAnd we have confirmed that U, S, H, Y are in the word and in these positions.\n\nNow, what letters are possible for the first position? It must be a letter not in the excluded list and not P (since P is absent).\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).\n\nWe need to find a word that starts with one of these and is followed by ""USHY"".\n\nLet\'s think of common words ending with ""USHY"". Actually, the word is ?USHY.\n\nWhat words end with ""USHY""? Not many. The most common one is ""GUSHY"", but we already used ""PUSHY"" and it had P which is absent. ""GUSHY"" would be G U S H Y.\n\nG is not excluded, so it\'s a candidate.\n\nOther possibilities? ""MUSHY"" but M U S H Y. M is allowed.\n\n""BUSHY"" but B U S H Y. B is allowed.\n\nLet\'s list:\n\n- BUSHY: B U S H Y\n- GUSHY: G U S H Y\n- MUSHY: M U S H Y\n- Also, ""RUSHY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"").\n- ""PUSHY"" we tried and P is excluded.\n\nSo the main candidates are BUSHY, GUSHY, MUSHY.\n\nBut we need to check if they are valid words.\n\n- BUSHY: meaning full of bushes, like a bushy tail.\n- GUSHY: meaning effusively sentimental.\n- MUSHY: meaning soft and pulpy, or emotionally sentimental.\n\nAll are valid.\n\nNow, we have to choose one. But note that in our feedback for ""pushy"", we got U, S, H, Y all correct. That means the secret word has U in position 2, S in 3, H in 4, Y in 5. So the only position we don\'t know is the first.\n\nAnd we have three candidates: B, G, M for the first letter.\n\nWe can guess any of them, but we need to pick one.\n\nSince we have no more information, we can make a guess and see.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4. We can try one of these.\n\nTo be systematic, we can choose the most common one or one that might give more information, but in this case, since we know the last four letters are fixed, any guess will tell us if the first letter is correct or not.\n\nIf we guess one and it\'s wrong, we still have two more tries (guesses 5 and 6) to try the other two.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency or commonness.\n\n""Bushy"" is a common word, as is ""mushy"". ""Gushy"" is less common.\n\nBut we don\'t know the word list.\n\nWe could also consider if there are other possibilities? What about ""CUSHY""? But C is excluded.\n\n""JUSHY"" - not a word.\n\n""FUSHY"" - not a word.\n\n""HUSHY"" - not common, and H is already in position 4, but we can\'t have H in position 1? The word is ?USHY, so position 1 is separate. But ""hushy"" isn\'t standard.\n\n""TUSHY"" - informal, might not be in word list.\n\nSo probably the main ones are BUSHY, MUSHY, GUSHY.\n\nNow, we have to pick one. Let\'s go with ""BUSHY"" as it\'s a common word.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""pushy"", we had U, S, H, Y correct, so if we guess ""bushy"", it should be all correct if B is the first letter.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""BUSHY"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the excluded letters: B is not excluded, yes.\n\nSo, <guess>bushy</guess>\n\nBut we must be cautious: is there a chance that the word has a double letter? For example, could it be ""GUSHY"" with G, but we don\'t have any indication of double letters. In ""pushy"", we had only one S and one H, but in the secret word, since S and H are in the same positions, and we have them correct, it doesn\'t suggest double letters.\n\nMoreover, in position 1, it\'s a single letter.\n\nSo, I think it\'s safe to guess one of the candidates.\n\nAlternatively, we could think if there are other words. For example, ""WUSHU"" but that doesn\'t end with Y, and positions don\'t match.\n\nNo, the word must end with USHY.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""BUSHY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.\n- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → T, O, I, L are absent (x), and S is present but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 5 and marked `-`, it cannot be in position 5 in the secret word.\n- **Guess 3: ""pushy""** → P is absent (x), while U, S, H, and Y are correct and in the right positions (✓). This means:\n  - Position 2 must be U.\n  - Position 3 must be S.\n  - Position 4 must be H.\n  - Position 5 must be Y.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the form `_ U S H Y` (first letter unknown, followed by ""USHY"").\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P (all marked `x` in previous guesses). These cannot appear in the word.\n- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (since U, S, H, Y are already confirmed in positions 2–5).\n- **Possible words**: The only common 5-letter English words matching `_USHY` are:\n  - **BUSHY** (meaning overgrown with bushes)\n  - **MUSHY** (meaning soft or sentimental)\n  - **GUSHY** (meaning effusively sentimental)\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Since the last 4 letters are confirmed, the only unknown is position 1. We need to test one of the candidate words to identify the first letter.\n- **BUSHY** is selected as the guess because it is a common word and tests the letter B, which is a high-frequency consonant.

We are given feedback up to Guess 5:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" had all (x) → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""toils"" had T, O, I, L as (x) and S as (-) → T, O, I, L are not in the word; S is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 3: ""pushy"" had P as (x) and U, S, H, Y all (✓) → P is not in the word; U in position 2, S in position 3, H in position 4, Y in position 5. So the word is ? U S H Y.
- Guess 4: ""bushy"" had B as (x) and U, S, H, Y all (✓) → B is not in the word.
- Guess 5: ""gushy"" had G as (x) and U, S, H, Y all (✓) → G is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ U S H Y, and the first letter cannot be C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P, B, G.

The remaining possible letters for position 1 are: D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, considering common English words ending with ""USHY"", the only common options left are:
- ""MUSHY"": which is a valid word.

Other possibilities:
- ""CUSHY"": but C is excluded.
- ""RUSHY"": R excluded.
- ""PUSHY"": P excluded, and we tried it.
- ""BUSHY"": B excluded, tried.
- ""GUSHY"": G excluded, tried.

So ""MUSHY"" is the only common candidate left. We must guess this.

We have one guess left (this is guess 6), so we should guess ""MUSHY"".

Based on the cumulative feedback, the secret word pattern is firmly `_ U S H Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed as U, S, H, Y). All previous guesses have ruled out common starting letters:  
- **Excluded letters for position 1**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, I, L, P, B, G (all marked ❌ in position 1 or general absence).  
- **Remaining possible first letters**: D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

However, **""MUSHY""** is the **only common English word** fitting `_USHY` after eliminating all other candidates (""PUSHY,"" ""BUSHY,"" ""GUSHY""). Feedback confirms U, S, H, Y are correct and positioned, so ""MUSHY"" must be the solution.
