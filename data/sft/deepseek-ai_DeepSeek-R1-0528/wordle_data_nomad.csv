We are starting the game. Since there's no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that includes common letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words include vowels and frequent consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Let's choose that.
</think>
For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter English word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starter words use common letters (like vowels and frequent consonants) to cover more possibilities. I'll go with **CRANE** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- C, R, N, A, and E are among the most frequent letters in English words
- This will provide feedback on multiple high-frequency letters at once, helping narrow down the secret word efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)

This means:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked as present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"" it's the fourth letter).

So, the secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.

We know:
- A is not in position 3 (because we guessed it in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position). So A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5? But note: we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We guessed A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A is in the word but at position 1,2,4, or 5.
- Similarly, N is not in position 4 (we guessed it at 4 and it was wrong position). So N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5.

But note: we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or E.

So we must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, E (because they are absent).
- Contains A and N (because they are present) but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).

We also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we have eliminated C, R, E, we can try to use other frequent letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, P, M, etc.

We also note that the word must have A and N.

We can try to put A in a different position and N in a different position.

For example, we might try putting A at the beginning or end, and N in the middle or beginning.

But note: we don't know the positions, so we can try a word that has A and N in positions we haven't tried.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)

We also want to test other common letters.

One common strategy is to try a word that uses as many new common letters as possible, while including the known present letters (A and N).

Let me think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

For example, consider the word ""SANDY"":
- S, A, N, D, Y
- A is at position 2 (which is allowed, since we haven't tried A at 2)
- N is at position 3 (which is allowed, since we haven't tried N at 3)

But note: we don't know if S, D, Y are in the word. This is a good way to test them.

Another possibility: ""PAINT"" - but we don't know if P, I, T are in the word. Also, A is at position 2 and N at position 4? But wait, in ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A is at 2, N at 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback for N was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5. Therefore, if we use ""PAINT"", we are putting N at position 4 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not a good choice because it puts N at position 4 again, which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

So ""SANDY"" has A at 2 and N at 3, which are new positions.

Another word: ""MANGO"" - but M, A, N, G, O. A is at 2, N at 3. But we don't know about M, G, O. Also, we are testing new letters.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn't have these.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3 because we already tried that and it was wrong. So we cannot use A at 3.

In ""PLAIN"", A is at position 3? Let's see: P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5). So A is at 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

Another word: ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> N at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is not allowed (we know A is not at 3). So avoid.

We need a word that has A and N, with A not at 3 and N not at 4, and without C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words with A and N, and A in position 1,2,4,5 and N in 1,2,3,5.

For example:
- A at 1: ANTSY, ANGST, ANVIL, etc.
- A at 2: MANIA, MANLY, LANKY, etc.
- A at 4: ... like ""PLANT"" but N is at 5? In ""PLANT"": P (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, A is at 3? We don't want that. Or ""TALON"": T (1), A (2), L (3), O (4), N (5) -> A at 2, N at 5.

So ""TALON"" has A at 2 and N at 5.

But we don't know if T, L, O are in the word.

Another word: ""DAISY"" - but does it have N? No.

We must have both A and N.

Another: ""SAINT"" - S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4) -> but N is at 4? We must avoid N at 4 because we already know N is not at 4. So that's invalid.

How about ""SNAKY"": S (1), N (2), A (3), K (4), Y (5) -> A is at 3, which is invalid.

So let's try to avoid A at 3 and N at 4.

I think ""SANDY"" is a good candidate: S (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5). 
- A is at 2 (new position)
- N is at 3 (new position, and we haven't tried N at 3 before)

We are testing S, D, Y as new letters.

Another candidate: ""HANDY"": H (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5) - same positions.

But we don't know if H is common? Maybe S is more common.

Alternatively, ""LANDS"": L (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), S (5) -> same as above but with L and S.

But note: we are also trying to cover more vowels? We know E is out, so we might try I or O or U.

In ""SANDY"", we have A (vowel) and Y (sometimes vowel). But we don't have I or O.

Another word: ""ADMIN"" - A (1), D (2), M (3), I (4), N (5). 
- A at 1 (new position) and N at 5 (new position). 
- We test D, M, I.

This also avoids the forbidden positions.

But ""ADMIN"" is a valid word.

We could also consider ""NASTY"": N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). 
- N at 1 (new) and A at 2 (new). 
- We test S, T, Y.

This seems good because S, T, Y are common.

But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has two of the same letter? But in this case, all letters are distinct.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N at 4.

How about ""POINT""? But it doesn't have A. We must include A and N.

So we must have both.

I think ""NASTY"" is a strong candidate because:
- It uses common letters: N, A, S, T, Y.
- It places A and N in positions we haven't tried (N at 1, A at 2, and we haven't tried these positions for these letters).
- It avoids C, R, E.

Similarly, ""SANDY"" is good but uses D and Y, which are less common than S and T? Actually, S and T are very common.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N at position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in a position we haven't tried and N in a position we haven't tried, and also test other vowels? We know the word has A, but we don't know about other vowels. Since E is out, we might test I or O or U.

In ""NASTY"", we have A and Y (which can be a vowel) but no I or O.

Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is out, and we don't have A? No.

""OASIS"" -> no N.

""MAINS"" -> M (1), A (2), I (3), N (4) -> but N at 4 is invalid.

""ALIGN"": A (1), L (2), I (3), G (4), N (5) -> A at 1, N at 5. This is good. We test L, I, G.

But G is less common? And we have I (vowel).

""ALIEN"" -> but E is out, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So ""ALIGN"" is a possibility.

But let's compare:

- ""NASTY"": tests N, A, S, T, Y (with N at 1, A at 2)
- ""ALIGN"": tests A, L, I, G, N (with A at 1, N at 5)

We already know that the word has A and N, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on these. The goal is to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""NASTY"", we test S, T, Y (and we already know A and N are present, so we expect at least two correct marks, but we don't know which ones).

In ""ALIGN"", we test L, I, G.

Which set of letters is more common? S and T are more common than L, I, G? Actually, S and T are very common.

Moreover, we have already eliminated C, R, E, so the remaining common consonants are S, T, L, N (we know N is in), P, M, etc.

I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice because S and T are extremely common.

We could also consider ""STAIN"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) -> but A is at 3, which is the same as our first guess and we know it's not there. So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

So the next guess is ""NASTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains **A** and **N**, but **not** in positions 3 or 4 (since ""crane"" had A at position 3 and N at position 4, both marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters **C, R, and E are absent** from the secret word and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for **A** are 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- Possible positions for **N** are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4).

For the second guess, I chose **NASTY** because:
- It includes **A** (position 2) and **N** (position 1), testing new positions for both letters.
- It introduces three new common letters: **S, T, and Y** (all high-frequency consonants/vowels), maximizing information gain.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, E) and forbidden positions for A and N.
- If the secret word has S, T, or Y, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities quickly. If not, we still confirm the presence/absence of these letters.

<guess>nasty</guess>",nasty,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)

This means:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked as present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"" it's the fourth letter).

So, the secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.

We know:
- A is not in position 3 (because we guessed it in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position). So A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5? But note: we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We guessed A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A is in the word but at position 1,2,4, or 5.
- Similarly, N is not in position 4 (we guessed it at 4 and it was wrong position). So N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5.

But note: we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or E.

So we must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, E (because they are absent).
- Contains A and N (because they are present) but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).

We also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we have eliminated C, R, E, we can try to use other frequent letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, P, M, etc.

We also note that the word must have A and N.

We can try to put A in a different position and N in a different position.

For example, we might try putting A at the beginning or end, and N in the middle or beginning.

But note: we don't know the positions, so we can try a word that has A and N in positions we haven't tried.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)

We also want to test other common letters.

One common strategy is to try a word that uses as many new common letters as possible, while including the known present letters (A and N).

Let me think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

For example, consider the word ""SANDY"":
- S, A, N, D, Y
- A is at position 2 (which is allowed, since we haven't tried A at 2)
- N is at position 3 (which is allowed, since we haven't tried N at 3)

But note: we don't know if S, D, Y are in the word. This is a good way to test them.

Another possibility: ""PAINT"" - but we don't know if P, I, T are in the word. Also, A is at position 2 and N at position 4? But wait, in ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A is at 2, N at 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback for N was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5. Therefore, if we use ""PAINT"", we are putting N at position 4 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not a good choice because it puts N at position 4 again, which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

So ""SANDY"" has A at 2 and N at 3, which are new positions.

Another word: ""MANGO"" - but M, A, N, G, O. A is at 2, N at 3. But we don't know about M, G, O. Also, we are testing new letters.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn't have these.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3 because we already tried that and it was wrong. So we cannot use A at 3.

In ""PLAIN"", A is at position 3? Let's see: P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5). So A is at 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

Another word: ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> N at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is not allowed (we know A is not at 3). So avoid.

We need a word that has A and N, with A not at 3 and N not at 4, and without C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words with A and N, and A in position 1,2,4,5 and N in 1,2,3,5.

For example:
- A at 1: ANTSY, ANGST, ANVIL, etc.
- A at 2: MANIA, MANLY, LANKY, etc.
- A at 4: ... like ""PLANT"" but N is at 5? In ""PLANT"": P (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, A is at 3? We don't want that. Or ""TALON"": T (1), A (2), L (3), O (4), N (5) -> A at 2, N at 5.

So ""TALON"" has A at 2 and N at 5.

But we don't know if T, L, O are in the word.

Another word: ""DAISY"" - but does it have N? No.

We must have both A and N.

Another: ""SAINT"" - S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4) -> but N is at 4? We must avoid N at 4 because we already know N is not at 4. So that's invalid.

How about ""SNAKY"": S (1), N (2), A (3), K (4), Y (5) -> A is at 3, which is invalid.

So let's try to avoid A at 3 and N at 4.

I think ""SANDY"" is a good candidate: S (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5). 
- A is at 2 (new position)
- N is at 3 (new position, and we haven't tried N at 3 before)

We are testing S, D, Y as new letters.

Another candidate: ""HANDY"": H (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5) - same positions.

But we don't know if H is common? Maybe S is more common.

Alternatively, ""LANDS"": L (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), S (5) -> same as above but with L and S.

But note: we are also trying to cover more vowels? We know E is out, so we might try I or O or U.

In ""SANDY"", we have A (vowel) and Y (sometimes vowel). But we don't have I or O.

Another word: ""ADMIN"" - A (1), D (2), M (3), I (4), N (5). 
- A at 1 (new position) and N at 5 (new position). 
- We test D, M, I.

This also avoids the forbidden positions.

But ""ADMIN"" is a valid word.

We could also consider ""NASTY"": N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). 
- N at 1 (new) and A at 2 (new). 
- We test S, T, Y.

This seems good because S, T, Y are common.

But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has two of the same letter? But in this case, all letters are distinct.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N at 4.

How about ""POINT""? But it doesn't have A. We must include A and N.

So we must have both.

I think ""NASTY"" is a strong candidate because:
- It uses common letters: N, A, S, T, Y.
- It places A and N in positions we haven't tried (N at 1, A at 2, and we haven't tried these positions for these letters).
- It avoids C, R, E.

Similarly, ""SANDY"" is good but uses D and Y, which are less common than S and T? Actually, S and T are very common.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N at position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in a position we haven't tried and N in a position we haven't tried, and also test other vowels? We know the word has A, but we don't know about other vowels. Since E is out, we might test I or O or U.

""OASIS"" -> no N.

""MAINS"" -> M (1), A (2), I (3), N (4) -> but N at 4 is invalid.

""ALIGN"": A (1), L (2), I (3), G (4), N (5) -> A at 1, N at 5. This is good. We test L, I, G.

But G is less common? And we have I (vowel).

""ALIEN"" -> but E is out, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So ""ALIGN"" is a possibility.

But let's compare:

- ""NASTY"": tests N, A, S, T, Y (with N at 1, A at 2)
- ""ALIGN"": tests A, L, I, G, N (with A at 1, N at 5)

We already know that the word has A and N, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on these. The goal is to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""NASTY"", we test S, T, Y (and we already know A and N are present, so we expect at least two correct marks, but we don't know which ones).

Which set of letters is more common? S and T are more common than L, I, G? Actually, S and T are very common.

Moreover, we have already eliminated C, R, E, so the remaining common consonants are S, T, L, N (we know N is in), P, M, etc.

I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice because S and T are extremely common.

We could also consider ""STAIN"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) -> but A is at 3, which is the same as our first guess and we know it's not there. So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

So the next guess is ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains **A** and **N**, but **not** in positions 3 or 4 (since ""crane"" had A at position 3 and N at position 4, both marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters **C, R, and E are absent** from the secret word and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for **A** are 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- Possible positions for **N** are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4).

For the second guess, I chose **NASTY** because:
- It includes **A** (position 2) and **N** (position 1), testing new positions for both letters.
- It introduces three new common letters: **S, T, and Y** (all high-frequency consonants/vowels), maximizing information gain.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, E) and forbidden positions for A and N.
- If the secret word has S, T, or Y, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities quickly. If not, we still confirm the presence/absence of these letters.",Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since there's no prior feedback, we need to choose a word that includes common letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words include vowels and frequent consonants. ""CRANE"" is a good starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Let's choose that.For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter English word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starter words use common letters (like vowels and frequent consonants) to cover more possibilities. I'll go with **CRANE** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- C, R, N, A, and E are among the most frequent letters in English words
- This will provide feedback on multiple high-frequency letters at once, helping narrow down the secret word efficiently.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)

This means:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked as present but wrong position).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"" it's the fourth letter).

So, the secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.

We know:
- A is not in position 3 (because we guessed it in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position). So A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5? But note: we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We guessed A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A is in the word but at position 1,2,4, or 5.
- Similarly, N is not in position 4 (we guessed it at 4 and it was wrong position). So N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5.

But note: we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or E.

So we must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, E (because they are absent).
- Contains A and N (because they are present) but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).

We also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we have eliminated C, R, E, we can try to use other frequent letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, P, M, etc.

We also note that the word must have A and N.

We can try to put A in a different position and N in a different position.

For example, we might try putting A at the beginning or end, and N in the middle or beginning.

But note: we don't know the positions, so we can try a word that has A and N in positions we haven't tried.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)

We also want to test other common letters.

One common strategy is to try a word that uses as many new common letters as possible, while including the known present letters (A and N).

Let me think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

For example, consider the word ""SANDY"":
- S, A, N, D, Y
- A is at position 2 (which is allowed, since we haven't tried A at 2)
- N is at position 3 (which is allowed, since we haven't tried N at 3)

But note: we don't know if S, D, Y are in the word. This is a good way to test them.

Another possibility: ""PAINT"" - but we don't know if P, I, T are in the word. Also, A is at position 2 and N at position 4? But wait, in ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> A is at 2, N at 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback for N was that it is in the word but not at position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5. Therefore, if we use ""PAINT"", we are putting N at position 4 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not a good choice because it puts N at position 4 again, which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

So ""SANDY"" has A at 2 and N at 3, which are new positions.

Another word: ""MANGO"" - but M, A, N, G, O. A is at 2, N at 3. But we don't know about M, G, O. Also, we are testing new letters.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn't have these.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3 because we already tried that and it was wrong. So we cannot use A at 3.

In ""PLAIN"", A is at position 3? Let's see: P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5). So A is at 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

Another word: ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> N at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is not allowed (we know A is not at 3). So avoid.

We need a word that has A and N, with A not at 3 and N not at 4, and without C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words with A and N, and A in position 1,2,4,5 and N in 1,2,3,5.

For example:
- A at 1: ANTSY, ANGST, ANVIL, etc.
- A at 2: MANIA, MANLY, LANKY, etc.
- A at 4: ... like ""PLANT"" but N is at 5? In ""PLANT"": P (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, A is at 3? We don't want that. Or ""TALON"": T (1), A (2), L (3), O (4), N (5) -> A at 2, N at 5.

So ""TALON"" has A at 2 and N at 5.

But we don't know if T, L, O are in the word.

Another word: ""DAISY"" - but does it have N? No.

We must have both A and N.

Another: ""SAINT"" - S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4) -> but N is at 4? We must avoid N at 4 because we already know N is not at 4. So that's invalid.

How about ""SNAKY"": S (1), N (2), A (3), K (4), Y (5) -> A is at 3, which is invalid.

So let's try to avoid A at 3 and N at 4.

I think ""SANDY"" is a good candidate: S (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5). 
- A is at 2 (new position)
- N is at 3 (new position, and we haven't tried N at 3 before)

We are testing S, D, Y as new letters.

Another candidate: ""HANDY"": H (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5) - same positions.

But we don't know if H is common? Maybe S is more common.

Alternatively, ""LANDS"": L (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), S (5) -> same as above but with L and S.

But note: we are also trying to cover more vowels? We know E is out, so we might try I or O or U.

In ""SANDY"", we have A (vowel) and Y (sometimes vowel). But we don't have I or O.

Another word: ""ADMIN"" - A (1), D (2), M (3), I (4), N (5). 
- A at 1 (new position) and N at 5 (new position). 
- We test D, M, I.

This also avoids the forbidden positions.

But ""ADMIN"" is a valid word.

We could also consider ""NASTY"": N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). 
- N at 1 (new) and A at 2 (new). 
- We test S, T, Y.

This seems good because S, T, Y are common.

But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has two of the same letter? But in this case, all letters are distinct.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N at 4.

How about ""POINT""? But it doesn't have A. We must include A and N.

So we must have both.

I think ""NASTY"" is a strong candidate because:
- It uses common letters: N, A, S, T, Y.
- It places A and N in positions we haven't tried (N at 1, A at 2, and we haven't tried these positions for these letters).
- It avoids C, R, E.

Similarly, ""SANDY"" is good but uses D and Y, which are less common than S and T? Actually, S and T are very common.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N at position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in a position we haven't tried and N in a position we haven't tried, and also test other vowels? We know the word has A, but we don't know about other vowels. Since E is out, we might test I or O or U.

In ""NASTY"", we have A and Y (which can be a vowel) but no I or O.

Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is out, and we don't have A? No.

""OASIS"" -> no N.

""MAINS"" -> M (1), A (2), I (3), N (4) -> but N at 4 is invalid.

""ALIGN"": A (1), L (2), I (3), G (4), N (5) -> A at 1, N at 5. This is good. We test L, I, G.

But G is less common? And we have I (vowel).

""ALIEN"" -> but E is out, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So ""ALIGN"" is a possibility.

But let's compare:

- ""NASTY"": tests N, A, S, T, Y (with N at 1, A at 2)
- ""ALIGN"": tests A, L, I, G, N (with A at 1, N at 5)

We already know that the word has A and N, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on these. The goal is to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""NASTY"", we test S, T, Y (and we already know A and N are present, so we expect at least two correct marks, but we don't know which ones).

In ""ALIGN"", we test L, I, G.

Which set of letters is more common? S and T are more common than L, I, G? Actually, S and T are very common.

Moreover, we have already eliminated C, R, E, so the remaining common consonants are S, T, L, N (we know N is in), P, M, etc.

I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice because S and T are extremely common.

We could also consider ""STAIN"": S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) -> but A is at 3, which is the same as our first guess and we know it's not there. So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

So the next guess is ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains **A** and **N**, but **not** in positions 3 or 4 (since ""crane"" had A at position 3 and N at position 4, both marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters **C, R, and E are absent** from the secret word and should be avoided.
- Possible positions for **A** are 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- Possible positions for **N** are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4).

For the second guess, I chose **NASTY** because:
- It includes **A** (position 2) and **N** (position 1), testing new positions for both letters.
- It introduces three new common letters: **S, T, and Y** (all high-frequency consonants/vowels), maximizing information gain.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, E) and forbidden positions for A and N.
- If the secret word has S, T, or Y, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities quickly. If not, we still confirm the presence/absence of these letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.

Second guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(✓) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
Interpretation:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with N.
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (since we get '-', meaning wrong position).
- S, T, Y are not in the word at all.

Now, combining information:

Definite facts:
- The word starts with N.
- The word contains A, but not at position 1 (since position 1 is N), nor at position 2 (from ""nasty""), nor at position 3 (from ""crane""). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.
- The word also contains N, but since we already have N at position 1, and feedback from ""crane"" showed N is present but not at position 4, we need to note that there might be another N? However, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and marked present but wrong position, meaning there is at least one N that is not at position 4. But in ""nasty"", N at position 1 is correct, so that is one N. The ""crane"" feedback might refer to the same N or a different one? Since in ""nasty"" we have N at position 1 marked correct, and in ""crane"" we had N at position 4 marked as present but wrong position, this could imply that the word has two N's? But let me check.

Actually, the feedback about N in ""crane"" could be because of the N at position 1 (which we haven't revealed yet), and since position 4 was wrong, that doesn't conflict. But note: if the word has only one N, and it's at position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"" with N at position 4, it should have been marked absent because the N is at position 1. But it was marked present (-), meaning there is an N, but not at that position. So there could be only one N, but we have not yet placed it correctly until ""nasty"". Therefore, we now know N is at position 1 and no duplicate N is necessary.

So in summary:
- Position 1: N (fixed)
- A is at either position 4 or 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are impossible for A).
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, S, T, Y. Also, from ""crane"", we had A(x) for position 3? No, we had A(-) meaning present but wrong position.

Additionally, we know from ""crane"" that N was present but not at position 4, but now we have N at 1, so that condition is satisfied.

Now, we need to include A in the word at position 4 or 5, and we must choose letters that are not C, R, E, S, T, Y.

We also need to fill positions 2 and 3, and either 4 or 5 (since A takes one, the other is free).

Positions:
1: N
2: unknown, but not any excluded letter, and not A (since position 2 is not A as per ""nasty"" feedback)
3: unknown, same constraints
4: either A or a new letter
5: either A or a new letter

But note: A is exactly in one of positions 4 or 5.

We want to test common letters. We have eliminated many consonants: C, R, S, T, and vowels E, Y (Y might be vowel). Remaining common vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants: L, P, D, M, B, G, etc.

We should try to test for other vowels.

But also, we know A is in the word, at 4 or 5.

Since we have limited tries (4 left? We've used 2), we want to maximize information.

We might also consider words that help distinguish between A at position 4 vs 5.

But first, let me note the excluded letters: C, E, R, S, T, Y. So we must avoid these.

Now, consider position 2 and 3: we need to choose letters not in the excluded set.

Let me try to think of possible words that start with N, have A at 4 or 5, and avoid forbidden letters.

First, if A is at position 4: word pattern: N _ _ A ?
We need a letter for position 2,3,5.

Similarly, if A at 5: N _ _ ? A

We also know from ""crane"" that A was present but not at 3, and in ""nasty"" A was present but not at 2. But we don't have information about the other letters in the word.

Moreover, we don't know what else is missing.

Common words with N at start and A at end: NA? If A at position 5: words like NADIA? But that's 5 letters? NADIA: N-A-D-I-A -> but then A appears twice? However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules didn't say, so we assume possible.

But in feedback, if there are multiple same letters, it might be tricky. But let's avoid duplicates for simplicity unless necessary.

Another possibility: if A at 4: e.g., NOVA? but NOVA is 4 letters.

5-letter words: NA? Let me list some.

Possibly:
- A at 4: e.g., NOMAD, NOVA but that's 5? NOMAD: N-O-M-A-D -> positions:1:N,2:O,3:M,4:A,5:D -> so A at 4.
- A at 5: e.g., NYALA? But Y is excluded. Or ""NINJA"": N-I-N-J-A -> positions:1:N,2:I,3:N,4:J,5:A. But N is repeated? And S is excluded, so not.

""NINJA"" has duplicate N? We don't know if N can be duplicated. But position 1: we have fixed N, so if we put N at position 3, should be acceptable? But let's see.

But we must avoid S,T,Y, etc.

Another word: ""NADIR"" but R is excluded.

""LABAN"" but doesn't start with N.

Potential words with N at start and A at end (position 5): 
- N (1), * (2), * (3), * (4), A (5): For example, ""NEVER"" but E is excluded, and it doesn't end with A? Actually ""never"" ends with R? Not A.

More examples: ""NUBIA"", ""NUTTY"" but T excluded, ""NAVAL"" but A at position 4? NAVAL: N-A-V-A-L -> A at position 2 and 4? But we know position 2 cannot be A, so not.

Similarly, ""NOPAL"": N-O-P-A-L -> A at 4.

But we don't know.

We can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

For instance, pick a word that has A at position 5, and uses common vowels at positions 2 and 3.

For example, choose a word like ""NOISE"" but E and S excluded? That's no.

""MAIZE"" ... but doesn't start with N.

So: N, then positions 2,3, and either 4 or 5 must be filled.

But if A is at 5, then positions 2,3,4 need to be filled.

Similarly, if A is at 4, positions 2,3,5 need to be filled.

Also, note that in the feedback from ""crane"", we had N marked wrong position at 4, which is consistent with N at 1.

Now, let me think of common letters we haven't tested: we have tried A, N, S, T, Y, E, C, R.

So remaining vowels: I, O, U
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We can test I and O, for example.

Also, L, P, D, M are common.

So I can choose a word like ""NOPAL"" or ""NIGHT"" ... but ""NIGHT"" has G,H,T -> T is excluded? T is in excluded list? From ""nasty"" feedback, T is absent.

Excluded: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

So T is no. Also Y is gone.

So ""NOPE"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""NOBLE"": N-O-B-L-E -> but E excluded? Yes, E is absent.

""NIXED"" but E? Excluded.

""DOING"" doesn't start with N.

We need N at start.

So perhaps: ""NAVVY"" but V repeats? And excluded letters? A is in, but we know A position issue.

But let's think differently.

Idea: choose a word that has A in position 5, and uses I and O at another positions to test.

For example: ""NOMAD"" has A at position 4: N(1)O(2)M(3)A(4)D(5) -> but we don't know if A is at position 4 or 5? And D.

Another: ""NUKED"" but E excluded.

""NIPAS"" not a common word? Or ""NIVAL"" but L and V? Or ""NINJA"" as before?

Let's consider ""NINJA"": N-I-N-J-A
- Position 1: N (already correct)
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N? That would be a duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are possible? But we can try.

But in feedback, since we have N at position 1 correct, a duplicate N at position 3, and A at 5? But the word ""NINJA"": if secret has only one N? Then we might get conflict? But we don't know.

Perhaps avoid duplicates for now.

Alternative: ""NOWAY"" but W and A? And Y excluded? W is allowed? Y is excluded.

""NOWAY"" has Y? At the end? But Y is out.

Another possibility: ""NOVEL"" has E and L? But E excluded.

Words with N, A in the ending, and avoiding E,S,T,Y,C,R.

Let me list possible words:
- With A at 4: 
  - NOMAD: N-O-M-A-D
  - NOVA not 5 letters
  - DOGNA not a word
  - HAVEN not start N, and has E? 
  - Valid: N (1) _ (2) _ (3) A (4) _ (5)
  Options: LAPIN? Not start with N? 
  PINTA? Not N start.
  So: ""NOXAL""? Not common.
  But ""NODAL"": N-O-D-A-L -> A at 4? In ""NODAL"": positions: N(1), O(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)

- With A at 5:
  - NUBIA: N-U-B-I-A
  - NUMDA not a word
  - NEVUS not common
  - ""MANGA"" not start N

But ""NAVAL"" has A at 2 and 4, but position 2 we know not A? So invalid.

""NAIAD"": N-A-I-A-D -> A at 2 and 4? Again, position 2 cannot be A.

So words without A at 2 or 3.

So for A at 5: we must have positions 2,3,4 not A.

e.g., ""NUBIA"": N-U-B-I-A
A at 5.

Similarly, ""NORIA"": N-O-R-I-A -> but R excluded? R is in excluded list? Yes, from first guess: R(x), so absent.

R is out.

""NOHOW"" not ends with A.

""NOSMO""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""NUCHA"": but not common? N-U-C-H-A -> C is excluded.

So common words: 
- A at 4: NOMAD, NOPAL (if we use), or NEVEL not?
Other: ""NADIR"" R excluded, ""NASAL"" has S and A at 2? But S excluded and position 2 A invalid.

It's challenging.

Another word: ""NYCIN""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""LEMNA"" not start with N.

I think some valid words:
- NOMAD: N, O, M, A, D -> A at 4
- NUBIA: N, U, B, I, A -> A at 5 (but U, B, I)
+ ""NOVAE"": but E? Excluded.
+ ""NAPED"": E excluded.

We might need to consider less common words.

Perhaps ""KOPAN"" not start with N? 

Let me check: ""NGANA""? Not English.

Or ""QAJAQ""? Not standard.

Acceptable common words: maybe ""NATAL"", but T and A at 2? T excluded and A at 2 invalid.

""NITON"" not ends with A.

I should look for words that end with IA or something.

""INDIA"" not start with N.

""NORIA"" but R excluded.

""MEDIA"" not start with N.

We have to work with what we have.

Given that, I think ""NOMAD"" is a reasonable choice: N-O-M-A-D
- Positions: 1:N (correct), 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:D
- We are testing O, M, D, and the position of A (at 4).
- Since A must be at 4 or 5, by place it at 4, we can learn something.
- Also, O is a vowel, M and D are common consonants.

If feedback shows A at position 4 is correct or not, we'll know.

Feedback on O and M will tell if they are in the word or not.

Another option: ""NOPAL"" (a cactus): N-O-P-A-L -> similarly, O, P, L tested, A at 4.

Similarly, ""NUBIA"": N-U-B-I-A -> tests U, B, I, A at 5.

But ""NOMAD"" might be more common.

I choose ""NOMAD"". But let's confirm letters: N, O, M, A, D. None are in the excluded list? Excluded: C, R, E, S, T, Y. So O, M, D are new.

Also, we avoided A at position 2 and 3.

In ""nomad"", A is at position 4.

Let's see what we learn:
- If A is at position 4, then we get A(✓) 
- But we think A might be at 5? If we guess A at 4 and it is actually at position 5, then we would get A(-) for position 4.

Similarly, if we guess ""nubia"" with A at 5, but actually A at 4, we might get A(-) or something.

But either way, we get information.

I think ""NOMAD"" is fine.

But note: we have to use valid English words. ""NOMAD"" is valid.

So my guess is ""NOMAD"".Summary of known information:
- Secret word starts with `N` (position 1 is `N`).
- `A` is present, but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 → **must be at position 4 or 5**.
- Banned letters: `C`, `R`, `E`, `S`, `T`, `Y` (absent per feedback).
- Goal: Test position of `A` and uncover new letters.

For Guess 3, I selected **NOMAD** because:
- It places `A` at position 4 (allowing us to confirm/reject if `A` is at position 4).
- Tests new common consonants: `M`, `D`.
- Tests vowel `O` (position 2).
- Avoids banned letters (`C,R,E,S,T,Y`).
- If the secret word has `A` at position 5 (not 4), feedback will show `A` as `-`. If `A` is at position 4, feedback will show `✓`.

This maximizes information while respecting constraints.

<guess>nomad</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Guess 3:
1. **Review Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - `C`, `R`, `E` → absent (`x`), so **exclude these letters**.
   - `A` → present but wrong position (`-`), and since `A` was guessed in position 3, it **cannot be at position 3** in the secret word.
   - `N` → present but wrong position (`-`), and since `N` was guessed in position 4, it **cannot be at position 4**.

2. **Review Feedback from Guess 2 (""nasty"")**:
   - `N` → correct position (`✓`), confirming **position 1 is `N`**.
   - `A` → present but wrong position (`-`), and since `A` was guessed in position 2, it **cannot be at position 2**.
   - `S`, `T`, `Y` → absent (`x`), so **exclude these letters**.

3. **Synthesize Key Constraints**:
   - **Position 1**: Must be `N` (fixed from feedback).
   - **`A` positioning**: 
     - Cannot be at position 1 (occupied by `N`), 2 (per ""nasty""), or 3 (per ""crane"").
     - Therefore, `A` **must be at position 4 or 5**.
   - **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `E`, `S`, `T`, `Y` (banned from future guesses).
   - **Untested common letters**: Prioritize vowels (`I`, `O`, `U`) and common consonants (`L`, `D`, `M`, `P`, `B`, etc.) to maximize information gain.

4. **Choose Guess Word**:
   - Goal: Test `A`'s position (4 vs. 5) while probing new letters.
   - Guessed **""nomad""** because:
     - Starts with `N` (position 1 correct).
     - Places `A` at position 4 → if `A` is truly at position 4, feedback will show `✓`; if `A` is at position 5, feedback will show `-` (wrong position).
     - Introduces three new letters:
       - `O` (position 2): Tests a common vowel.
       - `M` (position 3): Tests a common consonant.
       - `D` (position 5): Tests another common consonant.
     - Avoids all excluded letters (`C,R,E,S,T,Y`).
   - Alternative options considered:
     - ""nubia"" (tests `U`, `B`, `I`, with `A` at position 5), but `U` and `B` are less common than `O`/`M`/`D`.
     - ""nopal"" (similar to ""nomad"" but tests `P` and `L` instead of `M` and `D`), but `M` and `D` are slightly higher frequency in English.

<guess>nomad</guess>",nomad,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.

Second guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(✓) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
Interpretation:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with N.
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (since we get '-', meaning wrong position).
- S, T, Y are not in the word at all.

Now, combining information:

Definite facts:
- The word starts with N.
- The word contains A, but not at position 1 (since position 1 is N), nor at position 2 (from ""nasty""), nor at position 3 (from ""crane""). Therefore, A must be at position 4 or 5.
- The word also contains N, but since we already have N at position 1, and feedback from ""crane"" showed N is present but not at position 4, we need to note that there might be another N? However, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and marked present but wrong position, meaning there is at least one N that is not at position 4. But in ""nasty"", N at position 1 is correct, so that is one N. The ""crane"" feedback might refer to the same N or a different one? Since in ""nasty"" we have N at position 1 marked correct, and in ""crane"" we had N at position 4 marked as present but wrong position, this could imply that the word has two N's? But let me check.

Actually, the feedback about N in ""crane"" could be because of the N at position 1 (which we haven't revealed yet), and since position 4 was wrong, that doesn't conflict. But note: if the word has only one N, and it's at position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"" with N at position 4, it should have been marked absent because the N is at position 1. But it was marked present (-), meaning there is an N, but not at that position. So there could be only one N, but we have not yet placed it correctly until ""nasty"". Therefore, we now know N is at position 1 and no duplicate N is necessary.

So in summary:
- Position 1: N (fixed)
- A is at either position 4 or 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are impossible for A).
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, S, T, Y. Also, from ""crane"", we had A(x) for position 3? No, we had A(-) meaning present but wrong position.

Additionally, we know from ""crane"" that N was present but not at position 4, but now we have N at 1, so that condition is satisfied.

Now, we need to include A in the word at position 4 or 5, and we must choose letters that are not C, R, E, S, T, Y.

We also need to fill positions 2 and 3, and either 4 or 5 (since A takes one, the other is free).

Positions:
1: N
2: unknown, but not any excluded letter, and not A (since position 2 is not A as per ""nasty"" feedback)
3: unknown, same constraints
4: either A or a new letter
5: either A or a new letter

But note: A is exactly in one of positions 4 or 5.

We want to test common letters. We have eliminated many consonants: C, R, S, T, and vowels E, Y (Y might be vowel). Remaining common vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants: L, P, D, M, B, G, etc.

We should try to test for other vowels.

But also, we know A is in the word, at 4 or 5.

Since we have limited tries (4 left? We've used 2), we want to maximize information.

We might also consider words that help distinguish between A at position 4 vs 5.

But first, let me note the excluded letters: C, E, R, S, T, Y. So we must avoid these.

Now, consider position 2 and 3: we need to choose letters not in the excluded set.

Let me try to think of possible words that start with N, have A at 4 or 5, and avoid forbidden letters.

First, if A is at position 4: word pattern: N _ _ A ?
We need a letter for position 2,3,5.

Similarly, if A at 5: N _ _ ? A

We also know from ""crane"" that A was present but not at 3, and in ""nasty"" A was present but not at 2. But we don't have information about the other letters in the word.

Moreover, we don't know what else is missing.

Common words with N at start and A at end: NA? If A at position 5: words like NADIA? But that's 5 letters? NADIA: N-A-D-I-A -> but then A appears twice? However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules didn't say, so we assume possible.

But in feedback, if there are multiple same letters, it might be tricky. But let's avoid duplicates for simplicity unless necessary.

Another possibility: if A at 4: e.g., NOVA? but NOVA is 4 letters.

5-letter words: NA? Let me list some.

Possibly:
- A at 4: e.g., NOMAD, NOVA but that's 5? NOMAD: N-O-M-A-D -> positions:1:N,2:O,3:M,4:A,5:D -> so A at 4.
- A at 5: e.g., NYALA? But Y is excluded. Or ""NINJA"": N-I-N-J-A -> positions:1:N,2:I,3:N,4:J,5:A. But N is repeated? And S is excluded, so not.

""NINJA"" has duplicate N? We don't know if N can be duplicated. But position 1: we have fixed N, so if we put N at position 3, should be acceptable? But let's see.

But we must avoid S,T,Y, etc.

Another word: ""NADIR"" but R is excluded.

""LABAN"" but doesn't start with N.

Potential words with N at start and A at end (position 5): 
- N (1), * (2), * (3), * (4), A (5): For example, ""NEVER"" but E is excluded, and it doesn't end with A? Actually ""never"" ends with R? Not A.

More examples: ""NUBIA"", ""NUTTY"" but T excluded, ""NAVAL"" but A at position 4? NAVAL: N-A-V-A-L -> A at position 2 and 4? But we know position 2 cannot be A, so not.

Similarly, ""NOPAL"": N-O-P-A-L -> A at 4.

But we don't know.

We can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

For instance, pick a word that has A at position 5, and uses common vowels at positions 2 and 3.

For example, choose a word like ""NOISE"" but E and S excluded? That's no.

""MAIZE"" ... but doesn't start with N.

So: N, then positions 2,3, and either 4 or 5 must be filled.

But if A is at 5, then positions 2,3,4 need to be filled.

Similarly, if A is at 4, positions 2,3,5 need to be filled.

Also, note that in the feedback from ""crane"", we had N marked wrong position at 4, which is consistent with N at 1.

Now, let me think of common letters we haven't tested: we have tried A, N, S, T, Y, E, C, R.

So remaining vowels: I, O, U
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We can test I and O, for example.

Also, L, P, D, M are common.

So I can choose a word like ""NOPAL"" or ""NIGHT"" ... but ""NIGHT"" has G,H,T -> T is excluded? T is in excluded list? From ""nasty"" feedback, T is absent.

Excluded: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

So T is no. Also Y is gone.

So ""NOPE"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""NOBLE"": N-O-B-L-E -> but E excluded? Yes, E is absent.

""NIXED"" but E? Excluded.

""DOING"" doesn't start with N.

We need N at start.

So perhaps: ""NAVVY"" but V repeats? And excluded letters? A is in, but we know A position issue.

But let's think differently.

Idea: choose a word that has A in position 5, and uses I and O at another positions to test.

For example: ""NOMAD"" has A at position 4: N(1)O(2)M(3)A(4)D(5) -> but we don't know if A is at position 4 or 5? And D.

Another: ""NUKED"" but E excluded.

""NIPAS"" not a common word? Or ""NIVAL"" but L and V? Or ""NINJA"" as before?

Let's consider ""NINJA"": N-I-N-J-A
- Position 1: N (already correct)
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N? That would be a duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are possible? But we can try.

But in feedback, since we have N at position 1 correct, a duplicate N at position 3, and A at 5? But the word ""NINJA"": if secret has only one N? Then we might get conflict? But we don't know.

Perhaps avoid duplicates for now.

Alternative: ""NOWAY"" but W and A? And Y excluded? W is allowed? Y is excluded.

""NOWAY"" has Y? At the end? But Y is out.

Another possibility: ""NOVEL"" has E and L? But E excluded.

Words with N, A in the ending, and avoiding E,S,T,Y,C,R.

Let me list possible words:
- With A at 4: 
  - NOMAD: N-O-M-A-D
  - NOVA not 5 letters
  - DOGNA not a word
  - HAVEN not start N, and has E? 
  - Valid: N (1) _ (2) _ (3) A (4) _ (5)
  Options: LAPIN? Not start with N? 
  PINTA? Not N start.
  So: ""NOXAL""? Not common.
  But ""NODAL"": N-O-D-A-L -> A at 4? In ""NODAL"": positions: N(1), O(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)

- With A at 5:
  - NUBIA: N-U-B-I-A
  - NUMDA not a word
  - NEVUS not common
  - ""MANGA"" not start N

But ""NAVAL"" has A at 2 and 4, but position 2 we know not A? So invalid.

""NAIAD"": N-A-I-A-D -> A at 2 and 4? Again, position 2 cannot be A.

So words without A at 2 or 3.

So for A at 5: we must have positions 2,3,4 not A.

e.g., ""NUBIA"": N-U-B-I-A
A at 5.

Similarly, ""NORIA"": N-O-R-I-A -> but R excluded? R is in excluded list? Yes, from first guess: R(x), so absent.

R is out.

""NOHOW"" not ends with A.

""NOSMO""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""NUCHA"": but not common? N-U-C-H-A -> C is excluded.

So common words: 
- A at 4: NOMAD, NOPAL (if we use), or NEVEL not?
Other: ""NADIR"" R excluded, ""NASAL"" has S and A at 2? But S excluded and position 2 A invalid.

It's challenging.

Another word: ""NYCIN""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""LEMNA"" not start with N.

I think some valid words:
- NOMAD: N, O, M, A, D -> A at 4
- NUBIA: N, U, B, I, A -> A at 5 (but U, B, I)
+ ""NOVAE"": but E? Excluded.
+ ""NAPED"": E excluded.

We might need to consider less common words.

Perhaps ""KOPAN"" not start with N? 

Let me check: ""NGANA""? Not English.

Or ""QAJAQ""? Not standard.

Acceptable common words: maybe ""NATAL"", but T and A at 2? T excluded and A at 2 invalid.

""NITON"" not ends with A.

I should look for words that end with IA or something.

""INDIA"" not start with N.

""NORIA"" but R excluded.

""MEDIA"" not start with N.

We have to work with what we have.

Given that, I think ""NOMAD"" is a reasonable choice: N-O-M-A-D
- Positions: 1:N (correct), 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:D
- We are testing O, M, D, and the position of A (at 4).
- Since A must be at 4 or 5, by place it at 4, we can learn something.
- Also, O is a vowel, M and D are common consonants.

If feedback shows A at position 4 is correct or not, we'll know.

Feedback on O and M will tell if they are in the word or not.

Another option: ""NOPAL"" (a cactus): N-O-P-A-L -> similarly, O, P, L tested, A at 4.

Similarly, ""NUBIA"": N-U-B-I-A -> tests U, B, I, A at 5.

But ""NOMAD"" might be more common.

I choose ""NOMAD"". But let's confirm letters: N, O, M, A, D. None are in the excluded list? Excluded: C, R, E, S, T, Y. So O, M, D are new.

Also, we avoided A at position 2 and 3.

In ""nomad"", A is at position 4.

Let's see what we learn:
- If A is at position 4, then we get A(✓) 
- But we think A might be at 5? If we guess A at 4 and it is actually at position 5, then we would get A(-) for position 4.

Similarly, if we guess ""nubia"" with A at 5, but actually A at 4, we might get A(-) or something.

But either way, we get information.

I think ""NOMAD"" is fine.

But note: we have to use valid English words. ""NOMAD"" is valid.

So my guess is ""NOMAD"".Summary of known information:
- Secret word starts with `N` (position 1 is `N`).
- `A` is present, but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 → **must be at position 4 or 5**.
- Banned letters: `C`, `R`, `E`, `S`, `T`, `Y` (absent per feedback).
- Goal: Test position of `A` and uncover new letters.

For Guess 3, I selected **NOMAD** because:
- It places `A` at position 4 (allowing us to confirm/reject if `A` is at position 4).
- Tests new common consonants: `M`, `D`.
- Tests vowel `O` (position 2).
- Avoids banned letters (`C,R,E,S,T,Y`).
- If the secret word has `A` at position 5 (not 4), feedback will show `A` as `-`. If `A` is at position 4, feedback will show `✓`.

This maximizes information while respecting constraints.

<guess>nomad</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Guess 3:
1. **Review Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - `C`, `R`, `E` → absent (`x`), so **exclude these letters**.
   - `A` → present but wrong position (`-`), and since `A` was guessed in position 3, it **cannot be at position 3** in the secret word.
   - `N` → present but wrong position (`-`), and since `N` was guessed in position 4, it **cannot be at position 4**.

2. **Review Feedback from Guess 2 (""nasty"")**:
   - `N` → correct position (`✓`), confirming **position 1 is `N`**.
   - `A` → present but wrong position (`-`), and since `A` was guessed in position 2, it **cannot be at position 2**.
   - `S`, `T`, `Y` → absent (`x`), so **exclude these letters**.

3. **Synthesize Key Constraints**:
   - **Position 1**: Must be `N` (fixed from feedback).
   - **`A` positioning**: 
     - Cannot be at position 1 (occupied by `N`), 2 (per ""nasty""), or 3 (per ""crane"").
     - Therefore, `A` **must be at position 4 or 5**.
   - **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `E`, `S`, `T`, `Y` (banned from future guesses).
   - **Untested common letters**: Prioritize vowels (`I`, `O`, `U`) and common consonants (`L`, `D`, `M`, `P`, `B`, etc.) to maximize information gain.

4. **Choose Guess Word**:
   - Goal: Test `A`'s position (4 vs. 5) while probing new letters.
   - Guessed **""nomad""** because:
     - Starts with `N` (position 1 correct).
     - Places `A` at position 4 → if `A` is truly at position 4, feedback will show `✓`; if `A` is at position 5, feedback will show `-` (wrong position).
     - Introduces three new letters:
       - `O` (position 2): Tests a common vowel.
       - `M` (position 3): Tests a common consonant.
       - `D` (position 5): Tests another common consonant.
     - Avoids all excluded letters (`C,R,E,S,T,Y`).
   - Alternative options considered:
     - ""nubia"" (tests `U`, `B`, `I`, with `A` at position 5), but `U` and `B` are less common than `O`/`M`/`D`.
     - ""nopal"" (similar to ""nomad"" but tests `P` and `L` instead of `M` and `D`), but `M` and `D` are slightly higher frequency in English.",Guess 3: nomad -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) M(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
