We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word at all.
R(-) - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
A(-) - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.
N(-) - N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word at all.

So, we know that:
- The secret word contains R, A, and N, but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively (positions in ""crane"": 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
- The secret word does not contain C or E.

Also, note that R, A, N must appear in the word, just in different positions.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that includes R, A, N and avoids C and E. Also, we should try to place R, A, N in positions we haven't tried yet.

Recall the positions of the letters in the first guess:
Position 1: C -> excluded
Position 2: R -> must be moved (since it was marked wrong position)
Position 3: A -> must be moved
Position 4: N -> must be moved
Position 5: E -> excluded

So for the new guess:
- Avoid positions 2, 3, 4 for R, A, N respectively? Actually, we know that R is not at position 2, A not at position 3, N not at position 4. But they could be at other positions.

We have three known letters: R, A, N.

We should try to put these in different positions and also introduce two new letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for R: can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But note position 1 was previously C (excluded) and we don't know what it is. Similarly, position 5 was excluded (E). So R can be in 1, 3, 4? However, position 1 might be a good candidate for R? But note: the feedback didn't prevent R from being in position 1, only that it's not in position 2. Similarly for A: cannot be in position 3, but can be in 1,2,4,5? But position 1 is open? Actually, we don't have information about position 1 except that it isn't C.

But note: we must not use C and E.

We should try a word that has:
- R, A, N at different positions than before.
- And two new letters.

We also want to cover common vowels or consonants. We already have A (a vowel) and R and N (consonants). We might try to include another vowel? The vowels we haven't tested are: I, O, U. Y sometimes.

One common word that comes to mind: ""RAINY"" - but let's check:
- R in position 1: in the first guess R was in position 2 and now we put it at 1. That's allowed because we know it wasn't at 2.
- A in position 2: but in the first guess A was at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, but can it be at position 2? Yes.
- N: in the first guess was at position 4, so we should avoid that? We can put N at a different position, say position 3? But in ""RAINY"": 
  R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Then N is at position 4 again? That was the same position as before? Feedback said N is not at position 4? Then putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect? So avoid.

Alternatively, what about ""RANCH""? But we cannot use C? C is excluded because feedback said C(x). So no.

Another word: ""ROAST""? But has O and S? But then S is new? Also, note that E is excluded so no problem. However, we have A and R: 
R at 1 (new position), O at 2 (new), A at 3? But wait: feedback from first guess said A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, we must not place A at position 3. So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3? Then we shouldn't use that.

Another idea: ""PLAIN""? But let's check:
P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again, A at position 3 is disallowed? So not.

How about ""TRADE""? But E is excluded? Cannot use E.

Another word: ""PARIS""? 
P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, I at 4, S at 5.

This seems better because:
A is at position 2 (not position 3) -> which is a new position.
R is at position 3 (not position 2) -> new position.
N is missing? But we need to include N? Wait, we know the secret word has N? So if we don't include N, we might not get information about N? Actually, we should try to include N because we know it's in the word.

But we have three letters R, A, N to include. So the next guess should ideally include R, A, and N? But we can also consider that we have two more tries and we can use one to narrow down.

But we must avoid C and E.

Another word: ""RANIS""? Not a word.

""NADIR""? 
N at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, R at 5.

Now:
- N is at position 1 (was at 4 before, so avoided position 4)
- A at position 2 (avoided position 3)
- R at position 5 (avoided position 2)

So all three are in new positions. Also, new letters: D and I.

Is ""NADIR"" a valid word? Yes, meaning the lowest point.

Alternatively, we can consider common words. Let's think of words that include R, A, N and two new letters, avoiding positions we know are wrong.

Other options:
""TRAIN"": 
T at 1, R at 2? But R was in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong? So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? Because feedback said R(-) meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. So avoiding position 2 for R. Therefore, ""TRAIN"" has R at position 2 -> avoid.

""GRAIN"": same problem, R at position 2 -> avoid.

""BRAIN"": B at 1, R at 2 -> same issue with R at position 2.

""PRANK"":
P at 1, R at 2? Avoid because R cannot be at position 2.

""CRANK"": no, C is excluded.

How about ""ADORN""? 
A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
This seems okay:
- A is at position 1 (avoided position 3)
- R is at position 4 (avoided position 2)
- N is at position 5 (avoided position 4)

New letters: D, O.

So ""ADORN"" is a word. Let's use that.

Another word: ""RADON""? 
R at 1 (avoided position 2), A at 2, D at 3, O at 4, N at 5? Then N is at position 5, which is fine? But we have A at position 2? We don't have information against A at position 2? Because first guess had A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A can be elsewhere? So yes.

But note that we also should consider frequency and covering more common letters.

We can also think: since the secret word has R, A, N, and two other letters which are not C or E.

After considering, I think ""ADORN"" is a reasonable guess.

Thus, I will guess ""ADORN"".

But wait: let me confirm: 
- In ""ADORN"": 
  Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now at position 1 -> okay)
  Position 2: D (new)
  Position 3: O (new)
  Position 4: R (we know R is in the word, now at position 4 -> okay because it wasn't at 2)
  Position 5: N (we know N is in the word, and wasn't at position 4? Now at position 5 -> okay)

Alternatively, to maximize new letters and also test the position of A at a new location, this seems good.

So I'll go with ""adorn"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- The secret word must contain R, A, and N, so the new guess should include these letters while avoiding C and E.
- Since R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4, the guess ""adorn"" places:
  - A in position 1 (a new position not ruled out),
  - R in position 4 (avoiding position 2),
  - N in position 5 (avoiding position 4),
  - while introducing two new letters: D and O.

This maximizes information gain by testing the known letters in untried positions and adding common unused letters.

- N: in the first guess was at position 4, so we should avoid that? We can put N at a different position, say position 3? But in ""RAINY"": 
  R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Then N is at position 4 again? That was the same position as before? Feedback said N is not at position 4? Then putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect? So avoid.

Alternatively, what about ""RANCH""? But we cannot use C? C is excluded because feedback said C(x). So no.

Another word: ""ROAST""? But has O and S? But then S is new? Also, note that E is excluded so no problem. However, we have A and R: 
R at 1 (new position), O at 2 (new), A at 3? But wait: feedback from first guess said A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, we must not place A at position 3. So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3? Then we shouldn't use that.

Another idea: ""PLAIN""? But let's check:
P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again, A at position 3 is disallowed? So not.

How about ""TRADE""? But E is excluded? Cannot use E.

Another word: ""PARIS""? 
P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, I at 4, S at 5.

This seems better because:
A is at position 2 (not position 3) -> which is a new position.
R is at position 3 (not position 2) -> new position.
N is missing? But we need to include N? Wait, we know the secret word has N? So if we don't include N, we might not get information about N? Actually, we should try to include N because we know it's in the word.

But we have three letters R, A, N to include. So the next guess should ideally include R, A, and N? But we can also consider that we have two more tries and we can use one to narrow down.

But we must avoid C and E.

Another word: ""RANIS""? Not a word.

""NADIR""? 
N at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, R at 5.

Now:
- N is at position 1 (was at 4 before, so avoided position 4)
- A at position 2 (avoided position 3)
- R at position 5 (avoided position 2)

So all three are in new positions. Also, new letters: D and I.

Is ""NADIR"" a valid word? Yes, meaning the lowest point.

Alternatively, we can consider common words. Let's think of words that include R, A, N and two new letters, avoiding positions we know are wrong.

Other options:
""TRAIN"": 
T at 1, R at 2? But R was in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong? So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? Because feedback said R(-) meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. So avoiding position 2 for R. Therefore, ""TRAIN"" has R at position 2 -> avoid.

""GRAIN"": same problem, R at position 2 -> avoid.

""BRAIN"": B at 1, R at 2 -> same issue with R at position 2.

""PRANK"":
P at 1, R at 2? Avoid because R cannot be at position 2.

""CRANK"": no, C is excluded.

How about ""ADORN""? 
A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
This seems okay:
- A is at position 1 (avoided position 3)
- R is at position 4 (avoided position 2)
- N is at position 5 (avoided position 4)

New letters: D, O.

So ""ADORN"" is a word. Let's use that.

Another word: ""RADON""? 
R at 1 (avoided position 2), A at 2, D at 3, O at 4, N at 5? Then N is at position 5, which is fine? But we have A at position 2? We don't have information against A at position 2? Because first guess had A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A can be elsewhere? So yes.

But note that we also should consider frequency and covering more common letters.

We can also think: since the secret word has R, A, N, and two other letters which are not C or E.

After considering, I think ""ADORN"" is a reasonable guess.

Thus, I will guess ""ADORN"".

But wait: let me confirm: 
- In ""ADORN"": 
  Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now at position 1 -> okay)
  Position 2: D (new)
  Position 3: O (new)
  Position 4: R (we know R is in the word, now at position 4 -> okay because it wasn't at 2)
  Position 5: N (we know N is in the word, and wasn't at position 4? Now at position 5 -> okay)

Alternatively, to maximize new letters and also test the position of A at a new location, this seems good.

So I'll go with ""adorn"".Based on the feedback from ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- The secret word must contain R, A, and N, so the new guess should include these letters while avoiding C and E.
- Since R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4, the guess ""adorn"" places:
  - A in position 1 (a new position not ruled out),
  - R in position 4 (avoiding position 2),
  - N in position 5 (avoiding position 4),
  - while introducing two new letters: D and O.

This maximizes information gain by testing the known letters in untried positions and adding common unused letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This tells us:
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the secret word, but:
    - R is not at position 2 (where it was in ""crane"")
    - A is not at position 3
    - N is not at position 4

Guess 2: adorn -> A(-), D(x), O(-), R(-), N(✓)
This tells us:
- D is not in the secret word.
- A, O, R are in the secret word, but:
    - A is not at position 1 (where it was in ""adorn"")
    - O is not at position 3
    - R is not at position 4
- N is in the secret word and at position 5! Because it got a ✓.

Therefore, we know for sure:
- The secret word has N at position 5.
- The secret word contains R, A, O, and N. (N at position 5, and R, A, O are also present.)
- Letters not in the word: C, E, D.

Also, from the positions:
- R is not at position 2 (from crane) and also not at position 4 (from adorn).
- A is not at position 3 (from crane) and also not at position 1 (from adorn).
- O is not at position 3 (from adorn).
- N is fixed at position 5.

Now, the secret word has positions: _ _ _ _ N

We need to place R, A, O, and one more unknown letter? Since we don't know the fifth letter yet.

But we also know from the first guess that there are five distinct letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we haven't seen duplicates yet.

The letters we know must be in the word: R, A, O, N. And since N is in position 5, we have three more positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4? The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the other four? So we have R, A, O, and one additional letter? Because we only have three missing positions? But wait: we know R, A, O, and N are in the word. That's four distinct letters. Therefore, there is one more distinct letter we haven't identified yet.

We have not encountered duplicates in feedback, so I'll assume distinct for now.

We must avoid letters: C, E, D.

Now, possible positions for A, R, O:

- A cannot be at position 1 (from adorn) or position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 4? Because positions are 1,2,3,4 excluding 1 and 3? So A must be at position 2 or 4.

Similarly for R:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from crane) or position 4 (from adorn). Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 3? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4 but excluding 2 and 4? So R must be at position 1 or 3.

For O:
- O is in the word and is not at position 3 (from adorn). So O cannot be at position 3? Then O can be at position 1,2,4? Because position 1 is available? But note, O is a new letter we only tried in position 3.

Now, we need to assign R, A, O to positions 1,2,3,4 without conflict.

Since R is only possible at 1 or 3, and A only at 2 or 4, and O can be at 1,2,4? But note we have only three positions left? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 to be filled with three letters? No: we have to place A, R, O, and one more letter? Wait, there are four positions: 1,2,3,4 to be filled with four letters? But we only have R, A, O? So one more letter we don't know? So four letters: one of which is possibly duplicated? Or we have an additional letter.

But from the feedback of the first guess: crane had five distinct letters, and adorn had five distinct letters? And we have R, A, O, N all distinct? So the fifth letter is missing? And we need to guess it.

Now, we need to form a word ending with N (position 5) and having R, A, O, and one more letter? And avoiding C, E, D.

Possible word patterns:

Let me represent the word as: W1 W2 W3 W4 N

Constraints:
- R must be in W1 or W3.
- A must be in W2 or W4.
- O must not be in W3? Because O was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning that O is in the word but not at that position? So O must be at position 1,2,4? But W4 is position 4? Positions: 1,2,3,4.

Now, let's consider cases:

Case 1: R at position 1 (W1=R). Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at position W2 or W4? But we cannot have two letters at the same position? So if W1=R, then we have:
- W1 = R
- Then A and O can be at positions: W2, W3, W4? But note A cannot be at W3? So A must be at W2 or W4, and O must be somewhere? O cannot be at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? Then we have conflict if both A and O want W2 or W4? But also position W3 must be filled with the fifth letter? Not necessarily? Wait the fifth letter? We have R (at W1), and then we need to place A and O? Plus the fifth letter? So three letters for positions W2, W3, W4? But then A must be at W2 or W4, O must be at W1? Wait no, W1 is taken? O must be at W2 or W4? Then the fifth letter at the remaining position? And W3 is available? But O cannot be at W3? So at W3 we can put the fifth letter? And A and O can be at W2 and W4? But positions: W2 and W4? That leaves W3 for the fifth letter? So if we assign:
  W1 = R
  Then we assign W2 and W4 to A and O? But we don't know which? Then W3 can be the fifth letter? But O cannot be at W3? And we put the fifth letter at W3? That's fine.

Similarly, Case 2: R at position 3 (W3=R). Then:
  W3 = R
  Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at W1, W2, or W4? But O cannot be at W3? Which is taken by R? So that's fine? Then assign A at W2 or W4, O at one of W1, W2 or W4? And the fifth letter at the remaining position.

We need to find words that end with N and contain R, A, O and one variable? Plus the constraints.

We should use a word that has N at the end and includes R, A, O? And positions as above.

But let me list possible words:

First, let's consider if R is at position 1: then the word pattern: R ? ? ? N

With A at either position 2 or 4? And O in the other? And one letter at position 3? And we must avoid C, E, D? And it must be a valid word.

Also, we already know positions that are invalid for A? We know A cannot be in position 3? And also cannot be in position 1? So R at position 1 allows A at position 2 or 4. Similarly? O can be at the other of 2 or 4? Or? Position 2 and 4 are for A and O? Position 3 for the fifth letter? Or A at position 2? O elsewhere? Actually? We have three letters: A, O, and X (the unknown) to fill positions W2, W3, W4? With constraints:
- A at W2 or W4? But not W3?
- O not at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? But we cannot have both A and O trying to be at same position? So we must assign one to W2 and one to W4? Then the fifth letter must be at W3? Because that's the only position left? Yes.

So pattern becomes: R A or O? at w2? and the other at w4? and X at w3? Then word: R X O N? Or R X A N? Or? With specific positions.

Thus, possible words:

Option: R at W1, A at W2, O at W4: then word: R ? A ? N? Wait: no! Positions: W1=R, W2=A? Then W3=X, W4=O? And W5=N? So word: R X O N? But wait: if W4=O, then the word is R X ? O N? Not: R at1, W2=X1, W3=X, W4=O, W5=N? Then pattern: R ? ? O N? But with A? Where is A? We assigned A to W2? Then if W2=A? Then: R A ? O N? So word is R A X O N? Where X is the unknown letter? And O at position 4? That yields: position: 1=R, position2=A, position3=X, position4=O, position5=N? But O is at position4? But note: in adorn, R was at position4 and marked (-), meaning R cannot be at position4? But R isn't here? Now O is at position4? That's fine? We don't have constraints for O at position4? Only that R cannot be there? And similarly, A is at position2? Is that allowed? Previously A was not at position3? We don't have constraint on position2? So yes.

Similarly, if we put O at W2 and A at W4? Then word: R O X A N? Meaning positions: 1=R, 2=O, 3=X, 4=A, 5=N.

Now, we need to look for words that end with N? Pattern possibilities:

Pattern1: R A ? O N? So RA_O N? For example? Known words: RATON? Not valid? RAYON? Y not excluded? But is it a word? Yes.

Pattern2: R O ? A N? So RO_A N? For example? RORAN? No? ROBAN? Not? ROLAN? No? RO? Let me think.

Now, the other case: R at position 3 (W3=R)? Then:
  W3 = R
  Then A must be at W2 or W4?
  O must be at W1 or W2 or W4? But W3 is taken by R? And O cannot be at W3? That's fine? So assignments? How do we assign?

Subcase: A at W2? Then O can be at W1 or W4? And W4 and W1? Then the fifth letter must be at the other? Because we have positions W1, W2, W4? And we need to assign A? Which we put at W2? Then O and the fifth letter at W1 and W4? So:
  W1: O or fifth?
  W2: A
  W3: R
  W4: O or fifth? (alternate)
  W5: N

So if O is at W1? Then fifth at W4? Word: O A R X N? OAR?X N? Like OAR? Not meaningful? OARAN? No? OARIN? No?

If O is at W4? Then word: ? A R X N? But W1 must be the fifth? So word: X A R O N? Or? If O at W4? But we assigned O at W4? Then W1 is fifth? So word: F A R O N? Which is ""faron"" not a word? But ""far on""? Not? Maybe BARON? With B? But valid!

Similarly, subcase: A at W4? Then O can be at W1 or W2? And the fifth letter at the other? So:
  W1: O or fifth?
  W2: O or fifth? 
  W3: R
  W4: A
  W5: N

So if O at W1? Then fifth at W2? Word: O X R A N? Now, OXRAN? Perhaps with X? Like OVRAN? Not? Or OTRAN? Not words? Maybe?

If O at W2? Then fifth at W1? Word: X O R A N? Now, pattern:?ORAN? Like MORAN? Not? But ""moran"" is not common? ""coran""? Not? ""boran""? Not?

So better words seem to come from:
Patterns with R at position1: 
  RA_O N -> RATON? RATON - a rat? But ""raton"" is a word meaning a raccoon-like animal? But accepted? 
  But better: RAYON? RAYON is a fabric? But RAYON has Y? Which is available? Not excluded.

Patterns with R at position3:
  X A R O N? Only real word: BARON? But BARON: B-A-R-O-N? With B? And B is not excluded.

And BARON: positions? Position1=B, Position2=A, Position3=R, Position4=O, Position5=N.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position3? That's allowed? Because we said R must be in position1 or3? And position3 is okay? Previously R was excluded from position2 and4? Position3 is new? Then A? Is at position2? Now, previously: A cannot be at position3? And not at position1? Position2 is allowed? Then O? At position4? And we have no constraint against O at position4? Previously O was only tried at position3? So okay.

Also, BARON avoids C,E,D? B is not excluded? So BARON is a good candidate.

Or other words? Like... what else?

Also consider the first pattern: with R at1? And A at2? O at4? Then word: R A ? O N? Possibilities: R and fifth letter? Fifth letter must be a consonant? And common letters? Letters not used: we have B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? etc? Without C,E,D?

Possible: R?O?N? With second letter A? Then third letter could be T? Then RATON? But is that a valid word? Or PAYON? No? MAYON? No? RAYON? With Y? Third letter Y? RAYON - valid.

RAYON is a word.

But BARON also valid? Which one to choose?

Another word: SALON? But SALON ends in ON? But not? SALON has L at position4? Not O? We need position4=O? For the first pattern? Only if we assign O at position4? But if we have R at1 and O at4? Then SALON doesn't match? Pattern for R at1? RA_O N? So must have A at2 and O at4? So R?A?third?O?N? Then third letter? RATON? RATON is in some dictionaries.

We should prefer BARON because it uses a common letter? And also, BARON allows us to test the position for R? Since we haven't tested position3 for R?

We also need to gain information about the fifth letter.

But we also have another constraint: from the first guess, R was in the word but not position2? So R could be at position1? Or3?

Similarly, A could be at position2 or4? 

In BARON:
- R at position3? Then if we get feedback, it will tell us whether R is at position3? And other placements.

In BARON: structure: B-A-R-O-N

Now, from feedback? We can see:

Also, BARON uses B? Which is a common letter? So we can test B.

Whereas RAYON? Uses Y? Which is less common? And might be good? But BARON seems better? Or are there other words?

Another word: for the other configuration: R O ? A N? Pattern: RO_A N? Words? ROTAN? Not? Or ROPAN? No? ROTAN? Not? Maybe? Not common? RO?AN? Like roman? But roman is ROMAN? With M? But that doesn't fit? ROMAN has O at position2? But we need O at position2? Then if we have R O ? ? N? But we assigned A at position4? So pattern: R O ? A N? Like: R O T A N? But not word? R O M A N? But then N? Then ROMAN? But ROMAN is 5 letters? R-O-M-A-N? Then position5=N? That's good? ROMAN? Let's see:

ROMAN: R at1, O at2, M at3, A at4, N at5.

Now, constraints? 
- R at position1? Allowed? 
- O at position2? But we haven't imposed constraint? But O cannot be at position3? But position2 is fine? 
- A at position4? Previously? A cannot be at position1 (from adorn) and position3 (from crane)? Position4 is new? 
- M is new letter? 

And not containing C,E,D? M is allowed? 

So ROMAN is a valid word? Also?

Now, we have two good words: BARON and ROMAN.

In ROMAN: 
- Position1=R? But R? We are allowed R at position1? How does that fit our case? 
Actually, our case for R at position1: then if A at position4 and O at position2? Then ROMAN: O at position2, A at position4? Then third letter? M? So R O M A N? Yes? Exactly.

Whereas BARON: R at position3? 

But wait? ROMAN: R at position1? And in this case we have O at position2? And A at position4? Which satisfies R at1? Also? Then the fifth letter? M? 

Similarly, BARON has B? 

Now? We need to choose one? 

Also? From previous feedback? We know A is in the word? But not tested at position2? And ROMAN tests A at position4? Whereas BARON tests A at position2? 

But we already tested A at position1? And not at position3? Now? Position2 and position4 are possible? 

To gain more information? We want to test a configuration that differs? 

But BARON? Also? Let me see? We already have N at position5? So for the unknown letter? 

Consider? BARON? would test:
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: R? 
  Position4: O? 
  Position5: N? 

But note? We know A cannot be at position1? So if B is wrong? But not exist? We get x? Or if R is at position3? If correct? We get ✓? 

Similarly? ROMAN? 
  R at1? Which we think might be possible? 
  O at2? 
  M at3? 
  A at4? 
  N at5? 

Now? But in the first guess? crane had R at position2? And got (-) meaning R is not at2? And ROMAN has R at1? If R is at1? Then we get ✓ for R? And A at4? Etc? 

But? We don't know? So both seem valid? 

Perhaps choose ROMAN? Because it tests R at position1? Which hasn't been tested? While BARON tests R at position3? Position3 hasn't been tested either? 

But? Also? ROMAN avoids the letter O at position3? Because in adorn? O was at position3 and got (-)? Meaning O is in the word but not there? So position3 must be something else? In ROMAN? Position3 is M? So that's fine? 

Similarly? In BARON? position3 is R? Which is fine? 

We also need to consider which word is more likely? 

Common words? BARON and ROMAN are both common? 

Or perhaps we can get more letters? 

But? We have only one unknown? And this will be our third guess? So we can guess one of them? 

I'll choose BARON? Because BAR? Letter B is high frequency? And helps us test if B is the fifth letter? 

But ROMAN also tests M? 

Alternatively? Another word: PARON? Not word? Or others? 

Since in BARON? it also assigns A at position2? Which hasn't been tested? Whereas ROMAN assigns A at position4? 

But we don't know which is the case? 

Perhaps BARON? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't fix O and A? But tests possible letters? 

But we want to get the word quickly? 

I think BARON is a good guess? And may be the word? 

But? Let's confirm with the feedback: 

If the word were BARON? Then from the feedback? 

But note? We have feedback from previous: 

The secret word might be? For example? But I think BARON is reasonable? 

Perhaps? Another possibility? With R at1? And A at4? And O at2? Then ROMAN? 

But ROMAN has O at2? So if we guess BARON? 

BARON: letters B,A,R,O,N? 

And we haven't used B? So if the secret word has B? We learn? 

Whereas? If we guess ROMAN? learn about M? 

Both are valid? 

I'll go with BARON? 

But? An important point? In BARON? it has position2=A? But position2 is available? And position4=O? 

Similarly? constraints are satisfied? 

So? Guess BARON? 

Another reason? With the first pattern? If we had R at1 and O at2? But? We don't? ROMAN does? 

So I think BARON is fine? 

We are in the third guess? So we have tries left? 

Do it? Final choice? BARON. 

But? Perhaps consider? From the feedback? We know the secret word must have R, A, O, N? So BARON covers all? But has an extra B? True? But if the secret word has B? Then BARON is the word? Otherwise? We learn about B? 

Similarly? ROMAN covers R,O,M,A,N? With M? 

I think BARON uses more common letters? 

So?
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From **crane**: C and E are not in the secret word. R, A, and N are present but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- From **adorn**: D is not in the secret word. A, O, and R are present but not in positions 1, 3, and 4 respectively. N is confirmed at position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with N (position 5) and includes R, A, O.
2. Letters excluded: C, E, D.
3. Position constraints:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2 or 4.
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
4. The secret word has 4 known distinct letters (R, A, O, N) and one unknown letter (not C, E, D).

Given that N is fixed at position 5, possible word patterns are:
- If R is at position 1, then A and O must occupy positions 2 and 4, with the unknown letter at position 3 (e.g., RAXON).
- If R is at position 3, then A must be at position 2 or 4, and O must fill the remaining spot, with the unknown letter at the open position (e.g., XARON).

Considering valid words:
- **BARON** (B-A-R-O-N) fits most constraints:
  - Position 3 is R (allowed since R avoids positions 2/4).
  - Position 2 is A (allowed position).
  - Position 4 is O (allowed position).
  - Position 5 is N (correct).
  - Uses B (common letter, not excluded).

This tests R at position 3 and A at position 2, both new placements, while introducing B to check if it is the unknown letter.

<guess>baron</guess>",baron,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This tells us:
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the secret word, but:
    - R is not at position 2 (where it was in ""crane"")
    - A is not at position 3
    - N is not at position 4

Guess 2: adorn -> A(-), D(x), O(-), R(-), N(✓)
This tells us:
- D is not in the secret word.
- A, O, R are in the secret word, but:
    - A is not at position 1 (where it was in ""adorn"")
    - O is not at position 3
    - R is not at position 4
- N is in the secret word and at position 5! Because it got a ✓.

Therefore, we know for sure:
- The secret word has N at position 5.
- The secret word contains R, A, O, and N. (N at position 5, and R, A, O are also present.)
- Letters not in the word: C, E, D.

Also, from the positions:
- R is not at position 2 (from crane) and also not at position 4 (from adorn).
- A is not at position 3 (from crane) and also not at position 1 (from adorn).
- O is not at position 3 (from adorn).
- N is fixed at position 5.

Now, the secret word has positions: _ _ _ _ N

We need to place R, A, O, and one more unknown letter? Since we don't know the fifth letter yet.

But we also know from the first guess that there are five distinct letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we haven't seen duplicates yet.

The letters we know must be in the word: R, A, O, N. And since N is in position 5, we have three more positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4? The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the other four? So we have R, A, O, and one additional letter? Because we only have three missing positions? But wait: we know R, A, O, and N are in the word. That's four distinct letters. Therefore, there is one more distinct letter we haven't identified yet.

We have not encountered duplicates in feedback, so I'll assume distinct for now.

We must avoid letters: C, E, D.

Now, possible positions for A, R, O:

- A cannot be at position 1 (from adorn) or position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 4? Because positions are 1,2,3,4 excluding 1 and 3? So A must be at position 2 or 4.

Similarly for R:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from crane) or position 4 (from adorn). Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 3? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4 but excluding 2 and 4? So R must be at position 1 or 3.

For O:
- O is in the word and is not at position 3 (from adorn). So O cannot be at position 3? Then O can be at position 1,2,4? Because position 1 is available? But note, O is a new letter we only tried in position 3.

Now, we need to assign R, A, O to positions 1,2,3,4 without conflict.

Since R is only possible at 1 or 3, and A only at 2 or 4, and O can be at 1,2,4? But note we have only three positions left? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 to be filled with three letters? No: we have to place A, R, O, and one more letter? Wait, there are four positions: 1,2,3,4 to be filled with four letters? But we only have R, A, O? So one more letter we don't know? So four letters: one of which is possibly duplicated? Or we have an additional letter.

But from the feedback of the first guess: crane had five distinct letters, and adorn had five distinct letters? And we have R, A, O, N all distinct? So the fifth letter is missing? And we need to guess it.

Now, we need to form a word ending with N (position 5) and having R, A, O, and one more letter? And avoiding C, E, D.

Possible word patterns:

Let me represent the word as: W1 W2 W3 W4 N

Constraints:
- R must be in W1 or W3.
- A must be in W2 or W4.
- O must not be in W3? Because O was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning that O is in the word but not at that position? So O must be at position 1,2,4? But W4 is position 4? Positions: 1,2,3,4.

Now, let's consider cases:

Case 1: R at position 1 (W1=R). Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at position W2 or W4? But we cannot have two letters at the same position? So if W1=R, then we have:
- W1 = R
- Then A and O can be at positions: W2, W3, W4? But note A cannot be at W3? So A must be at W2 or W4, and O must be somewhere? O cannot be at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? Then we have conflict if both A and O want W2 or W4? But also position W3 must be filled with the fifth letter? Not necessarily? Wait the fifth letter? We have R (at W1), and then we need to place A and O? Plus the fifth letter? So three letters for positions W2, W3, W4? But then A must be at W2 or W4, O must be at W1? Wait no, W1 is taken? O must be at W2 or W4? Then the fifth letter at the remaining position? And W3 is available? But O cannot be at W3? So at W3 we can put the fifth letter? And A and O can be at W2 and W4? But positions: W2 and W4? That leaves W3 for the fifth letter? So if we assign:
  W1 = R
  Then we assign W2 and W4 to A and O? But we don't know which? Then W3 can be the fifth letter? But O cannot be at W3? And we put the fifth letter at W3? That's fine.

Similarly, Case 2: R at position 3 (W3=R). Then:
  W3 = R
  Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at W1, W2, or W4? But O cannot be at W3? Which is taken by R? So that's fine? Then assign A at W2 or W4, O at one of W1, W2 or W4? And the fifth letter at the remaining position.

We need to find words that end with N and contain R, A, O and one variable? Plus the constraints.

We should use a word that has N at the end and includes R, A, O? And positions as above.

But let me list possible words:

First, let's consider if R is at position 1: then the word pattern: R ? ? ? N

With A at either position 2 or 4? And O in the other? And one letter at position 3? And we must avoid C, E, D? And it must be a valid word.

Also, we already know positions that are invalid for A? We know A cannot be in position 3? And also cannot be in position 1? So R at position 1 allows A at position 2 or 4. Similarly? O can be at the other of 2 or 4? Or? Position 2 and 4 are for A and O? Position 3 for the fifth letter? Or A at position 2? O elsewhere? Actually? We have three letters: A, O, and X (the unknown) to fill positions W2, W3, W4? With constraints:
- A at W2 or W4? But not W3?
- O not at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? But we cannot have both A and O trying to be at same position? So we must assign one to W2 and one to W4? Then the fifth letter must be at W3? Because that's the only position left? Yes.

So pattern becomes: R A or O? at w2? and the other at w4? and X at w3? Then word: R X O N? Or R X A N? Or? With specific positions.

Thus, possible words:

Option: R at W1, A at W2, O at W4: then word: R ? A ? N? Wait: no! Positions: W1=R, W2=A? Then W3=X, W4=O? And W5=N? So word: R X O N? But wait: if W4=O, then the word is R X ? O N? Not: R at1, W2=X1, W3=X, W4=O, W5=N? Then pattern: R ? ? O N? But with A? Where is A? We assigned A to W2? Then if W2=A? Then: R A ? O N? So word is R A X O N? Where X is the unknown letter? And O at position 4? That yields: position: 1=R, position2=A, position3=X, position4=O, position5=N? But O is at position4? But note: in adorn, R was at position4 and marked (-), meaning R cannot be at position4? But R isn't here? Now O is at position4? That's fine? We don't have constraints for O at position4? Only that R cannot be there? And similarly, A is at position2? Is that allowed? Previously A was not at position3? We don't have constraint on position2? So yes.

Similarly, if we put O at W2 and A at W4? Then word: R O X A N? Meaning positions: 1=R, 2=O, 3=X, 4=A, 5=N.

Now, we need to look for words that end with N? Pattern possibilities:

Pattern1: R A ? O N? So RA_O N? For example? Known words: RATON? Not valid? RAYON? Y not excluded? But is it a word? Yes.

Pattern2: R O ? A N? So RO_A N? For example? RORAN? No? ROBAN? Not? ROLAN? No? RO? Let me think.

Now, the other case: R at position 3 (W3=R)? Then:
  W3 = R
  Then A must be at W2 or W4?
  O must be at W1 or W2 or W4? But W3 is taken by R? And O cannot be at W3? That's fine? So assignments? How do we assign?

Subcase: A at W2? Then O can be at W1 or W4? And W4 and W1? Then the fifth letter must be at the other? Because we have positions W1, W2, W4? And we need to assign A? Which we put at W2? Then O and the fifth letter at W1 and W4? So:
  W1: O or fifth?
  W2: A
  W3: R
  W4: O or fifth? (alternate)
  W5: N

So if O is at W1? Then fifth at W4? Word: O A R X N? OAR?X N? Like OAR? Not meaningful? OARAN? No? OARIN? No?

If O is at W4? Then word: ? A R X N? But W1 must be the fifth? So word: X A R O N? Or? If O at W4? But we assigned O at W4? Then W1 is fifth? So word: F A R O N? Which is ""faron"" not a word? But ""far on""? Not? Maybe BARON? With B? But valid!

Similarly, subcase: A at W4? Then O can be at W1 or W2? And the fifth letter at the other? So:
  W1: O or fifth?
  W2: O or fifth? 
  W3: R
  W4: A
  W5: N

So if O at W1? Then fifth at W2? Word: O X R A N? Now, OXRAN? Perhaps with X? Like OVRAN? Not? Or OTRAN? Not words? Maybe?

If O at W2? Then fifth at W1? Word: X O R A N? Now, pattern:?ORAN? Like MORAN? Not? But ""moran"" is not common? ""coran""? Not? ""boran""? Not?

So better words seem to come from:
Patterns with R at position1: 
  RA_O N -> RATON? RATON - a rat? But ""raton"" is a word meaning a raccoon-like animal? But accepted? 
  But better: RAYON? RAYON is a fabric? But RAYON has Y? Which is available? Not excluded.

Patterns with R at position3:
  X A R O N? Only real word: BARON? But BARON: B-A-R-O-N? With B? And B is not excluded.

And BARON: positions? Position1=B, Position2=A, Position3=R, Position4=O, Position5=N.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position3? That's allowed? Because we said R must be in position1 or3? And position3 is okay? Previously R was excluded from position2 and4? Position3 is new? Then A? Is at position2? Now, previously: A cannot be at position3? And not at position1? Position2 is allowed? Then O? At position4? And we have no constraint against O at position4? Previously O was only tried at position3? So okay.

Also, BARON avoids C,E,D? B is not excluded? So BARON is a good candidate.

Or other words? Like... what else?

Also consider the first pattern: with R at1? And A at2? O at4? Then word: R A ? O N? Possibilities: R and fifth letter? Fifth letter must be a consonant? And common letters? Letters not used: we have B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? etc? Without C,E,D?

Possible: R?O?N? With second letter A? Then third letter could be T? Then RATON? But is that a valid word? Or PAYON? No? MAYON? No? RAYON? With Y? Third letter Y? RAYON - valid.

RAYON is a word.

But BARON also valid? Which one to choose?

Another word: SALON? But SALON ends in ON? But not? SALON has L at position4? Not O? We need position4=O? For the first pattern? Only if we assign O at position4? But if we have R at1 and O at4? Then SALON doesn't match? Pattern for R at1? RA_O N? So must have A at2 and O at4? So R?A?third?O?N? Then third letter? RATON? RATON is in some dictionaries.

We should prefer BARON because it uses a common letter? And also, BARON allows us to test the position for R? Since we haven't tested position3 for R?

We also need to gain information about the fifth letter.

But we also have another constraint: from the first guess, R was in the word but not position2? So R could be at position1? Or3?

Similarly, A could be at position2 or4? 

In BARON:
- R at position3? Then if we get feedback, it will tell us whether R is at position3? And other placements.

In BARON: structure: B-A-R-O-N

Now, from feedback? We can see:

Also, BARON uses B? Which is a common letter? So we can test B.

Whereas RAYON? Uses Y? Which is less common? And might be good? But BARON seems better? Or are there other words?

Another word: for the other configuration: R O ? A N? Pattern: RO_A N? Words? ROTAN? Not? Or ROPAN? No? ROTAN? Not? Maybe? Not common? RO?AN? Like roman? But roman is ROMAN? With M? But that doesn't fit? ROMAN has O at position2? But we need O at position2? Then if we have R O ? ? N? But we assigned A at position4? So pattern: R O ? A N? Like: R O T A N? But not word? R O M A N? But then N? Then ROMAN? But ROMAN is 5 letters? R-O-M-A-N? Then position5=N? That's good? ROMAN? Let's see:

ROMAN: R at1, O at2, M at3, A at4, N at5.

Now, constraints? 
- R at position1? Allowed? 
- O at position2? But we haven't imposed constraint? But O cannot be at position3? But position2 is fine? 
- A at position4? Previously? A cannot be at position1 (from adorn) and position3 (from crane)? Position4 is new? 
- M is new letter? 

And not containing C,E,D? M is allowed? 

So ROMAN is a valid word? Also?

Now, we have two good words: BARON and ROMAN.

In ROMAN: 
- Position1=R? But R? We are allowed R at position1? How does that fit our case? 
Actually, our case for R at position1: then if A at position4 and O at position2? Then ROMAN: O at position2, A at position4? Then third letter? M? So R O M A N? Yes? Exactly.

Whereas BARON: R at position3? 

But wait? ROMAN: R at position1? And in this case we have O at position2? And A at position4? Which satisfies R at1? Also? Then the fifth letter? M? 

Similarly, BARON has B? 

Now? We need to choose one? 

Also? From previous feedback? We know A is in the word? But not tested at position2? And ROMAN tests A at position4? Whereas BARON tests A at position2? 

But we already tested A at position1? And not at position3? Now? Position2 and position4 are possible? 

To gain more information? We want to test a configuration that differs? 

But BARON? Also? Let me see? We already have N at position5? So for the unknown letter? 

Consider? BARON? would test:
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: R? 
  Position4: O? 
  Position5: N? 

But note? We know A cannot be at position1? So if B is wrong? But not exist? We get x? Or if R is at position3? If correct? We get ✓? 

Similarly? ROMAN? 
  R at1? Which we think might be possible? 
  O at2? 
  M at3? 
  A at4? 
  N at5? 

Now? But in the first guess? crane had R at position2? And got (-) meaning R is not at2? And ROMAN has R at1? If R is at1? Then we get ✓ for R? And A at4? Etc? 

But? We don't know? So both seem valid? 

Perhaps choose ROMAN? Because it tests R at position1? Which hasn't been tested? While BARON tests R at position3? Position3 hasn't been tested either? 

But? Also? ROMAN avoids the letter O at position3? Because in adorn? O was at position3 and got (-)? Meaning O is in the word but not there? So position3 must be something else? In ROMAN? Position3 is M? So that's fine? 

Similarly? In BARON? position3 is R? Which is fine? 

We also need to consider which word is more likely? 

Common words? BARON and ROMAN are both common? 

Or perhaps we can get more letters? 

But? We have only one unknown? And this will be our third guess? So we can guess one of them? 

I'll choose BARON? Because BAR? Letter B is high frequency? And helps us test if B is the fifth letter? 

But ROMAN also tests M? 

Alternatively? Another word: PARON? Not word? Or others? 

Since in BARON? it also assigns A at position2? Which hasn't been tested? Whereas ROMAN assigns A at position4? 

But we don't know which is the case? 

Perhaps BARON? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't fix O and A? But tests possible letters? 

But we want to get the word quickly? 

I think BARON is a good guess? And may be the word? 

But? Let's confirm with the feedback: 

If the word were BARON? Then from the feedback? 

But note? We have feedback from previous: 

The secret word might be? For example? But I think BARON is reasonable? 

Perhaps? Another possibility? With R at1? And A at4? And O at2? Then ROMAN? 

But ROMAN has O at2? So if we guess BARON? 

BARON: letters B,A,R,O,N? 

And we haven't used B? So if the secret word has B? We learn? 

Whereas? If we guess ROMAN? learn about M? 

Both are valid? 

I'll go with BARON? 

But? An important point? In BARON? it has position2=A? But position2 is available? And position4=O? 

Similarly? constraints are satisfied? 

So? Guess BARON? 

Another reason? With the first pattern? If we had R at1 and O at2? But? We don't? ROMAN does? 

So I think BARON is fine? 

We are in the third guess? So we have tries left? 

Do it? Final choice? BARON. 

But? Perhaps consider? From the feedback? We know the secret word must have R, A, O, N? So BARON covers all? But has an extra B? True? But if the secret word has B? Then BARON is the word? Otherwise? We learn about B? 

Similarly? ROMAN covers R,O,M,A,N? With M? 

I think BARON uses more common letters? 

So?Based on the previous feedback:
- From **crane**: C and E are not in the secret word. R, A, and N are present but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- From **adorn**: D is not in the secret word. A, O, and R are present but not in positions 1, 3, and 4 respectively. N is confirmed at position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with N (position 5) and includes R, A, O.
2. Letters excluded: C, E, D.
3. Position constraints:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2 or 4.
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
4. The secret word has 4 known distinct letters (R, A, O, N) and one unknown letter (not C, E, D).

Given that N is fixed at position 5, possible word patterns are:
- If R is at position 1, then A and O must occupy positions 2 and 4, with the unknown letter at position 3 (e.g., RAXON).
- If R is at position 3, then A must be at position 2 or 4, and O must fill the remaining spot, with the unknown letter at the open position (e.g., XARON).

Considering valid words:
- **BARON** (B-A-R-O-N) fits most constraints:
  - Position 3 is R (allowed since R avoids positions 2/4).
  - Position 2 is A (allowed position).
  - Position 4 is O (allowed position).
  - Position 5 is N (correct).
  - Uses B (common letter, not excluded).

This tests R at position 3 and A at position 2, both new placements, while introducing B to check if it is the unknown letter.",Guess 3: baron -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(-) O(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,RAYON,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word at all.
R(-) - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
A(-) - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.
N(-) - N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word at all.

So, we know that:
- The secret word contains R, A, and N, but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively (positions in ""crane"": 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
- The secret word does not contain C or E.

Also, note that R, A, N must appear in the word, just in different positions.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that includes R, A, N and avoids C and E. Also, we should try to place R, A, N in positions we haven't tried yet.

Recall the positions of the letters in the first guess:
Position 1: C -> excluded
Position 2: R -> must be moved (since it was marked wrong position)
Position 3: A -> must be moved
Position 4: N -> must be moved
Position 5: E -> excluded

So for the new guess:
- Avoid positions 2, 3, 4 for R, A, N respectively? Actually, we know that R is not at position 2, A not at position 3, N not at position 4. But they could be at other positions.

We have three known letters: R, A, N.

We should try to put these in different positions and also introduce two new letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for R: can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But note position 1 was previously C (excluded) and we don't know what it is. Similarly, position 5 was excluded (E). So R can be in 1, 3, 4? However, position 1 might be a good candidate for R? But note: the feedback didn't prevent R from being in position 1, only that it's not in position 2. Similarly for A: cannot be in position 3, but can be in 1,2,4,5? But position 1 is open? Actually, we don't have information about position 1 except that it isn't C.

But note: we must not use C and E.

We should try a word that has:
- R, A, N at different positions than before.
- And two new letters.

We also want to cover common vowels or consonants. We already have A (a vowel) and R and N (consonants). We might try to include another vowel? The vowels we haven't tested are: I, O, U. Y sometimes.

One common word that comes to mind: ""RAINY"" - but let's check:
- R in position 1: in the first guess R was in position 2 and now we put it at 1. That's allowed because we know it wasn't at 2.
- A in position 2: but in the first guess A was at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, but can it be at position 2? Yes.
- N: in the first guess was at position 4, so we should avoid that? We can put N at a different position, say position 3? But in ""RAINY"": 
  R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Then N is at position 4 again? That was the same position as before? Feedback said N is not at position 4? Then putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect? So avoid.

Alternatively, what about ""RANCH""? But we cannot use C? C is excluded because feedback said C(x). So no.

Another word: ""ROAST""? But has O and S? But then S is new? Also, note that E is excluded so no problem. However, we have A and R: 
R at 1 (new position), O at 2 (new), A at 3? But wait: feedback from first guess said A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, we must not place A at position 3. So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3? Then we shouldn't use that.

Another idea: ""PLAIN""? But let's check:
P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again, A at position 3 is disallowed? So not.

How about ""TRADE""? But E is excluded? Cannot use E.

Another word: ""PARIS""? 
P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, I at 4, S at 5.

This seems better because:
A is at position 2 (not position 3) -> which is a new position.
R is at position 3 (not position 2) -> new position.
N is missing? But we need to include N? Wait, we know the secret word has N? So if we don't include N, we might not get information about N? Actually, we should try to include N because we know it's in the word.

But we have three letters R, A, N to include. So the next guess should ideally include R, A, and N? But we can also consider that we have two more tries and we can use one to narrow down.

But we must avoid C and E.

Another word: ""RANIS""? Not a word.

""NADIR""? 
N at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, R at 5.

Now:
- N is at position 1 (was at 4 before, so avoided position 4)
- A at position 2 (avoided position 3)
- R at position 5 (avoided position 2)

So all three are in new positions. Also, new letters: D and I.

Is ""NADIR"" a valid word? Yes, meaning the lowest point.

Alternatively, we can consider common words. Let's think of words that include R, A, N and two new letters, avoiding positions we know are wrong.

Other options:
""TRAIN"": 
T at 1, R at 2? But R was in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong? So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? Because feedback said R(-) meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. So avoiding position 2 for R. Therefore, ""TRAIN"" has R at position 2 -> avoid.

""GRAIN"": same problem, R at position 2 -> avoid.

""BRAIN"": B at 1, R at 2 -> same issue with R at position 2.

""PRANK"":
P at 1, R at 2? Avoid because R cannot be at position 2.

""CRANK"": no, C is excluded.

How about ""ADORN""? 
A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, R at 4, N at 5.
This seems okay:
- A is at position 1 (avoided position 3)
- R is at position 4 (avoided position 2)
- N is at position 5 (avoided position 4)

New letters: D, O.

So ""ADORN"" is a word. Let's use that.

Another word: ""RADON""? 
R at 1 (avoided position 2), A at 2, D at 3, O at 4, N at 5? Then N is at position 5, which is fine? But we have A at position 2? We don't have information against A at position 2? Because first guess had A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A can be elsewhere? So yes.

But note that we also should consider frequency and covering more common letters.

We can also think: since the secret word has R, A, N, and two other letters which are not C or E.

After considering, I think ""ADORN"" is a reasonable guess.

Thus, I will guess ""ADORN"".

But wait: let me confirm: 
- In ""ADORN"": 
  Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now at position 1 -> okay)
  Position 2: D (new)
  Position 3: O (new)
  Position 4: R (we know R is in the word, now at position 4 -> okay because it wasn't at 2)
  Position 5: N (we know N is in the word, and wasn't at position 4? Now at position 5 -> okay)

Alternatively, to maximize new letters and also test the position of A at a new location, this seems good.

So I'll go with ""adorn"".Based on the feedback from ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- The secret word must contain R, A, and N, so the new guess should include these letters while avoiding C and E.
- Since R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4, the guess ""adorn"" places:
  - A in position 1 (a new position not ruled out),
  - R in position 4 (avoiding position 2),
  - N in position 5 (avoiding position 4),
  - while introducing two new letters: D and O.

This maximizes information gain by testing the known letters in untried positions and adding common unused letters.

<guess>adorn</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: adorn -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This tells us:
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R, A, and N are in the secret word, but:
    - R is not at position 2 (where it was in ""crane"")
    - A is not at position 3
    - N is not at position 4

Guess 2: adorn -> A(-), D(x), O(-), R(-), N(✓)
This tells us:
- D is not in the secret word.
- A, O, R are in the secret word, but:
    - A is not at position 1 (where it was in ""adorn"")
    - O is not at position 3
    - R is not at position 4
- N is in the secret word and at position 5! Because it got a ✓.

Therefore, we know for sure:
- The secret word has N at position 5.
- The secret word contains R, A, O, and N. (N at position 5, and R, A, O are also present.)
- Letters not in the word: C, E, D.

Also, from the positions:
- R is not at position 2 (from crane) and also not at position 4 (from adorn).
- A is not at position 3 (from crane) and also not at position 1 (from adorn).
- O is not at position 3 (from adorn).
- N is fixed at position 5.

Now, the secret word has positions: _ _ _ _ N

We need to place R, A, O, and one more unknown letter? Since we don't know the fifth letter yet.

But we also know from the first guess that there are five distinct letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we haven't seen duplicates yet.

The letters we know must be in the word: R, A, O, N. And since N is in position 5, we have three more positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4? The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the other four? So we have R, A, O, and one additional letter? Because we only have three missing positions? But wait: we know R, A, O, and N are in the word. That's four distinct letters. Therefore, there is one more distinct letter we haven't identified yet.

We have not encountered duplicates in feedback, so I'll assume distinct for now.

We must avoid letters: C, E, D.

Now, possible positions for A, R, O:

- A cannot be at position 1 (from adorn) or position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 4? Because positions are 1,2,3,4 excluding 1 and 3? So A must be at position 2 or 4.

Similarly for R:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from crane) or position 4 (from adorn). Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 3? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4 but excluding 2 and 4? So R must be at position 1 or 3.

For O:
- O is in the word and is not at position 3 (from adorn). So O cannot be at position 3? Then O can be at position 1,2,4? Because position 1 is available? But note, O is a new letter we only tried in position 3.

Now, we need to assign R, A, O to positions 1,2,3,4 without conflict.

Since R is only possible at 1 or 3, and A only at 2 or 4, and O can be at 1,2,4? But note we have only three positions left? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 to be filled with three letters? No: we have to place A, R, O, and one more letter? Wait, there are four positions: 1,2,3,4 to be filled with four letters? But we only have R, A, O? So one more letter we don't know? So four letters: one of which is possibly duplicated? Or we have an additional letter.

But from the feedback of the first guess: crane had five distinct letters, and adorn had five distinct letters? And we have R, A, O, N all distinct? So the fifth letter is missing? And we need to guess it.

Now, we need to form a word ending with N (position 5) and having R, A, O, and one more letter? And avoiding C, E, D.

Possible word patterns:

Let me represent the word as: W1 W2 W3 W4 N

Constraints:
- R must be in W1 or W3.
- A must be in W2 or W4.
- O must not be in W3? Because O was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning that O is in the word but not at that position? So O must be at position 1,2,4? But W4 is position 4? Positions: 1,2,3,4.

Now, let's consider cases:

Case 1: R at position 1 (W1=R). Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at position W2 or W4? But we cannot have two letters at the same position? So if W1=R, then we have:
- W1 = R
- Then A and O can be at positions: W2, W3, W4? But note A cannot be at W3? So A must be at W2 or W4, and O must be somewhere? O cannot be at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? Then we have conflict if both A and O want W2 or W4? But also position W3 must be filled with the fifth letter? Not necessarily? Wait the fifth letter? We have R (at W1), and then we need to place A and O? Plus the fifth letter? So three letters for positions W2, W3, W4? But then A must be at W2 or W4, O must be at W1? Wait no, W1 is taken? O must be at W2 or W4? Then the fifth letter at the remaining position? And W3 is available? But O cannot be at W3? So at W3 we can put the fifth letter? And A and O can be at W2 and W4? But positions: W2 and W4? That leaves W3 for the fifth letter? So if we assign:
  W1 = R
  Then we assign W2 and W4 to A and O? But we don't know which? Then W3 can be the fifth letter? But O cannot be at W3? And we put the fifth letter at W3? That's fine.

Similarly, Case 2: R at position 3 (W3=R). Then:
  W3 = R
  Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at W1, W2, or W4? But O cannot be at W3? Which is taken by R? So that's fine? Then assign A at W2 or W4, O at one of W1, W2 or W4? And the fifth letter at the remaining position.

We need to find words that end with N and contain R, A, O and one variable? Plus the constraints.

We should use a word that has N at the end and includes R, A, O? And positions as above.

But let me list possible words:

First, let's consider if R is at position 1: then the word pattern: R ? ? ? N

With A at either position 2 or 4? And O in the other? And one letter at position 3? And we must avoid C, E, D? And it must be a valid word.

Also, we already know positions that are invalid for A? We know A cannot be in position 3? And also cannot be in position 1? So R at position 1 allows A at position 2 or 4. Similarly? O can be at the other of 2 or 4? Or? Position 2 and 4 are for A and O? Position 3 for the fifth letter? Or A at position 2? O elsewhere? Actually? We have three letters: A, O, and X (the unknown) to fill positions W2, W3, W4? With constraints:
- A at W2 or W4? But not W3?
- O not at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? But we cannot have both A and O trying to be at same position? So we must assign one to W2 and one to W4? Then the fifth letter must be at W3? Because that's the only position left? Yes.

So pattern becomes: R A or O? at w2? and the other at w4? and X at w3? Then word: R X O N? Or R X A N? Or? With specific positions.

Thus, possible words:

Option: R at W1, A at W2, O at W4: then word: R ? A ? N? Wait: no! Positions: W1=R, W2=A? Then W3=X, W4=O? And W5=N? So word: R X O N? But wait: if W4=O, then the word is R X ? O N? Not: R at1, W2=X1, W3=X, W4=O, W5=N? Then pattern: R ? ? O N? But with A? Where is A? We assigned A to W2? Then if W2=A? Then: R A ? O N? So word is R A X O N? Where X is the unknown letter? And O at position 4? That yields: position: 1=R, position2=A, position3=X, position4=O, position5=N? But O is at position4? But note: in adorn, R was at position4 and marked (-), meaning R cannot be at position4? But R isn't here? Now O is at position4? That's fine? We don't have constraints for O at position4? Only that R cannot be there? And similarly, A is at position2? Is that allowed? Previously A was not at position3? We don't have constraint on position2? So yes.

Similarly, if we put O at W2 and A at W4? Then word: R O X A N? Meaning positions: 1=R, 2=O, 3=X, 4=A, 5=N.

Now, we need to look for words that end with N? Pattern possibilities:

Pattern1: R A ? O N? So RA_O N? For example? Known words: RATON? Not valid? RAYON? Y not excluded? But is it a word? Yes.

Pattern2: R O ? A N? So RO_A N? For example? RORAN? No? ROBAN? Not? ROLAN? No? RO? Let me think.

Now, the other case: R at position 3 (W3=R)? Then:
  W3 = R
  Then A must be at W2 or W4?
  O must be at W1 or W2 or W4? But W3 is taken by R? And O cannot be at W3? That's fine? So assignments? How do we assign?

Subcase: A at W2? Then O can be at W1 or W4? And W4 and W1? Then the fifth letter must be at the other? Because we have positions W1, W2, W4? And we need to assign A? Which we put at W2? Then O and the fifth letter at W1 and W4? So:
  W1: O or fifth?
  W2: A
  W3: R
  W4: O or fifth? (alternate)
  W5: N

So if O is at W1? Then fifth at W4? Word: O A R X N? OAR?X N? Like OAR? Not meaningful? OARAN? No? OARIN? No?

If O is at W4? Then word: ? A R X N? But W1 must be the fifth? So word: X A R O N? Or? If O at W4? But we assigned O at W4? Then W1 is fifth? So word: F A R O N? Which is ""faron"" not a word? But ""far on""? Not? Maybe BARON? With B? But valid!

Similarly, subcase: A at W4? Then O can be at W1 or W2? And the fifth letter at the other? So:
  W1: O or fifth?
  W2: O or fifth? 
  W3: R
  W4: A
  W5: N

So if O at W1? Then fifth at W2? Word: O X R A N? Now, OXRAN? Perhaps with X? Like OVRAN? Not? Or OTRAN? Not words? Maybe?

If O at W2? Then fifth at W1? Word: X O R A N? Now, pattern:?ORAN? Like MORAN? Not? But ""moran"" is not common? ""coran""? Not? ""boran""? Not?

So better words seem to come from:
Patterns with R at position1: 
  RA_O N -> RATON? RATON - a rat? But ""raton"" is a word meaning a raccoon-like animal? But accepted? 
  But better: RAYON? RAYON is a fabric? But RAYON has Y? Which is available? Not excluded.

Patterns with R at position3:
  X A R O N? Only real word: BARON? But BARON: B-A-R-O-N? With B? And B is not excluded.

And BARON: positions? Position1=B, Position2=A, Position3=R, Position4=O, Position5=N.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position3? That's allowed? Because we said R must be in position1 or3? And position3 is okay? Previously R was excluded from position2 and4? Position3 is new? Then A? Is at position2? Now, previously: A cannot be at position3? And not at position1? Position2 is allowed? Then O? At position4? And we have no constraint against O at position4? Previously O was only tried at position3? So okay.

Also, BARON avoids C,E,D? B is not excluded? So BARON is a good candidate.

Or other words? Like... what else?

Also consider the first pattern: with R at1? And A at2? O at4? Then word: R A ? O N? Possibilities: R and fifth letter? Fifth letter must be a consonant? And common letters? Letters not used: we have B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? etc? Without C,E,D?

Possible: R?O?N? With second letter A? Then third letter could be T? Then RATON? But is that a valid word? Or PAYON? No? MAYON? No? RAYON? With Y? Third letter Y? RAYON - valid.

RAYON is a word.

But BARON also valid? Which one to choose?

Another word: SALON? But SALON ends in ON? But not? SALON has L at position4? Not O? We need position4=O? For the first pattern? Only if we assign O at position4? But if we have R at1 and O at4? Then SALON doesn't match? Pattern for R at1? RA_O N? So must have A at2 and O at4? So R?A?third?O?N? Then third letter? RATON? RATON is in some dictionaries.

We should prefer BARON because it uses a common letter? And also, BARON allows us to test the position for R? Since we haven't tested position3 for R?

We also need to gain information about the fifth letter.

But we also have another constraint: from the first guess, R was in the word but not position2? So R could be at position1? Or3?

Similarly, A could be at position2 or4? 

In BARON:
- R at position3? Then if we get feedback, it will tell us whether R is at position3? And other placements.

In BARON: structure: B-A-R-O-N

Now, from feedback? We can see:

Also, BARON uses B? Which is a common letter? So we can test B.

Whereas RAYON? Uses Y? Which is less common? And might be good? But BARON seems better? Or are there other words?

Another word: for the other configuration: R O ? A N? Pattern: RO_A N? Words? ROTAN? Not? Or ROPAN? No? ROTAN? Not? Maybe? Not common? RO?AN? Like roman? But roman is ROMAN? With M? But that doesn't fit? ROMAN has O at position2? But we need O at position2? Then if we have R O ? ? N? But we assigned A at position4? So pattern: R O ? A N? Like: R O T A N? But not word? R O M A N? But then N? Then ROMAN? But ROMAN is 5 letters? R-O-M-A-N? Then position5=N? That's good? ROMAN? Let's see:

ROMAN: R at1, O at2, M at3, A at4, N at5.

Now, constraints? 
- R at position1? Allowed? 
- O at position2? But we haven't imposed constraint? But O cannot be at position3? But position2 is fine? 
- A at position4? Previously? A cannot be at position1 (from adorn) and position3 (from crane)? Position4 is new? 
- M is new letter? 

And not containing C,E,D? M is allowed? 

So ROMAN is a valid word? Also?

Now, we have two good words: BARON and ROMAN.

In ROMAN: 
- Position1=R? But R? We are allowed R at position1? How does that fit our case? 
Actually, our case for R at position1: then if A at position4 and O at position2? Then ROMAN: O at position2, A at position4? Then third letter? M? So R O M A N? Yes? Exactly.

Whereas BARON: R at position3? 

But wait? ROMAN: R at position1? And in this case we have O at position2? And A at position4? Which satisfies R at1? Also? Then the fifth letter? M? 

Similarly, BARON has B? 

Now? We need to choose one? 

Also? From previous feedback? We know A is in the word? But not tested at position2? And ROMAN tests A at position4? Whereas BARON tests A at position2? 

But we already tested A at position1? And not at position3? Now? Position2 and position4 are possible? 

To gain more information? We want to test a configuration that differs? 

But BARON? Also? Let me see? We already have N at position5? So for the unknown letter? 

Consider? BARON? would test:
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: R? 
  Position4: O? 
  Position5: N? 

But note? We know A cannot be at position1? So if B is wrong? But not exist? We get x? Or if R is at position3? If correct? We get ✓? 

Similarly? ROMAN? 
  R at1? Which we think might be possible? 
  O at2? 
  M at3? 
  A at4? 
  N at5? 

Now? But in the first guess? crane had R at position2? And got (-) meaning R is not at2? And ROMAN has R at1? If R is at1? Then we get ✓ for R? And A at4? Etc? 

But? We don't know? So both seem valid? 

Perhaps choose ROMAN? Because it tests R at position1? Which hasn't been tested? While BARON tests R at position3? Position3 hasn't been tested either? 

But? Also? ROMAN avoids the letter O at position3? Because in adorn? O was at position3 and got (-)? Meaning O is in the word but not there? So position3 must be something else? In ROMAN? Position3 is M? So that's fine? 

Similarly? In BARON? position3 is R? Which is fine? 

We also need to consider which word is more likely? 

Common words? BARON and ROMAN are both common? 

Or perhaps we can get more letters? 

But? We have only one unknown? And this will be our third guess? So we can guess one of them? 

I'll choose BARON? Because BAR? Letter B is high frequency? And helps us test if B is the fifth letter? 

But ROMAN also tests M? 

Alternatively? Another word: PARON? Not word? Or others? 

Since in BARON? it also assigns A at position2? Which hasn't been tested? Whereas ROMAN assigns A at position4? 

But we don't know which is the case? 

Perhaps BARON? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't fix O and A? But tests possible letters? 

But we want to get the word quickly? 

I think BARON is a good guess? And may be the word? 

But? Let's confirm with the feedback: 

If the word were BARON? Then from the feedback? 

But note? We have feedback from previous: 

The secret word might be? For example? But I think BARON is reasonable? 

Perhaps? Another possibility? With R at1? And A at4? And O at2? Then ROMAN? 

But ROMAN has O at2? So if we guess BARON? 

BARON: letters B,A,R,O,N? 

And we haven't used B? So if the secret word has B? We learn? 

Whereas? If we guess ROMAN? learn about M? 

Both are valid? 

I'll go with BARON? 

But? An important point? In BARON? it has position2=A? But position2 is available? And position4=O? 

Similarly? constraints are satisfied? 

So? Guess BARON? 

Another reason? With the first pattern? If we had R at1 and O at2? But? We don't? ROMAN does? 

So I think BARON is fine? 

We are in the third guess? So we have tries left? 

Do it? Final choice? BARON. 

But? Perhaps consider? From the feedback? We know the secret word must have R, A, O, N? So BARON covers all? But has an extra B? True? But if the secret word has B? Then BARON is the word? Otherwise? We learn about B? 

Similarly? ROMAN covers R,O,M,A,N? With M? 

I think BARON uses more common letters? 

So?Based on the previous feedback:
- From **crane**: C and E are not in the secret word. R, A, and N are present but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- From **adorn**: D is not in the secret word. A, O, and R are present but not in positions 1, 3, and 4 respectively. N is confirmed at position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with N (position 5) and includes R, A, O.
2. Letters excluded: C, E, D.
3. Position constraints:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2 or 4.
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
4. The secret word has 4 known distinct letters (R, A, O, N) and one unknown letter (not C, E, D).

Given that N is fixed at position 5, possible word patterns are:
- If R is at position 1, then A and O must occupy positions 2 and 4, with the unknown letter at position 3 (e.g., RAXON).
- If R is at position 3, then A must be at position 2 or 4, and O must fill the remaining spot, with the unknown letter at the open position (e.g., XARON).

Considering valid words:
- **BARON** (B-A-R-O-N) fits most constraints:
  - Position 3 is R (allowed since R avoids positions 2/4).
  - Position 2 is A (allowed position).
  - Position 4 is O (allowed position).
  - Position 5 is N (correct).
  - Uses B (common letter, not excluded).

This tests R at position 3 and A at position 2, both new placements, while introducing B to check if it is the unknown letter.

We should choose a word that includes R, A, N and avoids C and E. Also, we should try to place R, A, N in positions we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nRecall the positions of the letters in the first guess:\nPosition 1: C -> excluded\nPosition 2: R -> must be moved (since it was marked wrong position)\nPosition 3: A -> must be moved\nPosition 4: N -> must be moved\nPosition 5: E -> excluded\n\nSo for the new guess:\n- Avoid positions 2, 3, 4 for R, A, N respectively? Actually, we know that R is not at position 2, A not at position 3, N not at position 4. But they could be at other positions.\n\nWe have three known letters: R, A, N.\n\nWe should try to put these in different positions and also introduce two new letters to gather more information.\n\nPossible positions for R: can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But note position 1 was previously C (excluded) and we don\'t know what it is. Similarly, position 5 was excluded (E). So R can be in 1, 3, 4? However, position 1 might be a good candidate for R? But note: the feedback didn\'t prevent R from being in position 1, only that it\'s not in position 2. Similarly for A: cannot be in position 3, but can be in 1,2,4,5? But position 1 is open? Actually, we don\'t have information about position 1 except that it isn\'t C.\n\nBut note: we must not use C and E.\n\nWe should try a word that has:\n- R, A, N at different positions than before.\n- And two new letters.\n\nWe also want to cover common vowels or consonants. We already have A (a vowel) and R and N (consonants). We might try to include another vowel? The vowels we haven\'t tested are: I, O, U. Y sometimes.\n\nOne common word that comes to mind: ""RAINY"" - but let\'s check:\n- R in position 1: in the first guess R was in position 2 and now we put it at 1. That\'s allowed because we know it wasn\'t at 2.\n- A in position 2: but in the first guess A was at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, but can it be at position 2? Yes.\n- N: in the first guess was at position 4, so we should avoid that? We can put N at a different position, say position 3? But in ""RAINY"": \n  R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Then N is at position 4 again? That was the same position as before? Feedback said N is not at position 4? Then putting N at position 4 again would be incorrect? So avoid.\n\nAlternatively, what about ""RANCH""? But we cannot use C? C is excluded because feedback said C(x). So no.\n\nAnother word: ""ROAST""? But has O and S? But then S is new? Also, note that E is excluded so no problem. However, we have A and R: \nR at 1 (new position), O at 2 (new), A at 3? But wait: feedback from first guess said A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, we must not place A at position 3. So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3? Then we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLAIN""? But let\'s check:\nP at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again, A at position 3 is disallowed? So not.\n\nHow about ""TRADE""? But E is excluded? Cannot use E.\n\nAnother word: ""PARIS""? \nP at 1, A at 2, R at 3, I at 4, S at 5.\n\nThis seems better because:\nA is at position 2 (not position 3) -> which is a new position.\nR is at position 3 (not position 2) -> new position.\nN is missing? But we need to include N? Wait, we know the secret word has N? So if we don\'t include N, we might not get information about N? Actually, we should try to include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nBut we have three letters R, A, N to include. So the next guess should ideally include R, A, and N? But we can also consider that we have two more tries and we can use one to narrow down.\n\nBut we must avoid C and E.\n\nAnother word: ""RANIS""? Not a word.\n\n""NADIR""? \nN at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, R at 5.\n\nNow:\n- N is at position 1 (was at 4 before, so avoided position 4)\n- A at position 2 (avoided position 3)\n- R at position 5 (avoided position 2)\n\nSo all three are in new positions. Also, new letters: D and I.\n\nIs ""NADIR"" a valid word? Yes, meaning the lowest point.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider common words. Let\'s think of words that include R, A, N and two new letters, avoiding positions we know are wrong.\n\nOther options:\n""TRAIN"": \nT at 1, R at 2? But R was in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong? So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? Because feedback said R(-) meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 2. So avoiding position 2 for R. Therefore, ""TRAIN"" has R at position 2 -> avoid.\n\n""GRAIN"": same problem, R at position 2 -> avoid.\n\n""BRAIN"": B at 1, R at 2 -> same issue with R at position 2.\n\n""PRANK"":\nP at 1, R at 2? Avoid because R cannot be at position 2.\n\n""CRANK"": no, C is excluded.\n\nHow about ""ADORN""? \nA at 1, D at 2, O at 3, R at 4, N at 5.\nThis seems okay:\n- A is at position 1 (avoided position 3)\n- R is at position 4 (avoided position 2)\n- N is at position 5 (avoided position 4)\n\nNew letters: D, O.\n\nSo ""ADORN"" is a word. Let\'s use that.\n\nAnother word: ""RADON""? \nR at 1 (avoided position 2), A at 2, D at 3, O at 4, N at 5? Then N is at position 5, which is fine? But we have A at position 2? We don\'t have information against A at position 2? Because first guess had A at position 3 and it was wrong, so A can be elsewhere? So yes.\n\nBut note that we also should consider frequency and covering more common letters.\n\nWe can also think: since the secret word has R, A, N, and two other letters which are not C or E.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""ADORN"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nThus, I will guess ""ADORN"".\n\nBut wait: let me confirm: \n- In ""ADORN"": \n  Position 1: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now at position 1 -> okay)\n  Position 2: D (new)\n  Position 3: O (new)\n  Position 4: R (we know R is in the word, now at position 4 -> okay because it wasn\'t at 2)\n  Position 5: N (we know N is in the word, and wasn\'t at position 4? Now at position 5 -> okay)\n\nAlternatively, to maximize new letters and also test the position of A at a new location, this seems good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""adorn"".Based on the feedback from ""crane"":\n- C and E are not in the secret word.\n- R, A, and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n- The secret word must contain R, A, and N, so the new guess should include these letters while avoiding C and E.\n- Since R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4, the guess ""adorn"" places:\n  - A in position 1 (a new position not ruled out),\n  - R in position 4 (avoiding position 2),\n  - N in position 5 (avoiding position 4),\n  - while introducing two new letters: D and O.\n\nThis maximizes information gain by testing the known letters in untried positions and adding common unused letters.\n\n<guess>adorn</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: adorn -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(-), E(x)\nThis tells us:\n- C and E are not in the secret word.\n- R, A, and N are in the secret word, but:\n    - R is not at position 2 (where it was in ""crane"")\n    - A is not at position 3\n    - N is not at position 4\n\nGuess 2: adorn -> A(-), D(x), O(-), R(-), N(✓)\nThis tells us:\n- D is not in the secret word.\n- A, O, R are in the secret word, but:\n    - A is not at position 1 (where it was in ""adorn"")\n    - O is not at position 3\n    - R is not at position 4\n- N is in the secret word and at position 5! Because it got a ✓.\n\nTherefore, we know for sure:\n- The secret word has N at position 5.\n- The secret word contains R, A, O, and N. (N at position 5, and R, A, O are also present.)\n- Letters not in the word: C, E, D.\n\nAlso, from the positions:\n- R is not at position 2 (from crane) and also not at position 4 (from adorn).\n- A is not at position 3 (from crane) and also not at position 1 (from adorn).\n- O is not at position 3 (from adorn).\n- N is fixed at position 5.\n\nNow, the secret word has positions: _ _ _ _ N\n\nWe need to place R, A, O, and one more unknown letter? Since we don\'t know the fifth letter yet.\n\nBut we also know from the first guess that there are five distinct letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we haven\'t seen duplicates yet.\n\nThe letters we know must be in the word: R, A, O, N. And since N is in position 5, we have three more positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4? The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the other four? So we have R, A, O, and one additional letter? Because we only have three missing positions? But wait: we know R, A, O, and N are in the word. That\'s four distinct letters. Therefore, there is one more distinct letter we haven\'t identified yet.\n\nWe have not encountered duplicates in feedback, so I\'ll assume distinct for now.\n\nWe must avoid letters: C, E, D.\n\nNow, possible positions for A, R, O:\n\n- A cannot be at position 1 (from adorn) or position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 4? Because positions are 1,2,3,4 excluding 1 and 3? So A must be at position 2 or 4.\n\nSimilarly for R:\n- R cannot be at position 2 (from crane) or position 4 (from adorn). Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 3? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4 but excluding 2 and 4? So R must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nFor O:\n- O is in the word and is not at position 3 (from adorn). So O cannot be at position 3? Then O can be at position 1,2,4? Because position 1 is available? But note, O is a new letter we only tried in position 3.\n\nNow, we need to assign R, A, O to positions 1,2,3,4 without conflict.\n\nSince R is only possible at 1 or 3, and A only at 2 or 4, and O can be at 1,2,4? But note we have only three positions left? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 to be filled with three letters? No: we have to place A, R, O, and one more letter? Wait, there are four positions: 1,2,3,4 to be filled with four letters? But we only have R, A, O? So one more letter we don\'t know? So four letters: one of which is possibly duplicated? Or we have an additional letter.\n\nBut from the feedback of the first guess: crane had five distinct letters, and adorn had five distinct letters? And we have R, A, O, N all distinct? So the fifth letter is missing? And we need to guess it.\n\nNow, we need to form a word ending with N (position 5) and having R, A, O, and one more letter? And avoiding C, E, D.\n\nPossible word patterns:\n\nLet me represent the word as: W1 W2 W3 W4 N\n\nConstraints:\n- R must be in W1 or W3.\n- A must be in W2 or W4.\n- O must not be in W3? Because O was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning that O is in the word but not at that position? So O must be at position 1,2,4? But W4 is position 4? Positions: 1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, let\'s consider cases:\n\nCase 1: R at position 1 (W1=R). Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at position W2 or W4? But we cannot have two letters at the same position? So if W1=R, then we have:\n- W1 = R\n- Then A and O can be at positions: W2, W3, W4? But note A cannot be at W3? So A must be at W2 or W4, and O must be somewhere? O cannot be at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? Then we have conflict if both A and O want W2 or W4? But also position W3 must be filled with the fifth letter? Not necessarily? Wait the fifth letter? We have R (at W1), and then we need to place A and O? Plus the fifth letter? So three letters for positions W2, W3, W4? But then A must be at W2 or W4, O must be at W1? Wait no, W1 is taken? O must be at W2 or W4? Then the fifth letter at the remaining position? And W3 is available? But O cannot be at W3? So at W3 we can put the fifth letter? And A and O can be at W2 and W4? But positions: W2 and W4? That leaves W3 for the fifth letter? So if we assign:\n  W1 = R\n  Then we assign W2 and W4 to A and O? But we don\'t know which? Then W3 can be the fifth letter? But O cannot be at W3? And we put the fifth letter at W3? That\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: R at position 3 (W3=R). Then:\n  W3 = R\n  Then A must be at W2 or W4? And O must be at W1, W2, or W4? But O cannot be at W3? Which is taken by R? So that\'s fine? Then assign A at W2 or W4, O at one of W1, W2 or W4? And the fifth letter at the remaining position.\n\nWe need to find words that end with N and contain R, A, O and one variable? Plus the constraints.\n\nWe should use a word that has N at the end and includes R, A, O? And positions as above.\n\nBut let me list possible words:\n\nFirst, let\'s consider if R is at position 1: then the word pattern: R ? ? ? N\n\nWith A at either position 2 or 4? And O in the other? And one letter at position 3? And we must avoid C, E, D? And it must be a valid word.\n\nAlso, we already know positions that are invalid for A? We know A cannot be in position 3? And also cannot be in position 1? So R at position 1 allows A at position 2 or 4. Similarly? O can be at the other of 2 or 4? Or? Position 2 and 4 are for A and O? Position 3 for the fifth letter? Or A at position 2? O elsewhere? Actually? We have three letters: A, O, and X (the unknown) to fill positions W2, W3, W4? With constraints:\n- A at W2 or W4? But not W3?\n- O not at W3? So O can be at W2 or W4? But we cannot have both A and O trying to be at same position? So we must assign one to W2 and one to W4? Then the fifth letter must be at W3? Because that\'s the only position left? Yes.\n\nSo pattern becomes: R A or O? at w2? and the other at w4? and X at w3? Then word: R X O N? Or R X A N? Or? With specific positions.\n\nThus, possible words:\n\nOption: R at W1, A at W2, O at W4: then word: R ? A ? N? Wait: no! Positions: W1=R, W2=A? Then W3=X, W4=O? And W5=N? So word: R X O N? But wait: if W4=O, then the word is R X ? O N? Not: R at1, W2=X1, W3=X, W4=O, W5=N? Then pattern: R ? ? O N? But with A? Where is A? We assigned A to W2? Then if W2=A? Then: R A ? O N? So word is R A X O N? Where X is the unknown letter? And O at position 4? That yields: position: 1=R, position2=A, position3=X, position4=O, position5=N? But O is at position4? But note: in adorn, R was at position4 and marked (-), meaning R cannot be at position4? But R isn\'t here? Now O is at position4? That\'s fine? We don\'t have constraints for O at position4? Only that R cannot be there? And similarly, A is at position2? Is that allowed? Previously A was not at position3? We don\'t have constraint on position2? So yes.\n\nSimilarly, if we put O at W2 and A at W4? Then word: R O X A N? Meaning positions: 1=R, 2=O, 3=X, 4=A, 5=N.\n\nNow, we need to look for words that end with N? Pattern possibilities:\n\nPattern1: R A ? O N? So RA_O N? For example? Known words: RATON? Not valid? RAYON? Y not excluded? But is it a word? Yes.\n\nPattern2: R O ? A N? So RO_A N? For example? RORAN? No? ROBAN? Not? ROLAN? No? RO? Let me think.\n\nNow, the other case: R at position 3 (W3=R)? Then:\n  W3 = R\n  Then A must be at W2 or W4?\n  O must be at W1 or W2 or W4? But W3 is taken by R? And O cannot be at W3? That\'s fine? So assignments? How do we assign?\n\nSubcase: A at W2? Then O can be at W1 or W4? And W4 and W1? Then the fifth letter must be at the other? Because we have positions W1, W2, W4? And we need to assign A? Which we put at W2? Then O and the fifth letter at W1 and W4? So:\n  W1: O or fifth?\n  W2: A\n  W3: R\n  W4: O or fifth? (alternate)\n  W5: N\n\nSo if O is at W1? Then fifth at W4? Word: O A R X N? OAR?X N? Like OAR? Not meaningful? OARAN? No? OARIN? No?\n\nIf O is at W4? Then word: ? A R X N? But W1 must be the fifth? So word: X A R O N? Or? If O at W4? But we assigned O at W4? Then W1 is fifth? So word: F A R O N? Which is ""faron"" not a word? But ""far on""? Not? Maybe BARON? With B? But valid!\n\nSimilarly, subcase: A at W4? Then O can be at W1 or W2? And the fifth letter at the other? So:\n  W1: O or fifth?\n  W2: O or fifth? \n  W3: R\n  W4: A\n  W5: N\n\nSo if O at W1? Then fifth at W2? Word: O X R A N? Now, OXRAN? Perhaps with X? Like OVRAN? Not? Or OTRAN? Not words? Maybe?\n\nIf O at W2? Then fifth at W1? Word: X O R A N? Now, pattern:?ORAN? Like MORAN? Not? But ""moran"" is not common? ""coran""? Not? ""boran""? Not?\n\nSo better words seem to come from:\nPatterns with R at position1: \n  RA_O N -> RATON? RATON - a rat? But ""raton"" is a word meaning a raccoon-like animal? But accepted? \n  But better: RAYON? RAYON is a fabric? But RAYON has Y? Which is available? Not excluded.\n\nPatterns with R at position3:\n  X A R O N? Only real word: BARON? But BARON: B-A-R-O-N? With B? And B is not excluded.\n\nAnd BARON: positions? Position1=B, Position2=A, Position3=R, Position4=O, Position5=N.\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- R is at position3? That\'s allowed? Because we said R must be in position1 or3? And position3 is okay? Previously R was excluded from position2 and4? Position3 is new? Then A? Is at position2? Now, previously: A cannot be at position3? And not at position1? Position2 is allowed? Then O? At position4? And we have no constraint against O at position4? Previously O was only tried at position3? So okay.\n\nAlso, BARON avoids C,E,D? B is not excluded? So BARON is a good candidate.\n\nOr other words? Like... what else?\n\nAlso consider the first pattern: with R at1? And A at2? O at4? Then word: R A ? O N? Possibilities: R and fifth letter? Fifth letter must be a consonant? And common letters? Letters not used: we have B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? etc? Without C,E,D?\n\nPossible: R?O?N? With second letter A? Then third letter could be T? Then RATON? But is that a valid word? Or PAYON? No? MAYON? No? RAYON? With Y? Third letter Y? RAYON - valid.\n\nRAYON is a word.\n\nBut BARON also valid? Which one to choose?\n\nAnother word: SALON? But SALON ends in ON? But not? SALON has L at position4? Not O? We need position4=O? For the first pattern? Only if we assign O at position4? But if we have R at1 and O at4? Then SALON doesn\'t match? Pattern for R at1? RA_O N? So must have A at2 and O at4? So R?A?third?O?N? Then third letter? RATON? RATON is in some dictionaries.\n\nWe should prefer BARON because it uses a common letter? And also, BARON allows us to test the position for R? Since we haven\'t tested position3 for R?\n\nWe also need to gain information about the fifth letter.\n\nBut we also have another constraint: from the first guess, R was in the word but not position2? So R could be at position1? Or3?\n\nSimilarly, A could be at position2 or4? \n\nIn BARON:\n- R at position3? Then if we get feedback, it will tell us whether R is at position3? And other placements.\n\nIn BARON: structure: B-A-R-O-N\n\nNow, from feedback? We can see:\n\nAlso, BARON uses B? Which is a common letter? So we can test B.\n\nWhereas RAYON? Uses Y? Which is less common? And might be good? But BARON seems better? Or are there other words?\n\nAnother word: for the other configuration: R O ? A N? Pattern: RO_A N? Words? ROTAN? Not? Or ROPAN? No? ROTAN? Not? Maybe? Not common? RO?AN? Like roman? But roman is ROMAN? With M? But that doesn\'t fit? ROMAN has O at position2? But we need O at position2? Then if we have R O ? ? N? But we assigned A at position4? So pattern: R O ? A N? Like: R O T A N? But not word? R O M A N? But then N? Then ROMAN? But ROMAN is 5 letters? R-O-M-A-N? Then position5=N? That\'s good? ROMAN? Let\'s see:\n\nROMAN: R at1, O at2, M at3, A at4, N at5.\n\nNow, constraints? \n- R at position1? Allowed? \n- O at position2? But we haven\'t imposed constraint? But O cannot be at position3? But position2 is fine? \n- A at position4? Previously? A cannot be at position1 (from adorn) and position3 (from crane)? Position4 is new? \n- M is new letter? \n\nAnd not containing C,E,D? M is allowed? \n\nSo ROMAN is a valid word? Also?\n\nNow, we have two good words: BARON and ROMAN.\n\nIn ROMAN: \n- Position1=R? But R? We are allowed R at position1? How does that fit our case? \nActually, our case for R at position1: then if A at position4 and O at position2? Then ROMAN: O at position2, A at position4? Then third letter? M? So R O M A N? Yes? Exactly.\n\nWhereas BARON: R at position3? \n\nBut wait? ROMAN: R at position1? And in this case we have O at position2? And A at position4? Which satisfies R at1? Also? Then the fifth letter? M? \n\nSimilarly, BARON has B? \n\nNow? We need to choose one? \n\nAlso? From previous feedback? We know A is in the word? But not tested at position2? And ROMAN tests A at position4? Whereas BARON tests A at position2? \n\nBut we already tested A at position1? And not at position3? Now? Position2 and position4 are possible? \n\nTo gain more information? We want to test a configuration that differs? \n\nBut BARON? Also? Let me see? We already have N at position5? So for the unknown letter? \n\nConsider? BARON? would test:\n  Position1: B? \n  Position2: A? \n  Position3: R? \n  Position4: O? \n  Position5: N? \n\nBut note? We know A cannot be at position1? So if B is wrong? But not exist? We get x? Or if R is at position3? If correct? We get ✓? \n\nSimilarly? ROMAN? \n  R at1? Which we think might be possible? \n  O at2? \n  M at3? \n  A at4? \n  N at5? \n\nNow? But in the first guess? crane had R at position2? And got (-) meaning R is not at2? And ROMAN has R at1? If R is at1? Then we get ✓ for R? And A at4? Etc? \n\nBut? We don\'t know? So both seem valid? \n\nPerhaps choose ROMAN? Because it tests R at position1? Which hasn\'t been tested? While BARON tests R at position3? Position3 hasn\'t been tested either? \n\nBut? Also? ROMAN avoids the letter O at position3? Because in adorn? O was at position3 and got (-)? Meaning O is in the word but not there? So position3 must be something else? In ROMAN? Position3 is M? So that\'s fine? \n\nSimilarly? In BARON? position3 is R? Which is fine? \n\nWe also need to consider which word is more likely? \n\nCommon words? BARON and ROMAN are both common? \n\nOr perhaps we can get more letters? \n\nBut? We have only one unknown? And this will be our third guess? So we can guess one of them? \n\nI\'ll choose BARON? Because BAR? Letter B is high frequency? And helps us test if B is the fifth letter? \n\nBut ROMAN also tests M? \n\nAlternatively? Another word: PARON? Not word? Or others? \n\nSince in BARON? it also assigns A at position2? Which hasn\'t been tested? Whereas ROMAN assigns A at position4? \n\nBut we don\'t know which is the case? \n\nPerhaps BARON? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that doesn\'t fix O and A? But tests possible letters? \n\nBut we want to get the word quickly? \n\nI think BARON is a good guess? And may be the word? \n\nBut? Let\'s confirm with the feedback: \n\nIf the word were BARON? Then from the feedback? \n\nBut note? We have feedback from previous: \n\nThe secret word might be? For example? But I think BARON is reasonable? \n\nPerhaps? Another possibility? With R at1? And A at4? And O at2? Then ROMAN? \n\nBut ROMAN has O at2? So if we guess BARON? \n\nBARON: letters B,A,R,O,N? \n\nAnd we haven\'t used B? So if the secret word has B? We learn? \n\nWhereas? If we guess ROMAN? learn about M? \n\nBoth are valid? \n\nI\'ll go with BARON? \n\nBut? An important point? In BARON? it has position2=A? But position2 is available? And position4=O? \n\nSimilarly? constraints are satisfied? \n\nSo? Guess BARON? \n\nAnother reason? With the first pattern? If we had R at1 and O at2? But? We don\'t? ROMAN does? \n\nSo I think BARON is fine? \n\nWe are in the third guess? So we have tries left? \n\nDo it? Final choice? BARON. \n\nBut? Perhaps consider? From the feedback? We know the secret word must have R, A, O, N? So BARON covers all? But has an extra B? True? But if the secret word has B? Then BARON is the word? Otherwise? We learn about B? \n\nSimilarly? ROMAN covers R,O,M,A,N? With M? \n\nI think BARON uses more common letters? \n\nSo?Based on the previous feedback:\n- From **crane**: C and E are not in the secret word. R, A, and N are present but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n- From **adorn**: D is not in the secret word. A, O, and R are present but not in positions 1, 3, and 4 respectively. N is confirmed at position 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The secret word ends with N (position 5) and includes R, A, O.\n2. Letters excluded: C, E, D.\n3. Position constraints:\n   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2 or 4.\n   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in position 1 or 3.\n   - O cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n4. The secret word has 4 known distinct letters (R, A, O, N) and one unknown letter (not C, E, D).\n\nGiven that N is fixed at position 5, possible word patterns are:\n- If R is at position 1, then A and O must occupy positions 2 and 4, with the unknown letter at position 3 (e.g., RAXON).\n- If R is at position 3, then A must be at position 2 or 4, and O must fill the remaining spot, with the unknown letter at the open position (e.g., XARON).\n\nConsidering valid words:\n- **BARON** (B-A-R-O-N) fits most constraints:\n  - Position 3 is R (allowed since R avoids positions 2/4).\n  - Position 2 is A (allowed position).\n  - Position 4 is O (allowed position).\n  - Position 5 is N (correct).\n  - Uses B (common letter, not excluded).\n\nThis tests R at position 3 and A at position 2, both new placements, while introducing B to check if it is the unknown letter.\n\n<guess>baron</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: adorn -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(✓)\nGuess 3: baron -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(-) O(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)
- C and E are not in the word.
- R, A, N are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Guess 2: ""adorn"" -> A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(✓)
- D is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 1.
- O is in the word but not at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at position 4.
- N is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

Guess 3: ""baron"" -> B(x) A(✓) R(-) O(✓) N(✓)
- B is not in the word.
- A is in the word and at position 2 (correct).
- R is in the word but not at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and got ""-"").
- O is in the word and at position 4 (correct).
- N is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the following correct letters in these positions:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: O
   - Position 5: N

2. The secret word also contains R, but it is not in position 3 (from baron) and not in position 2 (from crane) or 4 (from adorn). Since positions 2, 4, and 5 are taken, and position 1 and 3 are left, but R cannot be at position 3 (from baron feedback), so R must be at position 1.

   Positions:
   - Position 1: ? (must be R, because R is in the word and the only position left is 1, and it can be there)
   - Position 2: A (correct)
   - Position 3: ? (must be the remaining letter, but we know R is not at 3, so it must be a new letter)
   - Position 4: O (correct)
   - Position 5: N (correct)

   But wait: we have R to place. The only positions available are 1 and 3. But from baron, R was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning R is not at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 1.

   So position 1 must be R.

3. Therefore, the word so far is: R A ? O N

4. We know the word contains R (at position 1), A (at 2), O (at 4), N (at 5), and one more letter at position 3.

5. Excluded letters: C, E, D, B (from the feedback).

6. We need to find a 5-letter word of the form R A ? O N, where the third letter is not C, E, D, or B, and it must be a valid English word.

Now, what are the possibilities for the third letter? We need to find a letter X such that ""RAXON"" is a word.

Common words:
- ""RAXON"" is not a word, but we can think of words like:
  - ""RAYON"" (a synthetic fiber) -> R A Y O N
  - ""RATON"" (a small animal, like a raccoon) -> R A T O N

But we must check if the letters are allowed. We haven't excluded Y or T.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as not at 4 (but now we know it's at 5, so that's consistent). And in the second guess, we had A at position 1 and it was marked as not there (so position 1 must be R, which we have).

Now, we need to consider if there are other constraints. For example, we know that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as not there. But in this word, A is at position 2, which is fine. Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have it at position 1.

So the word must be either ""RAYON"" or ""RATON"" or similar.

But let's see if there are more words? Other possibilities? Like ""RACON""? But C is excluded. ""RAVEN""? But E is excluded and V is not at position 3? But ""RAVEN"" has E and is excluded. ""RABON""? Not a word. ""RAGON""? Not. ""RAMON""? But ""RAMON"" is a name? But we need a common word? And in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? So probably not. ""RAPON""? Not. ""RASON""? Not. ""RAVON""? Not. ""RAWON""? Not.

So the common words are ""RAYON"" and ""RATON"". But ""RATON"" is less common? And ""RAYON"" is more common.

But we must choose one. We have two possibilities? But we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have two more guesses? But we want to get it in this guess.

But note: we don't have any feedback about the third letter. So we need to guess one.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes possible letters to test? But we have only one position unknown? And we know the other four? So if we guess a word that has the form R A ? O N, and we choose a letter, we might get it.

But we have two common possibilities: Y and T? So if we guess ""RAYON"", and it's wrong, then we know it must be ""RATON"" for the next guess? But we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have two more? But let's see the rules: we have 6 tries. We've used 3, so we have 3 left? But we are making the fourth now.

But to be safe, we might choose a word that can test multiple possibilities? But it's difficult because we have fixed positions for the other letters.

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints we missed?

In the first guess, we had ""crane"": R was at position 2 and marked as not there? But now we have R at position 1? That's fine.

In the second guess, ""adorn"": R was at position 4 and marked as not there? Now we have O at position 4? That's fine.

In the third guess, ""baron"": R was at position 3 and marked as not there? So position 3 cannot be R? Which we already used to put R at position 1.

So the only unknown is the letter at position 3.

Now, we can list possible letters for position 3: any letter except C, E, D, B, and the ones we know? But we know A, R, O, N? So the letter must be different? And form a word.

Possible words:
- R A T O N -> ""raton"" (a small animal, also called a coati or similar)
- R A Y O N -> ""rayon"" (a fabric)
- R A G O N? Not a word.
- R A M O N? Not common, and might be a name.
- R A P O N? Not.
- R A S O N? Not.
- R A V O N? Not.
- R A W O N? Not.

So only two real possibilities: T or Y.

We can choose one? Since ""rayon"" is more common, we can try that.

But note: in the context of Wordle, both are acceptable? But we need to pick one.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has both T and Y? But we have only one position? So we cannot.

We must choose one.

I think ""RAYON"" is a good guess.

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if it were ""RAYON"":

- Position 1: R? We know it should be R? But we are guessing R at position 1? And it is correct? So ✓.
- Position 2: A? Correct? ✓.
- Position 3: Y? If the word is ""RAYON"", then Y is correct? But if the word is ""RATON"", then Y is wrong? And we get x? But we don't know? 
But in the feedback, we will get:
  - If the word is ""RAYON"": R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) O(✓) N(✓) -> all correct.
  - If the word is ""RATON"": then R(✓) A(✓) Y(x) O(✓) N(✓) -> but Y is not in the word? Because ""RATON"" has T? So Y would be marked as x? And then we know it must be T? And we can guess ""RATON"" next.

But we have two more guesses? So it's safe.

But we can also consider: is there a word that uses a different letter? For example, ""RAVEN"" is excluded because of E. ""RAINY"" is not the pattern? Because we need O at position 4? ""RAINY"" has I and Y? Not O.

So I think ""RAYON"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""RAYON"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
     - C and E are **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
     - R, A, N are in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, or 4 (marked ""-"").
   - **Guess 2 (adorn)**:
     - D is **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
     - A is in the word but **not** in position 1 (marked ""-"").
     - O is in the word but **not** in position 3 (marked ""-"").
     - R is in the word but **not** in position 4 (marked ""-"").
     - N is **correct** at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
   - **Guess 3 (baron)**:
     - B is **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
     - A is **correct** at position 2 (marked ""✓"").
     - R is in the word but **not** in position 3 (marked ""-"").
     - O is **correct** at position 4 (marked ""✓"").
     - N is **correct** at position 5 (marked ""✓"").

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: A (confirmed correct in baron).
     - Position 4: O (confirmed correct in baron).
     - Position 5: N (confirmed correct in adorn and baron).
   - **R's Position**:
     - R cannot be in positions 2 (from crane), 3 (from baron), or 4 (from adorn). The only remaining position is 1. Thus, R **must** be at position 1.
   - **Word Structure**:
     - The word is now: **R A ? O N** (position 3 is the only unknown).
   - **Excluded Letters**:
     - C, E, D, B are confirmed absent (from feedback).
   - **Unknown Letter at Position 3**:
     - Must be a letter not excluded (not C, E, D, B) and form a valid English word with ""R A _ O N"".
     - Common possibilities: 
       - **RAYON** (a synthetic fiber) → Uses ""Y"".
       - **RATON** (a small animal like a raccoon) → Uses ""T"".
     - Both are valid 5-letter words. ""RAYON"" is more common, so it is prioritized for this guess.

3. **Why RAYON?**:
   - Tests ""Y"" at position 3, which is a plausible letter (not excluded).
   - If correct, it solves the word. If incorrect (e.g., if the word is ""RATON""), the feedback will confirm ""Y"" is absent, and ""T"" can be used in the next guess (we have 2 tries left).
   - Fits all constraints:
     - Position 1: R (deduced as correct).
     - Position 2: A (confirmed).
     - Position 3: Y (to test).
     - Position 4: O (confirmed).
     - Position 5: N (confirmed).

<guess>rayon</guess>",rayon,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)
- C and E are not in the word.
- R, A, N are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Guess 2: ""adorn"" -> A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(✓)
- D is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 1.
- O is in the word but not at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at position 4.
- N is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

Guess 3: ""baron"" -> B(x) A(✓) R(-) O(✓) N(✓)
- B is not in the word.
- A is in the word and at position 2 (correct).
- R is in the word but not at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and got ""-"").
- O is in the word and at position 4 (correct).
- N is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the following correct letters in these positions:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: O
   - Position 5: N

2. The secret word also contains R, but it is not in position 3 (from baron) and not in position 2 (from crane) or 4 (from adorn). Since positions 2, 4, and 5 are taken, and position 1 and 3 are left, but R cannot be at position 3 (from baron feedback), so R must be at position 1.

   Positions:
   - Position 1: ? (must be R, because R is in the word and the only position left is 1, and it can be there)
   - Position 2: A (correct)
   - Position 3: ? (must be the remaining letter, but we know R is not at 3, so it must be a new letter)
   - Position 4: O (correct)
   - Position 5: N (correct)

   But wait: we have R to place. The only positions available are 1 and 3. But from baron, R was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning R is not at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 1.

   So position 1 must be R.

3. Therefore, the word so far is: R A ? O N

4. We know the word contains R (at position 1), A (at 2), O (at 4), N (at 5), and one more letter at position 3.

5. Excluded letters: C, E, D, B (from the feedback).

6. We need to find a 5-letter word of the form R A ? O N, where the third letter is not C, E, D, or B, and it must be a valid English word.

Now, what are the possibilities for the third letter? We need to find a letter X such that ""RAXON"" is a word.

Common words:
- ""RAXON"" is not a word, but we can think of words like:
  - ""RAYON"" (a synthetic fiber) -> R A Y O N
  - ""RATON"" (a small animal, like a raccoon) -> R A T O N

But we must check if the letters are allowed. We haven't excluded Y or T.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as not at 4 (but now we know it's at 5, so that's consistent). And in the second guess, we had A at position 1 and it was marked as not there (so position 1 must be R, which we have).

Now, we need to consider if there are other constraints. For example, we know that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as not there. But in this word, A is at position 2, which is fine. Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have it at position 1.

So the word must be either ""RAYON"" or ""RATON"" or similar.

But let's see if there are more words? Other possibilities? Like ""RACON""? But C is excluded. ""RAVEN""? But E is excluded and V is not at position 3? But ""RAVEN"" has E and is excluded. ""RABON""? Not a word. ""RAGON""? Not. ""RAMON""? But ""RAMON"" is a name? But we need a common word? And in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? So probably not. ""RAPON""? Not. ""RASON""? Not. ""RAVON""? Not. ""RAWON""? Not.

So the common words are ""RAYON"" and ""RATON"". But ""RATON"" is less common? And ""RAYON"" is more common.

But we must choose one. We have two possibilities? But we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have two more guesses? But we want to get it in this guess.

But note: we don't have any feedback about the third letter. So we need to guess one.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes possible letters to test? But we have only one position unknown? And we know the other four? So if we guess a word that has the form R A ? O N, and we choose a letter, we might get it.

But we have two common possibilities: Y and T? So if we guess ""RAYON"", and it's wrong, then we know it must be ""RATON"" for the next guess? But we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have two more? But let's see the rules: we have 6 tries. We've used 3, so we have 3 left? But we are making the fourth now.

But to be safe, we might choose a word that can test multiple possibilities? But it's difficult because we have fixed positions for the other letters.

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints we missed?

In the first guess, we had ""crane"": R was at position 2 and marked as not there? But now we have R at position 1? That's fine.

In the second guess, ""adorn"": R was at position 4 and marked as not there? Now we have O at position 4? That's fine.

In the third guess, ""baron"": R was at position 3 and marked as not there? So position 3 cannot be R? Which we already used to put R at position 1.

So the only unknown is the letter at position 3.

Now, we can list possible letters for position 3: any letter except C, E, D, B, and the ones we know? But we know A, R, O, N? So the letter must be different? And form a word.

Possible words:
- R A T O N -> ""raton"" (a small animal, also called a coati or similar)
- R A Y O N -> ""rayon"" (a fabric)
- R A G O N? Not a word.
- R A M O N? Not common, and might be a name.
- R A P O N? Not.
- R A S O N? Not.
- R A V O N? Not.
- R A W O N? Not.

So only two real possibilities: T or Y.

We can choose one? Since ""rayon"" is more common, we can try that.

But note: in the context of Wordle, both are acceptable? But we need to pick one.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has both T and Y? But we have only one position? So we cannot.

We must choose one.

I think ""RAYON"" is a good guess.

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if it were ""RAYON"":

- Position 1: R? We know it should be R? But we are guessing R at position 1? And it is correct? So ✓.
- Position 2: A? Correct? ✓.
- Position 3: Y? If the word is ""RAYON"", then Y is correct? But if the word is ""RATON"", then Y is wrong? And we get x? But we don't know? 
But in the feedback, we will get:
  - If the word is ""RAYON"": R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) O(✓) N(✓) -> all correct.
  - If the word is ""RATON"": then R(✓) A(✓) Y(x) O(✓) N(✓) -> but Y is not in the word? Because ""RATON"" has T? So Y would be marked as x? And then we know it must be T? And we can guess ""RATON"" next.

But we have two more guesses? So it's safe.

But we can also consider: is there a word that uses a different letter? For example, ""RAVEN"" is excluded because of E. ""RAINY"" is not the pattern? Because we need O at position 4? ""RAINY"" has I and Y? Not O.

So I think ""RAYON"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""RAYON"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
     - C and E are **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
     - R, A, N are in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, or 4 (marked ""-"").
   - **Guess 2 (adorn)**:
     - D is **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
     - A is in the word but **not** in position 1 (marked ""-"").
     - O is in the word but **not** in position 3 (marked ""-"").
     - R is in the word but **not** in position 4 (marked ""-"").
     - N is **correct** at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
   - **Guess 3 (baron)**:
     - B is **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
     - A is **correct** at position 2 (marked ""✓"").
     - R is in the word but **not** in position 3 (marked ""-"").
     - O is **correct** at position 4 (marked ""✓"").
     - N is **correct** at position 5 (marked ""✓"").

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: A (confirmed correct in baron).
     - Position 4: O (confirmed correct in baron).
     - Position 5: N (confirmed correct in adorn and baron).
   - **R's Position**:
     - R cannot be in positions 2 (from crane), 3 (from baron), or 4 (from adorn). The only remaining position is 1. Thus, R **must** be at position 1.
   - **Word Structure**:
     - The word is now: **R A ? O N** (position 3 is the only unknown).
   - **Excluded Letters**:
     - C, E, D, B are confirmed absent (from feedback).
   - **Unknown Letter at Position 3**:
     - Must be a letter not excluded (not C, E, D, B) and form a valid English word with ""R A _ O N"".
     - Common possibilities: 
       - **RAYON** (a synthetic fiber) → Uses ""Y"".
       - **RATON** (a small animal like a raccoon) → Uses ""T"".
     - Both are valid 5-letter words. ""RAYON"" is more common, so it is prioritized for this guess.

3. **Why RAYON?**:
   - Tests ""Y"" at position 3, which is a plausible letter (not excluded).
   - If correct, it solves the word. If incorrect (e.g., if the word is ""RATON""), the feedback will confirm ""Y"" is absent, and ""T"" can be used in the next guess (we have 2 tries left).
   - Fits all constraints:
     - Position 1: R (deduced as correct).
     - Position 2: A (confirmed).
     - Position 3: Y (to test).
     - Position 4: O (confirmed).
     - Position 5: N (confirmed).",Guess 4: rayon -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
