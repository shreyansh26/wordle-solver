We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the 5th position and it's wrong position).

 Also, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since it's in the secret word) and places it in a different position than the 5th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this to test other common letters.

 Let's think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

 We can try to put E in the first position? But note: the feedback doesn't tell us where E is, only that it's not at the end.

 However, we can try a word that has E in a different position to narrow down.

 Example: We can try a word with E in the first position? But that might be less common. Alternatively, we can try E in the second, third, or fourth.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""SPIEL"" -> but we don't know if S, P, I, L are in the word. Also, E is at the fourth position? Actually, ""spiel"" has E at the fourth? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> E is the fourth letter? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are: S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5). But we want to move E to a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E at the beginning? Like ""EIGHT"" -> E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5). But we avoid using R, A, N, C? This word doesn't have those.

 However, note that we have no information about other letters. We can also try to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has E and also includes other vowels or common consonants.

 Since we know E is in the word, and we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N), we can try to use a word that has E and other new letters.

 Let me list some words:

 - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is at the 4th position? But we had E at 5th and it was wrong, so we want to try a different position. In ""TIMES"", E is at the 4th? Actually: T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at 4th? We don't know if 4th is correct or not.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th. It could be at 4th? We don't know. So we can try to put E at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to try E in a position we haven't tried (i.e., not 5th). Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Another common starting word is ""TOUCH"", but that has C which we know is not in the word. So avoid C.

 Let's try to form a word without C, R, A, N and with E in a new position.

 Possibilities:

 - E at position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ENVOY"" (but N is eliminated, so not ""ENVOY""). ""EIGHT"" is okay: E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 - E at position 2: e.g., ""LEAST"" -> but L, E, A, S, T -> but A is eliminated. So avoid A. How about ""QUEST""? Q, U, E, S, T -> but Q is uncommon. ""BESET"" -> B, E, S, E, T -> has duplicate E? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

 - E at position 3: e.g., ""SPIED"" -> S, P, I, E, D -> E at 4th? Actually, in ""SPIED"": S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), D(5) -> so E is at 4th? Then we are not testing position 3. Let me clarify: 
   We want to test E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4 are all new for E.

 But note: we don't have to test E in every position. We can use the feedback to deduce.

 However, to get the most information, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Let's choose ""EIGHT"": 
   E at position 1, and then I, G, H, T.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. If we put E at position 1, then:
   If the secret word has E at position 1, we get a check (✓).
   If the secret word has E at position 2,3,4, we get a minus (-).
   If we get an (x) for E, that would contradict the first feedback? But we know E is in the word, so we won't get (x) for E.

 So ""EIGHT"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Another option: ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is eliminated (from first feedback: A(x)). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? Actually, the first feedback said E is not at the 5th position? But in ""STOLE"", E is at the 5th? So that would be the same position we already tried. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid putting E at the 5th again.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me think of words with E in position 2: 
   ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> but we don't know about D, I, T, Y. Also, avoids C,R,A,N.

   ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T -> E at position 2.

   ""WEIRD"" -> W, E, I, R, D -> but R is eliminated (first feedback: R(x)), so we cannot use R.

 So avoid R: so ""HEIST"" is okay.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""OCEAN"" -> but O, C, E, A, N -> C, A, N are eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""MEDIA"" -> M, E, D, I, A -> but A is eliminated.

   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, E at 2nd and 5th? We are avoiding 5th for E.

   ""PENIS"" -> P, E, N, I, S -> but N is eliminated.

   ""DELIS"" -> D, E, L, I, S -> E at position 2? Actually: D(1), E(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). So E at 2.

 Actually, for position 3: 
   ""ADIEU"" -> but A is eliminated.

   ""TEPID"" -> T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2? Actually: T(1), E(2), P(3), I(4), D(5). So E at 2.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Then we are testing E at 4.

 After considering, let's choose a word that has E in position 2 and other common letters.

 I think ""HEIST"" is a good candidate: H, E, I, S, T -> all new letters and common.

 But note: we are also trying to cover common consonants and vowels.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""EIGHT"" to test E at the beginning and also get I, G, H, T.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""EIGHT"" -> tests E at 1, and letters I, G, H, T.
 Option 2: ""HEIST"" -> tests E at 2, and letters H, I, S, T.

 Both test H, I, T? Actually, ""EIGHT"" has G and ""HEIST"" has S.

 Since S is a very common letter, we might prefer ""HEIST"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. Both are valid.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has E, and we are trying to find its position.

 Let's choose ""HEIST"" because it has S which is common and we haven't tested S.

 So the next guess: ""HEIST""

 But wait: in ""HEIST"", E is at position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we will get feedback.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse the position we already know is wrong and also tests new positions.

 However, any position 1-4 is new.

 I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 Let me confirm: HEIST is a valid 5-letter word.

 So we'll go with ""HEIST"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letters C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- The letter E **is** in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (indicated by ""-"" at the end).

For the next guess:
- We must include E (since it's confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 5th position again.
- We must exclude C, R, A, and N entirely.
- To maximize information, we prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) and test E in a new position (positions 1–4).

The word **""heist""** fits these criteria:
- Places E in the 2nd position (a new untested position).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.
- Is a valid English word.

 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since we placed E at the 5th position and it's wrong position).

 Also, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since it's in the secret word) and places it in a different position than the 5th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this to test other common letters.

 Let's think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

 We can try to put E in the first position? But note: the feedback doesn't tell us where E is, only that it's not at the end.

 However, we can try a word that has E in a different position to narrow down.

 Example: We can try a word with E in the first position? But that might be less common. Alternatively, we can try E in the second, third, or fourth.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""SPIEL"" -> but we don't know if S, P, I, L are in the word. Also, E is at the fourth position? Actually, ""spiel"" has E at the fourth? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> E is the fourth letter? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are: S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5). But we want to move E to a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E at the beginning? Like ""EIGHT"" -> E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5). But we avoid using R, A, N, C? This word doesn't have those.

 However, note that we have no information about other letters. We can also try to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has E and also includes other vowels or common consonants.

 Since we know E is in the word, and we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N), we can try to use a word that has E and other new letters.

 Let me list some words:

 - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is at the 4th position? But we had E at 5th and it was wrong, so we want to try a different position. In ""TIMES"", E is at the 4th? Actually: T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at 4th? We don't know if 4th is correct or not.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the 5th. It could be at 4th? We don't know. So we can try to put E at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to try E in a position we haven't tried (i.e., not 5th). Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Another common starting word is ""TOUCH"", but that has C which we know is not in the word. So avoid C.

 Let's try to form a word without C, R, A, N and with E in a new position.

 Possibilities:

 - E at position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ENVOY"" (but N is eliminated, so not ""ENVOY""). ""EIGHT"" is okay: E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 - E at position 2: e.g., ""LEAST"" -> but L, E, A, S, T -> but A is eliminated. So avoid A. How about ""QUEST""? Q, U, E, S, T -> but Q is uncommon. ""BESET"" -> B, E, S, E, T -> has duplicate E? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

 - E at position 3: e.g., ""SPIED"" -> S, P, I, E, D -> E at 4th? Actually, in ""SPIED"": S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), D(5) -> so E is at 4th? Then we are not testing position 3. Let me clarify: 
   We want to test E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4 are all new for E.

 But note: we don't have to test E in every position. We can use the feedback to deduce.

 However, to get the most information, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Let's choose ""EIGHT"": 
   E at position 1, and then I, G, H, T.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. If we put E at position 1, then:
   If the secret word has E at position 1, we get a check (✓).
   If the secret word has E at position 2,3,4, we get a minus (-).
   If we get an (x) for E, that would contradict the first feedback? But we know E is in the word, so we won't get (x) for E.

 So ""EIGHT"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Another option: ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is eliminated (from first feedback: A(x)). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at the end? Actually, the first feedback said E is not at the 5th position? But in ""STOLE"", E is at the 5th? So that would be the same position we already tried. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid putting E at the 5th again.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me think of words with E in position 2: 
   ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> but we don't know about D, I, T, Y. Also, avoids C,R,A,N.

   ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T -> E at position 2.

   ""WEIRD"" -> W, E, I, R, D -> but R is eliminated (first feedback: R(x)), so we cannot use R.

 So avoid R: so ""HEIST"" is okay.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""OCEAN"" -> but O, C, E, A, N -> C, A, N are eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""MEDIA"" -> M, E, D, I, A -> but A is eliminated.

   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, E at 2nd and 5th? We are avoiding 5th for E.

   ""PENIS"" -> P, E, N, I, S -> but N is eliminated.

   ""DELIS"" -> D, E, L, I, S -> E at position 2? Actually: D(1), E(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). So E at 2.

 Actually, for position 3: 
   ""ADIEU"" -> but A is eliminated.

   ""TEPID"" -> T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2? Actually: T(1), E(2), P(3), I(4), D(5). So E at 2.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Then we are testing E at 4.

 After considering, let's choose a word that has E in position 2 and other common letters.

 I think ""HEIST"" is a good candidate: H, E, I, S, T -> all new letters and common.

 But note: we are also trying to cover common consonants and vowels.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""EIGHT"" to test E at the beginning and also get I, G, H, T.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""EIGHT"" -> tests E at 1, and letters I, G, H, T.
 Option 2: ""HEIST"" -> tests E at 2, and letters H, I, S, T.

 Both test H, I, T? Actually, ""EIGHT"" has G and ""HEIST"" has S.

 Since S is a very common letter, we might prefer ""HEIST"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. Both are valid.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has E, and we are trying to find its position.

 Let's choose ""HEIST"" because it has S which is common and we haven't tested S.

 So the next guess: ""HEIST""

 But wait: in ""HEIST"", E is at position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we will get feedback.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse the position we already know is wrong and also tests new positions.

 However, any position 1-4 is new.

 I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 Let me confirm: HEIST is a valid 5-letter word.

 So we'll go with ""HEIST"".

<guess>heist</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letters C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- The letter E **is** in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (indicated by ""-"" at the end).

For the next guess:
- We must include E (since it's confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 5th position again.
- We must exclude C, R, A, and N entirely.
- To maximize information, we prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) and test E in a new position (positions 1–4).

The word **""heist""** fits these criteria:
- Places E in the 2nd position (a new untested position).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down E's position and test four additional letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(✓), E(-), I(x), S(x), T(-)
Meaning:
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got a minus for E at position 2).
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since we placed T at position 5 and got a minus).

So, from both guesses, we know:

Correct letters in the word: H (at position 1), E (somewhere, but not position 2 or 5), and T (somewhere, but not position 5).

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, I, S.

Also, we know the secret word has H as the first letter.

Now, let's summarize:

- Position 1: H (fixed, we know it's H)
- E is in the word, but not at position 2 or 5 -> so it must be at position 3 or 4.
- T is in the word, but not at position 5 -> so it must be at position 2, 3, or 4. But note: position 3 and 4 are shared possibilities for E and T? They can't both be in the same position, but they can be in different ones.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we know H, E, T are in, so two more unknown letters).

But note: the word has 5 distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates. However, so far we haven't encountered duplicates, and we have 3 known letters (H, E, T) and two unknown.

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, I, S.

We need to form a word that:
- Starts with H.
- Contains E and T.
- E is not in position 2 or 5 -> so position 3 or 4.
- T is not in position 5 -> so position 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we cannot put E and T in the same position. So if E is at 3, T can be at 2 or 4. If E is at 4, T can be at 2 or 3.

We also need to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, I, S.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the possible positions for E and T and also discover the remaining two letters.

We have two unknown letters, and we want to cover common letters that haven't been tried.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has H at the start, E in position 3 or 4, T in a position that doesn't conflict, and two new common letters.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: E in position 3 and T in position 2.
Then the word would be: H, T, E, ?, ?

But we need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not in the exclusion list and form a valid word.

For example: ""HTE??"" -> but we need a word that starts with ""HTE"". What words? ""HTER_"" ? Not common. ""HTER"" is not a root. How about ""HOTEL""? But in ""HOTEL"": H, O, T, E, L -> but then T is at position 3 and E at position 4? Actually: 
Position: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> so E is at 4, not 3. 

We want E at 3: so the pattern is H, ?, E, ?, ?

If we put T at 2: then H, T, E, ?, ?

Words: ""HTE"" is not common. We have ""HYPHE"" (not common) or ""HUTCH"" (but has C). 

Actually, let's list possible words with H at 1, E at 3: 
Pattern: H _ E _ _

We can have:
- H _ E L _ : like HOTEL? But in HOTEL, E is at 4, not 3. 
- H _ E _ _ : examples: ""HOMER"" (H, O, M, E, R) -> but R is eliminated. 
  ""HOVER"" (H, O, V, E, R) -> R eliminated.
  ""HATER"" (H, A, T, E, R) -> A and R eliminated.
  ""HAZEL"" (H, A, Z, E, L) -> A eliminated.

It's tricky. Let me think of words with H, then a letter, then E.

Examples: 
- ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> but N is eliminated.
- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S is eliminated.
- ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> R eliminated.
- ""HEDGE"" -> H, E, D, G, E -> but E at position 2? We don't want E at 2 because we know E is not at 2. Also, duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in this case, E at 2 is not allowed by feedback.

We need to avoid E at 2.

Another word: ""HIKED"" -> H, I, K, E, D -> but I is eliminated.

""HEXED"" -> H, E, X, E, D -> E at 2 and 4? But we cannot have E at 2.

So let's try E at position 4.

Pattern: H _ _ E _

We can put T at position 2: then H, T, ?, E, ?

Or T at position 3: then H, ?, T, E, ?

We also have to consider that T might be at position 4? But if E is at 4, then T cannot be at 4. So T must be at 2 or 3.

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: T at 2, E at 4: pattern H T _ E _
Examples: 
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> O and L are new. But note: in this word, T is at 3? Actually: 
  H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so T is at 3, not 2.

We want T at 2: so H, T, ?, E, ?

Words: ""HTE"" is hard. ""HATCH"" -> H, A, T, C, H -> but A and C eliminated, and duplicate H? Not allowed? We don't know.

Actually, ""HITCH"" -> H, I, T, C, H -> I and C eliminated.

""BATCH"" -> doesn't start with H.

There are not many common words with ""HT"" at the beginning. 

Case 2: T at 3, E at 4: pattern H _ T E _
Examples: 
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> this fits: O at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5.
- ""HOTEN"" -> not a word.
- ""HUTEN"" -> not common.
- ""HITEN"" -> not a word.

So ""HOTEL"" is a candidate. But we have to check if the letters are allowed: O, T, E, L. 
- T and E are known to be in the word, but we are testing their positions.
- O and L: we haven't tested them, and they are not in the exclusion list (excluded: C,R,A,N,I,S).

So ""HOTEL"" is a valid guess.

But note: in ""HOTEL"", we have:
- H at 1: correct (we know H is at 1)
- O at 2: unknown
- T at 3: we know T is in the word, but we don't know if it's at 3.
- E at 4: we know E is in the word, and we are testing if it's at 4.
- L at 5: unknown.

This guess will tell us about O and L, and also confirm the positions of T and E.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests E at 3 and T at 4? 

Pattern: H _ E T _

But we know T is not at 5? Actually, we can put T at 4? Then E at 3: H _ E T _

Example: ""HORNET"" -> but 6 letters? No, 5: H, O, R, N, E -> but R and N eliminated.

""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y -> but E is at 2? We cannot have E at 2.

""HAVET"" -> not a word.

""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T -> A and R eliminated.

So it's hard to find a word with E at 3 and T at 4.

Another idea: put E at 3 and T at 2? We tried and couldn't find a common word.

So ""HOTEL"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we have T at 3 and E at 4. We know T is in the word and not at 5, so it could be at 2,3,4. Similarly, E must be at 3 or 4. So by putting T at 3 and E at 4, we are testing two possibilities at once.

Also, we are testing O and L.

We could also consider other words with E at 4 and T at 2? But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""HOMED"" -> H, O, M, E, D -> E at 4? Then we don't test T? But we know T is in the word, so we must include T in the guess? Not necessarily, but if we don't include T, we won't get information about its position. We have limited guesses, so we should try to include known letters to get their positions.

We have two known letters (E and T) that we need to position, so it's better to include both in the guess.

Therefore, ""HOTEL"" is a good choice because it includes both E and T and tests two possible positions.

So let's go with ""HOTEL"".

But wait: what if the secret word has E at 3 and T at 2? Then ""HOTEL"" would not be the word, but we are testing a different configuration. That's okay because we are trying to get feedback.

We are using the guess to test:
- If E is at 4 and T at 3? In ""HOTEL"", T is at 3 and E at 4.

But the secret word might have E at 3 and T at 4? Then we need to test that later.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E at 3 and T at 4? But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""HUTEX"" -> not a word.

So we'll go with ""HOTEL"".

But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""HOTEL"" uses O, T, E, L. T and E are in the word, O and L are new and not eliminated.

So the guess is ""HOTEL"".

But let me confirm: the feedback for ""heist"" told us that T is in the word but not at 5. So in ""HOTEL"", we put T at 3 and E at 4. We'll see if they are correct.

We might also get information about O and L.

So, next guess: ""HOTEL""

But wait, what if the secret word is ""HOTEL""? Then we win.

But we don't know.

So, let's output ""HOTEL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, A, N are **not** in the word. E is in the word but **not in position 5**.
- **Guess 2 (""heist"")**: 
  - H is **correct and in position 1**.
  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.
  - I and S are **not** in the word.
  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**:
   - H is fixed at position 1.
   - E is present but cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → must be in **position 3 or 4**.
   - T is present but cannot be in position 5 → must be in **position 2, 3, or 4**.
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, I, S (cannot appear in the word).
3. **Unknown positions**: Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 need resolution, with E and T occupying two of them.
4. **Remaining letters**: Two additional letters (besides H, E, T) are unknown and must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, etc.).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **E in position 4** and **T in position 3** (since E cannot be in position 2 or 5, and T cannot be in position 5, this configuration is plausible).
- Include **common unused letters** (e.g., O, L) to maximize information.
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse known letters (H, E, T) to clarify positions.

The word **""HOTEL""** fits perfectly:
- H in position 1 (correct, per feedback).
- T in position 3 (tests if T is here).
- E in position 4 (tests if E is here).
- O and L are new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, I, S).

This guess will:
- Confirm or deny E at position 4 and T at position 3.
- Reveal if O or L are in the word and their positions.

<guess>hotel</guess>",hotel,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(✓), E(-), I(x), S(x), T(-)
Meaning:
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got a minus for E at position 2).
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since we placed T at position 5 and got a minus).

So, from both guesses, we know:

Correct letters in the word: H (at position 1), E (somewhere, but not position 2 or 5), and T (somewhere, but not position 5).

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, I, S.

Also, we know the secret word has H as the first letter.

Now, let's summarize:

- Position 1: H (fixed, we know it's H)
- E is in the word, but not at position 2 or 5 -> so it must be at position 3 or 4.
- T is in the word, but not at position 5 -> so it must be at position 2, 3, or 4. But note: position 3 and 4 are shared possibilities for E and T? They can't both be in the same position, but they can be in different ones.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters, and we know H, E, T are in, so two more unknown letters).

But note: the word has 5 distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates. However, so far we haven't encountered duplicates, and we have 3 known letters (H, E, T) and two unknown.

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, I, S.

We need to form a word that:
- Starts with H.
- Contains E and T.
- E is not in position 2 or 5 -> so position 3 or 4.
- T is not in position 5 -> so position 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we cannot put E and T in the same position. So if E is at 3, T can be at 2 or 4. If E is at 4, T can be at 2 or 3.

We also need to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, I, S.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the possible positions for E and T and also discover the remaining two letters.

We have two unknown letters, and we want to cover common letters that haven't been tried.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has H at the start, E in position 3 or 4, T in a position that doesn't conflict, and two new common letters.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: E in position 3 and T in position 2.
Then the word would be: H, T, E, ?, ?

But we need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not in the exclusion list and form a valid word.

For example: ""HTE??"" -> but we need a word that starts with ""HTE"". What words? ""HTER_"" ? Not common. ""HTER"" is not a root. How about ""HOTEL""? But in ""HOTEL"": H, O, T, E, L -> but then T is at position 3 and E at position 4? Actually: 
Position: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> so E is at 4, not 3. 

We want E at 3: so the pattern is H, ?, E, ?, ?

If we put T at 2: then H, T, E, ?, ?

Words: ""HTE"" is not common. We have ""HYPHE"" (not common) or ""HUTCH"" (but has C). 

Actually, let's list possible words with H at 1, E at 3: 
Pattern: H _ E _ _

We can have:
- H _ E L _ : like HOTEL? But in HOTEL, E is at 4, not 3. 
- H _ E _ _ : examples: ""HOMER"" (H, O, M, E, R) -> but R is eliminated. 
  ""HOVER"" (H, O, V, E, R) -> R eliminated.
  ""HATER"" (H, A, T, E, R) -> A and R eliminated.
  ""HAZEL"" (H, A, Z, E, L) -> A eliminated.

It's tricky. Let me think of words with H, then a letter, then E.

Examples: 
- ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> but N is eliminated.
- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S is eliminated.
- ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> R eliminated.
- ""HEDGE"" -> H, E, D, G, E -> but E at position 2? We don't want E at 2 because we know E is not at 2. Also, duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in this case, E at 2 is not allowed by feedback.

We need to avoid E at 2.

Another word: ""HIKED"" -> H, I, K, E, D -> but I is eliminated.

""HEXED"" -> H, E, X, E, D -> E at 2 and 4? But we cannot have E at 2.

So let's try E at position 4.

Pattern: H _ _ E _

We can put T at position 2: then H, T, ?, E, ?

Or T at position 3: then H, ?, T, E, ?

We also have to consider that T might be at position 4? But if E is at 4, then T cannot be at 4. So T must be at 2 or 3.

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: T at 2, E at 4: pattern H T _ E _
Examples: 
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> O and L are new. But note: in this word, T is at 3? Actually: 
  H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> so T is at 3, not 2.

We want T at 2: so H, T, ?, E, ?

Words: ""HTE"" is hard. ""HATCH"" -> H, A, T, C, H -> but A and C eliminated, and duplicate H? Not allowed? We don't know.

Actually, ""HITCH"" -> H, I, T, C, H -> I and C eliminated.

""BATCH"" -> doesn't start with H.

There are not many common words with ""HT"" at the beginning. 

Case 2: T at 3, E at 4: pattern H _ T E _
Examples: 
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> this fits: O at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5.
- ""HOTEN"" -> not a word.
- ""HUTEN"" -> not common.
- ""HITEN"" -> not a word.

So ""HOTEL"" is a candidate. But we have to check if the letters are allowed: O, T, E, L. 
- T and E are known to be in the word, but we are testing their positions.
- O and L: we haven't tested them, and they are not in the exclusion list (excluded: C,R,A,N,I,S).

So ""HOTEL"" is a valid guess.

But note: in ""HOTEL"", we have:
- H at 1: correct (we know H is at 1)
- O at 2: unknown
- T at 3: we know T is in the word, but we don't know if it's at 3.
- E at 4: we know E is in the word, and we are testing if it's at 4.
- L at 5: unknown.

This guess will tell us about O and L, and also confirm the positions of T and E.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests E at 3 and T at 4? 

Pattern: H _ E T _

But we know T is not at 5? Actually, we can put T at 4? Then E at 3: H _ E T _

Example: ""HORNET"" -> but 6 letters? No, 5: H, O, R, N, E -> but R and N eliminated.

""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y -> but E is at 2? We cannot have E at 2.

""HAVET"" -> not a word.

""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T -> A and R eliminated.

So it's hard to find a word with E at 3 and T at 4.

Another idea: put E at 3 and T at 2? We tried and couldn't find a common word.

So ""HOTEL"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we have T at 3 and E at 4. We know T is in the word and not at 5, so it could be at 2,3,4. Similarly, E must be at 3 or 4. So by putting T at 3 and E at 4, we are testing two possibilities at once.

Also, we are testing O and L.

We could also consider other words with E at 4 and T at 2? But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""HOMED"" -> H, O, M, E, D -> E at 4? Then we don't test T? But we know T is in the word, so we must include T in the guess?
