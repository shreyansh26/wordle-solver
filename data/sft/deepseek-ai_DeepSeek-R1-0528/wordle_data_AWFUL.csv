We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (because it was at position 3 in CRANE).
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter A, but not at position 3 (since it was marked as - meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Also, since A is present but not at position 3, it must be at one of the other positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that respects this information.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 - Must include the letter A (since we know A is in the word), but not at position 3.
 - Must not include C, R, N, E.

 Also, to maximize information, we should try to include new common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

 Let's think about what letters we haven't tried yet that are common in 5-letter words.

 We have excluded: C, R, E, N (and R was excluded, but note: R was in the first guess and marked absent). Also, we have included A and know it must be in the word.

 Remaining common vowels: O, U, I (since E is out)
 Common consonants: T, S, L, D, P, M, etc.

 Our goal is to test other common letters and also find the position of A.

 Since A is not at position 3, let's try a word that places A in a different position, say position 1 or 2.

 We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words:
 Let me list words that:
   - Have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - Do not contain C, R, N, E.

 Also, we have 5 other positions to fill with new letters.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O, P, M, H, etc.

 Try a word with A in position 1: 
   Options: A _ _ _ _ 
   Possible: AUDIO (but U and I are vowels, and O is a vowel? But we have no information on vowels except A is in and E is out). However, AUDIO has A at 1 and contains U, D, I, O. And excludes C,R,N,E.

 But let's see: we also have the position constraint for A: we know it can't be at 3, but placing it at 1 is a possibility.

 Another idea: We might also try to put A in position 2? Or 4? Or 5? Since we have no information about the position except it's not 3.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there might be multiple As. But until we see more feedback, we assume one A.

 Given that, I need a word that includes A and tests other common consonants and vowels.

 Let me think of words that don't have C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3.

 Some words:
 - SALAD? -> but it has two As and L and D. But let's check letters: S, A, L, D -> no C,R,N,E? But two As: but we don't know if the word has multiple As. However, SALAD has A at position 2 and 4, which might be okay.

 But SALAD has a repeated A. It might be safer to use a word without repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Alternatively: 
 - PLAYS? -> P, L, A, Y, S -> A at position 3? But we can't put A at position 3 because it must not be at 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A anywhere except we hope to find its correct position. But we must avoid position 3? No, we can put A at position 3 again? Actually, we know the word has A but not at position 3. So we should try A at a new position.

 However, note: the ""-"" for A in the first guess (position 3) does not prevent us from putting A at position 3 in the next guess? We can, but it would be wasted because we know it's not the correct position. So it's better to try A in one of the other positions.

 Rules: 
 - The secret word has A but not in position 3.
 - We can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 To maximize information, we should try A in a different position and use new letters.

 Another word: TALON. But contains O and L and N? Wait, N is excluded. So no.

 Let me avoid N.

 Words: 
 - PASTA: P, A, S, T, A -> has two As? But A at positions 2 and 5. Also, letters: P, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E? Yes. But repeated A? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? They are, but for testing, maybe we avoid duplicates to get more information.

 But PASTA has A at 2 and 5. That might be acceptable, but if the word actually has two As, we'd get two marks.

 Alternatively, a word without duplicate letters: 
 - SHALT? Not common. 
 - PAINT? Contains N -> excluded.
 - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S -> A at position 2? This has unique letters.

 MAULS: 
   Position: M, A, U, L, S -> A at 2.

 Another: SPLAT: S, P, L, A, T -> A at position 4. This has S, P, L, A, T -> all distinct and avoids excluded letters.

 But where is the A? Position 4.

 Alternatively: OPALS? O, P, A, L, S -> A at position 3? But we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position so we might get the same feedback. It's better to avoid position 3 to test other positions.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with A not at position 3.

 Why not try A at the beginning? For example: ALPHA? Contains P and L and H? But H is not very common? Also, has A twice? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ALOUD? A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, A at 1. But has O and U? Might be useful.

 But I'm considering using SPLAT: placing A at position 4.

 Another common word: TRAIL? But contains R, which we know is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: PLAZA? Two As -> not ideal.

 After evaluation, let's pick a word with A at position 1 or 2, and include other common consonants.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a popular word, but it has E -> excluded.

 So, avoid E.

 I found: ""SOLAR"" -> but contains R and O -> R is excluded.

 Need no R.

 How about: ""DOULA""? Not common.

 Let me try: ""PLAIT"" -> but contains I and T, but also T? Wait, no: P, L, A, I, T -> but N? No, excluded? N is excluded, but not I or T. But PLAIT has A at position 3? Not allowed because we know A isn't at 3? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at 3, but we can put A at 3 to check? But that wouldn't be efficient.

 Another idea: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T -> A at position 2. This avoids C,R,N,E? Yes: H, A, B, I, T. Also, distinct letters.

 So ""HABIT"" is a valid word: 
   H, A, B, I, T -> letters not excluded.

 Similarly: ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A at 2? This also avoids C,R,N,E.

 But W and Z are less common.

 How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? Avoids C,R,N,E.

 Also: ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? So not as good.

 We want more distinct letters.

 So ""DAILY"" or ""HABIT"" might be good.

 Another option: ""MANOR"" -> contains M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are excluded, so invalid.

 Let's stick with ""HABIT"": 
   Advantages: common letters: H, A, B, I, T. H and B are less common? But we have to use new letters.

 But note: we have only excluded C,R,N,E. So B, T, I, H, etc. are fair game.

 Alternatively, how about ""FLAIL""? But two L's? Not distinct.

 Or ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A at 2. Distinct letters. P, A, S, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E.

 This seems good: PASTY? But is it a word? It might be (a type of food). And common? Perhaps.

 But we also have the option ""PASTA"" but repeated A. I think PASTY is better because it has distinct letters.

 Another: ""MAJOR"" -> has R, excluded.

 How about ""BAWDY""? B, A, W, D, Y -> A at 2? But W and Y not very common? 

 I think ""PASTY"" or ""HABIT"" are both acceptable.

 Or even better: let's choose ""SPLAT"" if it is allowed? S, P, L, A, T -> distinct and A at position 4? 

 But then we are testing A at position 4. We don't know if it's position 2 or 4? 

 Since we know A is in the word but not at 3, we can test two possibilities: by putting A at position 2 we also cover the possibility that it is at 2? Actually, if we put A at 2 and it's the correct position, we get a ✓. If it's not, but in the word, we get a -.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A at the same position as the first guess? That is, avoid position 3 and choose a new position? 

 Let me assign probabilities: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are equally likely for A? Maybe.

 But without any other constraints, we can pick arbitrarily.

 I'll pick ""PASTY"": 
   P (new), A (test position 2), S (new), T (new), Y (new)

 This way we get information about P, S, T, Y and A at position 2.

 If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it's not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.

 So I'll go with ""PASTY""

 But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It's in word lists.

 Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.

 I'll choose ""HABIT"": 
   H: new
   A: position 2? 
   B: new
   I: new
   T: new

 This covers more vowels? We have A and I.

 So, let's pick ""HABIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.

 So no.

 Decision: I'll guess ""HABIT""

<guess>HABIT</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is present but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess, I need a word that includes A (in any position except 3) and avoids C, R, N, E. I selected ""HABIT"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (to test a new position for A, since position 3 is invalid).
- It introduces new common consonants (H, B, T) and a vowel (I), avoiding excluded letters.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information feedback.

 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (because it was at position 3 in CRANE).

 - E is not in the word.

 So, from this feedback, we know:

 If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it's not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.

 So I'll go with ""PASTY""

 But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It's in word lists.

 Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.

 I'll choose ""HABIT"": 
   H: new
   A: position 2? 
   B: new
   I: new
   T: new

 This covers more vowels? We have A and I.

 So, let's pick ""HABIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.

 So no.

 Decision: I'll guess ""HABIT""

<guess>HABIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is present but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess, I need a word that includes A (in any position except 3) and avoids C, R, N, E. I selected ""HABIT"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (to test a new position for A, since position 3 is invalid).
- It introduces new common consonants (H, B, T) and a vowel (I), avoiding excluded letters.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information feedback.",Guess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, and there's no prior information. So we should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include words with common letters and distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers several common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) and all distinct letters.

 So my first guess is: ""CRANE""I'm starting my first guess without any prior clues. I need a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback information. A good starting word often has unique letters and covers vowels like A, E and common consonants like R, S, or T. I'll use ""CRANE"" – it satisfies this with five distinct letters and hits multiple common sounds. After this guess, the feedback will reveal initial letter positions and inclusions to guide future guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (because it was at position 3 in CRANE).
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter A, but not at position 3 (since it was marked as - meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Also, since A is present but not at position 3, it must be at one of the other positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that respects this information.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 - Must include the letter A (since we know A is in the word), but not at position 3.
 - Must not include C, R, N, E.

 Also, to maximize information, we should try to include new common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

 Let's think about what letters we haven't tried yet that are common in 5-letter words.

 We have excluded: C, R, E, N (and R was excluded, but note: R was in the first guess and marked absent). Also, we have included A and know it must be in the word.

 Remaining common vowels: O, U, I (since E is out)
 Common consonants: T, S, L, D, P, M, etc.

 Our goal is to test other common letters and also find the position of A.

 Since A is not at position 3, let's try a word that places A in a different position, say position 1 or 2.

 We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words:
 Let me list words that:
   - Have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - Do not contain C, R, N, E.

 Also, we have 5 other positions to fill with new letters.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O, P, M, H, etc.

 Try a word with A in position 1: 
   Options: A _ _ _ _ 
   Possible: AUDIO (but U and I are vowels, and O is a vowel? But we have no information on vowels except A is in and E is out). However, AUDIO has A at 1 and contains U, D, I, O. And excludes C,R,N,E.

 But let's see: we also have the position constraint for A: we know it can't be at 3, but placing it at 1 is a possibility.

 Another idea: We might also try to put A in position 2? Or 4? Or 5? Since we have no information about the position except it's not 3.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there might be multiple As. But until we see more feedback, we assume one A.

 Given that, I need a word that includes A and tests other common consonants and vowels.

 Let me think of words that don't have C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3.

 Some words:
 - SALAD? -> but it has two As and L and D. But let's check letters: S, A, L, D -> no C,R,N,E? But two As: but we don't know if the word has multiple As. However, SALAD has A at position 2 and 4, which might be okay.

 But SALAD has a repeated A. It might be safer to use a word without repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Alternatively: 
 - PLAYS? -> P, L, A, Y, S -> A at position 3? But we can't put A at position 3 because it must not be at 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A anywhere except we hope to find its correct position. But we must avoid position 3? No, we can put A at position 3 again? Actually, we know the word has A but not at position 3. So we should try A at a new position.

 However, note: the ""-"" for A in the first guess (position 3) does not prevent us from putting A at position 3 in the next guess? We can, but it would be wasted because we know it's not the correct position. So it's better to try A in one of the other positions.

 Rules: 
 - The secret word has A but not in position 3.
 - We can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 To maximize information, we should try A in a different position and use new letters.

 Another word: TALON. But contains O and L and N? Wait, N is excluded. So no.

 Let me avoid N.

 Words: 
 - PASTA: P, A, S, T, A -> has two As? But A at positions 2 and 5. Also, letters: P, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E? Yes. But repeated A? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? They are, but for testing, maybe we avoid duplicates to get more information.

 But PASTA has A at 2 and 5. That might be acceptable, but if the word actually has two As, we'd get two marks.

 Alternatively, a word without duplicate letters: 
 - SHALT? Not common. 
 - PAINT? Contains N -> excluded.
 - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S -> A at position 2? This has unique letters.

 MAULS: 
   Position: M, A, U, L, S -> A at 2.

 Another: SPLAT: S, P, L, A, T -> A at position 4. This has S, P, L, A, T -> all distinct and avoids excluded letters.

 But where is the A? Position 4.

 Alternatively: OPALS? O, P, A, L, S -> A at position 3? But we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position so we might get the same feedback. It's better to avoid position 3 to test other positions.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with A not at position 3.

 Why not try A at the beginning? For example: ALPHA? Contains P and L and H? But H is not very common? Also, has A twice? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ALOUD? A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, A at 1. But has O and U? Might be useful.

 But I'm considering using SPLAT: placing A at position 4.

 Another common word: TRAIL? But contains R, which we know is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: PLAZA? Two As -> not ideal.

 After evaluation, let's pick a word with A at position 1 or 2, and include other common consonants.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a popular word, but it has E -> excluded.

 So, avoid E.

 I found: ""SOLAR"" -> but contains R and O -> R is excluded.

 Need no R.

 How about: ""DOULA""? Not common.

 Let me try: ""PLAIT"" -> but contains I and T, but also T? Wait, no: P, L, A, I, T -> but N? No, excluded? N is excluded, but not I or T. But PLAIT has A at position 3? Not allowed because we know A isn't at 3? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at 3, but we can put A at 3 to check? But that wouldn't be efficient.

 Another idea: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T -> A at position 2. This avoids C,R,N,E? Yes: H, A, B, I, T. Also, distinct letters.

 So ""HABIT"" is a valid word: 
   H, A, B, I, T -> letters not excluded.

 Similarly: ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A at 2? This also avoids C,R,N,E.

 But W and Z are less common.

 How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? Avoids C,R,N,E.

 Also: ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? So not as good.

 We want more distinct letters.

 So ""DAILY"" or ""HABIT"" might be good.

 Another option: ""MANOR"" -> contains M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are excluded, so invalid.

 Let's stick with ""HABIT"": 
   Advantages: common letters: H, A, B, I, T. H and B are less common? But we have to use new letters.

 But note: we have only excluded C,R,N,E. So B, T, I, H, etc. are fair game.

 Alternatively, how about ""FLAIL""? But two L's? Not distinct.

 Or ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A at 2. Distinct letters. P, A, S, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E.

 This seems good: PASTY? But is it a word? It might be (a type of food). And common? Perhaps.

 But we also have the option ""PASTA"" but repeated A. I think PASTY is better because it has distinct letters.

 Another: ""MAJOR"" -> has R, excluded.

 How about ""BAWDY""? B, A, W, D, Y -> A at 2? But W and Y not very common? 

 I think ""PASTY"" or ""HABIT"" are both acceptable.

 Or even better: let's choose ""SPLAT"" if it is allowed? S, P, L, A, T -> distinct and A at position 4? 

 But then we are testing A at position 4. We don't know if it's position 2 or 4? 

 Since we know A is in the word but not at 3, we can test two possibilities: by putting A at position 2 we also cover the possibility that it is at 2? Actually, if we put A at 2 and it's the correct position, we get a ✓. If it's not, but in the word, we get a -.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A at the same position as the first guess? That is, avoid position 3 and choose a new position? 

 Let me assign probabilities: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are equally likely for A? Maybe.

 But without any other constraints, we can pick arbitrarily.

 I'll pick ""PASTY"": 
   P (new), A (test position 2), S (new), T (new), Y (new)

 This way we get information about P, S, T, Y and A at position 2.

 If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it's not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.

 So I'll go with ""PASTY""

 But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It's in word lists.

 Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.

 I'll choose ""HABIT"": 
   H: new
   A: position 2? 
   B: new
   I: new
   T: new

 This covers more vowels? We have A and I.

 So, let's pick ""HABIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.

 So no.

We have feedback from two guesses:
First guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and got a dash).

Second guess: HABIT -> H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, B, I, T are not in the secret word.
  - A is again in the word but this time it was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not at position 2.

So, combining both:
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T
- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we know that the secret word has 5 letters, includes A, and excludes the above letters.

We must now make a third guess. The guess must:
1. Include the letter A (only once? we don't know, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet) in position 1, 4, or 5.
2. Not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T.

Remaining common letters: We have used A, and excluded consonants: C, R, N, H, B, T, and vowels: E, I. Common vowels left: O, U. Common consonants: S, L, D, P, M, W, Y, G, K, V, etc.

We also know no other letters from the word yet beyond A. So we need to test many new letters.

Since A is at position 1, 4, or 5, let's try to cover multiple unknowns at once.

We should choose a word with A in one of the allowed positions and include other common unused letters.

Options:
- Place A at the beginning: A _ _ _ _
- Or at the end: _ _ _ _ A
- Or in the fourth position: _ _ _ A _

Possible words:

Option A in position 1: 
- Words like A_ _ _ _: Using remaining letters (S, L, O, P, etc.)
  - Example: ""ASKED"" -> but E is excluded. Invalid.
  - ""ASSAY"" -> but S repeated? Also has S and Y. But E is excluded? Wait, no E. But assay: A, S, S, A, Y -> two S and two A? We don't know about repetition. Not ideal because repeated letters give less information.
  - ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters? Yes. A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). And avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T -> none of these. So ALOUD is a valid word.

Option A in position 4:
  - Example: _ _ _ A _
    - ""PLAZA"" -> P, L, A, Z, A -> repeated A and Z uncommon? Also, we don't know Z. Avoid?
    - ""FLOPS"" -> F, L, O, P, S -> but this has no A? We must include A. So we need a word that has A at position 4.
    - ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is excluded (from second guess)? From HABIT, T is excluded? So SPLAT has T -> invalid.

We must avoid T, so SPLAT is not allowed.

Alternative for position 4: 
  - ""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but this has A at position 4? Let's see: O P A L S -> no, A is at position 3? We need position 4? 
    Actually, OPALS: O(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A at position 3? That is not allowed because we know A is not at position 3? From both guesses, we know A isn't at 2 or 3. So position 3 is invalid.

We need A only at 1,4,5.

So for position 4: 
  - Words ending with A? But wait, position 4 is the fourth position. So the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?
  - Example: ""SPOOK"" -> no A? We need A. ""SPLA""? Not a word.

  How about ""SOLAR""? But R excluded and also has O, L, A, S? Position: S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R -> but R is excluded? Invalid.

Another idea: ""DOULA""? D, O, U, L, A -> positions: D(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), A(5). So A is at position 5? Also? But we can try position 5.

Option A in position 5: 
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Example: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but N and I are excluded? Invalid.
  - ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded and repeated.
  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> but C is excluded? Yes, invalid.
  - ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R excluded.
  - ""MOCHA"" -> M, O, C, H, A -> C and H excluded.

So difficult? How about ""JUMPS""? But no A.

We must have A at position 5.

Possible: ""GAUZY""? G, A, U, Z, Y -> not common? But if we want: A is at position 2? Then not. For position 5: 
  - ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> repeated and A at 2 and 4? We need A at end?
  - ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> repeated U and A at position 4? Not at 5.

Another: ""LILAC"" -> L, I, L, A, C -> I and C excluded? Invalid.

After some thought, let's go with A in position 1: ALOUD? Which I mentioned earlier: A, L, O, U, D -> all new letters? Yes: L, O, U, D.

Alternatively: ""ABOUT""? A, B, O, U, T -> but B and T are excluded? From second guess, HABIT: B(x) and T(x), so yes, excluded.

So ALOUD is acceptable.

Are there other words? 
- ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> but B and E excluded? Not valid.
- ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> N excluded? Yes, invalid.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> T excluded? Yes, from second guess T(x)? So invalid.

So ALOUD: A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). This avoids all excluded letters? Check: excluded letters: C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T. None in ALOUD. Good.

Moreover, it uses:
- A in position 1: to test if it's the correct position? If it is, we get A(✓). Else, we get A(-) again, meaning A is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5).

Also, we test L, O, U, D in positions 2,3,4,5.

So I think ""ALOUD"" is a good third guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ALOUD"".

Response format:

</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E from Guess 1 and H, B, I, T from Guess 2. These cannot be in the secret word.
- **Required letter A**: The letter A must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (as confirmed by both guesses). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the third guess:
- I selected **ALOUD** because:
  - It places A in position 1 to test one of the possible locations.
  - It introduces **new common letters**: L, O, U, D (none excluded).
  - All letters are distinct to maximize information gain.
  - If A is in position 1, it will be marked ✓; if not, it will show A is at position 4 or 5 (-) while revealing which of L, O, U, D are in the secret word.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and tests frequent unused letters.

<guess>ALOUD</guess>",ALOUD,"We have feedback from two guesses:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, and there's no prior information. So we should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include words with common letters and distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers several common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) and all distinct letters.

 So my first guess is: ""CRANE""I'm starting my first guess without any prior clues. I need a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback information. A good starting word often has unique letters and covers vowels like A, E and common consonants like R, S, or T. I'll use ""CRANE"" – it satisfies this with five distinct letters and hits multiple common sounds. After this guess, the feedback will reveal initial letter positions and inclusions to guide future guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (because it was at position 3 in CRANE).
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter A, but not at position 3 (since it was marked as - meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Also, since A is present but not at position 3, it must be at one of the other positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that respects this information.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 - Must include the letter A (since we know A is in the word), but not at position 3.
 - Must not include C, R, N, E.

 Also, to maximize information, we should try to include new common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

 Let's think about what letters we haven't tried yet that are common in 5-letter words.

 We have excluded: C, R, E, N (and R was excluded, but note: R was in the first guess and marked absent). Also, we have included A and know it must be in the word.

 Remaining common vowels: O, U, I (since E is out)
 Common consonants: T, S, L, D, P, M, etc.

 Our goal is to test other common letters and also find the position of A.

 Since A is not at position 3, let's try a word that places A in a different position, say position 1 or 2.

 We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words:
 Let me list words that:
   - Have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - Do not contain C, R, N, E.

 Also, we have 5 other positions to fill with new letters.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O, P, M, H, etc.

 Try a word with A in position 1: 
   Options: A _ _ _ _ 
   Possible: AUDIO (but U and I are vowels, and O is a vowel? But we have no information on vowels except A is in and E is out). However, AUDIO has A at 1 and contains U, D, I, O. And excludes C,R,N,E.

 But let's see: we also have the position constraint for A: we know it can't be at 3, but placing it at 1 is a possibility.

 Another idea: We might also try to put A in position 2? Or 4? Or 5? Since we have no information about the position except it's not 3.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there might be multiple As. But until we see more feedback, we assume one A.

 Given that, I need a word that includes A and tests other common consonants and vowels.

 Let me think of words that don't have C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3.

 Some words:
 - SALAD? -> but it has two As and L and D. But let's check letters: S, A, L, D -> no C,R,N,E? But two As: but we don't know if the word has multiple As. However, SALAD has A at position 2 and 4, which might be okay.

 But SALAD has a repeated A. It might be safer to use a word without repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Alternatively: 
 - PLAYS? -> P, L, A, Y, S -> A at position 3? But we can't put A at position 3 because it must not be at 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A anywhere except we hope to find its correct position. But we must avoid position 3? No, we can put A at position 3 again? Actually, we know the word has A but not at position 3. So we should try A at a new position.

 However, note: the ""-"" for A in the first guess (position 3) does not prevent us from putting A at position 3 in the next guess? We can, but it would be wasted because we know it's not the correct position. So it's better to try A in one of the other positions.

 Rules: 
 - The secret word has A but not in position 3.
 - We can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 To maximize information, we should try A in a different position and use new letters.

 Another word: TALON. But contains O and L and N? Wait, N is excluded. So no.

 Let me avoid N.

 Words: 
 - PASTA: P, A, S, T, A -> has two As? But A at positions 2 and 5. Also, letters: P, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E? Yes. But repeated A? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? They are, but for testing, maybe we avoid duplicates to get more information.

 But PASTA has A at 2 and 5. That might be acceptable, but if the word actually has two As, we'd get two marks.

 Alternatively, a word without duplicate letters: 
 - SHALT? Not common. 
 - PAINT? Contains N -> excluded.
 - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S -> A at position 2? This has unique letters.

 MAULS: 
   Position: M, A, U, L, S -> A at 2.

 Another: SPLAT: S, P, L, A, T -> A at position 4. This has S, P, L, A, T -> all distinct and avoids excluded letters.

 But where is the A? Position 4.

 Alternatively: OPALS? O, P, A, L, S -> A at position 3? But we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position so we might get the same feedback. It's better to avoid position 3 to test other positions.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with A not at position 3.

 Why not try A at the beginning? For example: ALPHA? Contains P and L and H? But H is not very common? Also, has A twice? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ALOUD? A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, A at 1. But has O and U? Might be useful.

 But I'm considering using SPLAT: placing A at position 4.

 Another common word: TRAIL? But contains R, which we know is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: PLAZA? Two As -> not ideal.

 After evaluation, let's pick a word with A at position 1 or 2, and include other common consonants.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a popular word, but it has E -> excluded.

 So, avoid E.

 I found: ""SOLAR"" -> but contains R and O -> R is excluded.

 Need no R.

 How about: ""DOULA""? Not common.

 Let me try: ""PLAIT"" -> but contains I and T, but also T? Wait, no: P, L, A, I, T -> but N? No, excluded? N is excluded, but not I or T. But PLAIT has A at position 3? Not allowed because we know A isn't at 3? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at 3, but we can put A at 3 to check? But that wouldn't be efficient.

 Another idea: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T -> A at position 2. This avoids C,R,N,E? Yes: H, A, B, I, T. Also, distinct letters.

 So ""HABIT"" is a valid word: 
   H, A, B, I, T -> letters not excluded.

 Similarly: ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A at 2? This also avoids C,R,N,E.

 But W and Z are less common.

 How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? Avoids C,R,N,E.

 Also: ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? So not as good.

 We want more distinct letters.

 So ""DAILY"" or ""HABIT"" might be good.

 Another option: ""MANOR"" -> contains M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are excluded, so invalid.

 Let's stick with ""HABIT"": 
   Advantages: common letters: H, A, B, I, T. H and B are less common? But we have to use new letters.

 But note: we have only excluded C,R,N,E. So B, T, I, H, etc. are fair game.

 Alternatively, how about ""FLAIL""? But two L's? Not distinct.

 Or ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A at 2. Distinct letters. P, A, S, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E.

 This seems good: PASTY? But is it a word? It might be (a type of food). And common? Perhaps.

 But we also have the option ""PASTA"" but repeated A. I think PASTY is better because it has distinct letters.

 Another: ""MAJOR"" -> has R, excluded.

 How about ""BAWDY""? B, A, W, D, Y -> A at 2? But W and Y not very common? 

 I think ""PASTY"" or ""HABIT"" are both acceptable.

 Or even better: let's choose ""SPLAT"" if it is allowed? S, P, L, A, T -> distinct and A at position 4? 

 But then we are testing A at position 4. We don't know if it's position 2 or 4? 

 Since we know A is in the word but not at 3, we can test two possibilities: by putting A at position 2 we also cover the possibility that it is at 2? Actually, if we put A at 2 and it's the correct position, we get a ✓. If it's not, but in the word, we get a -.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A at the same position as the first guess? That is, avoid position 3 and choose a new position? 

 Let me assign probabilities: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are equally likely for A? Maybe.

 But without any other constraints, we can pick arbitrarily.

 I'll pick ""PASTY"": 
   P (new), A (test position 2), S (new), T (new), Y (new)

 This way we get information about P, S, T, Y and A at position 2.

 If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it's not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.

 So I'll go with ""PASTY""

 But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It's in word lists.

 Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.

 I'll choose ""HABIT"": 
   H: new
   A: position 2? 
   B: new
   I: new
   T: new

 This covers more vowels? We have A and I.

 So, let's pick ""HABIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.

 So no.

 Decision: I'll guess ""HABIT""

<guess>HABIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is present but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess, I need a word that includes A (in any position except 3) and avoids C, R, N, E. I selected ""HABIT"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (to test a new position for A, since position 3 is invalid).
- It introduces new common consonants (H, B, T) and a vowel (I), avoiding excluded letters.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information feedback.

<guess>HABIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
First guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and got a dash).

Second guess: HABIT -> H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, B, I, T are not in the secret word.
  - A is again in the word but this time it was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not at position 2.

So, combining both:
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T
- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we know that the secret word has 5 letters, includes A, and excludes the above letters.

We must now make a third guess. The guess must:
1. Include the letter A (only once? we don't know, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet) in position 1, 4, or 5.
2. Not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T.

Remaining common letters: We have used A, and excluded consonants: C, R, N, H, B, T, and vowels: E, I. Common vowels left: O, U. Common consonants: S, L, D, P, M, W, Y, G, K, V, etc.

We also know no other letters from the word yet beyond A. So we need to test many new letters.

Since A is at position 1, 4, or 5, let's try to cover multiple unknowns at once.

We should choose a word with A in one of the allowed positions and include other common unused letters.

Options:
- Place A at the beginning: A _ _ _ _
- Or at the end: _ _ _ _ A
- Or in the fourth position: _ _ _ A _

Possible words:

Option A in position 1: 
- Words like A_ _ _ _: Using remaining letters (S, L, O, P, etc.)
  - Example: ""ASKED"" -> but E is excluded. Invalid.
  - ""ASSAY"" -> but S repeated? Also has S and Y. But E is excluded? Wait, no E. But assay: A, S, S, A, Y -> two S and two A? We don't know about repetition. Not ideal because repeated letters give less information.
  - ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters? Yes. A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). And avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T -> none of these. So ALOUD is a valid word.

Option A in position 4:
  - Example: _ _ _ A _
    - ""PLAZA"" -> P, L, A, Z, A -> repeated A and Z uncommon? Also, we don't know Z. Avoid?
    - ""FLOPS"" -> F, L, O, P, S -> but this has no A? We must include A. So we need a word that has A at position 4.
    - ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is excluded (from second guess)? From HABIT, T is excluded? So SPLAT has T -> invalid.

We must avoid T, so SPLAT is not allowed.

Alternative for position 4: 
  - ""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but this has A at position 4? Let's see: O P A L S -> no, A is at position 3? We need position 4? 
    Actually, OPALS: O(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A at position 3? That is not allowed because we know A is not at position 3? From both guesses, we know A isn't at 2 or 3. So position 3 is invalid.

We need A only at 1,4,5.

So for position 4: 
  - Words ending with A? But wait, position 4 is the fourth position. So the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?
  - Example: ""SPOOK"" -> no A? We need A. ""SPLA""? Not a word.

  How about ""SOLAR""? But R excluded and also has O, L, A, S? Position: S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R -> but R is excluded? Invalid.

Another idea: ""DOULA""? D, O, U, L, A -> positions: D(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), A(5). So A is at position 5? Also? But we can try position 5.

Option A in position 5: 
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Example: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but N and I are excluded? Invalid.
  - ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded and repeated.
  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> but C is excluded? Yes, invalid.
  - ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R excluded.
  - ""MOCHA"" -> M, O, C, H, A -> C and H excluded.

So difficult? How about ""JUMPS""? But no A.

We must have A at position 5.

Possible: ""GAUZY""? G, A, U, Z, Y -> not common? But if we want: A is at position 2? Then not. For position 5: 
  - ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> repeated and A at 2 and 4? We need A at end?
  - ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> repeated U and A at position 4? Not at 5.

Another: ""LILAC"" -> L, I, L, A, C -> I and C excluded? Invalid.

After some thought, let's go with A in position 1: ALOUD? Which I mentioned earlier: A, L, O, U, D -> all new letters? Yes: L, O, U, D.

Alternatively: ""ABOUT""? A, B, O, U, T -> but B and T are excluded? From second guess, HABIT: B(x) and T(x), so yes, excluded.

So ALOUD is acceptable.

Are there other words? 
- ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> but B and E excluded? Not valid.
- ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> N excluded? Yes, invalid.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> T excluded? Yes, from second guess T(x)? So invalid.

So ALOUD: A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). This avoids all excluded letters? Check: excluded letters: C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T. None in ALOUD. Good.

Moreover, it uses:
- A in position 1: to test if it's the correct position? If it is, we get A(✓). Else, we get A(-) again, meaning A is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5).

Also, we test L, O, U, D in positions 2,3,4,5.

So I think ""ALOUD"" is a good third guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ALOUD"".

Response format: 
<guess>ALOUD</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E from Guess 1 and H, B, I, T from Guess 2. These cannot be in the secret word.
- **Required letter A**: The letter A must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (as confirmed by both guesses). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the third guess:
- I selected **ALOUD** because:
  - It places A in position 1 to test one of the possible locations.
  - It introduces **new common letters**: L, O, U, D (none excluded).
  - All letters are distinct to maximize information gain.
  - If A is in position 1, it will be marked ✓; if not, it will show A is at position 4 or 5 (-) while revealing which of L, O, U, D are in the secret word.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and tests frequent unused letters.

But we have no information on vowels except A is in and E is out). However, AUDIO has A at 1 and contains U, D, I, O. And excludes C,R,N,E.\n\n But let\'s see: we also have the position constraint for A: we know it can\'t be at 3, but placing it at 1 is a possibility.\n\n Another idea: We might also try to put A in position 2? Or 4? Or 5? Since we have no information about the position except it\'s not 3.\n\n However, note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there might be multiple As. But until we see more feedback, we assume one A.\n\n Given that, I need a word that includes A and tests other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Let me think of words that don\'t have C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3.\n\n Some words:\n - SALAD? -> but it has two As and L and D. But let\'s check letters: S, A, L, D -> no C,R,N,E? But two As: but we don\'t know if the word has multiple As. However, SALAD has A at position 2 and 4, which might be okay.\n\n But SALAD has a repeated A. It might be safer to use a word without repeated letters to cover more ground.\n\n Alternatively: \n - PLAYS? -> P, L, A, Y, S -> A at position 3? But we can\'t put A at position 3 because it must not be at 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A anywhere except we hope to find its correct position. But we must avoid position 3? No, we can put A at position 3 again? Actually, we know the word has A but not at position 3. So we should try A at a new position.\n\n However, note: the ""-"" for A in the first guess (position 3) does not prevent us from putting A at position 3 in the next guess? We can, but it would be wasted because we know it\'s not the correct position. So it\'s better to try A in one of the other positions.\n\n Rules: \n - The secret word has A but not in position 3.\n - We can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n To maximize information, we should try A in a different position and use new letters.\n\n Another word: TALON. But contains O and L and N? Wait, N is excluded. So no.\n\n Let me avoid N.\n\n Words: \n - PASTA: P, A, S, T, A -> has two As? But A at positions 2 and 5. Also, letters: P, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E? Yes. But repeated A? We don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? They are, but for testing, maybe we avoid duplicates to get more information.\n\n But PASTA has A at 2 and 5. That might be acceptable, but if the word actually has two As, we\'d get two marks.\n\n Alternatively, a word without duplicate letters: \n - SHALT? Not common. \n - PAINT? Contains N -> excluded.\n - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S -> A at position 2? This has unique letters.\n\n MAULS: \n   Position: M, A, U, L, S -> A at 2.\n\n Another: SPLAT: S, P, L, A, T -> A at position 4. This has S, P, L, A, T -> all distinct and avoids excluded letters.\n\n But where is the A? Position 4.\n\n Alternatively: OPALS? O, P, A, L, S -> A at position 3? But we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3 again? But we know it\'s not the correct position so we might get the same feedback. It\'s better to avoid position 3 to test other positions.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word with A not at position 3.\n\n Why not try A at the beginning? For example: ALPHA? Contains P and L and H? But H is not very common? Also, has A twice? Not ideal.\n\n Alternatively: ALOUD? A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, A at 1. But has O and U? Might be useful.\n\n But I\'m considering using SPLAT: placing A at position 4.\n\n Another common word: TRAIL? But contains R, which we know is excluded -> invalid.\n\n Another: PLAZA? Two As -> not ideal.\n\n After evaluation, let\'s pick a word with A at position 1 or 2, and include other common consonants.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a popular word, but it has E -> excluded.\n\n So, avoid E.\n\n I found: ""SOLAR"" -> but contains R and O -> R is excluded.\n\n Need no R.\n\n How about: ""DOULA""? Not common.\n\n Let me try: ""PLAIT"" -> but contains I and T, but also T? Wait, no: P, L, A, I, T -> but N? No, excluded? N is excluded, but not I or T. But PLAIT has A at position 3? Not allowed because we know A isn\'t at 3? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at 3, but we can put A at 3 to check? But that wouldn\'t be efficient.\n\n Another idea: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T -> A at position 2. This avoids C,R,N,E? Yes: H, A, B, I, T. Also, distinct letters.\n\n So ""HABIT"" is a valid word: \n   H, A, B, I, T -> letters not excluded.\n\n Similarly: ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A at 2? This also avoids C,R,N,E.\n\n But W and Z are less common.\n\n How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? Avoids C,R,N,E.\n\n Also: ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? So not as good.\n\n We want more distinct letters.\n\n So ""DAILY"" or ""HABIT"" might be good.\n\n Another option: ""MANOR"" -> contains M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are excluded, so invalid.\n\n Let\'s stick with ""HABIT"": \n   Advantages: common letters: H, A, B, I, T. H and B are less common? But we have to use new letters.\n\n But note: we have only excluded C,R,N,E. So B, T, I, H, etc. are fair game.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""FLAIL""? But two L\'s? Not distinct.\n\n Or ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A at 2. Distinct letters. P, A, S, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E.\n\n This seems good: PASTY? But is it a word? It might be (a type of food). And common? Perhaps.\n\n But we also have the option ""PASTA"" but repeated A. I think PASTY is better because it has distinct letters.\n\n Another: ""MAJOR"" -> has R, excluded.\n\n How about ""BAWDY""? B, A, W, D, Y -> A at 2? But W and Y not very common? \n\n I think ""PASTY"" or ""HABIT"" are both acceptable.\n\n Or even better: let\'s choose ""SPLAT"" if it is allowed? S, P, L, A, T -> distinct and A at position 4? \n\n But then we are testing A at position 4. We don\'t know if it\'s position 2 or 4? \n\n Since we know A is in the word but not at 3, we can test two possibilities: by putting A at position 2 we also cover the possibility that it is at 2? Actually, if we put A at 2 and it\'s the correct position, we get a ✓. If it\'s not, but in the word, we get a -.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have A at the same position as the first guess? That is, avoid position 3 and choose a new position? \n\n Let me assign probabilities: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are equally likely for A? Maybe.\n\n But without any other constraints, we can pick arbitrarily.\n\n I\'ll pick ""PASTY"": \n   P (new), A (test position 2), S (new), T (new), Y (new)\n\n This way we get information about P, S, T, Y and A at position 2.\n\n If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it\'s not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""PASTY""\n\n But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It\'s in word lists.\n\n Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.\n\n I\'ll choose ""HABIT"": \n   H: new\n   A: position 2? \n   B: new\n   I: new\n   T: new\n\n This covers more vowels? We have A and I.\n\n So, let\'s pick ""HABIT"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.\n\n So no.\n\n Decision: I\'ll guess ""HABIT""\n\n<guess>HABIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- A is present but **not in position 3**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that includes A (in any position except 3) and avoids C, R, N, E.

Not at 5.\n\nAnother: ""LILAC"" -> L, I, L, A, C -> I and C excluded? Invalid.\n\nAfter some thought, let\'s go with A in position 1: ALOUD?

From second guess, HABIT: B(x) and T(x), so yes, excluded.\n\nSo ALOUD is acceptable.\n\nAre there other words? \n- ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> but B and E excluded? Not valid.\n- ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> N excluded? Yes, invalid.\n- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> T excluded? Yes, from second guess T(x)? So invalid.\n\nSo ALOUD: A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). This avoids all excluded letters? Check: excluded letters: C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T. None in ALOUD. Good.\n\nMoreover, it uses:\n- A in position 1: to test if it\'s the correct position? If it is, we get A(✓). Else, we get A(-) again, meaning A is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5).\n\nAlso, we test L, O, U, D in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nSo I think ""ALOUD"" is a good third guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""ALOUD"".\n\nResponse format: \n<guess>ALOUD</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E from Guess 1 and H, B, I, T from Guess 2.

Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the third guess:\n- I selected **ALOUD** because:\n  - It places A in position 1 to test one of the possible locations.\n  - It introduces **new common letters**: L, O, U, D (none excluded).\n  - All letters are distinct to maximize information gain.\n  - If A is in position 1, it will be marked ✓; if not, it will show A is at position 4 or 5 (-) while revealing which of L, O, U, D are in the secret word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and tests frequent unused letters.\n\n<guess>ALOUD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) O(x) U(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - A is present but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).

2. **HABIT**: H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)
   - H, B, I, T are absent.
   - A is still present but not in position 2 (so we knew A not in position 3 or 2).

3. **ALOUD**: A(✓), L(-), O(x), U(✓), D(x)
   - A is in position 1 and correct! (since marked ✓)
   - U is in position 4 and correct? Positions: 
        Guess: A L O U D
        Positions: 1: A, 2: L, 3: O, 4: U, 5: D
        So U(✓) means U is correct and in position 4.
   - L is present but not in position 2 (since - at position 2).
   - O and D are absent.

So from all the feedback:
- **Correct positions:**
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 4: U
- **Present letters but wrong position:**
   - L (but not in position 2; so L must be in position 3 or 5? Since positions 1 and 4 are taken by A and U)
     Possible positions left for L: 3 or 5? Because the word is 5 letters: 1=A, 4=U, so positions 2,3,5 are open? But we know from ALOUD guess that L cannot be in position 2 (because it got - meaning it's elsewhere). 
- **Absent letters:**
   - C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must start with A and the fourth letter is U. So pattern: A _ _ U _
- Must contain L (since L got - meaning present but not the right spot), and L cannot be in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 5? But position 5 is possible? 

Also, what letters are still available? We have excluded many: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D. And we have A and U fixed.

So the word looks like: A _ X U Y, where:
- X is a letter we haven't guessed yet? Because position 2: we guessed L and it was wrong position, so if L is in the word but not at 2, then L could be at 3 (so X is L?) or at 5 (so Y is L?).

But also, position 5: in ALOUD we guessed D and it was absent? So D is not there? Therefore, at position 5, we cannot have D? So we can rule out D? 

Moreover, we know the letter L must be in the word? But not at position 2? So in the secret word, L is either at position 3 or 5? 

However, let me consider: we have A at 1, U at 4? So positions 2,3,5 are open? 

But position 3: we guessed O and it was absent? So O is out? So position 3 must be a new letter? Or L? 

Actually, O was guessed at position 3 and marked absent. Therefore, the letter at position 3 is not O? But more importantly, since absent? So the letter at position 3 is not O? 

Now, what do we know? 
- The word: A ? ? U ? 
- Letters that must be included: L (because L got a dash) and we know it must be at either position 3 or 5? Because position 2 is not allowed? 
- Also, no other known letters? 

But wait: we also know that the word must have exactly these letters? And L is one of them? 

Moreover, the second position is unknown? But we have no constraints? Except it cannot be absent letters? 

So available letters? Since excluded letters are: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D? And absent from feedback? 

Remaining possible letters? Any letter not excluded? English letters: 
Common ones left: S, P, M, G, W, Y, F, K, V, Q, J, etc. 

Also, we must use one L? And the L must be either at position 3 or 5? 

Moreover, the secret word must be a valid 5-letter word: A, followed by some letter, then?, then U, and finally ?

So, putting L in position 3: then the word would be A _ L U ? 

But also, L might be in position 5: A _ ? U L? 

We need to make a guess that tests these possibilities.

But note: we have only one occurrence of L? Until proven otherwise? And we are not forced to use L again? Actually, we know L is present? So we must consider it? 

Also, the guess must be a valid word that fits the known parts.

Options:

Case 1: L in position 3 -> then word: A _ L U ? 
Case 2: L in position 5 -> then word: A _ ? U L

But position 3 cannot be any absent letter? So we have to choose a letter that hasn't been excluded? 

Similarly, position 2 we haven't guessed correctly? So we must guess a letter we haven't tried? Or if we include L? But L must be in the word? But if we put L in position 3? Or if we put L in position 5? 

But note: in our guess, we must only include letters that are not excluded? And we have L? But for the correct word? 

For the next guess, we want to test the position of L and also fill the blanks? 

Let me form words:

First possibility: A _ L U ? 
The last letter must be one of the available letters? And the second letter is? 
Possible words: 
   - AGLU? Not English?
   - AILU? Not valid? Also I is excluded? 
   - ASLUR? No, 6 letters? 
   Let's list: 
   - Valid words: 
        - Perhaps ""ASLUR""? Not valid? 
        - ""ALUM? But M? ALUM is 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters? 
        - Actually, ""ALULA"": A L U L A? But repeated? And letters L? But we have U fixed? We have A? But pattern: A L U? But we need A _? With L at 3? So A?L?U? Then the last would be ?. 

Wait, the word would be? A X L U Y? 
5-letter words starting with A and ending with U? Not common? 

But let me find words that fit: 
- A plus any letter? Then L, then U, then any letter? 
Known words? 
- ""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? 
- ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L? But N and I excluded? 
- ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T? But B,O,T excluded? 

These don't work? 

Second possibility: L in position 5? Then the word is A X ? U L? 

So: A X Y U L? 

Now, what words? 
- ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E excluded? 
- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E? I and E excluded? 
- ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E? E excluded? 
- ""ANGEL"": A, N, G, E, L? N and E excluded? 

What about words with U in position 4? 
- ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T? But D and T excluded? 
- ""AFOUL"": A, F, O, U, L? But O excluded? 
- ""AWFUL"": A, W, F, U, L? Pattern: A, W, F, U, L? Position 4 is U? Then L at the end? But letters: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:F, 4:U, 5:L? So it fits? And letters: W and F? Not excluded? 

Similarly: ""AFOUL"" has O? Excluded? 

So ""AWFUL""? Or ""BAWKS""? Not matching? 

Another: ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L? N excluded? 

Let me think of words: 
Possible words: 
  - ""ASHUR""? Not valid? 
  - ""AVIAN""? But position 4? U is required? Pattern A X Y U L doesn't match avian?
  - ""ASKEW""? No U? 

Wait, we require U at position 4? So only words ending with L and U at position 4? 

So: the word must be: position 1:A, position 4:U, position 5:L? But we don't know? Or if L at 3? 

Perhaps a more productive way: since we know A and U, and L must be either at 3 or 5? And we need to figure out which? We can make a guess that includes L at one of these positions? 

But note: the secret word might have other letters? So we need to test? 

Also, position 2 has to be filled? 

The available letters? We haven't used: S, P, M, W, Y, F, G, K, V, Q, J, X, Z? Etc. 

Additionally, we know L is in the word? So our guess must include L? Otherwise we don't test the position? 

So let's construct a guess that:
- Starts with A? Already fixed? No, our guess doesn't have to start with A? But the secret word does? But we know A is correct? So in the guess, position 1 should be A? Because it's known? Similarly, position 4 is U? Which is known? 

Actually, because we have A at 1 and U at 4? So we can plug those in? 

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we can provide a word of the form: A ? ? U ? 

And we know L is present? So one of the unknown positions must be L? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Moreover, we have to avoid excluded letters? 

So pattern: A ? ? U ? 
The ? positions: let's denote pos2, pos3, and pos5? And L must be in either pos3 or pos5? Because pos2 we tried L and it was wrong? 

So not at pos2? So pos3 or pos5 must be L? 

But we have two blanks: so we have to choose? 

But the word must be valid? 

So we need to choose a word where either:
- Position 3 is L: so A ? L U ? 
- Or position 5 is L: so A ? ? U L

And the other positions filled with available letters? 

Now, which case? We don't know? 

So we can prioritize common words? 

But let's find possibilities:

First, if L at position 3: word A ? L U ? 
Possible letters? And the whole must be a word? 
Examples:
   - ""AXLUS""? Not valid?
   - ""ARLES""? But position 4? It's U? So no? 
   - Hard to find? 

Alternatively, L at position 5: A ? ? U L
Examples:
   - ""ABUTL""? Not valid? 
   - ""ANNUL""? But N excluded? 
   - ""APPUL""? Not common? 
   - ""ARNUL""? R excluded? 

Wait, actually ""AMPUL"" is a word? But E? No? ""AMPUL"": A, M, P, U, L? Which is A? M? P? U? L? So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:U, 5:L? 
Yes! This fits? And letters: M and P? Not excluded? 

Also, ""ANYUL""? Not valid? 

Another word: ""ASPUL""? Not standard? 

So ""AMPUL""? It is a 5-letter word? Meaning: a small, sealed container. Yes.

But are there others? For instance, ""ABUL? No? 

But if we don't use L at 5? We use L at 3? 

A?L U?Y? 
With U at position 4? 

For example: ""ALULE""? Not valid? 
""ALLYU""? Invalid? 

So maybe L at position 5 is more likely? 

But we don't know? 

If we guess ""AMPUL"": 
- Positions: 
   1: A -> should be ✓? 
   2: M -> unknown? 
   3: P -> unknown? 
   4: U -> ✓? 
   5: L -> we know L is in the word? So if L is not at position 5? It might get marked as - if it's present elsewhere? Or x if not? 

Wait, but position 5: if in our guess we put L at 5? And the secret word has L at 3? Then position 5 might be different? And L might get marked as - because it's in the word but not at 5? Because L is also at 3? 

But we have no indication the secret word has multiple Ls? So it might? 

Therefore, if we guess ""AMPUL"", the feedback might tell us:

- If L is in the word and at position 5, we get ✓ at position 5? Then we have solved L? 
- If L is at position 3? Then in our guess, position 5 and position 2,3? How? 

Specifically, for secret word: suppose L is at position 3? Then our guess A M P U L? 
At position 5: guess L? But secret word has L at position 3? So it might be that the word has only one L? Then our guess puts L at 5? Which is not? So we get L marked as absent? Or since L is in the secret word? One L? So when we guess L at 5? And secret L is at 3? Then we get L at 5 as - (because it's somewhere else) and also? But: 

In Wordle rules? Only one L? So if secret has L at 3? And we guess L at 5? Then position5 gets -? And what about position3? We guessed P? Which might be something else? 

Alternatively, if secret has L at 3? Then our position3: P? Which would be marked as letter at that position? 

But our goal is to test the position of L? 

Another possibility: guess a word that has L at position 3? 

For example: A ? L U ? 
With ? being non excluded letters? 

But hard to find words? ""ACYLU""? Not English? 

What about ""ALLYU""? Not valid? 
""ALIB""? Not long enough? 

Actually, ""ALURE"": A, L, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? 
""ALLEU"": Not common? And contains E? 

After research? Few words match A?L U? 

So maybe L at position 5 is more common? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""AMPUL"" to test? It also has M and P? Which we haven't tried? And avoids excluded letters? 

But we have fixed A and U? So we guess ""AMPUL""? 

Alternatively, if L is not at position 5? Then we get feedback that allows us to know? 

So the response: ""AMPUL""

But let me confirm the letters: 
In ""AMPUL"": 
   A: position1? Should be correct? 
   M: new? Position2? 
   P: new? Position3? 
   U: position4? Should be correct? 
   L: position5? We want to see if it's correct? 

This way, if L is correct, then the word is AMPUL? 
If not? Then L is likely at position3? 

But also? The secret might be something else? Like ""AVOW"" but not matching? 

Moreover, we have to confirm? 

Perhaps we should use a word that can have L in either position? But I'm not finding? 

Another word: ""ASKUL""? Not valid? 

So I think ""AMPUL"" is reasonable? 

But let's look at our feedback: 

We know L exists? So we must include L in the guess? Because if we don't? We violate? But in ""AMPUL"", we do include L? So that's fine? 

Therefore, guess ""AMPUL""? 

More common: ""ALTUS"" but position? 
Or ""ANVIL"" excluded? 

I think ""AMPUL"" is acceptable? 

Response: <guess>AMPUL</guess>
</think>
Based on the accumulated feedback from previous guesses:

- **Known Positions**: Position 1 is **A**, and position 4 is **U**. Thus, the secret word pattern is: `A _ _ U _`.
- **Present Letter**: **L** must be in the word (since it was marked ""─"" in Guess 3) but not in position 2 (as confirmed by Guess 3 feedback). Therefore, **L** must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Definitely Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D (from all previous feedback).

For this fourth guess:
- I selected **AMPUL** because:
  - It adheres to the pattern `A _ _ U _`, with positions 1 and 4 confirmed as A and U respectively.
  - It tests **L** in position 5 (to resolve whether L belongs at position 3 or 5).
  - It introduces **M** and **P** (new untested letters) in positions 2 and 3.
  - All letters avoid excluded characters, maximizing information gain:
    - If L is correct in position 5, we solve the word.
    - If L is marked ""─"", it means L must be in position 3 (and AMPUL is wrong).
    - We also learn about M and P in positions 2 and 3.

This guess efficiently narrows down L’s position and tests common unused consonants.

<guess>AMPUL</guess>",AMPUL,"We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - A is present but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).

2. **HABIT**: H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)
   - H, B, I, T are absent.
   - A is still present but not in position 2 (so we knew A not in position 3 or 2).

3. **ALOUD**: A(✓), L(-), O(x), U(✓), D(x)
   - A is in position 1 and correct! (since marked ✓)
   - U is in position 4 and correct? Positions: 
        Guess: A L O U D
        Positions: 1: A, 2: L, 3: O, 4: U, 5: D
        So U(✓) means U is correct and in position 4.
   - L is present but not in position 2 (since - at position 2).
   - O and D are absent.

So from all the feedback:
- **Correct positions:**
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 4: U
- **Present letters but wrong position:**
   - L (but not in position 2; so L must be in position 3 or 5? Since positions 1 and 4 are taken by A and U)
     Possible positions left for L: 3 or 5? Because the word is 5 letters: 1=A, 4=U, so positions 2,3,5 are open? But we know from ALOUD guess that L cannot be in position 2 (because it got - meaning it's elsewhere). 
- **Absent letters:**
   - C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must start with A and the fourth letter is U. So pattern: A _ _ U _
- Must contain L (since L got - meaning present but not the right spot), and L cannot be in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 5? But position 5 is possible? 

Also, what letters are still available? We have excluded many: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D. And we have A and U fixed.

So the word looks like: A _ X U Y, where:
- X is a letter we haven't guessed yet? Because position 2: we guessed L and it was wrong position, so if L is in the word but not at 2, then L could be at 3 (so X is L?) or at 5 (so Y is L?).

But also, position 5: in ALOUD we guessed D and it was absent? So D is not there? Therefore, at position 5, we cannot have D? So we can rule out D? 

Moreover, we know the letter L must be in the word? But not at position 2? So in the secret word, L is either at position 3 or 5? 

However, let me consider: we have A at 1, U at 4? So positions 2,3,5 are open? 

But position 3: we guessed O and it was absent? So O is out? So position 3 must be a new letter? Or L? 

Actually, O was guessed at position 3 and marked absent. Therefore, the letter at position 3 is not O? But more importantly, since absent? So the letter at position 3 is not O? 

Now, what do we know? 
- The word: A ? ? U ? 
- Letters that must be included: L (because L got a dash) and we know it must be at either position 3 or 5? Because position 2 is not allowed? 
- Also, no other known letters? 

But wait: we also know that the word must have exactly these letters? And L is one of them? 

Moreover, the second position is unknown? But we have no constraints? Except it cannot be absent letters? 

So available letters? Since excluded letters are: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D? And absent from feedback? 

Remaining possible letters? Any letter not excluded? English letters: 
Common ones left: S, P, M, G, W, Y, F, K, V, Q, J, etc. 

Also, we must use one L? And the L must be either at position 3 or 5? 

Moreover, the secret word must be a valid 5-letter word: A, followed by some letter, then?, then U, and finally ?

So, putting L in position 3: then the word would be A _ L U ? 

But also, L might be in position 5: A _ ? U L? 

We need to make a guess that tests these possibilities.

But note: we have only one occurrence of L? Until proven otherwise? And we are not forced to use L again? Actually, we know L is present? So we must consider it? 

Also, the guess must be a valid word that fits the known parts.

Options:

Case 1: L in position 3 -> then word: A _ L U ? 
Case 2: L in position 5 -> then word: A _ ? U L

But position 3 cannot be any absent letter? So we have to choose a letter that hasn't been excluded? 

Similarly, position 2 we haven't guessed correctly? So we must guess a letter we haven't tried? Or if we include L? But L must be in the word? But if we put L in position 3? Or if we put L in position 5? 

But note: in our guess, we must only include letters that are not excluded? And we have L? But for the correct word? 

For the next guess, we want to test the position of L and also fill the blanks? 

Let me form words:

First possibility: A _ L U ? 
The last letter must be one of the available letters? And the second letter is? 
Possible words: 
   - AGLU? Not English?
   - AILU? Not valid? Also I is excluded? 
   - ASLUR? No, 6 letters? 
   Let's list: 
   - Valid words: 
        - Perhaps ""ASLUR""? Not valid? 
        - ""ALUM? But M? ALUM is 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters? 
        - Actually, ""ALULA"": A L U L A? But repeated? And letters L? But we have U fixed? We have A? But pattern: A L U? But we need A _? With L at 3? So A?L?U? Then the last would be ?. 

Wait, the word would be? A X L U Y? 
5-letter words starting with A and ending with U? Not common? 

But let me find words that fit: 
- A plus any letter? Then L, then U, then any letter? 
Known words? 
- ""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? 
- ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L? But N and I excluded? 
- ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T? But B,O,T excluded? 

These don't work? 

Second possibility: L in position 5? Then the word is A X ? U L? 

So: A X Y U L? 

Now, what words? 
- ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E excluded? 
- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E? I and E excluded? 
- ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E? E excluded? 
- ""ANGEL"": A, N, G, E, L? N and E excluded? 

What about words with U in position 4? 
- ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T? But D and T excluded? 
- ""AFOUL"": A, F, O, U, L? But O excluded? 
- ""AWFUL"": A, W, F, U, L? Pattern: A, W, F, U, L? Position 4 is U? Then L at the end? But letters: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:F, 4:U, 5:L? So it fits? And letters: W and F? Not excluded? 

Similarly: ""AFOUL"" has O? Excluded? 

So ""AWFUL""? Or ""BAWKS""? Not matching? 

Another: ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L? N excluded? 

Let me think of words: 
Possible words: 
  - ""ASHUR""? Not valid? 
  - ""AVIAN""? But position 4? U is required? Pattern A X Y U L doesn't match avian?
  - ""ASKEW""? No U? 

Wait, we require U at position 4? So only words ending with L and U at position 4? 

So: the word must be: position 1:A, position 4:U, position 5:L? But we don't know? Or if L at 3? 

Perhaps a more productive way: since we know A and U, and L must be either at 3 or 5? And we need to figure out which? We can make a guess that includes L at one of these positions? 

But note: the secret word might have other letters? So we need to test? 

Also, position 2 has to be filled? 

The available letters? We haven't used: S, P, M, W, Y, F, G, K, V, Q, J, X, Z? Etc. 

Additionally, we know L is in the word? So our guess must include L? Otherwise we don't test the position? 

So let's construct a guess that:
- Starts with A? Already fixed? No, our guess doesn't have to start with A? But the secret word does? But we know A is correct? So in the guess, position 1 should be A? Because it's known? Similarly, position 4 is U? Which is known? 

Actually, because we have A at 1 and U at 4? So we can plug those in? 

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we can provide a word of the form: A ? ? U ? 

And we know L is present? So one of the unknown positions must be L? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Moreover, we have to avoid excluded letters? 

So pattern: A ? ? U ? 
The ? positions: let's denote pos2, pos3, and pos5? And L must be in either pos3 or pos5? Because pos2 we tried L and it was wrong? 

So not at pos2? So pos3 or pos5 must be L? 

But we have two blanks: so we have to choose? 

But the word must be valid? 

So we need to choose a word where either:
- Position 3 is L: so A ? L U ? 
- Or position 5 is L: so A ? ? U L

And the other positions filled with available letters? 

Now, which case? We don't know? 

So we can prioritize common words? 

But let's find possibilities:

First, if L at position 3: word A ? L U ? 
Possible letters? And the whole must be a word? 
Examples:
   - ""AXLUS""? Not valid?
   - ""ARLES""? But position 4? It's U? So no? 
   - Hard to find? 

Alternatively, L at position 5: A ? ? U L
Examples:
   - ""ABUTL""? Not valid? 
   - ""ANNUL""? But N excluded? 
   - ""APPUL""? Not common? 
   - ""ARNUL""? R excluded? 

Wait, actually ""AMPUL"" is a word? But E? No? ""AMPUL"": A, M, P, U, L? Which is A? M? P? U? L? So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:U, 5:L? 
Yes! This fits? And letters: M and P? Not excluded? 

Also, ""ANYUL""? Not valid? 

Another word: ""ASPUL""? Not standard? 

So ""AMPUL""? It is a 5-letter word? Meaning: a small, sealed container. Yes.

But are there others? For instance, ""ABUL? No? 

But if we don't use L at 5? We use L at 3? 

A?L U?Y? 
With U at position 4? 

For example: ""ALULE""? Not valid? 
""ALLYU""? Invalid? 

So maybe L at position 5 is more likely? 

But we don't know? 

If we guess ""AMPUL"": 
- Positions: 
   1: A -> should be ✓? 
   2: M -> unknown? 
   3: P -> unknown? 
   4: U -> ✓? 
   5: L -> we know L is in the word? So if L is not at position 5? It might get marked as - if it's present elsewhere? Or x if not? 

Wait, but position 5: if in our guess we put L at 5? And the secret word has L at 3? Then position 5 might be different? And L might get marked as - because it's in the word but not at 5? Because L is also at 3? 

But we have no indication the secret word has multiple Ls? So it might? 

Therefore, if we guess ""AMPUL"", the feedback might tell us:

- If L is in the word and at position 5, we get ✓ at position 5? Then we have solved L? 
- If L is at position 3? Then in our guess, position 5 and position 2,3? How? 

Specifically, for secret word: suppose L is at position 3? Then our guess A M P U L? 
At position 5: guess L? But secret word has L at position 3? So it might be that the word has only one L? Then our guess puts L at 5? Which is not? So we get L marked as absent? Or since L is in the secret word? One L? So when we guess L at 5? And secret L is at 3? Then we get L at 5 as - (because it's somewhere else) and also? But: 

In Wordle rules? Only one L? So if secret has L at 3? And we guess L at 5? Then position5 gets -? And what about position3? We guessed P? Which might be something else? 

Alternatively, if secret has L at 3? Then our position3: P? Which would be marked as letter at that position? 

But our goal is to test the position of L? 

Another possibility: guess a word that has L at position 3? 

For example: A ? L U ? 
With ? being non excluded letters? 

But hard to find words? ""ACYLU""? Not English? 

What about ""ALLYU""? Not valid? 
""ALIB""? Not long enough? 

Actually, ""ALURE"": A, L, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? 
""ALLEU"": Not common? And contains E? 

After research? Few words match A?L U? 

So maybe L at position 5 is more common? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""AMPUL"" to test? It also has M and P? Which we haven't tried? And avoids excluded letters? 

But we have fixed A and U? So we guess ""AMPUL""? 

Alternatively, if L is not at position 5? Then we get feedback that allows us to know? 

So the response: ""AMPUL""

But let me confirm the letters: 
In ""AMPUL"": 
   A: position1? Should be correct? 
   M: new? Position2? 
   P: new? Position3? 
   U: position4? Should be correct? 
   L: position5? We want to see if it's correct? 

This way, if L is correct, then the word is AMPUL? 
If not? Then L is likely at position3? 

But also? The secret might be something else? Like ""AVOW"" but not matching? 

Moreover, we have to confirm? 

Perhaps we should use a word that can have L in either position? But I'm not finding? 

Another word: ""ASKUL""? Not valid? 

So I think ""AMPUL"" is reasonable? 

But let's look at our feedback: 

We know L exists? So we must include L in the guess? Because if we don't? We violate? But in ""AMPUL"", we do include L? So that's fine? 

Therefore, guess ""AMPUL""? 

More common: ""ALTUS"" but position? 
Or ""ANVIL"" excluded? 

I think ""AMPUL"" is acceptable? 

Response: <guess>AMPUL</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback from previous guesses:

- **Known Positions**: Position 1 is **A**, and position 4 is **U**. Thus, the secret word pattern is: `A _ _ U _`.
- **Present Letter**: **L** must be in the word (since it was marked ""─"" in Guess 3) but not in position 2 (as confirmed by Guess 3 feedback). Therefore, **L** must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Definitely Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D (from all previous feedback).

For this fourth guess:
- I selected **AMPUL** because:
  - It adheres to the pattern `A _ _ U _`, with positions 1 and 4 confirmed as A and U respectively.
  - It tests **L** in position 5 (to resolve whether L belongs at position 3 or 5).
  - It introduces **M** and **P** (new untested letters) in positions 2 and 3.
  - All letters avoid excluded characters, maximizing information gain:
    - If L is correct in position 5, we solve the word.
    - If L is marked ""─"", it means L must be in position 3 (and AMPUL is wrong).
    - We also learn about M and P in positions 2 and 3.

This guess efficiently narrows down L’s position and tests common unused consonants.",Guess 4: AMPUL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) P(x) U(✓) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,AWFUL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, and there's no prior information. So we should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include words with common letters and distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers several common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) and all distinct letters.

 So my first guess is: ""CRANE""I'm starting my first guess without any prior clues. I need a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback information. A good starting word often has unique letters and covers vowels like A, E and common consonants like R, S, or T. I'll use ""CRANE"" – it satisfies this with five distinct letters and hits multiple common sounds. After this guess, the feedback will reveal initial letter positions and inclusions to guide future guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word at all.
 - R is not in the secret word at all.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (because it was at position 3 in CRANE).
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter A, but not at position 3 (since it was marked as - meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Also, since A is present but not at position 3, it must be at one of the other positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that respects this information.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 - Must include the letter A (since we know A is in the word), but not at position 3.
 - Must not include C, R, N, E.

 Also, to maximize information, we should try to include new common letters and avoid the excluded ones.

 Let's think about what letters we haven't tried yet that are common in 5-letter words.

 We have excluded: C, R, E, N (and R was excluded, but note: R was in the first guess and marked absent). Also, we have included A and know it must be in the word.

 Remaining common vowels: O, U, I (since E is out)
 Common consonants: T, S, L, D, P, M, etc.

 Our goal is to test other common letters and also find the position of A.

 Since A is not at position 3, let's try a word that places A in a different position, say position 1 or 2.

 We also want to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E.

 Possible words:
 Let me list words that:
   - Have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - Do not contain C, R, N, E.

 Also, we have 5 other positions to fill with new letters.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O, P, M, H, etc.

 Try a word with A in position 1: 
   Options: A _ _ _ _ 
   Possible: AUDIO (but U and I are vowels, and O is a vowel? But we have no information on vowels except A is in and E is out). However, AUDIO has A at 1 and contains U, D, I, O. And excludes C,R,N,E.

 But let's see: we also have the position constraint for A: we know it can't be at 3, but placing it at 1 is a possibility.

 Another idea: We might also try to put A in position 2? Or 4? Or 5? Since we have no information about the position except it's not 3.

 However, note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there might be multiple As. But until we see more feedback, we assume one A.

 Given that, I need a word that includes A and tests other common consonants and vowels.

 Let me think of words that don't have C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3.

 Some words:
 - SALAD? -> but it has two As and L and D. But let's check letters: S, A, L, D -> no C,R,N,E? But two As: but we don't know if the word has multiple As. However, SALAD has A at position 2 and 4, which might be okay.

 But SALAD has a repeated A. It might be safer to use a word without repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Alternatively: 
 - PLAYS? -> P, L, A, Y, S -> A at position 3? But we can't put A at position 3 because it must not be at 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A anywhere except we hope to find its correct position. But we must avoid position 3? No, we can put A at position 3 again? Actually, we know the word has A but not at position 3. So we should try A at a new position.

 However, note: the ""-"" for A in the first guess (position 3) does not prevent us from putting A at position 3 in the next guess? We can, but it would be wasted because we know it's not the correct position. So it's better to try A in one of the other positions.

 Rules: 
 - The secret word has A but not in position 3.
 - We can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 To maximize information, we should try A in a different position and use new letters.

 Another word: TALON. But contains O and L and N? Wait, N is excluded. So no.

 Let me avoid N.

 Words: 
 - PASTA: P, A, S, T, A -> has two As? But A at positions 2 and 5. Also, letters: P, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E? Yes. But repeated A? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? They are, but for testing, maybe we avoid duplicates to get more information.

 But PASTA has A at 2 and 5. That might be acceptable, but if the word actually has two As, we'd get two marks.

 Alternatively, a word without duplicate letters: 
 - SHALT? Not common. 
 - PAINT? Contains N -> excluded.
 - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S -> A at position 2? This has unique letters.

 MAULS: 
   Position: M, A, U, L, S -> A at 2.

 Another: SPLAT: S, P, L, A, T -> A at position 4. This has S, P, L, A, T -> all distinct and avoids excluded letters.

 But where is the A? Position 4.

 Alternatively: OPALS? O, P, A, L, S -> A at position 3? But we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position so we might get the same feedback. It's better to avoid position 3 to test other positions.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with A not at position 3.

 Why not try A at the beginning? For example: ALPHA? Contains P and L and H? But H is not very common? Also, has A twice? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ALOUD? A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, A at 1. But has O and U? Might be useful.

 But I'm considering using SPLAT: placing A at position 4.

 Another common word: TRAIL? But contains R, which we know is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: PLAZA? Two As -> not ideal.

 After evaluation, let's pick a word with A at position 1 or 2, and include other common consonants.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a popular word, but it has E -> excluded.

 So, avoid E.

 I found: ""SOLAR"" -> but contains R and O -> R is excluded.

 Need no R.

 How about: ""DOULA""? Not common.

 Let me try: ""PLAIT"" -> but contains I and T, but also T? Wait, no: P, L, A, I, T -> but N? No, excluded? N is excluded, but not I or T. But PLAIT has A at position 3? Not allowed because we know A isn't at 3? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at 3, but we can put A at 3 to check? But that wouldn't be efficient.

 Another idea: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T -> A at position 2. This avoids C,R,N,E? Yes: H, A, B, I, T. Also, distinct letters.

 So ""HABIT"" is a valid word: 
   H, A, B, I, T -> letters not excluded.

 Similarly: ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A at 2? This also avoids C,R,N,E.

 But W and Z are less common.

 How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? Avoids C,R,N,E.

 Also: ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? So not as good.

 We want more distinct letters.

 So ""DAILY"" or ""HABIT"" might be good.

 Another option: ""MANOR"" -> contains M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are excluded, so invalid.

 Let's stick with ""HABIT"": 
   Advantages: common letters: H, A, B, I, T. H and B are less common? But we have to use new letters.

 But note: we have only excluded C,R,N,E. So B, T, I, H, etc. are fair game.

 Alternatively, how about ""FLAIL""? But two L's? Not distinct.

 Or ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A at 2. Distinct letters. P, A, S, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E.

 This seems good: PASTY? But is it a word? It might be (a type of food). And common? Perhaps.

 But we also have the option ""PASTA"" but repeated A. I think PASTY is better because it has distinct letters.

 Another: ""MAJOR"" -> has R, excluded.

 How about ""BAWDY""? B, A, W, D, Y -> A at 2? But W and Y not very common? 

 I think ""PASTY"" or ""HABIT"" are both acceptable.

 Or even better: let's choose ""SPLAT"" if it is allowed? S, P, L, A, T -> distinct and A at position 4? 

 But then we are testing A at position 4. We don't know if it's position 2 or 4? 

 Since we know A is in the word but not at 3, we can test two possibilities: by putting A at position 2 we also cover the possibility that it is at 2? Actually, if we put A at 2 and it's the correct position, we get a ✓. If it's not, but in the word, we get a -.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A at the same position as the first guess? That is, avoid position 3 and choose a new position? 

 Let me assign probabilities: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are equally likely for A? Maybe.

 But without any other constraints, we can pick arbitrarily.

 I'll pick ""PASTY"": 
   P (new), A (test position 2), S (new), T (new), Y (new)

 This way we get information about P, S, T, Y and A at position 2.

 If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it's not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.

 So I'll go with ""PASTY""

 But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It's in word lists.

 Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.

 I'll choose ""HABIT"": 
   H: new
   A: position 2? 
   B: new
   I: new
   T: new

 This covers more vowels? We have A and I.

 So, let's pick ""HABIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.

 So no.

 Decision: I'll guess ""HABIT""

<guess>HABIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is present but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess, I need a word that includes A (in any position except 3) and avoids C, R, N, E. I selected ""HABIT"" because:
- It places A in position 2 (to test a new position for A, since position 3 is invalid).
- It introduces new common consonants (H, B, T) and a vowel (I), avoiding excluded letters.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information feedback.

<guess>HABIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
First guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and got a dash).

Second guess: HABIT -> H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, B, I, T are not in the secret word.
  - A is again in the word but this time it was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not at position 2.

So, combining both:
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T
- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we know that the secret word has 5 letters, includes A, and excludes the above letters.

We must now make a third guess. The guess must:
1. Include the letter A (only once? we don't know, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet) in position 1, 4, or 5.
2. Not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T.

Remaining common letters: We have used A, and excluded consonants: C, R, N, H, B, T, and vowels: E, I. Common vowels left: O, U. Common consonants: S, L, D, P, M, W, Y, G, K, V, etc.

We also know no other letters from the word yet beyond A. So we need to test many new letters.

Since A is at position 1, 4, or 5, let's try to cover multiple unknowns at once.

We should choose a word with A in one of the allowed positions and include other common unused letters.

Options:
- Place A at the beginning: A _ _ _ _
- Or at the end: _ _ _ _ A
- Or in the fourth position: _ _ _ A _

Possible words:

Option A in position 1: 
- Words like A_ _ _ _: Using remaining letters (S, L, O, P, etc.)
  - Example: ""ASKED"" -> but E is excluded. Invalid.
  - ""ASSAY"" -> but S repeated? Also has S and Y. But E is excluded? Wait, no E. But assay: A, S, S, A, Y -> two S and two A? We don't know about repetition. Not ideal because repeated letters give less information.
  - ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters? Yes. A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). And avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T -> none of these. So ALOUD is a valid word.

Option A in position 4:
  - Example: _ _ _ A _
    - ""PLAZA"" -> P, L, A, Z, A -> repeated A and Z uncommon? Also, we don't know Z. Avoid?
    - ""FLOPS"" -> F, L, O, P, S -> but this has no A? We must include A. So we need a word that has A at position 4.
    - ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is excluded (from second guess)? From HABIT, T is excluded? So SPLAT has T -> invalid.

We must avoid T, so SPLAT is not allowed.

Alternative for position 4: 
  - ""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but this has A at position 4? Let's see: O P A L S -> no, A is at position 3? We need position 4? 
    Actually, OPALS: O(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A at position 3? That is not allowed because we know A is not at position 3? From both guesses, we know A isn't at 2 or 3. So position 3 is invalid.

We need A only at 1,4,5.

So for position 4: 
  - Words ending with A? But wait, position 4 is the fourth position. So the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?
  - Example: ""SPOOK"" -> no A? We need A. ""SPLA""? Not a word.

  How about ""SOLAR""? But R excluded and also has O, L, A, S? Position: S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R -> but R is excluded? Invalid.

Another idea: ""DOULA""? D, O, U, L, A -> positions: D(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), A(5). So A is at position 5? Also? But we can try position 5.

Option A in position 5: 
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Example: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but N and I are excluded? Invalid.
  - ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded and repeated.
  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> but C is excluded? Yes, invalid.
  - ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R excluded.
  - ""MOCHA"" -> M, O, C, H, A -> C and H excluded.

So difficult? How about ""JUMPS""? But no A.

We must have A at position 5.

Possible: ""GAUZY""? G, A, U, Z, Y -> not common? But if we want: A is at position 2? Then not. For position 5: 
  - ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> repeated and A at 2 and 4? We need A at end?
  - ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> repeated U and A at position 4? Not at 5.

Another: ""LILAC"" -> L, I, L, A, C -> I and C excluded? Invalid.

After some thought, let's go with A in position 1: ALOUD? Which I mentioned earlier: A, L, O, U, D -> all new letters? Yes: L, O, U, D.

Alternatively: ""ABOUT""? A, B, O, U, T -> but B and T are excluded? From second guess, HABIT: B(x) and T(x), so yes, excluded.

So ALOUD is acceptable.

Are there other words? 
- ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> but B and E excluded? Not valid.
- ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> N excluded? Yes, invalid.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> T excluded? Yes, from second guess T(x)? So invalid.

So ALOUD: A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). This avoids all excluded letters? Check: excluded letters: C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T. None in ALOUD. Good.

Moreover, it uses:
- A in position 1: to test if it's the correct position? If it is, we get A(✓). Else, we get A(-) again, meaning A is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5).

Also, we test L, O, U, D in positions 2,3,4,5.

So I think ""ALOUD"" is a good third guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""ALOUD"".

Response format: 
<guess>ALOUD</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E from Guess 1 and H, B, I, T from Guess 2. These cannot be in the secret word.
- **Required letter A**: The letter A must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (as confirmed by both guesses). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the third guess:
- I selected **ALOUD** because:
  - It places A in position 1 to test one of the possible locations.
  - It introduces **new common letters**: L, O, U, D (none excluded).
  - All letters are distinct to maximize information gain.
  - If A is in position 1, it will be marked ✓; if not, it will show A is at position 4 or 5 (-) while revealing which of L, O, U, D are in the secret word.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and tests frequent unused letters.

<guess>ALOUD</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) O(x) U(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - A is present but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).

2. **HABIT**: H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)
   - H, B, I, T are absent.
   - A is still present but not in position 2 (so we knew A not in position 3 or 2).

3. **ALOUD**: A(✓), L(-), O(x), U(✓), D(x)
   - A is in position 1 and correct! (since marked ✓)
   - U is in position 4 and correct? Positions: 
        Guess: A L O U D
        Positions: 1: A, 2: L, 3: O, 4: U, 5: D
        So U(✓) means U is correct and in position 4.
   - L is present but not in position 2 (since - at position 2).
   - O and D are absent.

So from all the feedback:
- **Correct positions:**
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 4: U
- **Present letters but wrong position:**
   - L (but not in position 2; so L must be in position 3 or 5? Since positions 1 and 4 are taken by A and U)
     Possible positions left for L: 3 or 5? Because the word is 5 letters: 1=A, 4=U, so positions 2,3,5 are open? But we know from ALOUD guess that L cannot be in position 2 (because it got - meaning it's elsewhere). 
- **Absent letters:**
   - C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must start with A and the fourth letter is U. So pattern: A _ _ U _
- Must contain L (since L got - meaning present but not the right spot), and L cannot be in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 5? But position 5 is possible? 

Also, what letters are still available? We have excluded many: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D. And we have A and U fixed.

So the word looks like: A _ X U Y, where:
- X is a letter we haven't guessed yet? Because position 2: we guessed L and it was wrong position, so if L is in the word but not at 2, then L could be at 3 (so X is L?) or at 5 (so Y is L?).

But also, position 5: in ALOUD we guessed D and it was absent? So D is not there? Therefore, at position 5, we cannot have D? So we can rule out D? 

Moreover, we know the letter L must be in the word? But not at position 2? So in the secret word, L is either at position 3 or 5? 

However, let me consider: we have A at 1, U at 4? So positions 2,3,5 are open? 

But position 3: we guessed O and it was absent? So O is out? So position 3 must be a new letter? Or L? 

Actually, O was guessed at position 3 and marked absent. Therefore, the letter at position 3 is not O? But more importantly, since absent? So the letter at position 3 is not O? 

Now, what do we know? 
- The word: A ? ? U ? 
- Letters that must be included: L (because L got a dash) and we know it must be at either position 3 or 5? Because position 2 is not allowed? 
- Also, no other known letters? 

But wait: we also know that the word must have exactly these letters? And L is one of them? 

Moreover, the second position is unknown? But we have no constraints? Except it cannot be absent letters? 

So available letters? Since excluded letters are: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D? And absent from feedback? 

Remaining possible letters? Any letter not excluded? English letters: 
Common ones left: S, P, M, G, W, Y, F, K, V, Q, J, etc. 

Also, we must use one L? And the L must be either at position 3 or 5? 

Moreover, the secret word must be a valid 5-letter word: A, followed by some letter, then?, then U, and finally ?

So, putting L in position 3: then the word would be A _ L U ? 

But also, L might be in position 5: A _ ? U L? 

We need to make a guess that tests these possibilities.

But note: we have only one occurrence of L? Until proven otherwise? And we are not forced to use L again? Actually, we know L is present? So we must consider it? 

Also, the guess must be a valid word that fits the known parts.

Options:

Case 1: L in position 3 -> then word: A _ L U ? 
Case 2: L in position 5 -> then word: A _ ? U L

But position 3 cannot be any absent letter? So we have to choose a letter that hasn't been excluded? 

Similarly, position 2 we haven't guessed correctly? So we must guess a letter we haven't tried? Or if we include L? But L must be in the word? But if we put L in position 3? Or if we put L in position 5? 

But note: in our guess, we must only include letters that are not excluded? And we have L? But for the correct word? 

For the next guess, we want to test the position of L and also fill the blanks? 

Let me form words:

First possibility: A _ L U ? 
The last letter must be one of the available letters? And the second letter is? 
Possible words: 
   - AGLU? Not English?
   - AILU? Not valid? Also I is excluded? 
   - ASLUR? No, 6 letters? 
   Let's list: 
   - Valid words: 
        - Perhaps ""ASLUR""? Not valid? 
        - ""ALUM? But M? ALUM is 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters? 
        - Actually, ""ALULA"": A L U L A? But repeated? And letters L? But we have U fixed? We have A? But pattern: A L U? But we need A _? With L at 3? So A?L?U? Then the last would be ?. 

Wait, the word would be? A X L U Y? 
5-letter words starting with A and ending with U? Not common? 

But let me find words that fit: 
- A plus any letter? Then L, then U, then any letter? 
Known words? 
- ""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? 
- ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L? But N and I excluded? 
- ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T? But B,O,T excluded? 

These don't work? 

Second possibility: L in position 5? Then the word is A X ? U L? 

So: A X Y U L? 

Now, what words? 
- ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E excluded? 
- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E? I and E excluded? 
- ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E? E excluded? 
- ""ANGEL"": A, N, G, E, L? N and E excluded? 

What about words with U in position 4? 
- ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T? But D and T excluded? 
- ""AFOUL"": A, F, O, U, L? But O excluded? 
- ""AWFUL"": A, W, F, U, L? Pattern: A, W, F, U, L? Position 4 is U? Then L at the end? But letters: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:F, 4:U, 5:L? So it fits? And letters: W and F? Not excluded? 

Similarly: ""AFOUL"" has O? Excluded? 

So ""AWFUL""? Or ""BAWKS""? Not matching? 

Another: ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L? N excluded? 

Let me think of words: 
Possible words: 
  - ""ASHUR""? Not valid? 
  - ""AVIAN""? But position 4? U is required? Pattern A X Y U L doesn't match avian?
  - ""ASKEW""? No U? 

Wait, we require U at position 4? So only words ending with L and U at position 4? 

So: the word must be: position 1:A, position 4:U, position 5:L? But we don't know? Or if L at 3? 

Perhaps a more productive way: since we know A and U, and L must be either at 3 or 5? And we need to figure out which? We can make a guess that includes L at one of these positions? 

But note: the secret word might have other letters? So we need to test? 

Also, position 2 has to be filled? 

The available letters? We haven't used: S, P, M, W, Y, F, G, K, V, Q, J, X, Z? Etc. 

Additionally, we know L is in the word? So our guess must include L? Otherwise we don't test the position? 

So let's construct a guess that:
- Starts with A? Already fixed? No, our guess doesn't have to start with A? But the secret word does? But we know A is correct? So in the guess, position 1 should be A? Because it's known? Similarly, position 4 is U? Which is known? 

Actually, because we have A at 1 and U at 4? So we can plug those in? 

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we can provide a word of the form: A ? ? U ? 

And we know L is present? So one of the unknown positions must be L? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Moreover, we have to avoid excluded letters? 

So pattern: A ? ? U ? 
The ? positions: let's denote pos2, pos3, and pos5? And L must be in either pos3 or pos5? Because pos2 we tried L and it was wrong? 

So not at pos2? So pos3 or pos5 must be L? 

But we have two blanks: so we have to choose? 

But the word must be valid? 

So we need to choose a word where either:
- Position 3 is L: so A ? L U ? 
- Or position 5 is L: so A ? ? U L

And the other positions filled with available letters? 

Now, which case? We don't know? 

So we can prioritize common words? 

But let's find possibilities:

First, if L at position 3: word A ? L U ? 
Possible letters? And the whole must be a word? 
Examples:
   - ""AXLUS""? Not valid?
   - ""ARLES""? But position 4? It's U? So no? 
   - Hard to find? 

Alternatively, L at position 5: A ? ? U L
Examples:
   - ""ABUTL""? Not valid? 
   - ""ANNUL""? But N excluded? 
   - ""APPUL""? Not common? 
   - ""ARNUL""? R excluded? 

Wait, actually ""AMPUL"" is a word? But E? No? ""AMPUL"": A, M, P, U, L? Which is A? M? P? U? L? So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:U, 5:L? 
Yes! This fits? And letters: M and P? Not excluded? 

Also, ""ANYUL""? Not valid? 

Another word: ""ASPUL""? Not standard? 

So ""AMPUL""? It is a 5-letter word? Meaning: a small, sealed container. Yes.

But are there others? For instance, ""ABUL? No? 

But if we don't use L at 5? We use L at 3? 

A?L U?Y? 
With U at position 4? 

For example: ""ALULE""? Not valid? 
""ALLYU""? Invalid? 

So maybe L at position 5 is more likely? 

But we don't know? 

If we guess ""AMPUL"": 
- Positions: 
   1: A -> should be ✓? 
   2: M -> unknown? 
   3: P -> unknown? 
   4: U -> ✓? 
   5: L -> we know L is in the word? So if L is not at position 5? It might get marked as - if it's present elsewhere? Or x if not? 

Wait, but position 5: if in our guess we put L at 5? And the secret word has L at 3? Then position 5 might be different? And L might get marked as - because it's in the word but not at 5? Because L is also at 3? 

But we have no indication the secret word has multiple Ls? So it might? 

Therefore, if we guess ""AMPUL"", the feedback might tell us:

- If L is in the word and at position 5, we get ✓ at position 5? Then we have solved L? 
- If L is at position 3? Then in our guess, position 5 and position 2,3? How? 

Specifically, for secret word: suppose L is at position 3? Then our guess A M P U L? 
At position 5: guess L? But secret word has L at position 3? So it might be that the word has only one L? Then our guess puts L at 5? Which is not? So we get L marked as absent? Or since L is in the secret word? One L? So when we guess L at 5? And secret L is at 3? Then we get L at 5 as - (because it's somewhere else) and also? But: 

In Wordle rules? Only one L? So if secret has L at 3? And we guess L at 5? Then position5 gets -? And what about position3? We guessed P? Which might be something else? 

Alternatively, if secret has L at 3? Then our position3: P? Which would be marked as letter at that position? 

But our goal is to test the position of L? 

Another possibility: guess a word that has L at position 3? 

For example: A ? L U ? 
With ? being non excluded letters? 

But hard to find words? ""ACYLU""? Not English? 

What about ""ALLYU""? Not valid? 
""ALIB""? Not long enough? 

Actually, ""ALURE"": A, L, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? 
""ALLEU"": Not common? And contains E? 

After research? Few words match A?L U? 

So maybe L at position 5 is more common? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""AMPUL"" to test? It also has M and P? Which we haven't tried? And avoids excluded letters? 

But we have fixed A and U? So we guess ""AMPUL""? 

Alternatively, if L is not at position 5? Then we get feedback that allows us to know? 

So the response: ""AMPUL""

But let me confirm the letters: 
In ""AMPUL"": 
   A: position1? Should be correct? 
   M: new? Position2? 
   P: new? Position3? 
   U: position4? Should be correct? 
   L: position5? We want to see if it's correct? 

This way, if L is correct, then the word is AMPUL? 
If not? Then L is likely at position3? 

But also? The secret might be something else? Like ""AVOW"" but not matching? 

Moreover, we have to confirm? 

Perhaps we should use a word that can have L in either position? But I'm not finding? 

Another word: ""ASKUL""? Not valid? 

So I think ""AMPUL"" is reasonable? 

But let's look at our feedback: 

We know L exists? So we must include L in the guess? Because if we don't? We violate? But in ""AMPUL"", we do include L? So that's fine? 

Therefore, guess ""AMPUL""? 

More common: ""ALTUS"" but position? 
Or ""ANVIL"" excluded? 

I think ""AMPUL"" is acceptable? 

Response: <guess>AMPUL</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback from previous guesses:

- **Known Positions**: Position 1 is **A**, and position 4 is **U**. Thus, the secret word pattern is: `A _ _ U _`.
- **Present Letter**: **L** must be in the word (since it was marked ""─"" in Guess 3) but not in position 2 (as confirmed by Guess 3 feedback). Therefore, **L** must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Definitely Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D (from all previous feedback).

For this fourth guess:
- I selected **AMPUL** because:
  - It adheres to the pattern `A _ _ U _`, with positions 1 and 4 confirmed as A and U respectively.
  - It tests **L** in position 5 (to resolve whether L belongs at position 3 or 5).
  - It introduces **M** and **P** (new untested letters) in positions 2 and 3.
  - All letters avoid excluded characters, maximizing information gain:
    - If L is correct in position 5, we solve the word.
    - If L is marked ""─"", it means L must be in position 3 (and AMPUL is wrong).
    - We also learn about M and P in positions 2 and 3.

This guess efficiently narrows down L’s position and tests common unused consonants.

But we have no information on vowels except A is in and E is out). However, AUDIO has A at 1 and contains U, D, I, O. And excludes C,R,N,E.\n\n But let\'s see: we also have the position constraint for A: we know it can\'t be at 3, but placing it at 1 is a possibility.\n\n Another idea: We might also try to put A in position 2? Or 4? Or 5? Since we have no information about the position except it\'s not 3.\n\n However, note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there might be multiple As. But until we see more feedback, we assume one A.\n\n Given that, I need a word that includes A and tests other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Let me think of words that don\'t have C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3.\n\n Some words:\n - SALAD? -> but it has two As and L and D. But let\'s check letters: S, A, L, D -> no C,R,N,E? But two As: but we don\'t know if the word has multiple As.

It might be safer to use a word without repeated letters to cover more ground.\n\n Alternatively: \n - PLAYS? -> P, L, A, Y, S -> A at position 3? But we can\'t put A at position 3 because it must not be at 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A anywhere except we hope to find its correct position. But we must avoid position 3? No, we can put A at position 3 again? Actually, we know the word has A but not at position 3. So we should try A at a new position.\n\n However, note: the ""-"" for A in the first guess (position 3) does not prevent us from putting A at position 3 in the next guess? We can, but it would be wasted because we know it\'s not the correct position. So it\'s better to try A in one of the other positions.\n\n Rules: \n - The secret word has A but not in position 3.\n - We can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n To maximize information, we should try A in a different position and use new letters.\n\n Another word: TALON. But contains O and L and N? Wait, N is excluded. So no.\n\n Let me avoid N.\n\n Words: \n - PASTA: P, A, S, T, A -> has two As? But A at positions 2 and 5. Also, letters: P, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E? Yes. But repeated A? We don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? They are, but for testing, maybe we avoid duplicates to get more information.\n\n But PASTA has A at 2 and 5. That might be acceptable, but if the word actually has two As, we\'d get two marks.\n\n Alternatively, a word without duplicate letters: \n - SHALT? Not common. \n - PAINT? Contains N -> excluded.\n - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S -> A at position 2? This has unique letters.\n\n MAULS: \n   Position: M, A, U, L, S -> A at 2.\n\n Another: SPLAT: S, P, L, A, T -> A at position 4. This has S, P, L, A, T -> all distinct and avoids excluded letters.\n\n But where is the A? Position 4.\n\n Alternatively: OPALS? O, P, A, L, S -> A at position 3? But we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3 again? But we know it\'s not the correct position so we might get the same feedback. It\'s better to avoid position 3 to test other positions.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word with A not at position 3.\n\n Why not try A at the beginning? For example: ALPHA? Contains P and L and H? But H is not very common? Also, has A twice? Not ideal.\n\n Alternatively: ALOUD? A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters, A at 1. But has O and U? Might be useful.\n\n But I\'m considering using SPLAT: placing A at position 4.\n\n Another common word: TRAIL? But contains R, which we know is excluded -> invalid.\n\n Another: PLAZA? Two As -> not ideal.\n\n After evaluation, let\'s pick a word with A at position 1 or 2, and include other common consonants.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a popular word, but it has E -> excluded.\n\n So, avoid E.\n\n I found: ""SOLAR"" -> but contains R and O -> R is excluded.\n\n Need no R.\n\n How about: ""DOULA""? Not common.\n\n Let me try: ""PLAIT"" -> but contains I and T, but also T? Wait, no: P, L, A, I, T -> but N? No, excluded? N is excluded, but not I or T. But PLAIT has A at position 3? Not allowed because we know A isn\'t at 3? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at 3, but we can put A at 3 to check? But that wouldn\'t be efficient.\n\n Another idea: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T -> A at position 2. This avoids C,R,N,E? Yes: H, A, B, I, T. Also, distinct letters.\n\n So ""HABIT"" is a valid word: \n   H, A, B, I, T -> letters not excluded.\n\n Similarly: ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A at 2? This also avoids C,R,N,E.\n\n But W and Z are less common.\n\n How about ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? Avoids C,R,N,E.\n\n Also: ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? So not as good.\n\n We want more distinct letters.\n\n So ""DAILY"" or ""HABIT"" might be good.\n\n Another option: ""MANOR"" -> contains M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are excluded, so invalid.\n\n Let\'s stick with ""HABIT"": \n   Advantages: common letters: H, A, B, I, T. H and B are less common? But we have to use new letters.\n\n But note: we have only excluded C,R,N,E. So B, T, I, H, etc. are fair game.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""FLAIL""? But two L\'s? Not distinct.\n\n Or ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> A at 2. Distinct letters. P, A, S, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E.\n\n This seems good: PASTY? But is it a word? It might be (a type of food). And common? Perhaps.\n\n But we also have the option ""PASTA"" but repeated A. I think PASTY is better because it has distinct letters.\n\n Another: ""MAJOR"" -> has R, excluded.\n\n How about ""BAWDY""? B, A, W, D, Y -> A at 2? But W and Y not very common? \n\n I think ""PASTY"" or ""HABIT"" are both acceptable.\n\n Or even better: let\'s choose ""SPLAT"" if it is allowed? S, P, L, A, T -> distinct and A at position 4? \n\n But then we are testing A at position 4. We don\'t know if it\'s position 2 or 4? \n\n Since we know A is in the word but not at 3, we can test two possibilities: by putting A at position 2 we also cover the possibility that it is at 2? Actually, if we put A at 2 and it\'s the correct position, we get a ✓. If it\'s not, but in the word, we get a -.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have A at the same position as the first guess? That is, avoid position 3 and choose a new position? \n\n Let me assign probabilities: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are equally likely for A? Maybe.\n\n But without any other constraints, we can pick arbitrarily.\n\n I\'ll pick ""PASTY"": \n   P (new), A (test position 2), S (new), T (new), Y (new)\n\n This way we get information about P, S, T, Y and A at position 2.\n\n If A is actually at position 2, we get a ✓ at position 2. Else, we get a - for A and know it\'s not at 2 (so it must be at 1, 4, or 5) and we learn about P, S, T, Y.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""PASTY""\n\n But wait: is PASTY a valid English word? Yes, meaning either of or resembling a paste or having the characteristics of dough. Or, it can mean a type of pasty (food). It\'s in word lists.\n\n Alternatively, to be safer, I can use ""HABIT"". Let me check: habit is common.\n\n I\'ll choose ""HABIT"": \n   H: new\n   A: position 2? \n   B: new\n   I: new\n   T: new\n\n This covers more vowels? We have A and I.\n\n So, let\'s pick ""HABIT"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is popular? But contains E and U? E is excluded.\n\n So no.\n\n Decision: I\'ll guess ""HABIT""\n\n<guess>HABIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- A is present but **not in position 3**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that includes A (in any position except 3) and avoids C, R, N, E. I selected ""HABIT"" because:\n- It places A in position 2 (to test a new position for A, since position 3 is invalid).\n- It introduces new common consonants (H, B, T) and a vowel (I), avoiding excluded letters.\n- It uses distinct letters to maximize information feedback.\n\n<guess>HABIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\nFirst guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning: \n  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.\n  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and got a dash).\n\nSecond guess: HABIT -> H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n  - H, B, I, T are not in the secret word.\n  - A is again in the word but this time it was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not at position 2.\n\nSo, combining both:\n- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T\n- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3.\n\nTherefore, A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we know that the secret word has 5 letters, includes A, and excludes the above letters.\n\nWe must now make a third guess. The guess must:\n1. Include the letter A (only once? we don\'t know, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet) in position 1, 4, or 5.\n2. Not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T.\n\nRemaining common letters: We have used A, and excluded consonants: C, R, N, H, B, T, and vowels: E, I. Common vowels left: O, U. Common consonants: S, L, D, P, M, W, Y, G, K, V, etc.\n\nWe also know no other letters from the word yet beyond A. So we need to test many new letters.\n\nSince A is at position 1, 4, or 5, let\'s try to cover multiple unknowns at once.\n\nWe should choose a word with A in one of the allowed positions and include other common unused letters.\n\nOptions:\n- Place A at the beginning: A _ _ _ _\n- Or at the end: _ _ _ _ A\n- Or in the fourth position: _ _ _ A _\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption A in position 1: \n- Words like A_ _ _ _: Using remaining letters (S, L, O, P, etc.)\n  - Example: ""ASKED"" -> but E is excluded. Invalid.\n  - ""ASSAY"" -> but S repeated? Also has S and Y. But E is excluded? Wait, no E. But assay: A, S, S, A, Y -> two S and two A? We don\'t know about repetition. Not ideal because repeated letters give less information.\n  - ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> distinct letters? Yes. A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). And avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T -> none of these. So ALOUD is a valid word.\n\nOption A in position 4:\n  - Example: _ _ _ A _\n    - ""PLAZA"" -> P, L, A, Z, A -> repeated A and Z uncommon? Also, we don\'t know Z. Avoid?\n    - ""FLOPS"" -> F, L, O, P, S -> but this has no A? We must include A. So we need a word that has A at position 4.\n    - ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is excluded (from second guess)? From HABIT, T is excluded? So SPLAT has T -> invalid.\n\nWe must avoid T, so SPLAT is not allowed.\n\nAlternative for position 4: \n  - ""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but this has A at position 4? Let\'s see: O P A L S -> no, A is at position 3? We need position 4? \n    Actually, OPALS: O(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A at position 3? That is not allowed because we know A is not at position 3? From both guesses, we know A isn\'t at 2 or 3. So position 3 is invalid.\n\nWe need A only at 1,4,5.\n\nSo for position 4: \n  - Words ending with A? But wait, position 4 is the fourth position. So the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?\n  - Example: ""SPOOK"" -> no A? We need A. ""SPLA""? Not a word.\n\n  How about ""SOLAR""? But R excluded and also has O, L, A, S? Position: S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R -> but R is excluded? Invalid.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOULA""? D, O, U, L, A -> positions: D(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), A(5). So A is at position 5? Also? But we can try position 5.\n\nOption A in position 5: \n  - Words: _ _ _ _ A\n  - Example: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but N and I are excluded? Invalid.\n  - ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded and repeated.\n  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> but C is excluded? Yes, invalid.\n  - ""MURAL"" -> M, U, R, A, L -> R excluded.\n  - ""MOCHA"" -> M, O, C, H, A -> C and H excluded.\n\nSo difficult? How about ""JUMPS""? But no A.\n\nWe must have A at position 5.\n\nPossible: ""GAUZY""? G, A, U, Z, Y -> not common? But if we want: A is at position 2? Then not. For position 5: \n  - ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> repeated and A at 2 and 4? We need A at end?\n  - ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> repeated U and A at position 4? Not at 5.\n\nAnother: ""LILAC"" -> L, I, L, A, C -> I and C excluded? Invalid.\n\nAfter some thought, let\'s go with A in position 1: ALOUD? Which I mentioned earlier: A, L, O, U, D -> all new letters? Yes: L, O, U, D.\n\nAlternatively: ""ABOUT""? A, B, O, U, T -> but B and T are excluded? From second guess, HABIT: B(x) and T(x), so yes, excluded.\n\nSo ALOUD is acceptable.\n\nAre there other words? \n- ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> but B and E excluded? Not valid.\n- ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> N excluded? Yes, invalid.\n- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> T excluded? Yes, from second guess T(x)? So invalid.\n\nSo ALOUD: A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). This avoids all excluded letters? Check: excluded letters: C,R,N,E,H,B,I,T. None in ALOUD. Good.\n\nMoreover, it uses:\n- A in position 1: to test if it\'s the correct position? If it is, we get A(✓). Else, we get A(-) again, meaning A is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5).\n\nAlso, we test L, O, U, D in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nSo I think ""ALOUD"" is a good third guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""ALOUD"".\n\nResponse format: \n<guess>ALOUD</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E from Guess 1 and H, B, I, T from Guess 2. These cannot be in the secret word.\n- **Required letter A**: The letter A must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (as confirmed by both guesses). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the third guess:\n- I selected **ALOUD** because:\n  - It places A in position 1 to test one of the possible locations.\n  - It introduces **new common letters**: L, O, U, D (none excluded).\n  - All letters are distinct to maximize information gain.\n  - If A is in position 1, it will be marked ✓; if not, it will show A is at position 4 or 5 (-) while revealing which of L, O, U, D are in the secret word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and tests frequent unused letters.\n\n<guess>ALOUD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) O(x) U(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have accumulated feedback from three guesses:\n\n1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n   - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n   - A is present but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).\n\n2. **HABIT**: H(x), A(-), B(x), I(x), T(x)\n   - H, B, I, T are absent.\n   - A is still present but not in position 2 (so we knew A not in position 3 or 2).\n\n3. **ALOUD**: A(✓), L(-), O(x), U(✓), D(x)\n   - A is in position 1 and correct! (since marked ✓)\n   - U is in position 4 and correct? Positions: \n        Guess: A L O U D\n        Positions: 1: A, 2: L, 3: O, 4: U, 5: D\n        So U(✓) means U is correct and in position 4.\n   - L is present but not in position 2 (since - at position 2).\n   - O and D are absent.\n\nSo from all the feedback:\n- **Correct positions:**\n   - Position 1: A\n   - Position 4: U\n- **Present letters but wrong position:**\n   - L (but not in position 2; so L must be in position 3 or 5? Since positions 1 and 4 are taken by A and U)\n     Possible positions left for L: 3 or 5? Because the word is 5 letters: 1=A, 4=U, so positions 2,3,5 are open? But we know from ALOUD guess that L cannot be in position 2 (because it got - meaning it\'s elsewhere). \n- **Absent letters:**\n   - C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Must start with A and the fourth letter is U. So pattern: A _ _ U _\n- Must contain L (since L got - meaning present but not the right spot), and L cannot be in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 5? But position 5 is possible? \n\nAlso, what letters are still available? We have excluded many: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D. And we have A and U fixed.\n\nSo the word looks like: A _ X U Y, where:\n- X is a letter we haven\'t guessed yet? Because position 2: we guessed L and it was wrong position, so if L is in the word but not at 2, then L could be at 3 (so X is L?) or at 5 (so Y is L?).\n\nBut also, position 5: in ALOUD we guessed D and it was absent? So D is not there? Therefore, at position 5, we cannot have D? So we can rule out D? \n\nMoreover, we know the letter L must be in the word? But not at position 2? So in the secret word, L is either at position 3 or 5? \n\nHowever, let me consider: we have A at 1, U at 4? So positions 2,3,5 are open? \n\nBut position 3: we guessed O and it was absent? So O is out? So position 3 must be a new letter? Or L? \n\nActually, O was guessed at position 3 and marked absent. Therefore, the letter at position 3 is not O? But more importantly, since absent? So the letter at position 3 is not O? \n\nNow, what do we know? \n- The word: A ? ? U ? \n- Letters that must be included: L (because L got a dash) and we know it must be at either position 3 or 5? Because position 2 is not allowed? \n- Also, no other known letters? \n\nBut wait: we also know that the word must have exactly these letters? And L is one of them? \n\nMoreover, the second position is unknown? But we have no constraints? Except it cannot be absent letters? \n\nSo available letters? Since excluded letters are: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D? And absent from feedback? \n\nRemaining possible letters? Any letter not excluded? English letters: \nCommon ones left: S, P, M, G, W, Y, F, K, V, Q, J, etc. \n\nAlso, we must use one L? And the L must be either at position 3 or 5? \n\nMoreover, the secret word must be a valid 5-letter word: A, followed by some letter, then?, then U, and finally ?\n\nSo, putting L in position 3: then the word would be A _ L U ? \n\nBut also, L might be in position 5: A _ ? U L? \n\nWe need to make a guess that tests these possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have only one occurrence of L? Until proven otherwise? And we are not forced to use L again? Actually, we know L is present? So we must consider it? \n\nAlso, the guess must be a valid word that fits the known parts.\n\nOptions:\n\nCase 1: L in position 3 -> then word: A _ L U ? \nCase 2: L in position 5 -> then word: A _ ? U L\n\nBut position 3 cannot be any absent letter? So we have to choose a letter that hasn\'t been excluded? \n\nSimilarly, position 2 we haven\'t guessed correctly? So we must guess a letter we haven\'t tried? Or if we include L? But L must be in the word? But if we put L in position 3? Or if we put L in position 5? \n\nBut note: in our guess, we must only include letters that are not excluded? And we have L? But for the correct word? \n\nFor the next guess, we want to test the position of L and also fill the blanks? \n\nLet me form words:\n\nFirst possibility: A _ L U ? \nThe last letter must be one of the available letters? And the second letter is? \nPossible words: \n   - AGLU? Not English?\n   - AILU? Not valid? Also I is excluded? \n   - ASLUR? No, 6 letters? \n   Let\'s list: \n   - Valid words: \n        - Perhaps ""ASLUR""? Not valid? \n        - ""ALUM? But M? ALUM is 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters? \n        - Actually, ""ALULA"": A L U L A? But repeated? And letters L? But we have U fixed? We have A? But pattern: A L U? But we need A _? With L at 3? So A?L?U? Then the last would be ?. \n\nWait, the word would be? A X L U Y? \n5-letter words starting with A and ending with U? Not common? \n\nBut let me find words that fit: \n- A plus any letter? Then L, then U, then any letter? \nKnown words? \n- ""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? \n- ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L? But N and I excluded? \n- ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T? But B,O,T excluded? \n\nThese don\'t work? \n\nSecond possibility: L in position 5? Then the word is A X ? U L? \n\nSo: A X Y U L? \n\nNow, what words? \n- ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E excluded? \n- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E? I and E excluded? \n- ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E? E excluded? \n- ""ANGEL"": A, N, G, E, L? N and E excluded? \n\nWhat about words with U in position 4? \n- ""ADULT"": A, D, U, L, T? But D and T excluded? \n- ""AFOUL"": A, F, O, U, L? But O excluded? \n- ""AWFUL"": A, W, F, U, L? Pattern: A, W, F, U, L? Position 4 is U? Then L at the end? But letters: positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:F, 4:U, 5:L? So it fits? And letters: W and F? Not excluded? \n\nSimilarly: ""AFOUL"" has O? Excluded? \n\nSo ""AWFUL""? Or ""BAWKS""? Not matching? \n\nAnother: ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L? N excluded? \n\nLet me think of words: \nPossible words: \n  - ""ASHUR""? Not valid? \n  - ""AVIAN""? But position 4? U is required? Pattern A X Y U L doesn\'t match avian?\n  - ""ASKEW""? No U? \n\nWait, we require U at position 4? So only words ending with L and U at position 4? \n\nSo: the word must be: position 1:A, position 4:U, position 5:L? But we don\'t know? Or if L at 3? \n\nPerhaps a more productive way: since we know A and U, and L must be either at 3 or 5? And we need to figure out which? We can make a guess that includes L at one of these positions? \n\nBut note: the secret word might have other letters? So we need to test? \n\nAlso, position 2 has to be filled? \n\nThe available letters? We haven\'t used: S, P, M, W, Y, F, G, K, V, Q, J, X, Z? Etc. \n\nAdditionally, we know L is in the word? So our guess must include L? Otherwise we don\'t test the position? \n\nSo let\'s construct a guess that:\n- Starts with A? Already fixed? No, our guess doesn\'t have to start with A? But the secret word does? But we know A is correct? So in the guess, position 1 should be A? Because it\'s known? Similarly, position 4 is U? Which is known? \n\nActually, because we have A at 1 and U at 4? So we can plug those in? \n\nTherefore, for the fourth guess, we can provide a word of the form: A ? ? U ? \n\nAnd we know L is present? So one of the unknown positions must be L? \n\nBut we also want to test new letters? \n\nMoreover, we have to avoid excluded letters? \n\nSo pattern: A ? ? U ? \nThe ? positions: let\'s denote pos2, pos3, and pos5? And L must be in either pos3 or pos5? Because pos2 we tried L and it was wrong? \n\nSo not at pos2? So pos3 or pos5 must be L? \n\nBut we have two blanks: so we have to choose? \n\nBut the word must be valid? \n\nSo we need to choose a word where either:\n- Position 3 is L: so A ? L U ? \n- Or position 5 is L: so A ? ? U L\n\nAnd the other positions filled with available letters? \n\nNow, which case? We don\'t know? \n\nSo we can prioritize common words? \n\nBut let\'s find possibilities:\n\nFirst, if L at position 3: word A ? L U ? \nPossible letters? And the whole must be a word? \nExamples:\n   - ""AXLUS""? Not valid?\n   - ""ARLES""? But position 4? It\'s U? So no? \n   - Hard to find? \n\nAlternatively, L at position 5: A ? ? U L\nExamples:\n   - ""ABUTL""? Not valid? \n   - ""ANNUL""? But N excluded? \n   - ""APPUL""? Not common? \n   - ""ARNUL""? R excluded? \n\nWait, actually ""AMPUL"" is a word? But E? No? ""AMPUL"": A, M, P, U, L? Which is A? M? P? U? L? So positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:U, 5:L? \nYes! This fits? And letters: M and P? Not excluded? \n\nAlso, ""ANYUL""? Not valid? \n\nAnother word: ""ASPUL""? Not standard? \n\nSo ""AMPUL""? It is a 5-letter word? Meaning: a small, sealed container. Yes.\n\nBut are there others? For instance, ""ABUL? No? \n\nBut if we don\'t use L at 5? We use L at 3? \n\nA?L U?Y? \nWith U at position 4? \n\nFor example: ""ALULE""? Not valid? \n""ALLYU""? Invalid? \n\nSo maybe L at position 5 is more likely? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nIf we guess ""AMPUL"": \n- Positions: \n   1: A -> should be ✓? \n   2: M -> unknown? \n   3: P -> unknown? \n   4: U -> ✓? \n   5: L -> we know L is in the word? So if L is not at position 5? It might get marked as - if it\'s present elsewhere? Or x if not? \n\nWait, but position 5: if in our guess we put L at 5? And the secret word has L at 3? Then position 5 might be different? And L might get marked as - because it\'s in the word but not at 5? Because L is also at 3? \n\nBut we have no indication the secret word has multiple Ls? So it might? \n\nTherefore, if we guess ""AMPUL"", the feedback might tell us:\n\n- If L is in the word and at position 5, we get ✓ at position 5? Then we have solved L? \n- If L is at position 3? Then in our guess, position 5 and position 2,3? How? \n\nSpecifically, for secret word: suppose L is at position 3? Then our guess A M P U L? \nAt position 5: guess L? But secret word has L at position 3? So it might be that the word has only one L? Then our guess puts L at 5? Which is not? So we get L marked as absent? Or since L is in the secret word? One L? So when we guess L at 5? And secret L is at 3? Then we get L at 5 as - (because it\'s somewhere else) and also? But: \n\nIn Wordle rules? Only one L? So if secret has L at 3? And we guess L at 5? Then position5 gets -? And what about position3? We guessed P? Which might be something else? \n\nAlternatively, if secret has L at 3? Then our position3: P? Which would be marked as letter at that position? \n\nBut our goal is to test the position of L? \n\nAnother possibility: guess a word that has L at position 3? \n\nFor example: A ? L U ? \nWith ? being non excluded letters? \n\nBut hard to find words? ""ACYLU""? Not English? \n\nWhat about ""ALLYU""? Not valid? \n""ALIB""? Not long enough? \n\nActually, ""ALURE"": A, L, U, R, E? But R and E excluded? \n""ALLEU"": Not common? And contains E? \n\nAfter research? Few words match A?L U? \n\nSo maybe L at position 5 is more common? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""AMPUL"" to test? It also has M and P? Which we haven\'t tried? And avoids excluded letters? \n\nBut we have fixed A and U? So we guess ""AMPUL""? \n\nAlternatively, if L is not at position 5? Then we get feedback that allows us to know? \n\nSo the response: ""AMPUL""\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: \nIn ""AMPUL"": \n   A: position1? Should be correct? \n   M: new? Position2? \n   P: new? Position3? \n   U: position4? Should be correct? \n   L: position5? We want to see if it\'s correct? \n\nThis way, if L is correct, then the word is AMPUL? \nIf not? Then L is likely at position3? \n\nBut also? The secret might be something else? Like ""AVOW"" but not matching? \n\nMoreover, we have to confirm? \n\nPerhaps we should use a word that can have L in either position? But I\'m not finding? \n\nAnother word: ""ASKUL""? Not valid? \n\nSo I think ""AMPUL"" is reasonable? \n\nBut let\'s look at our feedback: \n\nWe know L exists? So we must include L in the guess? Because if we don\'t? We violate? But in ""AMPUL"", we do include L? So that\'s fine? \n\nTherefore, guess ""AMPUL""? \n\nMore common: ""ALTUS"" but position? \nOr ""ANVIL"" excluded? \n\nI think ""AMPUL"" is acceptable? \n\nResponse: <guess>AMPUL</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Known Positions**: Position 1 is **A**, and position 4 is **U**. Thus, the secret word pattern is: `A _ _ U _`.\n- **Present Letter**: **L** must be in the word (since it was marked ""─"" in Guess 3) but not in position 2 (as confirmed by Guess 3 feedback). Therefore, **L** must be in position 3 or 5.\n- **Definitely Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D (from all previous feedback).\n\nFor this fourth guess:\n- I selected **AMPUL** because:\n  - It adheres to the pattern `A _ _ U _`, with positions 1 and 4 confirmed as A and U respectively.\n  - It tests **L** in position 5 (to resolve whether L belongs at position 3 or 5).\n  - It introduces **M** and **P** (new untested letters) in positions 2 and 3.\n  - All letters avoid excluded characters, maximizing information gain:\n    - If L is correct in position 5, we solve the word.\n    - If L is marked ""─"", it means L must be in position 3 (and AMPUL is wrong).\n    - We also learn about M and P in positions 2 and 3.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down L’s position and tests common unused consonants.\n\n<guess>AMPUL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HABIT -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(-) B(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) O(x) U(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: AMPUL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) P(x) U(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess: AMPUL -> A(✓) M(x) P(x) U(✓) L(✓)
 This means:
   - A is correct and in position 1 (already known, but confirmed).
   - M is absent (x) from the word? But we guessed M at position 2? So M is not in the word at all? 
   - P is absent (x) from the word? So P is not in the word.
   - U is correct and in position 4 (known, confirmed).
   - L is correct and in position 5? Because we guessed L at position 5 and got ✓? 

 So, from this:
   - The secret word has L at position 5? So the word ends with L? 
   - Also, M and P are absent? 

 Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ U L? 
 And we know that the third letter? We have to fill? 

 But from previous feedback, we also know:
   - The letter L is in the word? But now we have L at position 5? So that's fixed? 
   - Also, from guess 3 (ALOUD), we had L marked as present but not at position 2? Now we know it's at position 5? So that matches? 

 Now, what about the second and third positions? 
   - We know the word is A ? ? U L? 
   - We have excluded: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D, M, P? 
   - And we have used: A, U, L? 

 So the missing letters? We need two letters? 

 Also, from the feedback of ALOUD: we had L marked as present? But now we know it's at position 5? So that's consistent? 

 Now, what about the third position? In ALOUD, we guessed O at position 3? And it was absent? So the third letter is not O? 

 Similarly, in AMPUL, we guessed P at position 3? And it was absent? So the third letter is not P? 

 But we already know P is absent? 

 Now, we need to find a word of the form A X Y U L? 
 Where X and Y are letters not in the excluded list? 

 Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D, M, P? 

 Available common letters: S, G, W, Y, F, K, V, Q, J, Z, X? 

 Also, we must ensure that the word is valid? 

 Let's think of words: 
   - AWFUL: A, W, F, U, L? 
        - W and F are available? 
        - So AWFUL? 
   - Also, AUGUL? Not a word? 
   - AZYUL? Not a word? 
   - ASHUL? Not common? 
   - AGUEL? Not? 
   - AISLE? But I and E excluded? 
   - AGLET? But E and T excluded? 

 So AWFUL seems a good candidate? 

 But let's check the positions? 
   - A: position1? 
   - W: position2? 
   - F: position3? 
   - U: position4? 
   - L: position5? 

 And we haven't tried W or F? 

 Also, are there other possibilities? 
   - AWFUL? 
   - AVIAL? But V? And I? I excluded? 
   - AQUIL? Not a word? 
   - AXIOL? Not? 
   - AFFUL? Not a word? 
   - AWFUL is the most common? 

 But we must confirm? 

 Another word: ""ANKUS""? But N and K? N excluded? 

 Or ""ARGUL""? R excluded? 

 So AWFUL seems the best? 

 But note: we have no feedback about W and F? So we need to test? 

 However, we have only one guess left? We have used 4 guesses? And we have 6 tries? So we have two more? But we can guess AWFUL? 

 But if it's not? Then we get feedback? 

 Alternatively, we can think of other words? 

 What about ""ASKEW""? But no U? 

 Or ""ABUZZ""? But B and Z? B excluded? 

 So I think AWFUL is a valid guess? 

 But let me double-check the feedback? 

 We know the word is A _ _ U L? 

 And we have excluded many letters? 

 So the only common word I can think of is AWFUL? 

 Therefore, I'll guess ""AWFUL""? 

 But note: in the pattern, the third letter? In AWFUL, it's F? 

 We haven't tested F? 

 But we have no other information? 

 So let's go with AWFUL?

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Position 1**: Must be **A** (confirmed by Guess 3 and 4).
   - **Position 4**: Must be **U** (confirmed by Guess 3 and 4).
   - **Position 5**: Must be **L** (confirmed by Guess 4: L(✓)).
   - **Pattern**: The secret word is `A _ _ U L`.
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, R, N, E, H, B, I, T, O, D, M, P (marked ""x"" in all feedback).
   - **Present Letters**: Only **A, U, L** are confirmed in the word (all now placed correctly). No other letters are known to exist yet.
   - **Untested Letters**: Common unused letters include S, G, W, Y, F, K, V, Q, J, Z.

2. **Analysis of Missing Positions**:
   - Positions 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters **not excluded**.
   - From Guess 3 (`ALOUD`), position 2 was tested with L (marked ""-""), but L is now confirmed at position 5. Position 3 was tested with O (marked ""x""), so it cannot be O.
   - From Guess 4 (`AMPUL`), position 2 was tested with M (marked ""x""), and position 3 was tested with P (marked ""x""), so neither M nor P can be in the word.

3. **Deduction**:
   - The secret word is `A _ _ U L`. We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the remaining pool (S, G, W, Y, F, K, V, etc.).
   - **Common English words** fitting this pattern and constraints:
     - `AWFUL` (A, W, F, U, L) is a valid word. W and F are untested and not excluded.
     - Other possibilities like `ASKUL` (invalid), `AZURE` (E excluded), or `ANNUL` (N excluded) are invalid due to constraints.
   - `AWFUL` tests two new common letters (W and F) and fits all known clues.

4. **Why `AWFUL`?**:
   - Maximizes information: Tests W (position 2) and F (position 3), both high-frequency consonants.
   - If incorrect, feedback on W/F will reveal if they are present/absent and narrow the solution.
   - Only 2 guesses remain (this is Guess 5), so prioritizing a plausible word is efficient.
