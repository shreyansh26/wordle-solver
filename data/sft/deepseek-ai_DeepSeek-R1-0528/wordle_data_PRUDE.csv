 A popular starting word in word games is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.
 E(✓) -> E is in the secret word and in the correct position.

 From the feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E and it is the last letter (position 5).
 - The letters S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the 5th position, the secret word ends with E.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain S, L, A, T.

 We have 5 tries left.

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that ends with E (so the 5th letter is E).
 2. Avoid using the letters S, L, A, T.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: R, I, O, U, N, D, C, M, etc.

 We can try a word that has E at the end and uses new letters.

 Some candidate words: 
   ""pride"" (but we don't know if P, R, I, D are in the word)
   ""crime"" (C, R, I, M, E) -> but note that E is at the end, which is good.

 However, we must avoid S, L, A, T.

 Let's think of words ending with E that don't use S, L, A, T.

 Examples:
   ""bribe"" -> uses B, R, I, B, E -> but B is repeated? Actually, it's valid. But let's see other options.
   ""prime"" -> P, R, I, M, E -> all distinct and common.

 Another common one: ""drone"" -> but we don't know if D, R, O, N are allowed? We haven't tried them.

 However, note that we have no information about these letters. So we can use them.

 But we must remember that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Let me choose ""prime"" because it uses common consonants and a vowel (I) that we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""drone"" is also good because it has O and N which are common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters to work with and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we know the 5th letter is E, we can focus on the first four.

 Let me consider ""drone"": D, R, O, N, E -> but the E is at the end, so that's good. However, we are not sure about the positions of the other letters.

 Another option: ""prone"" -> P, R, O, N, E.

 But I think ""prime"" is a good choice because it has M and I which are common.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent. We know S, L, A, T are absent, so ""prime"" is safe.

 Let's go with ""prime"".

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""Prime"" is a valid English word.

 So, second guess: ""prime""

 We are hoping to get feedback on P, R, I, M, and we already know E is correct at the end.

 However, note that the feedback for E in the 5th position will be ✓ again, but we already know that.

 Let me write the guess: prime

 But wait, what if the secret word has E in the 5th position and we are testing other letters? That's the plan.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E at the end and uses letters that are more common? 

 Another idea: ""rinse"" -> but we know S is absent, so we cannot use S. So ""rinse"" is invalid because it has S.

 We must avoid S, L, A, T.

 So, ""prime"" is acceptable.

 Let me check: P, R, I, M, E -> none of the forbidden letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""prime"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- **E is correct and in position 5** (the word ends with E).
- **S, L, A, T are absent** from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It should avoid **S, L, A, T** entirely.
- Use new common letters (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, D) to gather more information.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""slate"" -> S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""prime"" -> P(✓), R(✓), I(x), M(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I is not in the word at all.
- M is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, combining the information:
- The secret word has the pattern: P R _ _ E
- The first letter is P, second is R, and fifth is E.
- The third and fourth letters are unknown, but we know they are not S, L, A, T, I, or M (from the absent letters in both guesses).
- Also, note that the word does not contain: S, L, A, T, I, M.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PR"", ends with ""E"", and the third and fourth letters are from the remaining alphabet excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: S, L, A, T, I, M

Available letters: All letters except these and the ones we know (P, R, E are present but already placed, so for the middle positions, we can use other letters).

But note: P, R, E are in the word, but we are only missing the third and fourth letters.

So, the word is of the form: P R ? ? E

We need to choose two letters for the third and fourth positions from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. We know the following are absent: A, I, L, M, S, T.

So, available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word that fits ""PR??E"".

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern and use the available letters.

Some possibilities:
- PRONE: But O and N are available? O is available, N is available. However, let's check: P R O N E. But we have to avoid I and M? Yes, and prone doesn't use I or M. But wait, in guess 2, we have I and M absent, so prone is acceptable? However, we must check if O and N are not in the absent list. They are not, so prone is a candidate.

But let's see: prone means lying flat.

- PROBE: P R O B E -> B is available? Yes. So probe is another candidate.

- PRUDE: P R U D E -> U and D are available.

- PRICE: But C is available, but I is absent. So PRICE has I, which is absent. So not allowed.

- PRIME: We already tried, and it had I and M which are absent.

- PROSE: But S is absent, so not allowed.

- PRUNE: P R U N E -> U and N are available.

- PROVE: P R O V E -> O and V are available.

- PRATE: But T is absent, so not allowed.

- PRESS: S is absent, not allowed.

So, possible words: prone, probe, prude, prune, prove, etc.

We need to choose one that uses letters we haven't tried to maximize information. But note, we only have two positions to fill, and we are trying to guess the word. We might get it right or get more feedback.

We have 4 tries left.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible. However, since we have two unknowns, we can try a word that uses two new letters.

But if we guess a word and it's not correct, we get feedback on those two letters.

For example, if we guess ""prone"", we test O and N.

Similarly, ""probe"" tests O and B.

""prude"" tests U and D.

""prune"" tests U and N.

""prove"" tests O and V.

We don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other, but we can choose one that is common.

Alternatively, we can think about which letters are more common in the third and fourth positions.

But since we are trying to solve, let's pick one.

I'll go with ""prone"" because it's a common word.

But note: we are not sure if O or N are in the word. We are testing them.

So, let's guess ""prone"".

But wait, what if the word is ""probe""? We don't know.

We can also consider that we have more letters to test, but we have limited tries.

Another idea: we can use a word that has a letter we haven't tried in one of the positions, but we have to form a valid word.

But ""prone"" is fine.

However, let me check if there are other possibilities.

What about ""prude""? Or ""prove""?

I think ""prone"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""prone"":
- If the third letter is O and fourth is N, then we get it correct.
- If not, we get feedback on O and N.

Similarly for others.

We can also consider ""probe"" to test B.

But I think ""prone"" is acceptable.

So, I'll go with ""prone"".

But note: we must avoid the absent letters, and ""prone"" uses P, R, O, N, E. O and N are not in the absent list, so it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""prone"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).
- **P is confirmed at position 1 and R at position 2** (from Guess 2).
- **I and M are absent** (from Guess 2), adding to the earlier absent letters: **S, L, A, T** (from Guess 1).
- The secret word pattern is: **P R _ _ E**.

The third and fourth letters must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list (A, I, L, M, S, T). Possible candidates include words like ""prone"", ""probe"", ""prude"", ""prune"", or ""prove"".

I chose **""PRONE""** for the next guess because:
- It tests two new common letters (**O** and **N**) in the unknown positions.
- It avoids all absent letters.
- It's a valid English word that fits the pattern.

If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, the feedback on O and N will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining guesses.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter secret word.
 I'll choose a common starting word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 A popular starting word in word games is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters.
 But note: we want to maximize information. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"".
 Since we don't have any prior information, let's use ""SLATE"". It contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 However, note that the game requires valid English words. ""SLATE"" is valid.

 So, for the first guess, I'll use ""SLATE"".

 Let me write it in the required response format.I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I'll choose **""SLATE""** because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that frequently appear in English words. This should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities, as it includes both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.
 E(✓) -> E is in the secret word and in the correct position.

 From the feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E and it is the last letter (position 5).
 - The letters S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the 5th position, the secret word ends with E.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain S, L, A, T.

 We have 5 tries left.

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that ends with E (so the 5th letter is E).
 2. Avoid using the letters S, L, A, T.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: R, I, O, U, N, D, C, M, etc.

 We can try a word that has E at the end and uses new letters.

 Some candidate words: 
   ""pride"" (but we don't know if P, R, I, D are in the word)
   ""crime"" (C, R, I, M, E) -> but note that E is at the end, which is good.

 However, we must avoid S, L, A, T.

 Let's think of words ending with E that don't use S, L, A, T.

 Examples:
   ""bribe"" -> uses B, R, I, B, E -> but B is repeated? Actually, it's valid. But let's see other options.
   ""prime"" -> P, R, I, M, E -> all distinct and common.

 Another common one: ""drone"" -> but we don't know if D, R, O, N are allowed? We haven't tried them.

 However, note that we have no information about these letters. So we can use them.

 But we must remember that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Let me choose ""prime"" because it uses common consonants and a vowel (I) that we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""drone"" is also good because it has O and N which are common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters to work with and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we know the 5th letter is E, we can focus on the first four.

 Let me consider ""drone"": D, R, O, N, E -> but the E is at the end, so that's good. However, we are not sure about the positions of the other letters.

 Another option: ""prone"" -> P, R, O, N, E.

 But I think ""prime"" is a good choice because it has M and I which are common.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent. We know S, L, A, T are absent, so ""prime"" is safe.

 Let's go with ""prime"".

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""Prime"" is a valid English word.

 So, second guess: ""prime""

 We are hoping to get feedback on P, R, I, M, and we already know E is correct at the end.

 However, note that the feedback for E in the 5th position will be ✓ again, but we already know that.

 Let me write the guess: prime

 But wait, what if the secret word has E in the 5th position and we are testing other letters? That's the plan.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E at the end and uses letters that are more common? 

 Another idea: ""rinse"" -> but we know S is absent, so we cannot use S. So ""rinse"" is invalid because it has S.

 We must avoid S, L, A, T.

 So, ""prime"" is acceptable.

 Let me check: P, R, I, M, E -> none of the forbidden letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""prime"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- **E is correct and in position 5** (the word ends with E).
- **S, L, A, T are absent** from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It should avoid **S, L, A, T** entirely.
- Use new common letters (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, D) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""PRIME""**:
- Tests P, R, I, M (new letters).
- Ends with E (confirmed position).
- Avoids forbidden letters (S, L, A, T).

We are testing them.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""prone"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""probe""? We don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider that we have more letters to test, but we have limited tries.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that has a letter we haven\'t tried in one of the positions, but we have to form a valid word.\n\nBut ""prone"" is fine.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nWhat about ""prude""? Or ""prove""?\n\nI think ""prone"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""prone"":\n- If the third letter is O and fourth is N, then we get it correct.\n- If not, we get feedback on O and N.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe can also consider ""probe"" to test B.\n\nBut I think ""prone"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""prone"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters, and ""prone"" uses P, R, O, N, E. O and N are not in the absent list, so it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""prone"".Based on the feedback:\n- **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).\n- **P is confirmed at position 1 and R at position 2** (from Guess 2).\n- **I and M are absent** (from Guess 2), adding to the earlier absent letters: **S, L, A, T** (from Guess 1).\n- The secret word pattern is: **P R _ _ E**.\n\nThe third and fourth letters must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list (A, I, L, M, S, T).

We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""slate"" -> E is correct at position 5; S, L, A, T absent.

Guess 3: ""prone"" -> P correct position 1, R correct position 2, E correct position 5; O and N absent.

So now we know:
- The word is in the pattern: P R _ _ E
- Known absent letters: S, L, A, T, I, M, O, N
- The third and fourth letters are missing, and must be from the remaining letters.

Available letters: We must avoid the absent letters: A, I, L, M, N, O, S, T.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P*, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
But note: P, R, E are already used and confirmed, so for the two missing positions, we can use any of the remaining letters except the absent ones.

However, P is already at position 1 and R at position 2, so they are occupied. The missing letters must be two letters from the available set, and they can be new letters not yet tested.

We need to find a word that fits: P R ? ? E

Possible words? We must use letters not in the absent list.

Let's consider common words:

- prune? But we tried ""prone"" and N is absent, so prune has N -> not allowed.
- probe? B is available? Yes. And O is absent? We know O is absent from guess 3, so probe has O -> not allowed? Probe has O? probe: P R O B E -> O is in the third position, but guess 3 ""prone"" had O(x) meaning O is absent. So probe would use O, which is absent -> invalid.

We must avoid using any absent letters.

So words with O, N, etc., are banned.

What about words without O and N? For example:

- prude: P R U D E -> U and D are not in absent list? Yes, so possible.
- prove: but O is absent, not allowed.
- price: I is absent, not allowed.
- pride: I is absent, not allowed.
- brake: A is absent, not allowed.
- plume: M is absent, not allowed.
- prune: has N and might have U? But N is absent.

prude: P R U D E -> uses U and D.

Another one: ""prune"" is out because of N.

What about ""prose""? But S and O are absent.

Another option: ""prone"" we tried, didn't work.

""prime"" we tried, didn't work.

Perhaps ""pryke""? Not a word.

""prase""? But A and S are absent.

""prede""? Not a word.

""prude"" seems valid: meaning a person who is excessively proper or modest.

Also, ""prune"" is invalid now.

Another word: ""prole""? But O is absent.

""prate"": A and T absent.

""pruce""? Not a word.

""prude"" seems to be a candidate.

Are there others?

""prone"" and ""probe"" are out.

What about ""preve""? Not common.

""prize"": I and Z? I is absent, so not allowed.

""proke""? Not a word.

""pryce""? Not a word.

""prink""? K is available, but let me check: prink means to dress or adjust one's dress, but is it valid? And I is absent? Prink: P R I N K -> I and N are absent -> invalid.

So, we don't have many choices.

Another word: ""bride"" -> but B is not at start, pattern is PR at start.

We need PR at start.

""prude"" might be the only common word? Or ""prosy""? But O and S absent.

""proud"": O and U? O is absent, so no.

""priss"": S and I absent.

So, ""prude"" appears to be a valid option.

But let's confirm: P R U D E. U and D are not in the absent list? Absent letters: A,I,L,M,N,O,S,T. So U is not absent? Correct. D is not absent? Correct.

Therefore, we can try ""prude"".

If not, there might be other words, but let's go with ""prude"".

We have 3 tries left, so it's acceptable.

So, fourth guess: ""prude""

We hope that U is in the third position and D in the fourth? Or maybe not? But according to pattern, we are testing U at position 3 and D at position 4.

If it matches, we are done.

If not, we get feedback on U and D.

Perhaps there is another word: ""prede"" is not valid.

""prune"" is invalid.

""pryde""? Not a word.

""prube""? Not a word.

""prude"" is the best candidate.

Another word: ""prore""? Not a word.

""crore"" doesn't start with PR.

So, I think ""prude"" is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess is ""prude"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

- The secret word is **5 letters**, starts with **PR**, ends with **E** (pattern: P R _ _ E).
- **Confirmed absent letters**: A, I, L, M, N, O, S, T (from previous feedback).
- The third and fourth positions must be filled with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (though P, R, E are already placed).

Given the pattern **P R _ _ E**, possible words include:
- **PRUDE** (tests U and D in positions 3 and 4).
- Other theoretical candidates like ""PROKE"" (invalid word), ""PRYDE"" (invalid), or ""PRECE"" (invalid) are not valid English words.
- ""PRUDE"" uses the new letters U and D, which have not been tested yet and are not absent.

This guess maximizes the potential to confirm or rule out U and D while sticking to the known pattern. If ""PRUDE"" is incorrect, the feedback on U and D will be invaluable, narrowing down possibilities significantly for the next guess.

<guess>prude</guess>",prude,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""slate"" -> E is correct at position 5; S, L, A, T absent.
Guess 2: ""prime"" -> P correct position 1, R correct position 2, E correct position 5; I and M absent.
Guess 3: ""prone"" -> P correct position 1, R correct position 2, E correct position 5; O and N absent.

So now we know:
- The word is in the pattern: P R _ _ E
- Known absent letters: S, L, A, T, I, M, O, N
- The third and fourth letters are missing, and must be from the remaining letters.

Available letters: We must avoid the absent letters: A, I, L, M, N, O, S, T.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P*, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
But note: P, R, E are already used and confirmed, so for the two missing positions, we can use any of the remaining letters except the absent ones.

However, P is already at position 1 and R at position 2, so they are occupied. The missing letters must be two letters from the available set, and they can be new letters not yet tested.

We need to find a word that fits: P R ? ? E

Possible words? We must use letters not in the absent list.

Let's consider common words:

- prune? But we tried ""prone"" and N is absent, so prune has N -> not allowed.
- probe? B is available? Yes. And O is absent? We know O is absent from guess 3, so probe has O -> not allowed? Probe has O? probe: P R O B E -> O is in the third position, but guess 3 ""prone"" had O(x) meaning O is absent. So probe would use O, which is absent -> invalid.

We must avoid using any absent letters.

So words with O, N, etc., are banned.

What about words without O and N? For example:

- prude: P R U D E -> U and D are not in absent list? Yes, so possible.
- prove: but O is absent, not allowed.
- price: I is absent, not allowed.
- pride: I is absent, not allowed.
- brake: A is absent, not allowed.
- plume: M is absent, not allowed.
- prune: has N and might have U? But N is absent.

prude: P R U D E -> uses U and D.

Another one: ""prune"" is out because of N.

What about ""prose""? But S and O are absent.

Another option: ""prone"" we tried, didn't work.

""prime"" we tried, didn't work.

Perhaps ""pryke""? Not a word.

""prase""? But A and S are absent.

""prede""? Not a word.

""prude"" seems valid: meaning a person who is excessively proper or modest.

Also, ""prune"" is invalid now.

Another word: ""prole""? But O is absent.

""prate"": A and T absent.

""pruce""? Not a word.

""prude"" seems to be a candidate.

Are there others?

""prone"" and ""probe"" are out.

What about ""preve""? Not common.

""prize"": I and Z? I is absent, so not allowed.

""proke""? Not a word.

""pryce""? Not a word.

""prink""? K is available, but let me check: prink means to dress or adjust one's dress, but is it valid? And I is absent? Prink: P R I N K -> I and N are absent -> invalid.

So, we don't have many choices.

Another word: ""bride"" -> but B is not at start, pattern is PR at start.

We need PR at start.

""prude"" might be the only common word? Or ""prosy""? But O and S absent.

""proud"": O and U? O is absent, so no.

""priss"": S and I absent.

So, ""prude"" appears to be a valid option.

But let's confirm: P R U D E. U and D are not in the absent list? Absent letters: A,I,L,M,N,O,S,T. So U is not absent? Correct. D is not absent? Correct.

Therefore, we can try ""prude"".

If not, there might be other words, but let's go with ""prude"".

We have 3 tries left, so it's acceptable.

So, fourth guess: ""prude""

We hope that U is in the third position and D in the fourth? Or maybe not? But according to pattern, we are testing U at position 3 and D at position 4.

If it matches, we are done.

If not, we get feedback on U and D.

Perhaps there is another word: ""prede"" is not valid.

""prune"" is invalid.

""pryde""? Not a word.

""prube""? Not a word.

""prude"" is the best candidate.

Another word: ""prore""? Not a word.

""crore"" doesn't start with PR.

So, I think ""prude"" is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess is ""prude"".After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

- The secret word is **5 letters**, starts with **PR**, ends with **E** (pattern: P R _ _ E).
- **Confirmed absent letters**: A, I, L, M, N, O, S, T (from previous feedback).
- The third and fourth positions must be filled with letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (though P, R, E are already placed).

Given the pattern **P R _ _ E**, possible words include:
- **PRUDE** (tests U and D in positions 3 and 4).
- Other theoretical candidates like ""PROKE"" (invalid word), ""PRYDE"" (invalid), or ""PRECE"" (invalid) are not valid English words.
- ""PRUDE"" uses the new letters U and D, which have not been tested yet and are not absent.

This guess maximizes the potential to confirm or rule out U and D while sticking to the known pattern. If ""PRUDE"" is incorrect, the feedback on U and D will be invaluable, narrowing down possibilities significantly for the next guess.",Guess 4: prude -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) U(✓) D(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
