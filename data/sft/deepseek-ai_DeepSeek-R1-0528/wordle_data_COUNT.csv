We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any information about the word. I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. Words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants are often good starting points.

Common starting words in games like Wordle are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc. However, I note that the feedback uses a system of three symbols: 
  - ✓ (green) for correct letter and position
  - - (yellow) for correct letter but wrong position
  - x (black/gray) for absent letter.

I want a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a typical starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good.

But note: the example provided used words like ""ST"", ""BR"", etc., which might imply the solution has those letters? Actually, the example is just an example. We don't know the word.

After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels? Wait: C, R, A, N, E: that's two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. Actually, vowels are A, E, I, O, U so ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E).

Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" for many vowels, but note it has 4 vowels (A, D? D is consonant, so A, I, E, U - that's four vowels). However, it doesn't have common consonants.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" (a bird) is used, but might be less common.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels: A, I, E
- It has two common consonants: R, S

But let's check: R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E (three); consonants: R, S.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E (two); consonants: S, L, T.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good starting point.

So my first guess is: RAISE

I will output it as per the format.

I am starting my first guess without any prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A strong starting word should:
- Include common letters (vowels and consonants) to test for their presence.
- Avoid repeating words that may appear in examples.
Ideally, the word should have multiple vowels and frequent consonants to reveal letter positions effectively. 

A popular choice in similar games is ""RAISE"" because:
- It uses three vowels (A, I, E), which are common in English words.
- It includes two common consonants (R, S).
- This combination gives high coverage of frequent letters, which may help identify matching or misplaced letters across various positions.

Other options like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also good, but ""RAISE"" offers a slightly better vowel-consonant balance for initial data gathering.

Alright, the user just provided feedback on my first guess ""raise"", and all letters were marked incorrect: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x). This is quite surprising because ""raise"" contains common letters, but it tells me the secret word has none of these letters. 

I need to completely shift my strategy. The word likely uses less frequent consonants and perhaps uncommon vowels. Since A, E, I are excluded, the vowels must be O, U, or Y serving as a vowel. Consonants like R, S are out, so I should focus on others such as C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W.

For the next guess, I want to maximize information by testing five new letters. Choosing a word without any repeated letters and covering common untested consonants: ""CLOMP"" comes to mind—it uses C, L, O, M, P. ""C"" and ""M"" are moderately common, ""O"" is a vowel, ""L"" and ""P"" frequent consonants. 

Alternatively, ""NYMPH"" includes Y as a vowel and many consonants but ""Y"" is riskier. ""CLOMP"" seems better rounded. After eliminating R/A/I/S/E, ""CLOMP"" ensures no overlap with previous letters.

The goal is to uncover presence or absence of letters like O (possible vowel), C, L, M, P. This reshapes the possibilities significantly—secret word could be like ""THUMB"", ""PLUCK"", or ""DOWDY"". 

This guess might also pin down positions better. If it fails, the pool narrows further—words avoiding R/A/I/S/E and upcoming letters. But ""CLOMP"" feels optimal for this stage.

Based on the previous feedback:  
All letters in ""raise"" (R, A, I, S, E) are **absent** from the secret word. This means:
- The secret word contains **no R, A, I, S, or E**.  
- All vowels are likely **O, U**, or **Y** (if used as a vowel).  
- Focus on **unused consonants** like C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.  

For my next guess, I need to prioritize:
1. Testing **new letters** excluded from the first guess.
2. Incorporating **remaining common vowels** (O, U).
3. Avoiding any letter from ""raise"" (R,A,I,S,E).

A strong candidate is **""CLOMP""**:
- **C, L, O, M, P**: All untested letters.
- **O** checks for a common vowel.
- **C, L, M, P** are high-frequency consonants.

Words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants are often good starting points.\n\nCommon starting words in games like Wordle are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc. However, I note that the feedback uses a system of three symbols: \n  - ✓ (green) for correct letter and position\n  - - (yellow) for correct letter but wrong position\n  - x (black/gray) for absent letter.\n\nI want a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a typical starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good.\n\nBut note: the example provided used words like ""ST"", ""BR"", etc., which might imply the solution has those letters? Actually, the example is just an example. We don\'t know the word.\n\nAfter considering, I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels? Wait: C, R, A, N, E: that\'s two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. Actually, vowels are A, E, I, O, U so ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E).\n\nAnother popular choice is ""ADIEU"" for many vowels, but note it has 4 vowels (A, D? D is consonant, so A, I, E, U - that\'s four vowels). However, it doesn\'t have common consonants.\n\nAlternatively, ""SOARE"" (a bird) is used, but might be less common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because:\n- It has three vowels: A, I, E\n- It has two common consonants: R, S\n\nBut let\'s check: R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E (three); consonants: R, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E (two); consonants: S, L, T.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" is a good starting point.\n\nSo my first guess is: RAISE\n\nI will output it as per the format.I am starting my first guess without any prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A strong starting word should:\n- Include common letters (vowels and consonants) to test for their presence.\n- Avoid repeating words that may appear in examples.\nIdeally, the word should have multiple vowels and frequent consonants to reveal letter positions effectively. \n\nA popular choice in similar games is ""RAISE"" because:\n- It uses three vowels (A, I, E), which are common in English words.\n- It includes two common consonants (R, S).\n- This combination gives high coverage of frequent letters, which may help identify matching or misplaced letters across various positions.\n\nOther options like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also good, but ""RAISE"" offers a slightly better vowel-consonant balance for initial data gathering.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, the user just provided feedback on my first guess ""raise"", and all letters were marked incorrect: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x). This is quite surprising because ""raise"" contains common letters, but it tells me the secret word has none of these letters. \n\nI need to completely shift my strategy. The word likely uses less frequent consonants and perhaps uncommon vowels. Since A, E, I are excluded, the vowels must be O, U, or Y serving as a vowel. Consonants like R, S are out, so I should focus on others such as C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W.\n\nFor the next guess, I want to maximize information by testing five new letters. Choosing a word without any repeated letters and covering common untested consonants: ""CLOMP"" comes to mind—it uses C, L, O, M, P. ""C"" and ""M"" are moderately common, ""O"" is a vowel, ""L"" and ""P"" frequent consonants. \n\nAlternatively, ""NYMPH"" includes Y as a vowel and many consonants but ""Y"" is riskier. ""CLOMP"" seems better rounded. After eliminating R/A/I/S/E, ""CLOMP"" ensures no overlap with previous letters.\n\nThe goal is to uncover presence or absence of letters like O (possible vowel), C, L, M, P. This reshapes the possibilities significantly—secret word could be like ""THUMB"", ""PLUCK"", or ""DOWDY"". \n\nThis guess might also pin down positions better. If it fails, the pool narrows further—words avoiding R/A/I/S/E and upcoming letters. But ""CLOMP"" feels optimal for this stage.Based on the previous feedback:  \nAll letters in ""raise"" (R, A, I, S, E) are **absent** from the secret word. This means:\n- The secret word contains **no R, A, I, S, or E**.  \n- All vowels are likely **O, U**, or **Y** (if used as a vowel).  \n- Focus on **unused consonants** like C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.  \n\nFor my next guess, I need to prioritize:\n1. Testing **new letters** excluded from the first guess.\n2. Incorporating **remaining common vowels** (O, U).\n3. Avoiding any letter from ""raise"" (R,A,I,S,E).\n\nA strong candidate is **""CLOMP""**:\n- **C, L, O, M, P**: All untested letters.\n- **O** checks for a common vowel.\n- **C, L, M, P** are high-frequency consonants.\n- If we guess ""CLOMP"", the feedback will reveal if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>clomp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: clomp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) O(-) M(x) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""raise"": All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""clomp"": 
   - C is correct (✓), meaning C is in the word and in the first position. So the secret word starts with C.
   - L is absent (x), so no L in the word.
   - O is present but in the wrong position (-). So O is in the word, but not in the second position.
   - M and P are absent (x), so no M or P.

So from Guess 2:
- Position 1: C is correct → Secret word: C _ _ _ _
- O is in the word, but not in position 2 → so O must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters L, M, P are absent (in addition to R, A, I, S, E from before).

Now, we know the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains O, but not in position 2 → so O is in 3, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P.

Available letters: We need to avoid R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P. Also, from the alphabet, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is used and must appear. So the word must have C (position1), O (somewhere not pos2), and three other letters from the available set.

Common vowels: We don't have A, E, I, but O is present. The other possible vowels are U and sometimes Y. So we might need to include U or Y.

We also know that the word has no L, M, P.

Given that O is not in position 2, and position 2 is currently unknown (but not O), let's think of possibilities for position 2.

We can try to form a word with:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: ? (not O, and not any of the forbidden letters)
- Then O must be in 3,4, or 5.

Also, since we have few vowels left, U might be a good candidate to test.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Include O in a position that is not 2 (so positions 3,4,5).
- Use new letters to test more of the available consonants and vowels (like U, H, T, etc.)

Consideration: We have not tested U, T, N, D, etc. which are common.

Looking for words that start with C, have O in 3,4, or 5, and use other non-forbidden letters.

Some candidate words:
- If O is in position 3: C?O??
- If O is in position 4: C??O?
- If O is in position 5: C????O

But we need real words.

Possible words:
- ""CROWN"": But R is forbidden (from guess1) → no R.
- ""CLOWN"": L and W? W is allowed, but L is forbidden → no L.
- ""COUNT"": 
   - C O U N T → positions: C(1), O(2) but O is not allowed in position 2? Feedback said O is not in position 2. So ""COUNT"" has O in position 2 → invalid because we know O cannot be there.

We need O not in position 2.

So words where O is at position 3,4,5.

Examples:
- Position 3: ""CHOOF"", ""CHOOM"" → but M forbidden? and not standard words? 
   - Better: ""CHOMP"" but M forbidden → no M.
   - ""CHOCK"": H, O, C, K. But C is at start, O in third? But we have C already at position1, and O must be elsewhere. And ""CHOCK"": C H O C K → duplicates C? It's C at start, and C again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the rules don't say anything. So duplicates might be possible? Wait, in the feedback system, if a letter appears twice, we don't know how it's handled. But typically, in such games, duplicates are handled by position.

But in our case, the word may have duplicate letters? However, in the first guess ""raise"", all different, and ""clomp"" all different. So let's assume we avoid duplicates until we know more.

Forbidden letters: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

So ""CHOOK"" (variant spelling? but maybe not valid).

Common words: 
- How about ""COULD"" ? 
   - C O U L D → O is in position 2 → invalid (we know O cannot be in position 2).

Other words:
- Position 4: C _ _ O _
   - Examples: ""COUNT"" was invalid. 
   - ""DONUT"" but doesn't start with C.
   - Words starting with C? ""CACTI"" → but C duplicate? and A forbidden? A is forbidden.

Words without forbidden letters and O not at position 2.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,~~L~~,N,~~M~~,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, plus O is included.

O must be in the word. Since position1 is C, and O not at position2.

Try position3: C _ O _ _

Examples: 
- ""CHOIR"" → H,O,I,R → I and R forbidden.
- ""CHORD"" → O is position3? But R forbidden.
- ""CHOWK"" → not standard.
- ""BHOUT"" → not starting C.

Better: ""THICK"" but not starting with C.

Start with C: ""CHOKY"" → C H O K Y → H, O, K, Y. O at position3.
Check: H, K, Y not forbidden? Yes. So ""choky"" is a word (adjective, sticky? or variant of chocolate? Actually, choky: causing choking or choky as noun? Acceptable).

But ""choky"" has Y which can be a vowel. Still, we might not know if it's valid.

Another: ""CHOOF"" → obscure.

""CHOON"" → slang, not widely known.

Try O in position4: C _ _ O _

Examples:
- ""CUPRO"" → not a word? How about ""CUPSO"" no.
- ""JUMBO"" → doesn't start with C? 
- ""CURIO"" → C U R I O → R and I forbidden? R and A,I,S,E are forbidden → but R and I forbidden.

Forbidden: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

So ""CURIO"" has R and I → bad.

""DUTCH"" → not starting C.

Start with C: ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.

""CLOUD"" → L forbidden and O at position2? No, L forbidden and O should not be at position2.

O at position4: so something like C? ? O ?

Common words: 
- ""ABOUT"" → no, A forbidden.
- ""CANTON"" → too long? 5 letters: ""CANTON"" is 6? C-A-N-T-O-N? 6 letters.

5-letter: ""CINCH"" → I forbidden.

Hard. What about ""COHOE"" → obscure, and O at position1? Not starting C.

Positions: C at 1, then O at position4? So indices: 1:C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4:O, 5:?

Available: F,G,H,K,N,T,U,W,Y, etc.

Examples: ""CHINO"" → but H? and O in position5? ""CHINO"" is C H I N O → I forbidden.

""CONTO"" → O at position2? Invalid.

""CONKY"" → K and Y? C O N K Y → O at position2, invalid.

O at position5? Then C _ _ _ O

Examples: 
- ""BALCO"" not word.
- ""CASINO"" too long? 5-letter: ""CAMEo"" → not.
- ""CALICO"" too long.

Common: ""HELLO"" → doesn't start with C.

With C: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""TYPIC"" → not starting with C? Doesn't.

We need to include U or Y as vowel.

Let me try ""COUTH"" → O at position2? Invalid.

Another idea: ""COUGH"" → O at position2 → invalid.

How about ""DUCHY"" → not C starter.

Start with C and O at end: ""CARRYO"" → no.

""CANTO"" → A forbidden? A in position2? And A forbidden → no.

Recall: We have U available.

List words: C? ? O? ? but O not at position2.

I think I missed some words. 
- ""CHOCK"": Earlier, C-H-O-C-K? But duplicate C? We don't know if secret allows duplicate letters. Moreover, H, O, C, K: C at start, O at position3? Then another C? But we need to check.

If the secret word has duplicate C, then in feedback for ""clomp"": We had C(✓) meaning position1 is correct C. Then if we have another C in position4, say, but in ""clomp"" we don't have another C, so that wouldn't give information about duplicate.

For safety, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Alternative: Perhaps ""THING"" → not C.

Back to O in position3: C _ O _ _

Available vowels: O and U/Y? But O is already used in another position.

Letters: Pos1: C; Position2: must be not O, and not forbidden → must be a consonant? Not always, but vowels A,E,I forbidden ⇒ so position2 is consonant? Or U/Y.

U is a vowel. So position2 can be U? or Y? or consonant.

Words: 
- ""CUBIT"" → U, B, I, T → I forbidden.
- ""CUTIN"" → I.
- ""CUVET"" → obscure.
- ""CUTUP"" → P forbidden? P is forbidden → P(x) in guess2.

Another word: ""CHOUT"" → not common.

Perhaps ""COWER"" → R forbidden and O at position2? No.

Try O in position4: So pattern C??O?

Examples: 
- ""CANON"" → A forbidden? And O in position2? No.
- ""CROON"" → R forbidden.
- ""CROUP"" → R and P forbidden.
- ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.

With U: ""CURIO"" → forbidden.
""GROUP"" → doesn't start with C.

Start with C: ""CURGY"" → not word.

How about ""CONUS"" → O at position2? Invalid.

Perhaps we use Y: ""CYTON"" (biology term) → C Y T O N → O at position4? That works. Pattern: C Y T O N → positions: 1:C, 2:Y, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N? 
Letters: Y,T,O,N → all not forbidden? Y, T, O, N: O we know is present, Y is new, T new, N new. And no R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

""cyton"" is a valid word? Neuron part? Might be acceptable.

But let's see common words: ""PITHY"" → doesn't start with C.

Another: ""CYNIC"" → I forbidden? I in position4? C Y N I C → I is forbidden.

Back to O in position5: C???O

Words: 
- ""CASKO"" → A forbidden.
- ""DECKO"" → not C starter? Starting is D.
- With C: ""CAGOT"" → A forbidden.
- ""CAVEO"" → A.
- ""COMET"" → O in position3? M forbidden.

Perhaps ""TUMOR"" → doesn't start with C.

A common word: ""BROAD"" → not.

Wait, think: ""COUNT"" is common but O in position2 which is disallowed.

What about ""COUGH"" → O in position2 → disallowed.

Another idea: The word might have O and U. But U not tested.

For example: ""CUMUL"" → obscure.

""COULD"" → O in position2 → not.

Perhaps ""DONUT"" → not starting C.

I think we need to list the constraints:
- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P
- Required: C (position1), O (not position2)
- Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Try O in position3: pattern C _ O _ _

Possible words:
- ""CHOUB"" → not standard.
- ""CHOOF"" → not common.
- ""CHOOM"" → M forbidden? M is forbidden → no.
- ""CHOOK"" → K? Might be slang.
- ""CHOTA"" → A forbidden.
- ""CHOTT"" → duplicate T? And O at position3? Chott: dry lake? Not common.

But ""CHOOK"" might be acceptable? But let's avoid.

Use H? ""CHUTA"" → U? C H U T A → A forbidden? ""CHUTE"" → E forbidden? E forbidden.

""CHUTE"": letters C,H,U,T,E → E forbidden → no.

Another: With U: ""CUBEB"" → has E? C U B E B → E forbidden → no.

Perhaps ""CONK"" → too short? 4 letters? ""CONKY"" has O at position2 → no. ""CONKY"" is C O N K Y → O position2, disallowed.

Consider O in position4: C??O ?

- ""CANTO"" → A forbidden.
- ""CAPOT"" → A and P forbidden.
- ""CAROB"" → A and R forbidden.
- ""CATHO"" → not word.

But ""CELLO"" → E and L forbidden? E and L both forbidden → no.

""CONVO"" → O in position2? C O N V O → O at position2 and end? Position2 O is disallowed per feedback, so invalid.

But if O is at position4, it's okay? ""CONVO"": positions: 1:C, 2:O (O is in position2, which we know is bad → so cannot).

""CONVO"" has O at position2, so invalid.

Another: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.

""BENCH"" → not C starter.

I think I need to try U and Y.

Perhaps ""CUTTY"" → U, T, T, Y → duplicate T? Allowed? But pattern: C U T T Y → O missing? We must include O? No, we know O is in the word? From guess2, O is present.

But in this word ""CUTTY"", no O → does not have O → so invalid candidate.

We know O must be in positions 3,4,5.

So we need a word with O.

Let's search for words matching C, O in 3/4/5, no forbidden letters.

Candidates:
- O in position3: ""CHOKY"" -> C H O K Y → O at position3. H, K, Y allowed? We haven't seen H or K, so yes. Word is choky (chok·y, adj. variant of chokey, meaning tight or suffocating? Or related to chowky? But it's an English word).
- O in position4: ""CYCLO"" → has L? No, C Y C L O → L forbidden? L is forbidden → no L.
  But ""Cyclone"" is 7 letters. 5-letter: ""CYCLO"" is prefix? Not common.

  ""TYCHO"" → not starting C.
- ""HUTCH"" → not starting C.
- ""CROWD"" forbidden R.

Another with O in position4: ""BAYOU"" → not C? ""CANYO"" -> A forbidden.

""COYPU"" → O at position2, forbidden.

O in position5: ""??C? O"" wait no, O at end: pattern ????O, but we have C at start: so C???O

Words:
- ""CAMPO"" → A and M and P? M,P forbidden and A forbidden.
- ""CARBO"" → A,R forbidden.
- ""CONDO"" → O at position5? C O N D O → O at position2? Yes, so position2 O, which is disallowed.

What about ""CUE""? Too short.

Perhaps ""NACHO"" → not C starter.

Wait, ""BUTEO"" -> not C.

With C: ""CHEVY"" -> E forbidden.

I think ""CHOKY"" is a reasonable guess. It follows:
- Starts with C (position1: C)
- Position3: O (which is allowed since O not at position2)
- Has H, K, Y: all new letters.
- No forbidden letters: H, K, Y not in forbidden list.
- Word: choky (accepted in some dictionaries).

Alternatively, ""COHOG"" -> H, O in position3? C O H O G -> O at position2 forbidden.

If no ""CHOKY"", an alternative with U: ""CUCKOO"" too long? 6 letters.

5-letter: ""COUTH"" invalid position for O.

Or ""CUCHO"" -> U,C,H,O? Duplicate C? Not, but C at start and another at position4? But also O at position4? Pattern: C U C H O → O at position5? So O in position5: yes. But duplicate C? Maybe.

But feedback: if secret is ""cucuy"" or something, we don't know.

Another word: ""CUSHY"" -> U, S, H, Y -> S forbidden? S(x) from guess1, so S is forbidden -> ""cushy"" contains S -> forbidden.

""COVIN"" -> O position2? Invalid.

So I think ""CHOKY"" is a decent choice for a guess.

But let's confirm: In ""CHOKY"", positions: 
- Position1: C (matched)
- Position3: O → from feedback of guess2, O is misplaced (so not position2), but here it's position3 → which is possible.

And we test new letters: H, K, Y.

If the word is ""choky"", it might be niche, but it's valid.

Alternatively, ""THUNK"" -> not C.

Another possibility: ""COVET"" -> O position2 invalid.

Or ""FLOOD"" -> L and O position2? L forbidden and O position2 forbidden.

So I'll go with ""CHOKY"".

But another idea: perhaps ""COWAN"" -> O position2 forbidden.

Maybe ""BOWET"" -> not C.

Perhaps use N: ""CNIDA"" -> not common.

Okay, let's proceed with ""CHOKY"".

Therefore, my guess is ""CHOKY"".

In the feedback, we also know that O is present but not position2. In ""CHOKY"", we put O at position3. This will help confirm the position of O.

Other words: ""CHOUN"" -> archaic.

I think ""CHOKY"" is acceptable.

<guess>choky</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Secret word starts with C** (since C was correct in position 1 in ""clomp"").
- **O is in the word but not in position 2**.
- **Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P** (all marked absent in previous feedback).
- The secret word must include **O** at one of the positions 3, 4, or 5, and use only untested or confirmed letters.

For this guess, I chose **""CHOKY""** because:
- It starts with **C** (required).
- It places **O** in position 3 (consistent with feedback that O is not in position 2).
- It tests new letters: **H, K, Y** (all not previously used and not forbidden).
- It adheres to the constraint of avoiding forbidden letters.
- ""Choky"" is a valid English word (e.g., meaning oppressive or jail-like).

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If O is correct in position 3, we confirm its placement.
- Feedback on H, K, and Y will reveal their presence/absence and positions.

<guess>choky</guess>",choky,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""raise"": All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""clomp"": 
   - C is correct (✓), meaning C is in the word and in the first position. So the secret word starts with C.
   - L is absent (x), so no L in the word.
   - O is present but in the wrong position (-). So O is in the word, but not in the second position.
   - M and P are absent (x), so no M or P.

So from Guess 2:
- Position 1: C is correct → Secret word: C _ _ _ _
- O is in the word, but not in position 2 → so O must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters L, M, P are absent (in addition to R, A, I, S, E from before).

Now, we know the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains O, but not in position 2 → so O is in 3, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P.

Available letters: We need to avoid R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P. Also, from the alphabet, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is used and must appear. So the word must have C (position1), O (somewhere not pos2), and three other letters from the available set.

Common vowels: We don't have A, E, I, but O is present. The other possible vowels are U and sometimes Y. So we might need to include U or Y.

We also know that the word has no L, M, P.

Given that O is not in position 2, and position 2 is currently unknown (but not O), let's think of possibilities for position 2.

We can try to form a word with:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: ? (not O, and not any of the forbidden letters)
- Then O must be in 3,4, or 5.

Also, since we have few vowels left, U might be a good candidate to test.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Include O in a position that is not 2 (so positions 3,4,5).
- Use new letters to test more of the available consonants and vowels (like U, H, T, etc.)

Consideration: We have not tested U, T, N, D, etc. which are common.

Looking for words that start with C, have O in 3,4, or 5, and use other non-forbidden letters.

Some candidate words:
- If O is in position 3: C?O??
- If O is in position 4: C??O?
- If O is in position 5: C????O

But we need real words.

Possible words:
- ""CROWN"": But R is forbidden (from guess1) → no R.
- ""CLOWN"": L and W? W is allowed, but L is forbidden → no L.
- ""COUNT"": 
   - C O U N T → positions: C(1), O(2) but O is not allowed in position 2? Feedback said O is not in position 2. So ""COUNT"" has O in position 2 → invalid because we know O cannot be there.

We need O not in position 2.

So words where O is at position 3,4,5.

Examples:
- Position 3: ""CHOOF"", ""CHOOM"" → but M forbidden? and not standard words? 
   - Better: ""CHOMP"" but M forbidden → no M.
   - ""CHOCK"": H, O, C, K. But C is at start, O in third? But we have C already at position1, and O must be elsewhere. And ""CHOCK"": C H O C K → duplicates C? It's C at start, and C again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the rules don't say anything. So duplicates might be possible? Wait, in the feedback system, if a letter appears twice, we don't know how it's handled. But typically, in such games, duplicates are handled by position.

But in our case, the word may have duplicate letters? However, in the first guess ""raise"", all different, and ""clomp"" all different. So let's assume we avoid duplicates until we know more.

Forbidden letters: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

So ""CHOOK"" (variant spelling? but maybe not valid).

Common words: 
- How about ""COULD"" ? 
   - C O U L D → O is in position 2 → invalid (we know O cannot be in position 2).

Other words:
- Position 4: C _ _ O _
   - Examples: ""COUNT"" was invalid. 
   - ""DONUT"" but doesn't start with C.
   - Words starting with C? ""CACTI"" → but C duplicate? and A forbidden? A is forbidden.

Words without forbidden letters and O not at position 2.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,~~L~~,N,~~M~~,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, plus O is included.

O must be in the word. Since position1 is C, and O not at position2.

Try position3: C _ O _ _

Examples: 
- ""CHOIR"" → H,O,I,R → I and R forbidden.
- ""CHORD"" → O is position3? But R forbidden.
- ""CHOWK"" → not standard.
- ""BHOUT"" → not starting C.

Better: ""THICK"" but not starting with C.

Start with C: ""CHOKY"" → C H O K Y → H, O, K, Y. O at position3.
Check: H, K, Y not forbidden? Yes. So ""choky"" is a word (adjective, sticky? or variant of chocolate? Actually, choky: causing choking or choky as noun? Acceptable).

But ""choky"" has Y which can be a vowel. Still, we might not know if it's valid.

Another: ""CHOOF"" → obscure.

""CHOON"" → slang, not widely known.

Try O in position4: C _ _ O _

Examples:
- ""CUPRO"" → not a word? How about ""CUPSO"" no.
- ""JUMBO"" → doesn't start with C? 
- ""CURIO"" → C U R I O → R and I forbidden? R and A,I,S,E are forbidden → but R and I forbidden.

Forbidden: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

So ""CURIO"" has R and I → bad.

""DUTCH"" → not starting C.

Start with C: ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.

""CLOUD"" → L forbidden and O at position2? No, L forbidden and O should not be at position2.

O at position4: so something like C? ? O ?

Common words: 
- ""ABOUT"" → no, A forbidden.
- ""CANTON"" → too long? 5 letters: ""CANTON"" is 6? C-A-N-T-O-N? 6 letters.

5-letter: ""CINCH"" → I forbidden.

Hard. What about ""COHOE"" → obscure, and O at position1? Not starting C.

Positions: C at 1, then O at position4? So indices: 1:C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4:O, 5:?

Available: F,G,H,K,N,T,U,W,Y, etc.

Examples: ""CHINO"" → but H? and O in position5? ""CHINO"" is C H I N O → I forbidden.

""CONTO"" → O at position2? Invalid.

""CONKY"" → K and Y? C O N K Y → O at position2, invalid.

O at position5? Then C _ _ _ O

Examples: 
- ""BALCO"" not word.
- ""CASINO"" too long? 5-letter: ""CAMEo"" → not.
- ""CALICO"" too long.

Common: ""HELLO"" → doesn't start with C.

With C: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""TYPIC"" → not starting with C? Doesn't.

We need to include U or Y as vowel.

Let me try ""COUTH"" → O at position2? Invalid.

Another idea: ""COUGH"" → O at position2 → invalid.

How about ""DUCHY"" → not C starter.

Start with C and O at end: ""CARRYO"" → no.

""CANTO"" → A forbidden? A in position2? And A forbidden → no.

Recall: We have U available.

List words: C? ? O? ? but O not at position2.

I think I missed some words. 
- ""CHOCK"": Earlier, C-H-O-C-K? But duplicate C? We don't know if secret allows duplicate letters. Moreover, H, O, C, K: C at start, O at position3? Then another C? But we need to check.

If the secret word has duplicate C, then in feedback for ""clomp"": We had C(✓) meaning position1 is correct C. Then if we have another C in position4, say, but in ""clomp"" we don't have another C, so that wouldn't give information about duplicate.

For safety, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Alternative: Perhaps ""THING"" → not C.

Back to O in position3: C _ O _ _

Available vowels: O and U/Y? But O is already used in another position.

Letters: Pos1: C; Position2: must be not O, and not forbidden → must be a consonant? Not always, but vowels A,E,I forbidden ⇒ so position2 is consonant? Or U/Y.

U is a vowel. So position2 can be U? or Y? or consonant.

Words: 
- ""CUBIT"" → U, B, I, T → I forbidden.
- ""CUTIN"" → I.
- ""CUVET"" → obscure.
- ""CUTUP"" → P forbidden? P is forbidden → P(x) in guess2.

Another word: ""CHOUT"" → not common.

Perhaps ""COWER"" → R forbidden and O at position2? No.

Try O in position4: So pattern C??O?

Examples: 
- ""CANON"" → A forbidden? And O in position2? No.
- ""CROON"" → R forbidden.
- ""CROUP"" → R and P forbidden.
- ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.

With U: ""CURIO"" → forbidden.
""GROUP"" → doesn't start with C.

Start with C: ""CURGY"" → not word.

How about ""CONUS"" → O at position2? Invalid.

Perhaps we use Y: ""CYTON"" (biology term) → C Y T O N → O at position4? That works. Pattern: C Y T O N → positions: 1:C, 2:Y, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N? 
Letters: Y,T,O,N → all not forbidden? Y, T, O, N: O we know is present, Y is new, T new, N new. And no R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

""cyton"" is a valid word? Neuron part? Might be acceptable.

But let's see common words: ""PITHY"" → doesn't start with C.

Another: ""CYNIC"" → I forbidden? I in position4? C Y N I C → I is forbidden.

Back to O in position5: C???O

Words: 
- ""CASKO"" → A forbidden.
- ""DECKO"" → not C starter? Starting is D.
- With C: ""CAGOT"" → A forbidden.
- ""CAVEO"" → A.
- ""COMET"" → O in position3? M forbidden.

Perhaps ""TUMOR"" → doesn't start with C.

A common word: ""BROAD"" → not.

Wait, think: ""COUNT"" is common but O in position2 which is disallowed.

What about ""COUGH"" → O in position2 → disallowed.

Another idea: The word might have O and U. But U not tested.

For example: ""CUMUL"" → obscure.

""COULD"" → O in position2 → not.

Perhaps ""DONUT"" → not starting C.

I think we need to list the constraints:
- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P
- Required: C (position1), O (not position2)
- Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Try O in position3: pattern C _ O _ _

Possible words:
- ""CHOUB"" → not standard.
- ""CHOOF"" → not common.
- ""CHOOM"" → M forbidden? M is forbidden → no.
- ""CHOOK"" → K? Might be slang.
- ""CHOTA"" → A forbidden.
- ""CHOTT"" → duplicate T? And O at position3? Chott: dry lake? Not common.

But ""CHOOK"" might be acceptable? But let's avoid.

Use H? ""CHUTA"" → U? C H U T A → A forbidden? ""CHUTE"" → E forbidden? E forbidden.

""CHUTE"": letters C,H,U,T,E → E forbidden → no.

Another: With U: ""CUBEB"" → has E? C U B E B → E forbidden → no.

Perhaps ""CONK"" → too short? 4 letters? ""CONKY"" has O at position2 → no. ""CONKY"" is C O N K Y → O position2, disallowed.

Consider O in position4: C??O ?

- ""CANTO"" → A forbidden.
- ""CAPOT"" → A and P forbidden.
- ""CAROB"" → A and R forbidden.
- ""CATHO"" → not word.

But ""CELLO"" → E and L forbidden? E and L both forbidden → no.

""CONVO"" → O in position2? C O N V O → O at position2 and end? Position2 O is disallowed per feedback, so invalid.

But if O is at position4, it's okay? ""CONVO"": positions: 1:C, 2:O (O is in position2, which we know is bad → so cannot).

""CONVO"" has O at position2, so invalid.

Another: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.

""BENCH"" → not C starter.

I think I need to try U and Y.

Perhaps ""CUTTY"" → U, T, T, Y → duplicate T? Allowed? But pattern: C U T T Y → O missing? We must include O? No, we know O is in the word? From guess2, O is present.

But in this word ""CUTTY"", no O → does not have O → so invalid candidate.

We know O must be in positions 3,4,5.

So we need a word with O.

Let's search for words matching C, O in 3/4/5, no forbidden letters.

Candidates:
- O in position3: ""CHOKY"" -> C H O K Y → O at position3. H, K, Y allowed? We haven't seen H or K, so yes. Word is choky (chok·y, adj. variant of chokey, meaning tight or suffocating? Or related to chowky? But it's an English word).
- O in position4: ""CYCLO"" → has L? No, C Y C L O → L forbidden? L is forbidden → no L.
  But ""Cyclone"" is 7 letters. 5-letter: ""CYCLO"" is prefix? Not common.

  ""TYCHO"" → not starting C.
- ""HUTCH"" → not starting C.
- ""CROWD"" forbidden R.

Another with O in position4: ""BAYOU"" → not C? ""CANYO"" -> A forbidden.

""COYPU"" → O at position2, forbidden.

O in position5: ""??C? O"" wait no, O at end: pattern ????O, but we have C at start: so C???O

Words:
- ""CAMPO"" → A and M and P? M,P forbidden and A forbidden.
- ""CARBO"" → A,R forbidden.
- ""CONDO"" → O at position5? C O N D O → O at position2? Yes, so position2 O, which is disallowed.

What about ""CUE""? Too short.

Perhaps ""NACHO"" → not C starter.

Wait, ""BUTEO"" -> not C.

With C: ""CHEVY"" -> E forbidden.

I think ""CHOKY"" is a reasonable guess. It follows:
- Starts with C (position1: C)
- Position3: O (which is allowed since O not at position2)
- Has H, K, Y: all new letters.
- No forbidden letters: H, K, Y not in forbidden list.
- Word: choky (accepted in some dictionaries).

Alternatively, ""COHOG"" -> H, O in position3? C O H O G -> O at position2 forbidden.

If no ""CHOKY"", an alternative with U: ""CUCKOO"" too long? 6 letters.

5-letter: ""COUTH"" invalid position for O.

Or ""CUCHO"" -> U,C,H,O? Duplicate C? Not, but C at start and another at position4? But also O at position4? Pattern: C U C H O → O at position5? So O in position5: yes. But duplicate C? Maybe.

But feedback: if secret is ""cucuy"" or something, we don't know.

Another word: ""CUSHY"" -> U, S, H, Y -> S forbidden? S(x) from guess1, so S is forbidden -> ""cushy"" contains S -> forbidden.

""COVIN"" -> O position2? Invalid.

So I think ""CHOKY"" is a decent choice for a guess.

But let's confirm: In ""CHOKY"", positions: 
- Position1: C (matched)
- Position3: O → from feedback of guess2, O is misplaced (so not position2), but here it's position3 → which is possible.

And we test new letters: H, K, Y.

If the word is ""choky"", it might be niche, but it's valid.

Alternatively, ""THUNK"" -> not C.

Another possibility: ""COVET"" -> O position2 invalid.

Or ""FLOOD"" -> L and O position2? L forbidden and O position2 forbidden.

So I'll go with ""CHOKY"".

But another idea: perhaps ""COWAN"" -> O position2 forbidden.

Maybe ""BOWET"" -> not C.

Perhaps use N: ""CNIDA"" -> not common.

Okay, let's proceed with ""CHOKY"".

Therefore, my guess is ""CHOKY"".

In the feedback, we also know that O is present but not position2. In ""CHOKY"", we put O at position3. This will help confirm the position of O.

Other words: ""CHOUN"" -> archaic.

I think ""CHOKY"" is acceptable.

<guess>choky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Secret word starts with C** (since C was correct in position 1 in ""clomp"").
- **O is in the word but not in position 2**.
- **Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P** (all marked absent in previous feedback).
- The secret word must include **O** at one of the positions 3, 4, or 5, and use only untested or confirmed letters.

For this guess, I chose **""CHOKY""** because:
- It starts with **C** (required).
- It places **O** in position 3 (consistent with feedback that O is not in position 2).
- It tests new letters: **H, K, Y** (all not previously used and not forbidden).
- It adheres to the constraint of avoiding forbidden letters.
- ""Choky"" is a valid English word (e.g., meaning oppressive or jail-like).

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If O is correct in position 3, we confirm its placement.
- Feedback on H, K, and Y will reveal their presence/absence and positions.",Guess 3: choky -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(-) K(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,COUNT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any information about the word. I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. Words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants are often good starting points.

Common starting words in games like Wordle are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc. However, I note that the feedback uses a system of three symbols: 
  - ✓ (green) for correct letter and position
  - - (yellow) for correct letter but wrong position
  - x (black/gray) for absent letter.

I want a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a typical starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good.

But note: the example provided used words like ""ST"", ""BR"", etc., which might imply the solution has those letters? Actually, the example is just an example. We don't know the word.

After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels? Wait: C, R, A, N, E: that's two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. Actually, vowels are A, E, I, O, U so ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E).

Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" for many vowels, but note it has 4 vowels (A, D? D is consonant, so A, I, E, U - that's four vowels). However, it doesn't have common consonants.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" (a bird) is used, but might be less common.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels: A, I, E
- It has two common consonants: R, S

But let's check: R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E (three); consonants: R, S.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E (two); consonants: S, L, T.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good starting point.

So my first guess is: RAISE

I will output it as per the format.I am starting my first guess without any prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A strong starting word should:
- Include common letters (vowels and consonants) to test for their presence.
- Avoid repeating words that may appear in examples.
Ideally, the word should have multiple vowels and frequent consonants to reveal letter positions effectively. 

A popular choice in similar games is ""RAISE"" because:
- It uses three vowels (A, I, E), which are common in English words.
- It includes two common consonants (R, S).
- This combination gives high coverage of frequent letters, which may help identify matching or misplaced letters across various positions.

Other options like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also good, but ""RAISE"" offers a slightly better vowel-consonant balance for initial data gathering.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user just provided feedback on my first guess ""raise"", and all letters were marked incorrect: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x). This is quite surprising because ""raise"" contains common letters, but it tells me the secret word has none of these letters. 

I need to completely shift my strategy. The word likely uses less frequent consonants and perhaps uncommon vowels. Since A, E, I are excluded, the vowels must be O, U, or Y serving as a vowel. Consonants like R, S are out, so I should focus on others such as C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W.

For the next guess, I want to maximize information by testing five new letters. Choosing a word without any repeated letters and covering common untested consonants: ""CLOMP"" comes to mind—it uses C, L, O, M, P. ""C"" and ""M"" are moderately common, ""O"" is a vowel, ""L"" and ""P"" frequent consonants. 

Alternatively, ""NYMPH"" includes Y as a vowel and many consonants but ""Y"" is riskier. ""CLOMP"" seems better rounded. After eliminating R/A/I/S/E, ""CLOMP"" ensures no overlap with previous letters.

The goal is to uncover presence or absence of letters like O (possible vowel), C, L, M, P. This reshapes the possibilities significantly—secret word could be like ""THUMB"", ""PLUCK"", or ""DOWDY"". 

This guess might also pin down positions better. If it fails, the pool narrows further—words avoiding R/A/I/S/E and upcoming letters. But ""CLOMP"" feels optimal for this stage.Based on the previous feedback:  
All letters in ""raise"" (R, A, I, S, E) are **absent** from the secret word. This means:
- The secret word contains **no R, A, I, S, or E**.  
- All vowels are likely **O, U**, or **Y** (if used as a vowel).  
- Focus on **unused consonants** like C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.  

For my next guess, I need to prioritize:
1. Testing **new letters** excluded from the first guess.
2. Incorporating **remaining common vowels** (O, U).
3. Avoiding any letter from ""raise"" (R,A,I,S,E).

A strong candidate is **""CLOMP""**:
- **C, L, O, M, P**: All untested letters.
- **O** checks for a common vowel.
- **C, L, M, P** are high-frequency consonants.
- If we guess ""CLOMP"", the feedback will reveal if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>clomp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: clomp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) O(-) M(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""raise"": All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""clomp"": 
   - C is correct (✓), meaning C is in the word and in the first position. So the secret word starts with C.
   - L is absent (x), so no L in the word.
   - O is present but in the wrong position (-). So O is in the word, but not in the second position.
   - M and P are absent (x), so no M or P.

So from Guess 2:
- Position 1: C is correct → Secret word: C _ _ _ _
- O is in the word, but not in position 2 → so O must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters L, M, P are absent (in addition to R, A, I, S, E from before).

Now, we know the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains O, but not in position 2 → so O is in 3, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P.

Available letters: We need to avoid R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P. Also, from the alphabet, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is used and must appear. So the word must have C (position1), O (somewhere not pos2), and three other letters from the available set.

Common vowels: We don't have A, E, I, but O is present. The other possible vowels are U and sometimes Y. So we might need to include U or Y.

We also know that the word has no L, M, P.

Given that O is not in position 2, and position 2 is currently unknown (but not O), let's think of possibilities for position 2.

We can try to form a word with:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: ? (not O, and not any of the forbidden letters)
- Then O must be in 3,4, or 5.

Also, since we have few vowels left, U might be a good candidate to test.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Include O in a position that is not 2 (so positions 3,4,5).
- Use new letters to test more of the available consonants and vowels (like U, H, T, etc.)

Consideration: We have not tested U, T, N, D, etc. which are common.

Looking for words that start with C, have O in 3,4, or 5, and use other non-forbidden letters.

Some candidate words:
- If O is in position 3: C?O??
- If O is in position 4: C??O?
- If O is in position 5: C????O

But we need real words.

Possible words:
- ""CROWN"": But R is forbidden (from guess1) → no R.
- ""CLOWN"": L and W? W is allowed, but L is forbidden → no L.
- ""COUNT"": 
   - C O U N T → positions: C(1), O(2) but O is not allowed in position 2? Feedback said O is not in position 2. So ""COUNT"" has O in position 2 → invalid because we know O cannot be there.

We need O not in position 2.

So words where O is at position 3,4,5.

Examples:
- Position 3: ""CHOOF"", ""CHOOM"" → but M forbidden? and not standard words? 
   - Better: ""CHOMP"" but M forbidden → no M.
   - ""CHOCK"": H, O, C, K. But C is at start, O in third? But we have C already at position1, and O must be elsewhere. And ""CHOCK"": C H O C K → duplicates C? It's C at start, and C again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the rules don't say anything. So duplicates might be possible? Wait, in the feedback system, if a letter appears twice, we don't know how it's handled. But typically, in such games, duplicates are handled by position.

But in our case, the word may have duplicate letters? However, in the first guess ""raise"", all different, and ""clomp"" all different. So let's assume we avoid duplicates until we know more.

Forbidden letters: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

So ""CHOOK"" (variant spelling? but maybe not valid).

Common words: 
- How about ""COULD"" ? 
   - C O U L D → O is in position 2 → invalid (we know O cannot be in position 2).

Other words:
- Position 4: C _ _ O _
   - Examples: ""COUNT"" was invalid. 
   - ""DONUT"" but doesn't start with C.
   - Words starting with C? ""CACTI"" → but C duplicate? and A forbidden? A is forbidden.

Words without forbidden letters and O not at position 2.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,~~L~~,N,~~M~~,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, plus O is included.

O must be in the word. Since position1 is C, and O not at position2.

Try position3: C _ O _ _

Examples: 
- ""CHOIR"" → H,O,I,R → I and R forbidden.
- ""CHORD"" → O is position3? But R forbidden.
- ""CHOWK"" → not standard.
- ""BHOUT"" → not starting C.

Better: ""THICK"" but not starting with C.

Start with C: ""CHOKY"" → C H O K Y → H, O, K, Y. O at position3.
Check: H, K, Y not forbidden? Yes. So ""choky"" is a word (adjective, sticky? or variant of chocolate? Actually, choky: causing choking or choky as noun? Acceptable).

But ""choky"" has Y which can be a vowel. Still, we might not know if it's valid.

Another: ""CHOOF"" → obscure.

""CHOON"" → slang, not widely known.

Try O in position4: C _ _ O _

Examples:
- ""CUPRO"" → not a word? How about ""CUPSO"" no.
- ""JUMBO"" → doesn't start with C? 
- ""CURIO"" → C U R I O → R and I forbidden? R and A,I,S,E are forbidden → but R and I forbidden.

Forbidden: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

So ""CURIO"" has R and I → bad.

""DUTCH"" → not starting C.

Start with C: ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.

""CLOUD"" → L forbidden and O at position2? No, L forbidden and O should not be at position2.

O at position4: so something like C? ? O ?

Common words: 
- ""ABOUT"" → no, A forbidden.
- ""CANTON"" → too long? 5 letters: ""CANTON"" is 6? C-A-N-T-O-N? 6 letters.

5-letter: ""CINCH"" → I forbidden.

Hard. What about ""COHOE"" → obscure, and O at position1? Not starting C.

Positions: C at 1, then O at position4? So indices: 1:C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4:O, 5:?

Available: F,G,H,K,N,T,U,W,Y, etc.

Examples: ""CHINO"" → but H? and O in position5? ""CHINO"" is C H I N O → I forbidden.

""CONTO"" → O at position2? Invalid.

""CONKY"" → K and Y? C O N K Y → O at position2, invalid.

O at position5? Then C _ _ _ O

Examples: 
- ""BALCO"" not word.
- ""CASINO"" too long? 5-letter: ""CAMEo"" → not.
- ""CALICO"" too long.

Common: ""HELLO"" → doesn't start with C.

With C: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""TYPIC"" → not starting with C? Doesn't.

We need to include U or Y as vowel.

Let me try ""COUTH"" → O at position2? Invalid.

Another idea: ""COUGH"" → O at position2 → invalid.

How about ""DUCHY"" → not C starter.

Start with C and O at end: ""CARRYO"" → no.

""CANTO"" → A forbidden? A in position2? And A forbidden → no.

Recall: We have U available.

List words: C? ? O? ? but O not at position2.

I think I missed some words. 
- ""CHOCK"": Earlier, C-H-O-C-K? But duplicate C? We don't know if secret allows duplicate letters. Moreover, H, O, C, K: C at start, O at position3? Then another C? But we need to check.

If the secret word has duplicate C, then in feedback for ""clomp"": We had C(✓) meaning position1 is correct C. Then if we have another C in position4, say, but in ""clomp"" we don't have another C, so that wouldn't give information about duplicate.

For safety, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Alternative: Perhaps ""THING"" → not C.

Back to O in position3: C _ O _ _

Available vowels: O and U/Y? But O is already used in another position.

Letters: Pos1: C; Position2: must be not O, and not forbidden → must be a consonant? Not always, but vowels A,E,I forbidden ⇒ so position2 is consonant? Or U/Y.

U is a vowel. So position2 can be U? or Y? or consonant.

Words: 
- ""CUBIT"" → U, B, I, T → I forbidden.
- ""CUTIN"" → I.
- ""CUVET"" → obscure.
- ""CUTUP"" → P forbidden? P is forbidden → P(x) in guess2.

Another word: ""CHOUT"" → not common.

Perhaps ""COWER"" → R forbidden and O at position2? No.

Try O in position4: So pattern C??O?

Examples: 
- ""CANON"" → A forbidden? And O in position2? No.
- ""CROON"" → R forbidden.
- ""CROUP"" → R and P forbidden.
- ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.

With U: ""CURIO"" → forbidden.
""GROUP"" → doesn't start with C.

Start with C: ""CURGY"" → not word.

How about ""CONUS"" → O at position2? Invalid.

Perhaps we use Y: ""CYTON"" (biology term) → C Y T O N → O at position4? That works. Pattern: C Y T O N → positions: 1:C, 2:Y, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N? 
Letters: Y,T,O,N → all not forbidden? Y, T, O, N: O we know is present, Y is new, T new, N new. And no R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.

""cyton"" is a valid word? Neuron part? Might be acceptable.

But let's see common words: ""PITHY"" → doesn't start with C.

Another: ""CYNIC"" → I forbidden? I in position4? C Y N I C → I is forbidden.

Back to O in position5: C???O

Words: 
- ""CASKO"" → A forbidden.
- ""DECKO"" → not C starter? Starting is D.
- With C: ""CAGOT"" → A forbidden.
- ""CAVEO"" → A.
- ""COMET"" → O in position3? M forbidden.

Perhaps ""TUMOR"" → doesn't start with C.

A common word: ""BROAD"" → not.

Wait, think: ""COUNT"" is common but O in position2 which is disallowed.

What about ""COUGH"" → O in position2 → disallowed.

Another idea: The word might have O and U. But U not tested.

For example: ""CUMUL"" → obscure.

""COULD"" → O in position2 → not.

Perhaps ""DONUT"" → not starting C.

I think we need to list the constraints:
- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P
- Required: C (position1), O (not position2)
- Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Try O in position3: pattern C _ O _ _

Possible words:
- ""CHOUB"" → not standard.
- ""CHOOF"" → not common.
- ""CHOOM"" → M forbidden? M is forbidden → no.
- ""CHOOK"" → K? Might be slang.
- ""CHOTA"" → A forbidden.
- ""CHOTT"" → duplicate T? And O at position3? Chott: dry lake? Not common.

But ""CHOOK"" might be acceptable? But let's avoid.

Use H? ""CHUTA"" → U? C H U T A → A forbidden? ""CHUTE"" → E forbidden? E forbidden.

""CHUTE"": letters C,H,U,T,E → E forbidden → no.

Another: With U: ""CUBEB"" → has E? C U B E B → E forbidden → no.

Perhaps ""CONK"" → too short? 4 letters? ""CONKY"" has O at position2 → no. ""CONKY"" is C O N K Y → O position2, disallowed.

Consider O in position4: C??O ?

- ""CANTO"" → A forbidden.
- ""CAPOT"" → A and P forbidden.
- ""CAROB"" → A and R forbidden.
- ""CATHO"" → not word.

But ""CELLO"" → E and L forbidden? E and L both forbidden → no.

""CONVO"" → O in position2? C O N V O → O at position2 and end? Position2 O is disallowed per feedback, so invalid.

But if O is at position4, it's okay? ""CONVO"": positions: 1:C, 2:O (O is in position2, which we know is bad → so cannot).

""CONVO"" has O at position2, so invalid.

Another: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.

""BENCH"" → not C starter.

I think I need to try U and Y.

Perhaps ""CUTTY"" → U, T, T, Y → duplicate T? Allowed? But pattern: C U T T Y → O missing? We must include O? No, we know O is in the word? From guess2, O is present.

But in this word ""CUTTY"", no O → does not have O → so invalid candidate.

We know O must be in positions 3,4,5.

So we need a word with O.

Let's search for words matching C, O in 3/4/5, no forbidden letters.

Candidates:
- O in position3: ""CHOKY"" -> C H O K Y → O at position3. H, K, Y allowed? We haven't seen H or K, so yes. Word is choky (chok·y, adj. variant of chokey, meaning tight or suffocating? Or related to chowky? But it's an English word).
- O in position4: ""CYCLO"" → has L? No, C Y C L O → L forbidden? L is forbidden → no L.
  But ""Cyclone"" is 7 letters. 5-letter: ""CYCLO"" is prefix? Not common.

  ""TYCHO"" → not starting C.
- ""HUTCH"" → not starting C.
- ""CROWD"" forbidden R.

Another with O in position4: ""BAYOU"" → not C? ""CANYO"" -> A forbidden.

""COYPU"" → O at position2, forbidden.

O in position5: ""??C? O"" wait no, O at end: pattern ????O, but we have C at start: so C???O

Words:
- ""CAMPO"" → A and M and P? M,P forbidden and A forbidden.
- ""CARBO"" → A,R forbidden.
- ""CONDO"" → O at position5? C O N D O → O at position2? Yes, so position2 O, which is disallowed.

What about ""CUE""? Too short.

Perhaps ""NACHO"" → not C starter.

Wait, ""BUTEO"" -> not C.

With C: ""CHEVY"" -> E forbidden.

I think ""CHOKY"" is a reasonable guess. It follows:
- Starts with C (position1: C)
- Position3: O (which is allowed since O not at position2)
- Has H, K, Y: all new letters.
- No forbidden letters: H, K, Y not in forbidden list.
- Word: choky (accepted in some dictionaries).

Alternatively, ""COHOG"" -> H, O in position3? C O H O G -> O at position2 forbidden.

If no ""CHOKY"", an alternative with U: ""CUCKOO"" too long? 6 letters.

5-letter: ""COUTH"" invalid position for O.

Or ""CUCHO"" -> U,C,H,O? Duplicate C? Not, but C at start and another at position4? But also O at position4? Pattern: C U C H O → O at position5? So O in position5: yes. But duplicate C? Maybe.

But feedback: if secret is ""cucuy"" or something, we don't know.

Another word: ""CUSHY"" -> U, S, H, Y -> S forbidden? S(x) from guess1, so S is forbidden -> ""cushy"" contains S -> forbidden.

""COVIN"" -> O position2? Invalid.

So I think ""CHOKY"" is a decent choice for a guess.

But let's confirm: In ""CHOKY"", positions: 
- Position1: C (matched)
- Position3: O → from feedback of guess2, O is misplaced (so not position2), but here it's position3 → which is possible.

And we test new letters: H, K, Y.

If the word is ""choky"", it might be niche, but it's valid.

Alternatively, ""THUNK"" -> not C.

Another possibility: ""COVET"" -> O position2 invalid.

Or ""FLOOD"" -> L and O position2? L forbidden and O position2 forbidden.

So I'll go with ""CHOKY"".

But another idea: perhaps ""COWAN"" -> O position2 forbidden.

Maybe ""BOWET"" -> not C.

Perhaps use N: ""CNIDA"" -> not common.

Okay, let's proceed with ""CHOKY"".

Therefore, my guess is ""CHOKY"".

In the feedback, we also know that O is present but not position2. In ""CHOKY"", we put O at position3. This will help confirm the position of O.

Other words: ""CHOUN"" -> archaic.

I think ""CHOKY"" is acceptable.

<guess>choky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Secret word starts with C** (since C was correct in position 1 in ""clomp"").
- **O is in the word but not in position 2**.
- **Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P** (all marked absent in previous feedback).
- The secret word must include **O** at one of the positions 3, 4, or 5, and use only untested or confirmed letters.

For this guess, I chose **""CHOKY""** because:
- It starts with **C** (required).
- It places **O** in position 3 (consistent with feedback that O is not in position 2).
- It tests new letters: **H, K, Y** (all not previously used and not forbidden).
- It adheres to the constraint of avoiding forbidden letters.
- ""Choky"" is a valid English word (e.g., meaning oppressive or jail-like).

This guess will help narrow down possibilities:
- If O is correct in position 3, we confirm its placement.
- Feedback on H, K, and Y will reveal their presence/absence and positions.

Since it\'s the first guess, I don\'t have any information about the word. I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. Words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants are often good starting points.\n\nCommon starting words in games like Wordle are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc. However, I note that the feedback uses a system of three symbols: \n  - ✓ (green) for correct letter and position\n  - - (yellow) for correct letter but wrong position\n  - x (black/gray) for absent letter.\n\nI want a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a typical starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good.\n\nBut note: the example provided used words like ""ST"", ""BR"", etc., which might imply the solution has those letters? Actually, the example is just an example. We don\'t know the word.\n\nAfter considering, I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three vowels? Wait: C, R, A, N, E: that\'s two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. Actually, vowels are A, E, I, O, U so ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E).\n\nAnother popular choice is ""ADIEU"" for many vowels, but note it has 4 vowels (A, D? D is consonant, so A, I, E, U - that\'s four vowels). However, it doesn\'t have common consonants.\n\nAlternatively, ""SOARE"" (a bird) is used, but might be less common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because:\n- It has three vowels: A, I, E\n- It has two common consonants: R, S\n\nBut let\'s check: R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E (three); consonants: R, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E (two); consonants: S, L, T.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" is a good starting point.\n\nSo my first guess is: RAISE\n\nI will output it as per the format.I am starting my first guess without any prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A strong starting word should:\n- Include common letters (vowels and consonants) to test for their presence.\n- Avoid repeating words that may appear in examples.\nIdeally, the word should have multiple vowels and frequent consonants to reveal letter positions effectively. \n\nA popular choice in similar games is ""RAISE"" because:\n- It uses three vowels (A, I, E), which are common in English words.\n- It includes two common consonants (R, S).\n- This combination gives high coverage of frequent letters, which may help identify matching or misplaced letters across various positions.\n\nOther options like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also good, but ""RAISE"" offers a slightly better vowel-consonant balance for initial data gathering.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, the user just provided feedback on my first guess ""raise"", and all letters were marked incorrect: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x). This is quite surprising because ""raise"" contains common letters, but it tells me the secret word has none of these letters. \n\nI need to completely shift my strategy. The word likely uses less frequent consonants and perhaps uncommon vowels. Since A, E, I are excluded, the vowels must be O, U, or Y serving as a vowel. Consonants like R, S are out, so I should focus on others such as C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W.\n\nFor the next guess, I want to maximize information by testing five new letters. Choosing a word without any repeated letters and covering common untested consonants: ""CLOMP"" comes to mind—it uses C, L, O, M, P. ""C"" and ""M"" are moderately common, ""O"" is a vowel, ""L"" and ""P"" frequent consonants. \n\nAlternatively, ""NYMPH"" includes Y as a vowel and many consonants but ""Y"" is riskier. ""CLOMP"" seems better rounded. After eliminating R/A/I/S/E, ""CLOMP"" ensures no overlap with previous letters.\n\nThe goal is to uncover presence or absence of letters like O (possible vowel), C, L, M, P. This reshapes the possibilities significantly—secret word could be like ""THUMB"", ""PLUCK"", or ""DOWDY"". \n\nThis guess might also pin down positions better. If it fails, the pool narrows further—words avoiding R/A/I/S/E and upcoming letters. But ""CLOMP"" feels optimal for this stage.Based on the previous feedback:  \nAll letters in ""raise"" (R, A, I, S, E) are **absent** from the secret word. This means:\n- The secret word contains **no R, A, I, S, or E**.  \n- All vowels are likely **O, U**, or **Y** (if used as a vowel).  \n- Focus on **unused consonants** like C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.  \n\nFor my next guess, I need to prioritize:\n1. Testing **new letters** excluded from the first guess.\n2. Incorporating **remaining common vowels** (O, U).\n3. Avoiding any letter from ""raise"" (R,A,I,S,E).\n\nA strong candidate is **""CLOMP""**:\n- **C, L, O, M, P**: All untested letters.\n- **O** checks for a common vowel.\n- **C, L, M, P** are high-frequency consonants.\n- If we guess ""CLOMP"", the feedback will reveal if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>clomp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: clomp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) O(-) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""raise"": All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.\n2. ""clomp"": \n   - C is correct (✓), meaning C is in the word and in the first position. So the secret word starts with C.\n   - L is absent (x), so no L in the word.\n   - O is present but in the wrong position (-). So O is in the word, but not in the second position.\n   - M and P are absent (x), so no M or P.\n\nSo from Guess 2:\n- Position 1: C is correct → Secret word: C _ _ _ _\n- O is in the word, but not in position 2 → so O must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n- Letters L, M, P are absent (in addition to R, A, I, S, E from before).\n\nNow, we know the secret word:\n- Starts with C.\n- Contains O, but not in position 2 → so O is in 3, 4, or 5.\n- Does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P.\n\nAvailable letters: We need to avoid R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P. Also, from the alphabet, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: O is used and must appear. So the word must have C (position1), O (somewhere not pos2), and three other letters from the available set.\n\nCommon vowels: We don\'t have A, E, I, but O is present. The other possible vowels are U and sometimes Y. So we might need to include U or Y.\n\nWe also know that the word has no L, M, P.\n\nGiven that O is not in position 2, and position 2 is currently unknown (but not O), let\'s think of possibilities for position 2.\n\nWe can try to form a word with:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: ? (not O, and not any of the forbidden letters)\n- Then O must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, since we have few vowels left, U might be a good candidate to test.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to:\n- Include O in a position that is not 2 (so positions 3,4,5).\n- Use new letters to test more of the available consonants and vowels (like U, H, T, etc.)\n\nConsideration: We have not tested U, T, N, D, etc. which are common.\n\nLooking for words that start with C, have O in 3,4, or 5, and use other non-forbidden letters.\n\nSome candidate words:\n- If O is in position 3: C?O??\n- If O is in position 4: C??O?\n- If O is in position 5: C????O\n\nBut we need real words.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""CROWN"": But R is forbidden (from guess1) → no R.\n- ""CLOWN"": L and W? W is allowed, but L is forbidden → no L.\n- ""COUNT"": \n   - C O U N T → positions: C(1), O(2) but O is not allowed in position 2? Feedback said O is not in position 2. So ""COUNT"" has O in position 2 → invalid because we know O cannot be there.\n\nWe need O not in position 2.\n\nSo words where O is at position 3,4,5.\n\nExamples:\n- Position 3: ""CHOOF"", ""CHOOM"" → but M forbidden? and not standard words? \n   - Better: ""CHOMP"" but M forbidden → no M.\n   - ""CHOCK"": H, O, C, K. But C is at start, O in third? But we have C already at position1, and O must be elsewhere. And ""CHOCK"": C H O C K → duplicates C? It\'s C at start, and C again? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the rules don\'t say anything. So duplicates might be possible? Wait, in the feedback system, if a letter appears twice, we don\'t know how it\'s handled. But typically, in such games, duplicates are handled by position.\n\nBut in our case, the word may have duplicate letters? However, in the first guess ""raise"", all different, and ""clomp"" all different. So let\'s assume we avoid duplicates until we know more.\n\nForbidden letters: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.\n\nSo ""CHOOK"" (variant spelling? but maybe not valid).\n\nCommon words: \n- How about ""COULD"" ? \n   - C O U L D → O is in position 2 → invalid (we know O cannot be in position 2).\n\nOther words:\n- Position 4: C _ _ O _\n   - Examples: ""COUNT"" was invalid. \n   - ""DONUT"" but doesn\'t start with C.\n   - Words starting with C? ""CACTI"" → but C duplicate? and A forbidden? A is forbidden.\n\nWords without forbidden letters and O not at position 2.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,~~L~~,N,~~M~~,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, plus O is included.\n\nO must be in the word. Since position1 is C, and O not at position2.\n\nTry position3: C _ O _ _\n\nExamples: \n- ""CHOIR"" → H,O,I,R → I and R forbidden.\n- ""CHORD"" → O is position3? But R forbidden.\n- ""CHOWK"" → not standard.\n- ""BHOUT"" → not starting C.\n\nBetter: ""THICK"" but not starting with C.\n\nStart with C: ""CHOKY"" → C H O K Y → H, O, K, Y. O at position3.\nCheck: H, K, Y not forbidden? Yes. So ""choky"" is a word (adjective, sticky? or variant of chocolate? Actually, choky: causing choking or choky as noun? Acceptable).\n\nBut ""choky"" has Y which can be a vowel. Still, we might not know if it\'s valid.\n\nAnother: ""CHOOF"" → obscure.\n\n""CHOON"" → slang, not widely known.\n\nTry O in position4: C _ _ O _\n\nExamples:\n- ""CUPRO"" → not a word? How about ""CUPSO"" no.\n- ""JUMBO"" → doesn\'t start with C? \n- ""CURIO"" → C U R I O → R and I forbidden? R and A,I,S,E are forbidden → but R and I forbidden.\n\nForbidden: R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.\n\nSo ""CURIO"" has R and I → bad.\n\n""DUTCH"" → not starting C.\n\nStart with C: ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.\n\n""CLOUD"" → L forbidden and O at position2? No, L forbidden and O should not be at position2.\n\nO at position4: so something like C? ? O ?\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ABOUT"" → no, A forbidden.\n- ""CANTON"" → too long? 5 letters: ""CANTON"" is 6? C-A-N-T-O-N? 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""CINCH"" → I forbidden.\n\nHard. What about ""COHOE"" → obscure, and O at position1? Not starting C.\n\nPositions: C at 1, then O at position4? So indices: 1:C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4:O, 5:?\n\nAvailable: F,G,H,K,N,T,U,W,Y, etc.\n\nExamples: ""CHINO"" → but H? and O in position5? ""CHINO"" is C H I N O → I forbidden.\n\n""CONTO"" → O at position2? Invalid.\n\n""CONKY"" → K and Y? C O N K Y → O at position2, invalid.\n\nO at position5? Then C _ _ _ O\n\nExamples: \n- ""BALCO"" not word.\n- ""CASINO"" too long? 5-letter: ""CAMEo"" → not.\n- ""CALICO"" too long.\n\nCommon: ""HELLO"" → doesn\'t start with C.\n\nWith C: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.\n\nPerhaps ""TYPIC"" → not starting with C? Doesn\'t.\n\nWe need to include U or Y as vowel.\n\nLet me try ""COUTH"" → O at position2? Invalid.\n\nAnother idea: ""COUGH"" → O at position2 → invalid.\n\nHow about ""DUCHY"" → not C starter.\n\nStart with C and O at end: ""CARRYO"" → no.\n\n""CANTO"" → A forbidden? A in position2? And A forbidden → no.\n\nRecall: We have U available.\n\nList words: C? ? O? ? but O not at position2.\n\nI think I missed some words. \n- ""CHOCK"": Earlier, C-H-O-C-K? But duplicate C? We don\'t know if secret allows duplicate letters. Moreover, H, O, C, K: C at start, O at position3? Then another C? But we need to check.\n\nIf the secret word has duplicate C, then in feedback for ""clomp"": We had C(✓) meaning position1 is correct C. Then if we have another C in position4, say, but in ""clomp"" we don\'t have another C, so that wouldn\'t give information about duplicate.\n\nFor safety, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAlternative: Perhaps ""THING"" → not C.\n\nBack to O in position3: C _ O _ _\n\nAvailable vowels: O and U/Y? But O is already used in another position.\n\nLetters: Pos1: C; Position2: must be not O, and not forbidden → must be a consonant? Not always, but vowels A,E,I forbidden ⇒ so position2 is consonant? Or U/Y.\n\nU is a vowel. So position2 can be U? or Y? or consonant.\n\nWords: \n- ""CUBIT"" → U, B, I, T → I forbidden.\n- ""CUTIN"" → I.\n- ""CUVET"" → obscure.\n- ""CUTUP"" → P forbidden? P is forbidden → P(x) in guess2.\n\nAnother word: ""CHOUT"" → not common.\n\nPerhaps ""COWER"" → R forbidden and O at position2? No.\n\nTry O in position4: So pattern C??O?\n\nExamples: \n- ""CANON"" → A forbidden? And O in position2? No.\n- ""CROON"" → R forbidden.\n- ""CROUP"" → R and P forbidden.\n- ""CROWD"" → R forbidden.\n\nWith U: ""CURIO"" → forbidden.\n""GROUP"" → doesn\'t start with C.\n\nStart with C: ""CURGY"" → not word.\n\nHow about ""CONUS"" → O at position2? Invalid.\n\nPerhaps we use Y: ""CYTON"" (biology term) → C Y T O N → O at position4? That works. Pattern: C Y T O N → positions: 1:C, 2:Y, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N? \nLetters: Y,T,O,N → all not forbidden? Y, T, O, N: O we know is present, Y is new, T new, N new. And no R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P.\n\n""cyton"" is a valid word? Neuron part? Might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see common words: ""PITHY"" → doesn\'t start with C.\n\nAnother: ""CYNIC"" → I forbidden? I in position4? C Y N I C → I is forbidden.\n\nBack to O in position5: C???O\n\nWords: \n- ""CASKO"" → A forbidden.\n- ""DECKO"" → not C starter? Starting is D.\n- With C: ""CAGOT"" → A forbidden.\n- ""CAVEO"" → A.\n- ""COMET"" → O in position3? M forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""TUMOR"" → doesn\'t start with C.\n\nA common word: ""BROAD"" → not.\n\nWait, think: ""COUNT"" is common but O in position2 which is disallowed.\n\nWhat about ""COUGH"" → O in position2 → disallowed.\n\nAnother idea: The word might have O and U. But U not tested.\n\nFor example: ""CUMUL"" → obscure.\n\n""COULD"" → O in position2 → not.\n\nPerhaps ""DONUT"" → not starting C.\n\nI think we need to list the constraints:\n- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P\n- Required: C (position1), O (not position2)\n- Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nTry O in position3: pattern C _ O _ _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""CHOUB"" → not standard.\n- ""CHOOF"" → not common.\n- ""CHOOM"" → M forbidden? M is forbidden → no.\n- ""CHOOK"" → K? Might be slang.\n- ""CHOTA"" → A forbidden.\n- ""CHOTT"" → duplicate T? And O at position3? Chott: dry lake? Not common.\n\nBut ""CHOOK"" might be acceptable? But let\'s avoid.\n\nUse H? ""CHUTA"" → U? C H U T A → A forbidden? ""CHUTE"" → E forbidden? E forbidden.\n\n""CHUTE"": letters C,H,U,T,E → E forbidden → no.\n\nAnother: With U: ""CUBEB"" → has E? C U B E B → E forbidden → no.\n\nPerhaps ""CONK"" → too short? 4 letters? ""CONKY"" has O at position2 → no. ""CONKY"" is C O N K Y → O position2, disallowed.\n\nConsider O in position4: C??O ?\n\n- ""CANTO"" → A forbidden.\n- ""CAPOT"" → A and P forbidden.\n- ""CAROB"" → A and R forbidden.\n- ""CATHO"" → not word.\n\nBut ""CELLO"" → E and L forbidden? E and L both forbidden → no.\n\n""CONVO"" → O in position2? C O N V O → O at position2 and end? Position2 O is disallowed per feedback, so invalid.\n\nBut if O is at position4, it\'s okay? ""CONVO"": positions: 1:C, 2:O (O is in position2, which we know is bad → so cannot).\n\n""CONVO"" has O at position2, so invalid.\n\nAnother: ""CURIO"" forbidden letters.\n\n""BENCH"" → not C starter.\n\nI think I need to try U and Y.\n\nPerhaps ""CUTTY"" → U, T, T, Y → duplicate T? Allowed? But pattern: C U T T Y → O missing? We must include O? No, we know O is in the word? From guess2, O is present.\n\nBut in this word ""CUTTY"", no O → does not have O → so invalid candidate.\n\nWe know O must be in positions 3,4,5.\n\nSo we need a word with O.\n\nLet\'s search for words matching C, O in 3/4/5, no forbidden letters.\n\nCandidates:\n- O in position3: ""CHOKY"" -> C H O K Y → O at position3. H, K, Y allowed? We haven\'t seen H or K, so yes. Word is choky (chok·y, adj. variant of chokey, meaning tight or suffocating? Or related to chowky? But it\'s an English word).\n- O in position4: ""CYCLO"" → has L? No, C Y C L O → L forbidden? L is forbidden → no L.\n  But ""Cyclone"" is 7 letters. 5-letter: ""CYCLO"" is prefix? Not common.\n\n  ""TYCHO"" → not starting C.\n- ""HUTCH"" → not starting C.\n- ""CROWD"" forbidden R.\n\nAnother with O in position4: ""BAYOU"" → not C? ""CANYO"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""COYPU"" → O at position2, forbidden.\n\nO in position5: ""??C? O"" wait no, O at end: pattern ????O, but we have C at start: so C???O\n\nWords:\n- ""CAMPO"" → A and M and P? M,P forbidden and A forbidden.\n- ""CARBO"" → A,R forbidden.\n- ""CONDO"" → O at position5? C O N D O → O at position2? Yes, so position2 O, which is disallowed.\n\nWhat about ""CUE""? Too short.\n\nPerhaps ""NACHO"" → not C starter.\n\nWait, ""BUTEO"" -> not C.\n\nWith C: ""CHEVY"" -> E forbidden.\n\nI think ""CHOKY"" is a reasonable guess. It follows:\n- Starts with C (position1: C)\n- Position3: O (which is allowed since O not at position2)\n- Has H, K, Y: all new letters.\n- No forbidden letters: H, K, Y not in forbidden list.\n- Word: choky (accepted in some dictionaries).\n\nAlternatively, ""COHOG"" -> H, O in position3? C O H O G -> O at position2 forbidden.\n\nIf no ""CHOKY"", an alternative with U: ""CUCKOO"" too long? 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""COUTH"" invalid position for O.\n\nOr ""CUCHO"" -> U,C,H,O? Duplicate C? Not, but C at start and another at position4? But also O at position4? Pattern: C U C H O → O at position5? So O in position5: yes. But duplicate C? Maybe.\n\nBut feedback: if secret is ""cucuy"" or something, we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""CUSHY"" -> U, S, H, Y -> S forbidden? S(x) from guess1, so S is forbidden -> ""cushy"" contains S -> forbidden.\n\n""COVIN"" -> O position2? Invalid.\n\nSo I think ""CHOKY"" is a decent choice for a guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: In ""CHOKY"", positions: \n- Position1: C (matched)\n- Position3: O → from feedback of guess2, O is misplaced (so not position2), but here it\'s position3 → which is possible.\n\nAnd we test new letters: H, K, Y.\n\nIf the word is ""choky"", it might be niche, but it\'s valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""THUNK"" -> not C.\n\nAnother possibility: ""COVET"" -> O position2 invalid.\n\nOr ""FLOOD"" -> L and O position2? L forbidden and O position2 forbidden.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHOKY"".\n\nBut another idea: perhaps ""COWAN"" -> O position2 forbidden.\n\nMaybe ""BOWET"" -> not C.\n\nPerhaps use N: ""CNIDA"" -> not common.\n\nOkay, let\'s proceed with ""CHOKY"".\n\nTherefore, my guess is ""CHOKY"".\n\nIn the feedback, we also know that O is present but not position2. In ""CHOKY"", we put O at position3. This will help confirm the position of O.\n\nOther words: ""CHOUN"" -> archaic.\n\nI think ""CHOKY"" is acceptable.\n\n<guess>choky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Secret word starts with C** (since C was correct in position 1 in ""clomp"").\n- **O is in the word but not in position 2**.\n- **Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P** (all marked absent in previous feedback).\n- The secret word must include **O** at one of the positions 3, 4, or 5, and use only untested or confirmed letters.\n\nFor this guess, I chose **""CHOKY""** because:\n- It starts with **C** (required).\n- It places **O** in position 3 (consistent with feedback that O is not in position 2).\n- It tests new letters: **H, K, Y** (all not previously used and not forbidden).\n- It adheres to the constraint of avoiding forbidden letters.\n- ""Choky"" is a valid English word (e.g., meaning oppressive or jail-like).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down possibilities:\n- If O is correct in position 3, we confirm its placement.\n- Feedback on H, K, and Y will reveal their presence/absence and positions.\n\n<guess>choky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: clomp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) O(-) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: choky -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(-) K(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback:
- Guess 3: ""choky"" → C(✓) H(x) O(-) K(x) Y(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1, which we already knew.
  - H is absent → so H is not in the word.
  - O is present but in the wrong position (since - ). Previously, we knew O was not in position 2; now it's also not in position 3 because in ""choky"" O is at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position. So O cannot be in position 3 either? 
    - Correction: The symbol ""-"" means it's present but wrong position. So in ""choky"", position 3 is O, and it's marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. Since we already knew from Guess 2 (""clomp"") that O is not in position 2, now we know it's also not in position 3. Therefore, O must be in position 4 or 5.
  - K and Y are absent → K and Y are not in the word.

So far, we know:
- Position 1: C
- O is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 4 or 5.
- Forbidden letters (absent): R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P, H, K, Y (from Guess 1, 2, 3).
- Present letters: C (position 1), O (somewhere, not pos 2 or 3 → so pos 4 or 5).

The secret word has only two known letters: C at start and O somewhere in 4 or 5. The remaining letters must be from the unused set.

Unused letters (consonants and vowels available): B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. Also, O is present, so we have O.

Vowels available: U (since A,E,I are forbidden, and Y is absent). We also have consonants.

We have not tested U, T, N, D, etc.

The word structure: C _ _ _ _
- Position 4 or 5 must be O? Actually, O could be in position 4 OR 5? But positions 2 and 3 are still unknown.

So blanks: position 2, 3, 4, 5 → but O will occupy one of positions 4 or 5? Actually, positions 4 and 5 are the last two, but O could be in either, not both? Unless duplicate? But let's assume no duplicates for now.

Pattern: 
- If O in position 4: C _ _ O _
- If O in position 5: C _ _ _ O

Now, for position 2 and 3, we need two letters, and positions 4 or 5 whatever is not O also needs a letter? Actually:
- If O is in position 4: Then positions: 2,3,5 need letters.
- If O is in position 5: Then positions: 2,3,4 need letters.

Both cases require positions 2 and 3 to be filled. Also, position 5 (if O not there) or position 4 (if O not there) must be another letter.

Since O is present only once. We need letters chosen from the available set.

We must ensure we don't use forbidden letters.

For the guess, I want to test:
- Position of O: whether it's in 4 or 5.
- Also test common letters like U, T, N.

But we also need to consider valid words.

Let's form possible words.

First, if O in position 4: C? ? O ?

Possible words (from allowed letters):
- Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z (and O is in one spot).

Examples:
- ""CUTOU"" → not valid? Duplicate? ""CUTOU"" has U twice? Needs different.
- ""CONTU"" → O at position2? No, here position4: C? ? O ? So pos4 O.

Words:
- C with O at position4: ""COWTO"" → but O at position2? C O W T O → O at position2 → disallowed.
- Need no letter at position2 or 3 that causes issue? Positions 2 and 3 are not O per feedback.

For example: ""CUP O"" → but O not separate.

Think 5-letter: ""CUBO "" → U,B? ""cubon"" not word? 

Better words: 
- ""COUNT"" → O at position2 → disallowed → no.
- ""COUNT"" is bad.

Other? ""CONDU"" → not? ""CONDU"" not a word.

""CONTO"" → O at position position2 and position5 → O at position2 forbidden → invalid.

Perhaps ""CENTO"" → E at position2? E forbidden.

""CANTO"" → A forbidden.

With U: ""CURBO"" → R forbidden? R is forbidden → no.

Since R, A, I, S, E forbidden → we avoid them.

Another: ""JUNCO"" → J,U,N,C,O? But we have C at start? ""JUNCO"" starts with J → no.

Start with C: ""CUVEO"" → U,V,E,O → E forbidden → no.

Available: D, F, G, N, T, U, V, W, etc.

""COMBO"" → M forbidden and O position2? C O M B O → O2 → invalid.

How about ""CUNGO"" → U,N,G,O? But O in position4: C U N G O → so positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G? But we need O at position4 → but here position4 is G? Not O.

If O at position4: we need C _ _ O _

For example, ""CUZ O"" → ""cuz"" short? Words: ""CUNIT"" → not standard? ""cunit""? Unlikely.

""BOWED"" → doesn't start C.

Perhaps ""CHUTE"" → forbidden letters.

Another possibility: O at position5: C_ _ _ O

Words:
- ""CANTO"" → A forbidden.
- ""CARGO"" → R forbidden.
- ""CAMEO"" → A and E forbidden.
- ""DADOS"" → not C.

With C: ""CONVO"" → O at position2 → invalid.

""CRAMO"" → R,A forbidden.

How about ""DITTO"" → not C.

Start with C: ""CUZZO"" → zz? Not common.

But we have U available? So ""CUTTY"" → U,T,T,Y → Y absent? But we might use it to test? But Y is already known absent, no need to test? But words must be valid.

Since Y is absent, we avoid Y.

Possible word with O at position5: ""COUNT"" → O2 disallowed? For ""COUNT"" O is at position2 → so invalid.

What about ""COURT"" → O2 and R → forbidden.

Alternatively: ""BONGO"" → not C.

List: C _ _ _ O

Letters for positions 2,3,4: no R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P,H,K,Y.

From available: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z.

Examples:
- ""CUBEO"" → U,B,E? E forbidden? E in position4? But we don't know → forbidden letter E? But E forbidden → cannot use E.

E is forbidden from guess1.

So avoid.

""CUMBO"" → M forbidden.

""JUMBO"" → not C.

Try: ""CUBAN"" → A forbidden? A at position5? ""CUBAN"" is C U B A N → A forbidden → invalid.

But if O at position5? Then we need words like ""CUB N O"" no → positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:O

So ""C ? ? ? O""

Words: 
- ""CUVEE"" → E forbidden.
- ""CUSEC"" → S forbidden? S is forbidden from guess1 → no.
- ""CUTTO"" → T,T → duplicate? Allowed?
- ""CUTTO"" might not be word.

Common words: ""ADOBE"" → no C starth.

With U: ""CURVY"" → R forbidden? R forbidden and Y absent? However, R forbidden, and Y forbidden? From feedback, Y absent → forbidden? So cannot use R or Y.

""curvy"" has R and Y → both forbidden.

But O missing? We need O at position5 → must have O.

All words must include O at position4 or 5? Yes, because O is in the word and can't be in positions 2 or 3.

Is there a word like ""CUTTO""? Unlikely.

Perhaps ""WACKO"" → not C starter.

Another: ""FUTON"" → no C.

Start with C: ""CONTU"" → O at position2 → invalid.

""CONGE"" → O position2? C O N G E → O2 → forbidden.

O at position5: pattern C _ _ _ O

I am considering ""CUCKOO"" but too long.

5-letter: ""BUXOM"" → not C.

Perhaps ""COCOA"" → O at position2 → disallowed.

Hard to find common words with C at start and O at end, without using forbidden letters.

What about O at position4? Pattern C _ _ O _

Examples:
- ""CROUP"" → R and P forbidden.
- ""GROUP"" → no C.
- ""CAMPY"" → M,P forbidden and A? ""campy"" C A M P Y → A,M,P,Y all issues → invalid.

""CUBES"" → S forbidden.

""CUFFO"" → F,F → C U F F O → O at position5? Not position4? We need pattern C _ _ O _ so position4 is O → in this, position4 is F? Not O.

If O at position4, then positions: 1:C, 2:X, 3:Y, 4:O, 5:Z

XY from allowed.

Possible: ""CUNIT"" → U,N? But ""cunit"" not standard.

""CYTON"" → Y forbidden? Y is absent → no.

""BOUTS"" → not C.

Perhaps ""COWED"" → O position2 invalid.

Wait, maybe ""GOUDi"" not English.

Another word: ""COUTH"" -> O position2 -> invalid.

But ""CUNO"" -> too short.

Perhaps I should consider duplicharacters? But let's try to use U and T.

For example: ""CUTTO"" -> not valid.

""TUTTI"" -> no C.

Valid word: ""OUTDO"" -> no C.

With C and O at position4: what about ""CHADO"" -> H absent? H(x) from guess3 -> H forbidden -> cannot.

""SHOWY"" e.t. no C.

Perhaps we haven't tested G or N or T.

Let's try ""CONGA"" -> O position2 -> invalid.

But position4 O: so for example, ""C? ? O ?"" 

How about ""DUOMO"" -> not C, and O at position3 and 4? But positions: D U O M O -> but no C?

Start with C: ""DOOJO"" -> not word.

Another idea: ""COCOON"" too long.

Perhaps ""COOMB"" -> O at position2 -> invalid.

List the available letters agin: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

O is already used once.

For position4 O: C _ _ O _

Possible combinations:
- Position2: U? Position3: T? Position5: G? ""CUTOG"" or ""CUTOG"" not word.
- ""C U N O G"" -> ""CUNOG"" not word.
- ""C A B O D"" -> A forbidden.

But ""CABOB"" -> A forbidden.

Try ""CUB  O  W"" -> ""CUBOW"" not word.

Words that end with O: but O at position4, so position5 different.

""PUNTO"" -> not C.

With C: ""C "" + something + O + one letter.

Perhaps ""COMA"" too short.

Or ""COMFY"" O position2.

Maybe ""CURIO"" -> forbidden letters.

Perhaps we are missing that the letter U can be used, and and T.

For O at position5: C _ _ _ O

Valid words in English? ""CURIO"" has R and I -> invalid.

""HELLO"" -> no.

""MANGO"" -> no C.

""CONGO"" -> O position2 -> invalid.

""BINGO"" -> no.

""JUMBO"" -> no O.

C at start: ""CAMPO"" -> A,M,P forbidden.

""DUMPY"" -> no C.

""DECOY"" -> E forbidden.

Perhaps ""CINCO"" -> I forbidden.

I think I found one: ""MICRO"" -> not C.

""TABOO"" -> no.

Another: ""GUANO"" -> no.

C at start: ""CABIN"" -> A forbidden.

Perhaps ""BUNCO"" -> B U N C O -> has C not at start? But must have C at start? ""BUNCO"" starts with B -> no.

Start with C: what about ""CONTO"", but O position2.

""COMBO"", O position2.

I think I need to consider less common words or use U.

"" QUIET"" -> not C.

Perhaps ""COUDE"" -> O position2.

But let's Google or think: ""CURDO"" -> not standard.

""FICDO"" -> no.

Another possibility: ""COACH"" -> O position2 invalid.

Perhaps the word is ""C  O  W  E  D"" -> but forbidden letters.

Wait the only common work I can think is ""CLOTH"" -> L forbidden.

But L is forbidden.

"" Mirth"" not.

Breathe: not C and 6 letters.

Perhaps ""C WITH"" -> too short.

Another: ""BOXED"" -> not C.

C at start: ""CO  X  E  S"" -> O2.

No.

Perhaps ""COKED"" -> O position2 and K absent.

C "" V  E  N  O"" -> E forbidden.

Maybe ""CUNO"" is not allowed.

Let's consider O at position5 with U elsewhere.

For example: "" C  U  T  O "" -> but we need position4 if O at position4? ""CUTOT"" not word.

C U T O O -> duplicate O? ""CUTOO"" not valid.

""TUTOR"" -> not C.

Start with C: ""CUTIN"" -> I forbidden.

"" C U  D   O "" -> ""CUDDO"" not word.

Perhaps ""CUMIN"" -> I and M? M forbidden and I forbidden -> no.

All seem blocked.

Another idea: perhaps we forgot the letter G or N.

""CONG  O"" too long. ""CONGA"" O position2.

O at position5: ""CONGA"" is C O N G A -> O2 -> invalid.

But "" CONGEAL"" too long.

5-letter with O at position5: ""C R E D O"" -> R,E forbidden.

"" C B O O K"" -> not.

I think there's a word ""Canto"", but A forbidden.

Perhaps the word is ""Condo"" -> O position2.

No.

Let's think of ""BUYOUT"" -> not C or 6 letters.

Another: ""OUTBY"" -> no.

Perhaps we need to include ""U"" and ""N"" or ""T"".

Try O at position4: ""BUT T O"" -> ""BUTTO"" not standard.

We have ""DITTO"" which is common, but for C: no.

Perhaps ""COT  H"" -> H forbidden.

Or "" cot off"" no.

Maybe ""CUVEE"" is disallowed.

I recall that ""Cwtch"" is Welsh, not English.

We might have to use ""N"" with ""O"".

O at position4: ""C _ _ O _ ""

 with ""UN"" or something.

""C UND O"" -> ""CUNDO"" not word.

"" F U R O"" -> not C.

Start with C: ""CUNDY"" -> Y absent -> no.

""JUNKY"" -> no C.

Perhaps ""TONGS"" no.

Another possibility: ""CO  Z  Y"" -> O2.

Difficult.

Perhaps the word has duplicate letters, or we missed some available letter.

Available letters include B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

For example, ""O"" could be at position4, and position5 could be ""U"" or ""T"".

Word: ""CUNIT"" -> I not? ""CUNIT"" is not a word. In geology, ""cunette"" too long.

""BUILD"" not C.

Perhaps ""CABLE"" -> A forbidden.

Let's consider that position2 and position3 could have U and T.

For O at position5: pattern C _ _ _ O

Word: ""Cunto"" -> not English, and U,N,T,O? ""CUNTO"" might be not accepted, similar to Italian.

In English, ""cento"" has E? ""cento"" C E N T O -> E at position<2, not at start, but E in position2: C E? E forbidden -> no.

Another: ""dicto"" not C.

Perhaps ""micro"" -> not.

I think we need to look for words with ""U"" as vowel.

For O at position5: ""C  U  ?  ? O"" -> but O cannot be in position5 if position5 is O? Pattern is C X Y Z O, so position5 O.

Words:
- ""CURIO"" -> R,I forbidden.
- ""CUTTO"" -> not valid.
- ""CUSSO"" -> S forbidden.

  ""DAMAN"" no.

Maybe ""CUMUL"" -> u and l, L forbidden.

But L forbidden.

Perhaps ""O"" at position4: ""C _ _ O _"" -> then position5 can be U.

Word: ""C  X  Y  O  U"" -> but ""XY"" not standard.

Examples: "" CONTIN U"" too long.

5-letter: ""CONIU"" not word.

 ""CAN  U"" no.

Common word with C and O: ""blood"" not C.

I recall ""CO  U  P"" -> O at position2.

No.

Perhaps ""COUGH"" -> O2.

But let's think differently.

Maybe the word is ""COWED"", but O at position2 and W not at right position.

Feedback doesn't allow O at position2.

Another: ""COVER"" -> R and E forbidden.

No.

Perhaps we have not tried ""G"".

""GONAD"" -> no C.

C with O at position5: ""C R A G O"" no.

""DRAGO"" -> start D.

C: ""CAGED"" -> A forbidden.

But O missing? No, O at position5 must be? No, we need the word to have O.

Perhaps for position4 O: ""C  A  K  O  B"" not.

Maybe the word is ""OUNCE"" -> no C at start.

Start with C: ""Ounce"" is O U N C E -> but starts with O.

The only possibility is to use ""U"" in position2 or 3, O in 4 or 5, and common consonants.

For example, O at position4: C _ _ O _

With ""U"" in position2: ""C U ? O?""

Position3 must be a letter, say ""T"": ""C U T O ?"", so ""CUTO ?"" -> so position5, letter from available.

What can it be? ""CUTOD"" not word. ""CUTOF"" not. ""CUTOZ"" no.

""BUT U"" not.

With ""N"": ""C U N O ?"" like ""CUNOT"" not word.

""TUN  C"" no.

O at position5: C _ _ _ O

"" C U T U O"" duplicate U? ""CUTUO"" not.

""CUNTO"" might be accepted as a rare word? But doubtful.

""OUNCE"" is O U N C E -> not C start.

I think I found a word: ""COUTA"" -> O at position2, forbidden.

No.

Perhaps ""COB  O"" O position2.

Another common word: ""MACHO"" -> not C, and O at position5? H,O? C not position1.

Start with C: ""CACHO"" -> A forbidden.

""CUP  O  L"" -> ""CUPOL"" -> C U P O L -> but P forbidden? P(x) from guess2, so P forbidden and L forbidden? L and P forbidden -> invalid.

""CUPOL"" has L and P -> forbidden.

But L and P are forbidden.

Similarly, ""CUBIT"" -> I and T? I forbidden.

Perhaps ""DOUGH"" -> no.

Let's consider ""N"" and ""G"": ""CYGN "" -> not.

I think we have to try ""UNCO"" but ""UNCO"" is 4 letters.

""UNCO"" with what? 5-letter with C start.

""COUN"" too short.

Perhaps ""COUNTY"" too long.

But in 5-letter, a word like ""C T O N E"" -> O position3 forbidden? We know O cannot be in position3.

In this feedback, O not in position3.

So if pattern C T O N E, O at position3 -> not allowed.

So not that.

Perhaps the word is ""CUVEE"" but E forbidden.

I recall that ""debut"" not C.

Another idea: letter ""V"" and ""U"".

For O at position5: ""C _ _ _ O"" with ""V U"" or something.

"" C V U O not.

Perhaps "" OVA"" not.

Start with C: ""CURVY"" forbidden.

I am considering that Y might not be tested? No, Y is absent.

But perhaps the secret word has 'W' or 'V'.

For O at position4: ""C W O W O"" no real word.

""POWER"" not C.

Perhaps ""COVET"" -> O position2.

I think we need to choose a guess that can test multiple letters and positions, even if the word is less common.

For this guess, I can use ""CUNTY"" but Y is absent and I forbidden.

No.

"" C U S T O"" -> S forbidden.

So S forbidden.

Unused letters: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

Combination: ""C U D O "" -> ""cudo"" not 5 letters.

""UDO"" is 3.

""UDDER"" not C.

So perhaps ""CUNDY"" -> Y absent.

Or ""FUNDY"" -> not C.

Start with C: ""FUND"" too short.

Another: ""CON  K"" -> O position2.

No.

Perhaps include ""Q"" but ""QUOTH"" -> Q U O T H -> O position3? But position3 is O? Not allowed because O cannot be in position3. And H absent.

""QUOTH"": positions Q U O T H -> O at position3 -> disallowed.

""Q"" in 5-letter: ""C  Q  I  D  A"" not or ""C QUE"" short.

Not helpful.

Perhaps ""COQUI"" -> O position2.

No.

Let's give up and use ""COUNT"" but forbidden.

No.

Another word: ""BUXOM"" not C.

I know: ""COULD"" O position2.

But let's think: ""C U O T D"" not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""COT ED"" no.

Maybe ""CATED"" E forbidden.

A valid word: ""NICOL"" not C.

C with O at position4: ""C  O  O  E"" no.

Perhaps ""BOOZE"" no C.

I think I found a word: ""OUTGO"" -> not C. "" OUGHT"" not.

With C and O at position5: what about ""CIGARO"" too long.

5-letter: ""SAVOR"" not C.

""CABIN"" A forbidden.

""PIZZA"" not.

Another idea: ""COVIN"" -> O position2 -> disallowed.

But position4 O: are there words like ""CAHOW"" -> A forbidden, and H absent? ""CAHOW"" C A H O W -> A forbidden, H forbidden.

Not.

""MAN OR"" no.

Perhaps ""JUROR"" not C.

Start with C: ""JUDO"" too short.

""C JUD O"" not.

So after all, I decide to guess ""CUTTO"" even though it's not common, or choose another strategy.

 I can guess a different word that tests new letters and tries O in position 4 or 5? But with other letters.

Since O can be in position4 or 5, and positions 2 and 3 are unknown, I might guess ""COUNT"" but it has O in position2 and forbidden R? Bad.

Another thought: in Guess 2: ""clomp"" had O marked ""-"", so O is in the word, position unknown but not position2. In Guess 3: ""choky"" has O at position3 marked ""-"", so not position3. So we need to put O in position4 or 5.

But for the letter, we haven't used U, so I should include U to test if it's a vowel.

Also, include T and N, common letters.

For the guess, how about ""CUT  O  N"" -> ""CUTON"" is a word? CUTON: a weight or fabric term? In textile, ""cut on"" is not 5-letter word. ""CUTONS"" too long.

""TONGS"" not.

Perhaps ""CUTIN"" but I forbidden.

I think ""UNDID"" not C.

Another word: ""DUVET"" not C.

C start: ""DUVET"" D.

Perhaps ""O R G A N"" not.

Let's choose ""CONUS"" -> O position2 disallowed.

But ""CONUS"" has C O N U S -> O position2 -> invalid.

Perhaps ""INCUS"" not C.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps include ""W"": ""COW  E R"" no.

"" C O W S"" O at position2.

No.

O at position4: ""C  W ? O ?""

""CWHO  O"" not.

"" CROW "" R forbidden.

Perhaps ""BLEW"" not.

C at start: ""BLOWN"" L forbidden.

I think one valid word could be ""CUBEB"" -> but E forbidden.

E forbidden.

Another: ""CUBED"" E forbidden.

No.

Perhaps ""FAQIR"" not.

Let's consider ""G"" and ""U"": ""UN  C  A G"" not.

With C: ""C GUNG"" not.

Not working.

I recall a word: ""THONG"" -> not C.

C with O at position5: ""  OINT"" not C.

""POINT"" not C.

""C Cint"" no.

Perhaps ""QUINT"" not C.

I think I have to make a guess that isn't perfect.

Let's guess "" COUNT"" but we know it will have O in position2, which is wrong, but the feedback might help? No, because we know it's wrong, it's illegal? But the game allows any 5-letter English word, even if we know it's wrong.

But for maximum information, we should not reuse known wrong positions.

So Guess ""COUNT"" would have O in position2, which we know is incorrect, but we might test other letters.

But ""COUNT"" has letters: C O U N T.
- C: position1 should be correct, but in ""COUNT"" it is C, so if secret starts with C ""COUNT"" will show C correct?
- O: at position2, we know it's wrong position for O? Or absent? No, O is present, so it will show O as present but wrong position? And also U, N, T?

But we haven't tested U,N,T.

So it might provide information on U,N,T.

Similarly, R is in ""COUNT""? ""COUNT"" is C O U N T, no R.

Letters: O,U,N,T.
- O: we know is in word, but position2 is wrong, so it will show ""-"" for O.
- U,N,T: not yet tested.

However, the secret word does not have O in position2, so ""COUNT"" is not the secret, but we can use it to test.

But we know O is in position4 or 5, not 2, so ""COUNT"" cannot be the secret word? Yes, because O position2 is invalid.

But in terms of information, if I guess ""COUNT"", U position3, N position4, T position5.

Feedback will show:
- Position1 C: should be “✓” because we know it's C.
- Position2 O: since O is in word but not in position2, it will be ""-"". This we already know.
- Position3 U: will show correct or not.
- Position4 N: will show correct or not.
- Position5 T: will show correct or not.

But we also learn about the letters U,N,T.

This could be useful.

Otherwise, we can guess a different word like ""CUT ON"" not separated.

A better word might be ""CUT AN"" not valid.

""UN  C  O  T"" not.

Word like ""C U T O"" too short.

So ""COUNT"" might be an option to test U,N,T.

We have not tested U,N,T, and they are common.

T and N are high-frequency.

""COUNT"" is a valid English word.

However, it wastes position2 for O which we know is wrong.

But it only wastes one slot and tests three new letters.

There might be better words.

For example, a word that starts with C, has U in another position, N and T, and O in position4 or 5? But hard to find.

For instance, O at position5: ""C U N T O"" -> ""CUNTO"" not valid.

O at position4: ""C U N O T"" -> ""CUNOT"" not.

"" C T U N O"" too many positions.

Perhaps ""OCT AN"" not.

I think ""COUNT"" is the best compromise.

Or ""CURIO"" but R forbidden.

No.

Another common word: ""DOUBT"" not C.

""CREDIT"" too long.

So I choose ""COUNT"" for this guess.

But in ""COUNT"", position2 is O, which is misplaced, but we already know O is misplaced not there? And we'll get feedback on U,N,T.

Then we can use it to infer.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process

- **Summary of Previous Feedback**:  
  - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → All letters absent: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x). Secret word contains **no R, A, I, S, or E**.  
  - **Guess 2: ""clomp""** → C(✓) in position 1, L(x) absent, O(-) present but wrong position, M(x) absent, P(x) absent. Secret word starts with **C**, contains **O** (not in position 2), and excludes L, M, P.  
  - **Guess 3: ""choky""** → C(✓) in position 1, H(x) absent, O(-) present but wrong position (now confirmed not in position 3), K(x) absent, Y(x) absent. Secret word excludes H, K, Y, and O is not in position 2 or 3.  

- **Key Deductions**:  
  - Position 1 is **C** (confirmed ✓).  
  - **O** is in the word but must be in **position 4 or 5** (rules out positions 2 and 3 via previous feedback).  
  - **Absent letters**: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P, H, K, Y (cannot be used).  
  - **Valid letters for new guess**: B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - Secret word structure: `C _ _ _ _`, with O in position 4 or 5.  
    - If O in position 4: Pattern `C _ _ O _`.  
    - If O in position 5: Pattern `C _ _ _ O`.  
  - Since vowels A, E, I, Y are out, **U** is a high-priority vowel to test. Consonants like T, N, D, G are common and untested.  

- **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
  - Need to test if **O** is in position 4 or 5.  
  - Prioritize testing **U** (as the only remaining common vowel) and high-frequency consonants like **T, N, D**.  
  - Select a word that:  
    - Starts with C (position 1 correct).  
    - Places O in a position to validate (position 4 or 5, but neither 2 nor 3).  
    - Uses new, untested letters from the valid set.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - ""COUNT"" is a valid 5-letter English word that fits this strategy:  
    - Starts with C (position 1) → Confirms C again (expected ✓).  
    - Places O in position 2, which is known to be wrong for O → Expected ""-"" for O, reinforcing deduction.  
    - Tests U in position 3, N in position 4, T in position 5 (all new letters).  
  - Why ""COUNT"" is useful:  
    - Feedback on U, N, T will reveal their presence/absence and positions.  
    - If U, N, or T appear, it narrows down possibilities significantly (e.g., ""COUNT"" has 30+ common variants like ""COULD"" or ""CRUNT"", but R is forbidden).  
    - If absent, eliminates three common letters efficiently.  
  - Alternatives considered:  
    - Words like ""CURIO"" or ""CUBEB"" use forbidden letters (R, I, E).  
    - ""CUNTO"" or ""CUTTO"" are invalid/obscure.  
    - ""COUNT"" is common and maximizes information despite O in position 2 being ""wasted"" (since we know O isn't there, but it tests U/N/T).  

- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - ""COUNT"" cannot be the secret word because O cannot be in position 2.  
  - Feedback will still provide critical data on U, N, T:  
    - If any are ""✓"" or ""-"", we can infer their positions.  
    - If all ""x"", O must be in position 4 or 5 with other untested letters.  

Final decision: Guess **""COUNT""** to test U, N, T while maintaining consistency with known constraints.

<guess>count</guess>",count,"From the latest feedback:
- Guess 3: ""choky"" → C(✓) H(x) O(-) K(x) Y(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1, which we already knew.
  - H is absent → so H is not in the word.
  - O is present but in the wrong position (since - ). Previously, we knew O was not in position 2; now it's also not in position 3 because in ""choky"" O is at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position. So O cannot be in position 3 either? 
    - Correction: The symbol ""-"" means it's present but wrong position. So in ""choky"", position 3 is O, and it's marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. Since we already knew from Guess 2 (""clomp"") that O is not in position 2, now we know it's also not in position 3. Therefore, O must be in position 4 or 5.
  - K and Y are absent → K and Y are not in the word.

So far, we know:
- Position 1: C
- O is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 4 or 5.
- Forbidden letters (absent): R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P, H, K, Y (from Guess 1, 2, 3).
- Present letters: C (position 1), O (somewhere, not pos 2 or 3 → so pos 4 or 5).

The secret word has only two known letters: C at start and O somewhere in 4 or 5. The remaining letters must be from the unused set.

Unused letters (consonants and vowels available): B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. Also, O is present, so we have O.

Vowels available: U (since A,E,I are forbidden, and Y is absent). We also have consonants.

We have not tested U, T, N, D, etc.

The word structure: C _ _ _ _
- Position 4 or 5 must be O? Actually, O could be in position 4 OR 5? But positions 2 and 3 are still unknown.

So blanks: position 2, 3, 4, 5 → but O will occupy one of positions 4 or 5? Actually, positions 4 and 5 are the last two, but O could be in either, not both? Unless duplicate? But let's assume no duplicates for now.

Pattern: 
- If O in position 4: C _ _ O _
- If O in position 5: C _ _ _ O

Now, for position 2 and 3, we need two letters, and positions 4 or 5 whatever is not O also needs a letter? Actually:
- If O is in position 4: Then positions: 2,3,5 need letters.
- If O is in position 5: Then positions: 2,3,4 need letters.

Both cases require positions 2 and 3 to be filled. Also, position 5 (if O not there) or position 4 (if O not there) must be another letter.

Since O is present only once. We need letters chosen from the available set.

We must ensure we don't use forbidden letters.

For the guess, I want to test:
- Position of O: whether it's in 4 or 5.
- Also test common letters like U, T, N.

But we also need to consider valid words.

Let's form possible words.

First, if O in position 4: C? ? O ?

Possible words (from allowed letters):
- Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z (and O is in one spot).

Examples:
- ""CUTOU"" → not valid? Duplicate? ""CUTOU"" has U twice? Needs different.
- ""CONTU"" → O at position2? No, here position4: C? ? O ? So pos4 O.

Words:
- C with O at position4: ""COWTO"" → but O at position2? C O W T O → O at position2 → disallowed.
- Need no letter at position2 or 3 that causes issue? Positions 2 and 3 are not O per feedback.

For example: ""CUP O"" → but O not separate.

Think 5-letter: ""CUBO "" → U,B? ""cubon"" not word? 

Better words: 
- ""COUNT"" → O at position2 → disallowed → no.
- ""COUNT"" is bad.

Other? ""CONDU"" → not? ""CONDU"" not a word.

""CONTO"" → O at position position2 and position5 → O at position2 forbidden → invalid.

Perhaps ""CENTO"" → E at position2? E forbidden.

""CANTO"" → A forbidden.

With U: ""CURBO"" → R forbidden? R is forbidden → no.

Since R, A, I, S, E forbidden → we avoid them.

Another: ""JUNCO"" → J,U,N,C,O? But we have C at start? ""JUNCO"" starts with J → no.

Start with C: ""CUVEO"" → U,V,E,O → E forbidden → no.

Available: D, F, G, N, T, U, V, W, etc.

""COMBO"" → M forbidden and O position2? C O M B O → O2 → invalid.

How about ""CUNGO"" → U,N,G,O? But O in position4: C U N G O → so positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G? But we need O at position4 → but here position4 is G? Not O.

If O at position4: we need C _ _ O _

For example, ""CUZ O"" → ""cuz"" short? Words: ""CUNIT"" → not standard? ""cunit""? Unlikely.

""BOWED"" → doesn't start C.

Perhaps ""CHUTE"" → forbidden letters.

Another possibility: O at position5: C_ _ _ O

Words:
- ""CANTO"" → A forbidden.
- ""CARGO"" → R forbidden.
- ""CAMEO"" → A and E forbidden.
- ""DADOS"" → not C.

With C: ""CONVO"" → O at position2 → invalid.

""CRAMO"" → R,A forbidden.

How about ""DITTO"" → not C.

Start with C: ""CUZZO"" → zz? Not common.

But we have U available? So ""CUTTY"" → U,T,T,Y → Y absent? But we might use it to test? But Y is already known absent, no need to test? But words must be valid.

Since Y is absent, we avoid Y.

Possible word with O at position5: ""COUNT"" → O2 disallowed? For ""COUNT"" O is at position2 → so invalid.

What about ""COURT"" → O2 and R → forbidden.

Alternatively: ""BONGO"" → not C.

List: C _ _ _ O

Letters for positions 2,3,4: no R,A,I,S,E,L,M,P,H,K,Y.

From available: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z.

Examples:
- ""CUBEO"" → U,B,E? E forbidden? E in position4? But we don't know → forbidden letter E? But E forbidden → cannot use E.

E is forbidden from guess1.

So avoid.

""CUMBO"" → M forbidden.

""JUMBO"" → not C.

Try: ""CUBAN"" → A forbidden? A at position5? ""CUBAN"" is C U B A N → A forbidden → invalid.

But if O at position5? Then we need words like ""CUB N O"" no → positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:O

So ""C ? ? ? O""

Words: 
- ""CUVEE"" → E forbidden.
- ""CUSEC"" → S forbidden? S is forbidden from guess1 → no.
- ""CUTTO"" → T,T → duplicate? Allowed?
- ""CUTTO"" might not be word.

Common words: ""ADOBE"" → no C starth.

With U: ""CURVY"" → R forbidden? R forbidden and Y absent? However, R forbidden, and Y forbidden? From feedback, Y absent → forbidden? So cannot use R or Y.

""curvy"" has R and Y → both forbidden.

But O missing? We need O at position5 → must have O.

All words must include O at position4 or 5? Yes, because O is in the word and can't be in positions 2 or 3.

Is there a word like ""CUTTO""? Unlikely.

Perhaps ""WACKO"" → not C starter.

Another: ""FUTON"" → no C.

Start with C: ""CONTU"" → O at position2 → invalid.

""CONGE"" → O position2? C O N G E → O2 → forbidden.

O at position5: pattern C _ _ _ O

I am considering ""CUCKOO"" but too long.

5-letter: ""BUXOM"" → not C.

Perhaps ""COCOA"" → O at position2 → disallowed.

Hard to find common words with C at start and O at end, without using forbidden letters.

What about O at position4? Pattern C _ _ O _

Examples:
- ""CROUP"" → R and P forbidden.
- ""GROUP"" → no C.
- ""CAMPY"" → M,P forbidden and A? ""campy"" C A M P Y → A,M,P,Y all issues → invalid.

""CUBES"" → S forbidden.

""CUFFO"" → F,F → C U F F O → O at position5? Not position4? We need pattern C _ _ O _ so position4 is O → in this, position4 is F? Not O.

If O at position4, then positions: 1:C, 2:X, 3:Y, 4:O, 5:Z

XY from allowed.

Possible: ""CUNIT"" → U,N? But ""cunit"" not standard.

""CYTON"" → Y forbidden? Y is absent → no.

""BOUTS"" → not C.

Perhaps ""COWED"" → O position2 invalid.

Wait, maybe ""GOUDi"" not English.

Another word: ""COUTH"" -> O position2 -> invalid.

But ""CUNO"" -> too short.

Perhaps I should consider duplicharacters? But let's try to use U and T.

For example: ""CUTTO"" -> not valid.

""TUTTI"" -> no C.

Valid word: ""OUTDO"" -> no C.

With C and O at position4: what about ""CHADO"" -> H absent? H(x) from guess3 -> H forbidden -> cannot.

""SHOWY"" e.t. no C.

Perhaps we haven't tested G or N or T.

Let's try ""CONGA"" -> O position2 -> invalid.

But position4 O: so for example, ""C? ? O ?"" 

How about ""DUOMO"" -> not C, and O at position3 and 4? But positions: D U O M O -> but no C?

Start with C: ""DOOJO"" -> not word.

Another idea: ""COCOON"" too long.

Perhaps ""COOMB"" -> O at position2 -> invalid.

List the available letters agin: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

O is already used once.

For position4 O: C _ _ O _

Possible combinations:
- Position2: U? Position3: T? Position5: G? ""CUTOG"" or ""CUTOG"" not word.
- ""C U N O G"" -> ""CUNOG"" not word.
- ""C A B O D"" -> A forbidden.

But ""CABOB"" -> A forbidden.

Try ""CUB  O  W"" -> ""CUBOW"" not word.

Words that end with O: but O at position4, so position5 different.

""PUNTO"" -> not C.

With C: ""C "" + something + O + one letter.

Perhaps ""COMA"" too short.

Or ""COMFY"" O position2.

Maybe ""CURIO"" -> forbidden letters.

Perhaps we are missing that the letter U can be used, and and T.

For O at position5: C _ _ _ O

Valid words in English? ""CURIO"" has R and I -> invalid.

""HELLO"" -> no.

""MANGO"" -> no C.

""CONGO"" -> O position2 -> invalid.

""BINGO"" -> no.

""JUMBO"" -> no O.

C at start: ""CAMPO"" -> A,M,P forbidden.

""DUMPY"" -> no C.

""DECOY"" -> E forbidden.

Perhaps ""CINCO"" -> I forbidden.

I think I found one: ""MICRO"" -> not C.

""TABOO"" -> no.

Another: ""GUANO"" -> no.

C at start: ""CABIN"" -> A forbidden.

Perhaps ""BUNCO"" -> B U N C O -> has C not at start? But must have C at start? ""BUNCO"" starts with B -> no.

Start with C: what about ""CONTO"", but O position2.

""COMBO"", O position2.

I think I need to consider less common words or use U.

"" QUIET"" -> not C.

Perhaps ""COUDE"" -> O position2.

But let's Google or think: ""CURDO"" -> not standard.

""FICDO"" -> no.

Another possibility: ""COACH"" -> O position2 invalid.

Perhaps the word is ""C  O  W  E  D"" -> but forbidden letters.

Wait the only common work I can think is ""CLOTH"" -> L forbidden.

But L is forbidden.

"" Mirth"" not.

Breathe: not C and 6 letters.

Perhaps ""C WITH"" -> too short.

Another: ""BOXED"" -> not C.

C at start: ""CO  X  E  S"" -> O2.

No.

Perhaps ""COKED"" -> O position2 and K absent.

C "" V  E  N  O"" -> E forbidden.

Maybe ""CUNO"" is not allowed.

Let's consider O at position5 with U elsewhere.

For example: "" C  U  T  O "" -> but we need position4 if O at position4? ""CUTOT"" not word.

C U T O O -> duplicate O? ""CUTOO"" not valid.

""TUTOR"" -> not C.

Start with C: ""CUTIN"" -> I forbidden.

"" C U  D   O "" -> ""CUDDO"" not word.

Perhaps ""CUMIN"" -> I and M? M forbidden and I forbidden -> no.

All seem blocked.

Another idea: perhaps we forgot the letter G or N.

""CONG  O"" too long. ""CONGA"" O position2.

O at position5: ""CONGA"" is C O N G A -> O2 -> invalid.

But "" CONGEAL"" too long.

5-letter with O at position5: ""C R E D O"" -> R,E forbidden.

"" C B O O K"" -> not.

I think there's a word ""Canto"", but A forbidden.

Perhaps the word is ""Condo"" -> O position2.

No.

Let's think of ""BUYOUT"" -> not C or 6 letters.

Another: ""OUTBY"" -> no.

Perhaps we need to include ""U"" and ""N"" or ""T"".

Try O at position4: ""BUT T O"" -> ""BUTTO"" not standard.

We have ""DITTO"" which is common, but for C: no.

Perhaps ""COT  H"" -> H forbidden.

Or "" cot off"" no.

Maybe ""CUVEE"" is disallowed.

I recall that ""Cwtch"" is Welsh, not English.

We might have to use ""N"" with ""O"".

O at position4: ""C _ _ O _ ""

 with ""UN"" or something.

""C UND O"" -> ""CUNDO"" not word.

"" F U R O"" -> not C.

Start with C: ""CUNDY"" -> Y absent -> no.

""JUNKY"" -> no C.

Perhaps ""TONGS"" no.

Another possibility: ""CO  Z  Y"" -> O2.

Difficult.

Perhaps the word has duplicate letters, or we missed some available letter.

Available letters include B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

For example, ""O"" could be at position4, and position5 could be ""U"" or ""T"".

Word: ""CUNIT"" -> I not? ""CUNIT"" is not a word. In geology, ""cunette"" too long.

""BUILD"" not C.

Perhaps ""CABLE"" -> A forbidden.

Let's consider that position2 and position3 could have U and T.

For O at position5: pattern C _ _ _ O

Word: ""Cunto"" -> not English, and U,N,T,O? ""CUNTO"" might be not accepted, similar to Italian.

In English, ""cento"" has E? ""cento"" C E N T O -> E at position<2, not at start, but E in position2: C E? E forbidden -> no.

Another: ""dicto"" not C.

Perhaps ""micro"" -> not.

I think we need to look for words with ""U"" as vowel.

For O at position5: ""C  U  ?  ? O"" -> but O cannot be in position5 if position5 is O? Pattern is C X Y Z O, so position5 O.

Words:
- ""CURIO"" -> R,I forbidden.
- ""CUTTO"" -> not valid.
- ""CUSSO"" -> S forbidden.

  ""DAMAN"" no.

Maybe ""CUMUL"" -> u and l, L forbidden.

But L forbidden.

Perhaps ""O"" at position4: ""C _ _ O _"" -> then position5 can be U.

Word: ""C  X  Y  O  U"" -> but ""XY"" not standard.

Examples: "" CONTIN U"" too long.

5-letter: ""CONIU"" not word.

 ""CAN  U"" no.

Common word with C and O: ""blood"" not C.

I recall ""CO  U  P"" -> O at position2.

No.

Perhaps ""COUGH"" -> O2.

But let's think differently.

Maybe the word is ""COWED"", but O at position2 and W not at right position.

Feedback doesn't allow O at position2.

Another: ""COVER"" -> R and E forbidden.

No.

Perhaps we have not tried ""G"".

""GONAD"" -> no C.

C with O at position5: ""C R A G O"" no.

""DRAGO"" -> start D.

C: ""CAGED"" -> A forbidden.

But O missing? No, O at position5 must be? No, we need the word to have O.

Perhaps for position4 O: ""C  A  K  O  B"" not.

Maybe the word is ""OUNCE"" -> no C at start.

Start with C: ""Ounce"" is O U N C E -> but starts with O.

The only possibility is to use ""U"" in position2 or 3, O in 4 or 5, and common consonants.

For example, O at position4: C _ _ O _

With ""U"" in position2: ""C U ? O?""

Position3 must be a letter, say ""T"": ""C U T O ?"", so ""CUTO ?"" -> so position5, letter from available.

What can it be? ""CUTOD"" not word. ""CUTOF"" not. ""CUTOZ"" no.

""BUT U"" not.

With ""N"": ""C U N O ?"" like ""CUNOT"" not word.

""TUN  C"" no.

O at position5: C _ _ _ O

"" C U T U O"" duplicate U? ""CUTUO"" not.

""CUNTO"" might be accepted as a rare word? But doubtful.

""OUNCE"" is O U N C E -> not C start.

I think I found a word: ""COUTA"" -> O at position2, forbidden.

No.

Perhaps ""COB  O"" O position2.

Another common word: ""MACHO"" -> not C, and O at position5? H,O? C not position1.

Start with C: ""CACHO"" -> A forbidden.

""CUP  O  L"" -> ""CUPOL"" -> C U P O L -> but P forbidden? P(x) from guess2, so P forbidden and L forbidden? L and P forbidden -> invalid.

""CUPOL"" has L and P -> forbidden.

But L and P are forbidden.

Similarly, ""CUBIT"" -> I and T? I forbidden.

Perhaps ""DOUGH"" -> no.

Let's consider ""N"" and ""G"": ""CYGN "" -> not.

I think we have to try ""UNCO"" but ""UNCO"" is 4 letters.

""UNCO"" with what? 5-letter with C start.

""COUN"" too short.

Perhaps ""COUNTY"" too long.

But in 5-letter, a word like ""C T O N E"" -> O position3 forbidden? We know O cannot be in position3.

In this feedback, O not in position3.

So if pattern C T O N E, O at position3 -> not allowed.

So not that.

Perhaps the word is ""CUVEE"" but E forbidden.

I recall that ""debut"" not C.

Another idea: letter ""V"" and ""U"".

For O at position5: ""C _ _ _ O"" with ""V U"" or something.

"" C V U O not.

Perhaps "" OVA"" not.

Start with C: ""CURVY"" forbidden.

I am considering that Y might not be tested? No, Y is absent.

But perhaps the secret word has 'W' or 'V'.

For O at position4: ""C W O W O"" no real word.

""POWER"" not C.

Perhaps ""COVET"" -> O position2.

I think we need to choose a guess that can test multiple letters and positions, even if the word is less common.

For this guess, I can use ""CUNTY"" but Y is absent and I forbidden.

No.

"" C U S T O"" -> S forbidden.

So S forbidden.

Unused letters: B,D,F,G,J,N,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

Combination: ""C U D O "" -> ""cudo"" not 5 letters.

""UDO"" is 3.

""UDDER"" not C.

So perhaps ""CUNDY"" -> Y absent.

Or ""FUNDY"" -> not C.

Start with C: ""FUND"" too short.

Another: ""CON  K"" -> O position2.

No.

Perhaps include ""Q"" but ""QUOTH"" -> Q U O T H -> O position3? But position3 is O? Not allowed because O cannot be in position3. And H absent.

""QUOTH"": positions Q U O T H -> O at position3 -> disallowed.

""Q"" in 5-letter: ""C  Q  I  D  A"" not or ""C QUE"" short.

Not helpful.

Perhaps ""COQUI"" -> O position2.

No.

Let's give up and use ""COUNT"" but forbidden.

No.

Another word: ""BUXOM"" not C.

I know: ""COULD"" O position2.

But let's think: ""C U O T D"" not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""COT ED"" no.

Maybe ""CATED"" E forbidden.

A valid word: ""NICOL"" not C.

C with O at position4: ""C  O  O  E"" no.

Perhaps ""BOOZE"" no C.

I think I found a word: ""OUTGO"" -> not C. "" OUGHT"" not.

With C and O at position5: what about ""CIGARO"" too long.

5-letter: ""SAVOR"" not C.

""CABIN"" A forbidden.

""PIZZA"" not.

Another idea: ""COVIN"" -> O position2 -> disallowed.

But position4 O: are there words like ""CAHOW"" -> A forbidden, and H absent? ""CAHOW"" C A H O W -> A forbidden, H forbidden.

Not.

""MAN OR"" no.

Perhaps ""JUROR"" not C.

Start with C: ""JUDO"" too short.

""C JUD O"" not.

So after all, I decide to guess ""CUTTO"" even though it's not common, or choose another strategy.

 I can guess a different word that tests new letters and tries O in position 4 or 5? But with other letters.

Since O can be in position4 or 5, and positions 2 and 3 are unknown, I might guess ""COUNT"" but it has O in position2 and forbidden R? Bad.

Another thought: in Guess 2: ""clomp"" had O marked ""-"", so O is in the word, position unknown but not position2. In Guess 3: ""choky"" has O at position3 marked ""-"", so not position3. So we need to put O in position4 or 5.

But for the letter, we haven't used U, so I should include U to test if it's a vowel.

Also, include T and N, common letters.

For the guess, how about ""CUT  O  N"" -> ""CUTON"" is a word? CUTON: a weight or fabric term? In textile, ""cut on"" is not 5-letter word. ""CUTONS"" too long.

""TONGS"" not.

Perhaps ""CUTIN"" but I forbidden.

I think ""UNDID"" not C.

Another word: ""DUVET"" not C.

C start: ""DUVET"" D.

Perhaps ""O R G A N"" not.

Let's choose ""CONUS"" -> O position2 disallowed.

But ""CONUS"" has C O N U S -> O position2 -> invalid.

Perhaps ""INCUS"" not C.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps include ""W"": ""COW  E R"" no.

"" C O W S"" O at position2.

No.

O at position4: ""C  W ? O ?""

""CWHO  O"" not.

"" CROW "" R forbidden.

Perhaps ""BLEW"" not.

C at start: ""BLOWN"" L forbidden.

I think one valid word could be ""CUBEB"" -> but E forbidden.

E forbidden.

Another: ""CUBED"" E forbidden.

No.

Perhaps ""FAQIR"" not.

Let's consider ""G"" and ""U"": ""UN  C  A G"" not.

With C: ""C GUNG"" not.

Not working.

I recall a word: ""THONG"" -> not C.

C with O at position5: ""  OINT"" not C.

""POINT"" not C.

""C Cint"" no.

Perhaps ""QUINT"" not C.

I think I have to make a guess that isn't perfect.

Let's guess "" COUNT"" but we know it will have O in position2, which is wrong, but the feedback might help? No, because we know it's wrong, it's illegal? But the game allows any 5-letter English word, even if we know it's wrong.

But for maximum information, we should not reuse known wrong positions.

So Guess ""COUNT"" would have O in position2, which we know is incorrect, but we might test other letters.

But ""COUNT"" has letters: C O U N T.
- C: position1 should be correct, but in ""COUNT"" it is C, so if secret starts with C ""COUNT"" will show C correct?
- O: at position2, we know it's wrong position for O? Or absent? No, O is present, so it will show O as present but wrong position? And also U, N, T?

But we haven't tested U,N,T.

So it might provide information on U,N,T.

Similarly, R is in ""COUNT""? ""COUNT"" is C O U N T, no R.

Letters: O,U,N,T.
- O: we know is in word, but position2 is wrong, so it will show ""-"" for O.
- U,N,T: not yet tested.

However, the secret word does not have O in position2, so ""COUNT"" is not the secret, but we can use it to test.

But we know O is in position4 or 5, not 2, so ""COUNT"" cannot be the secret word? Yes, because O position2 is invalid.

But in terms of information, if I guess ""COUNT"", U position3, N position4, T position5.

Feedback will show:
- Position1 C: should be “✓” because we know it's C.
- Position2 O: since O is in word but not in position2, it will be ""-"". This we already know.
- Position3 U: will show correct or not.
- Position4 N: will show correct or not.
- Position5 T: will show correct or not.

But we also learn about the letters U,N,T.

This could be useful.

Otherwise, we can guess a different word like ""CUT ON"" not separated.

A better word might be ""CUT AN"" not valid.

""UN  C  O  T"" not.

Word like ""C U T O"" too short.

So ""COUNT"" might be an option to test U,N,T.

We have not tested U,N,T, and they are common.

T and N are high-frequency.

""COUNT"" is a valid English word.

However, it wastes position2 for O which we know is wrong.

But it only wastes one slot and tests three new letters.

There might be better words.

For example, a word that starts with C, has U in another position, N and T, and O in position4 or 5? But hard to find.

For instance, O at position5: ""C U N T O"" -> ""CUNTO"" not valid.

O at position4: ""C U N O T"" -> ""CUNOT"" not.

"" C T U N O"" too many positions.

Perhaps ""OCT AN"" not.

I think ""COUNT"" is the best compromise.

Or ""CURIO"" but R forbidden.

No.

Another common word: ""DOUBT"" not C.

""CREDIT"" too long.

So I choose ""COUNT"" for this guess.

But in ""COUNT"", position2 is O, which is misplaced, but we already know O is misplaced not there? And we'll get feedback on U,N,T.

Then we can use it to infer.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

- **Summary of Previous Feedback**:  
  - **Guess 1: ""raise""** → All letters absent: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x). Secret word contains **no R, A, I, S, or E**.  
  - **Guess 2: ""clomp""** → C(✓) in position 1, L(x) absent, O(-) present but wrong position, M(x) absent, P(x) absent. Secret word starts with **C**, contains **O** (not in position 2), and excludes L, M, P.  
  - **Guess 3: ""choky""** → C(✓) in position 1, H(x) absent, O(-) present but wrong position (now confirmed not in position 3), K(x) absent, Y(x) absent. Secret word excludes H, K, Y, and O is not in position 2 or 3.  

- **Key Deductions**:  
  - Position 1 is **C** (confirmed ✓).  
  - **O** is in the word but must be in **position 4 or 5** (rules out positions 2 and 3 via previous feedback).  
  - **Absent letters**: R, A, I, S, E, L, M, P, H, K, Y (cannot be used).  
  - **Valid letters for new guess**: B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - Secret word structure: `C _ _ _ _`, with O in position 4 or 5.  
    - If O in position 4: Pattern `C _ _ O _`.  
    - If O in position 5: Pattern `C _ _ _ O`.  
  - Since vowels A, E, I, Y are out, **U** is a high-priority vowel to test. Consonants like T, N, D, G are common and untested.  

- **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
  - Need to test if **O** is in position 4 or 5.  
  - Prioritize testing **U** (as the only remaining common vowel) and high-frequency consonants like **T, N, D**.  
  - Select a word that:  
    - Starts with C (position 1 correct).  
    - Places O in a position to validate (position 4 or 5, but neither 2 nor 3).  
    - Uses new, untested letters from the valid set.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - ""COUNT"" is a valid 5-letter English word that fits this strategy:  
    - Starts with C (position 1) → Confirms C again (expected ✓).  
    - Places O in position 2, which is known to be wrong for O → Expected ""-"" for O, reinforcing deduction.  
    - Tests U in position 3, N in position 4, T in position 5 (all new letters).  
  - Why ""COUNT"" is useful:  
    - Feedback on U, N, T will reveal their presence/absence and positions.  
    - If U, N, or T appear, it narrows down possibilities significantly (e.g., ""COUNT"" has 30+ common variants like ""COULD"" or ""CRUNT"", but R is forbidden).  
    - If absent, eliminates three common letters efficiently.  
  - Alternatives considered:  
    - Words like ""CURIO"" or ""CUBEB"" use forbidden letters (R, I, E).  
    - ""CUNTO"" or ""CUTTO"" are invalid/obscure.  
    - ""COUNT"" is common and maximizes information despite O in position 2 being ""wasted"" (since we know O isn't there, but it tests U/N/T).  

- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - ""COUNT"" cannot be the secret word because O cannot be in position 2.  
  - Feedback will still provide critical data on U, N, T:  
    - If any are ""✓"" or ""-"", we can infer their positions.  
    - If all ""x"", O must be in position 4 or 5 with other untested letters.  

Final decision: Guess **""COUNT""** to test U, N, T while maintaining consistency with known constraints.",Guess 4: count -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
