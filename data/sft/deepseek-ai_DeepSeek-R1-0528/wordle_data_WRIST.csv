We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This tells us:
   - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R is fixed in the second position, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

 We know the letters C, A, N, E are absent. Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Has R in the second position.
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
   - Uses other common letters to get more information.

 Possible common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, B, etc.

 Let's think of words that fit: _ R _ _ _

 Some possibilities: 
   - BRUSH (but has S and H; note B isn't tried yet)
   - TRUTH (has T and H; T is common)
   - DRUID (has D and U; D and U are less common)
   - PROUD (has P, O, U, D)

 Since we want to test more common letters, let's consider including S, T, L, etc.

 Example: ""TRYST"" -> T R Y S T (but Y is vowel and not common, and repeated T)

 Another: ""BIRTH"" (B, I, T, H) 
 But we don't know if B is safe? Actually, we haven't tried B, so it might be in the word or not.

 Let me list more options: 
   - ""PROWL"" (P, R, O, W, L) -> R is in position 2, and avoids A, C, E.
   - ""GROWL"" (G, R, O, W, L) -> similar.

 However, note the feedback didn't say anything about O or L, so they could be present or not.

 Another common word: ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y) -> but O, D, Y haven't been tested.

 We have only eliminated C, A, N, E. So many letters are still available.

 We can try ""PORTY"" but that's not a word? Let's think of valid English words.

 Actually, let's aim for a word that has varied letters and common ones.

 I think ""STORM"" is a common word? But we have to avoid A, C, E, N? ""STORM"" has S, T, O, R, M.

 Let's check: 
   - R is in the second position: fits.
   - Letters: S, T, O, M haven't been tried.

 But wait, the feedback for our first guess eliminated E, so ""STORM"" is safe? Yes because it doesn't have C,A,N,E.

 However, note we already know R is in the second position so we can use that.

 Alternatively, consider ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid A, C, N, E? Only from the first feedback: C, A, N, E are out.

 So ""BROWN"" has N -> not allowed.

 Similarly, ""BRAVE"" has A and E -> not allowed.

 So let's think of words without C, A, N, E and with R in second.

 Possibilities:
   - ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D
   - ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P (but rearranged)
   - ""TRY"" words: ""TRULY"" -> T, R, U, L, Y -> valid? 
   - ""FRUIT"" -> F, R, U, I, T -> F, U, I, T haven't been tested.

 I think ""FRUIT"" is a good candidate because it tests F, U, I, T and R in the second position.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters: FRUIT.

 Another: ""GRIME"" -> G, R, I, M, E -> but E is eliminated -> not allowed.

 How about ""SPRIT""? Not a common word? Or ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> valid? Yes.

 But note: we want to test vowels. We haven't tested I, O, U. We only eliminated A.

 Since E is also eliminated, the vowels to test are I, O, U.

 Let me try ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> uses O (a vowel) and common consonants P, W, L.

 Alternatively, ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but O and I are vowels.

 However, we don't know if B is safe? But that's the point to test B.

 But note: ""BROIL"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But we avoid A, C, N, E -> ""BROIL"" has no A,C,N,E -> okay.

 Similarly, ""TROLL"": T, R, O, L, L -> repeated L? Actually, valid but repeated letters might not be best.

 Since we are trying to cover new letters, avoid repeats.

 Therefore, I propose ""PROUD"" or ""BROIL"". 

 Let's look for more common words: ""STORY"" -> S, T, O, R, Y -> R is in second? No: S-T-O-R-Y -> positions: S(1), T(2)? Wait, we need R in second position. So ""STORY"" has R in the fourth position -> doesn't fit.

 We need the second letter to be R.

 Another: ""DRINK"" -> D, R, I, N, K -> has N -> eliminated -> not allowed.

 ""PRIME"" -> P, R, I, M, E -> has E -> not allowed.

 ""TRIPS"" -> T, R, I, P, S -> valid and without any eliminated letters? No E, A, C, N -> okay.

 Or ""GRIPS"": G, R, I, P, S.

 But note: we have limited information and we want to maximize coverage.

 Given the constraints, let's choose ""TRIPS"" because it tests T, R, I, P, S. T, I, P, S are common.

 However, R is known to be in the second position, so ""TRIPS"" has R in second? T(1), R(2) -> yes.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""LURKS"" -> L, R in third? No, R must be second -> must be at index 1 (0-indexed: position 1).

 So any word must have R at the second character.

 I think ""TRIPS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning journey.

 Let me confirm: T, R, I, P, S.

 We have not tested T, I, P, S and they are common.

 Another option: ""CRISP"" -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed.

 So ""TRIPS"" seems good.

 But note: we might want to include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried I, O, U. ""TRIPS"" has I, which is a vowel.

 We also haven't tested O or U? Not with this word, but we can test later.

 Alternatively, ""FORUM""? F, O, R, U, M -> R is in third position -> doesn't fit.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""TRIPS"".

 But wait: what about ""BROAD""? Not allowed because it has A (eliminated) and O.

 So let me finalize: ""TRIPS"" as next guess.

 However, note: we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? But we haven't seen duplicates.

 Since we are guessing and trying to test new letters, I think ""TRIPS"" is good.

 But we must ensure no eliminated letters: 
   - T: not eliminated -> okay
   - R: already present (and known) -> okay
   - I: not tested -> okay
   - P: not tested -> okay
   - S: not tested -> okay

 So, next guess: TRIPS

 But note: the feedback said R is in the correct position, so we are maintaining that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need:
1. A 5-letter word with R in the second position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, or E.
3. Include other common letters to maximize information.

Considering these constraints, I choose **""TRIPS""** because:
- R is in position 2 as required.
- It tests new common letters: T, I, P, S.
- These letters are likely to yield useful feedback for narrowing down the word.

 Alternatively, ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but O and I are vowels.

 However, we don't know if B is safe? But that's the point to test B.

 But note: ""BROIL"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But we avoid A, C, N, E -> ""BROIL"" has no A,C,N,E -> okay.

 Similarly, ""TROLL"": T, R, O, L, L -> repeated L? Actually, valid but repeated letters might not be best.

 Since we are trying to cover new letters, avoid repeats.

 Therefore, I propose ""PROUD"" or ""BROIL"". 

 Let's look for more common words: ""STORY"" -> S, T, O, R, Y -> R is in second? No: S-T-O-R-Y -> positions: S(1), T(2)? Wait, we need R in second position. So ""STORY"" has R in the fourth position -> doesn't fit.

 We need the second letter to be R.

 Another: ""DRINK"" -> D, R, I, N, K -> has N -> eliminated -> not allowed.

 ""PRIME"" -> P, R, I, M, E -> has E -> not allowed.

 ""TRIPS"" -> T, R, I, P, S -> valid and without any eliminated letters? No E, A, C, N -> okay.

 Or ""GRIPS"": G, R, I, P, S.

 But note: we have limited information and we want to maximize coverage.

 Given the constraints, let's choose ""TRIPS"" because it tests T, R, I, P, S. T, I, P, S are common.

 However, R is known to be in the second position, so ""TRIPS"" has R in second? T(1), R(2) -> yes.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""LURKS"" -> L, R in third? No, R must be second -> must be at index 1 (0-indexed: position 1).

 So any word must have R at the second character.

 I think ""TRIPS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning journey.

 Let me confirm: T, R, I, P, S.

 We have not tested T, I, P, S and they are common.

 Another option: ""CRISP"" -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed.

 So ""TRIPS"" seems good.

 But note: we might want to include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried I, O, U. ""TRIPS"" has I, which is a vowel.

 We also haven't tested O or U? Not with this word, but we can test later.

 Alternatively, ""FORUM""? F, O, R, U, M -> R is in third position -> doesn't fit.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""TRIPS"".

 But wait: what about ""BROAD""? Not allowed because it has A (eliminated) and O.

 So let me finalize: ""TRIPS"" as next guess.

 However, note: we don't know if the word has more than one of a letter? But we haven't seen duplicates.

 Since we are guessing and trying to test new letters, I think ""TRIPS"" is good.

 But we must ensure no eliminated letters: 
   - T: not eliminated -> okay
   - R: already present (and known) -> okay
   - I: not tested -> okay
   - P: not tested -> okay
   - S: not tested -> okay

 So, next guess: TRIPS

 But note: the feedback said R is in the correct position, so we are maintaining that.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need:
1. A 5-letter word with R in the second position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, or E.
3. Include other common letters to maximize information.

Considering these constraints, I choose **""TRIPS""** because:
- R is in position 2 as required.
- It tests new common letters: T, I, P, S.
- These letters are likely to yield useful feedback for narrowing down the word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Second guess: ""trips"" -> T(-), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (still ✓).
- I is now confirmed in the secret word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is in the word but not in the first position; it must be in another position.
- S is in the word but not in the fifth position; it must be elsewhere.
- P is not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know C, A, N, E, P are eliminated (absent).

So, the secret word must have:
- Second letter R
- Third letter I
- And contain T and S, but not in the positions guessed.

Moreover, we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, P.

Now, let's reconstruct what we know about the secret word:

Position 1: ? 
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

And the word has T and S in positions other than:
- T was in position 1 in our guess, but it's misplaced, so T cannot be in position 1, and must be in position 4 or 5? Or possibly position 4? Since position 5 was S in the guess.

We also know S is present but not in position 5. Since the word has positions 1,4,5 open for T and S, but position 1 is open, and S was tried in position 5 and was wrong.

Therefore, T must be in position 4 or 5? Or position 1? But T cannot be in position 1 because that's where we had it and feedback says wrong position (-). So T is not in position 1.

S cannot be in position 5? So S must be in position 1 or 4.

But the word has five positions: 
1: cannot be T, and must be either S or an unknown letter? But we have T and S to place, and only positions 1,4,5 left? Positions 2 and 3 are fixed.

Positions:
1: must be not T and also not S? Not necessarily: S could be in position 1.

Wait, let me list:

Fixed: 
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I

Open: positions 1, 4, 5.

We know T is in the word but not in position 1 (from feedback on ""trips"": T in position 1 got (-)).

Similarly, S is in the word but not in position 5 (from feedback: S in position 5 got (-)).

Therefore, T must be in position 4 or 5? And S must be in position 1 or 4? But we have only three positions: 1,4,5.

But note: the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we don't have duplication.

Also, we have T and S both to place. Therefore:

- Position 1: could be S or another letter?
- Position 4: could be T or S?
- Position 5: could be T? but S cannot be there.

Actually, we must assign T to either position 4 or 5? And S to position 1 or 4? But position 4 cannot be both T and S? So they must be in different positions.

Therefore, possible positions:

- For S: only positions 1 and 4 available? Because it cannot be in 5? And positions 2 and 3 are fixed? Yes.

Similarly, T can only be in positions 4 and 5? Because not 1? And positions 2 and 3 are fixed? Yes.

But position 4 is shared, so the possibilities are:

Either:
- T in position 4 and S in position 1? That might work.
Or:
- T in position 5 and S in position 4? That would work too.
Or:
- T in position 4 and S in position 4? Not possible, so crossed out.

But if T is in position - what about S? Two possibilities:

Scenario 1:
- Position 1: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: ? 

But we have an additional letter? No, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have to fill position 5 with a letter that hasn't appeared? Because we only know T and S are present, but there are three positions? Wait no: we know the word has T and S, and also the fixed R and I, and then there must be one more letter? Because five letters total.

We know: R, I, T, S -> that's four distinct letters? Then position 1,4,5 must have three letters: S, T, and one other letter? But wait: the secret word might have duplicated letters? However, from the feedback, we didn't see any duplication clues? But we haven't tested duplicates? So it could be that T and S are the same? But T and S are different? So in secret word: we have R, I, T, S and one more letter? Or duplicates.

But we have no information about duplicates? But T and S are distinct? So likely, the word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily? We must be cautious.

However, from our guesses: ""crane"" had five distinct and ""trips"" had five distinct? So we assume distinct? But actually, feedback might show duplicates? We haven't seen.

But for now, let's assume the secret word has no duplicates? Because we haven't found any? And the feedback symbols: if a letter appears twice? The rules handle it by marking only the occurrence? But we haven't seen that? So we'll proceed with distinct letters.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Letters: R, I, T, S, and one more letter? Say X.

And X must be in one of the positions: 1? But we have position 1 to fill? Alternatively, we know that positions:

1: ?
2: R
3: I
4: ?
5: ?

And ? must include T and S and one extra letter. But we know T and S are in the word? The extra letter is the fifth letter.

But we also have eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, P are absent.

Now, from the above, we know:
- Position 1: cannot be T (from feedback of ""trips"": T was in pos1 -> not correct)
- Position 1: can be S? Or the extra letter?
- Similarly, position 5: cannot be S? But we don't say it has to be T? Position 5 could be T or the extra letter.

But we also must place T and S: T must be in position 4 or 5? Because T cannot be in 1, and positions 2 and 3 are filled? Similarly, S cannot be in position 5? So S must be in 1 or 4? And T must be in 4 or 5? So:

If S is in position 1:
   - Then T must be in 4 or 5?
   - Then position 4 and 5: one with T and the other with an extra letter? Or T in 4 and extra in 5? Or T in 5 and extra in 4? But we have two positions: 4 and 5, and two things: T and an extra letter? Because if S is in 1, then positions 4 and 5: T and the extra letter.

Similarly, if S is in position 4:
   - Then position 1 must be the extra letter? Since S is in 4.
   - Then T must be in position 5? Because position 4 is taken by S? And T cannot be in position 1? So T must be in 5.

Thus, we have two possible scenarios:

Scenario A:
- Position 1: S
- Position 4: T or the extra letter?
- Position 5: the other? But wait, we have to assign T to one of them? So:
   Option A1: 
      Pos1: S
      Pos4: T
      Pos5: extra letter? Not necessarily? Because we don't know if T must be in that? Actually, yes: T must be in the word? So in positions 4 or 5? So:
      Either:
        A1a: Position 4: T and Position 5: ?
        A1b: Position 4: ? and Position 5: T

But wait: we have the same? Actually, we combine:

If position 1 is S, then:
   - Position 4: could be T or not? 
   - And Position 5: could be T or not? But T must be in the word? One of the positions 4 or 5 must be T? And the other is extra.

Similarly, Scenario B: position 1: not S? Then S must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in position 5? Then:
- Position 1: extra letter?
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T? Because we have to put T in position 5? Since position 1 cannot have T? Position 4 has S? So T must be in position 5? Then extra letter is in position 1.

Therefore, the secret word can be:

Case 1: S in position 1, then:
   - The word: S R I _ _
   - With T in position 4 or 5?
   - And an extra letter? Y? So either:
        Word: S R I T Y (if Y in position 5 and T in 4) -> ""SRITY""? Not a word? Or S R I Y T -> ""SRIYT""? Not a word? We need real words.

Case 2: S in position 4, then:
   - The word: ? R I S T? Because position 5 must be T? 
   - So: _ R I S T

And the first letter is the extra letter? Say: BRISK? WRIT? But wait: possibilities.

And note: we know the word must not contain: C, A, N, E, P.

Also, from the first guess, we tried ""crane"" and only R was correct? So other letters are out? Including A? So BRISK might be candidate.

Similarly, TRIPS was our guess? Which has T, R, I, P, S? But the secret word must not have P? Because P was eliminated? From ""trips"" feedback: P(x) -> not in the word? And P is eliminated.

Therefore, P is out? So we avoid P? So the extra letter must be something else? And not in the eliminated list.

What words are possible?

First possibility: _ R I S T? That is, words of the form x R I S T? Where x is a letter not eliminated? Not C,A,N,E,P.

Possible words: WRIST, GRIST? Or BRIST? But ""BRIST"" is not common? Or FRIST? Not words? But ""WRIST"" is a word: W R I S T.

Similarly, ""GRIST"" is a word: G R I S T.

But note: in this case, position 1 is W or G? And the word ends with S T? But S is in position 4.

Second possibility: S in position 1? So words: S R I _ _

Then T must be in position 4 or 5? 

For position 5: if T is there, word: S R I ? T? So SRI?T? And ? is a letter? Which must be not C,A,E,N,P? Also, must be real word? Like ""SPRIT""? Not valid? Or ""SKIRT"": but that would be S K I R T? But then R in position 4? But position 2 is R? Conflict? ""SKIRT"" -> positions: S K I R T? Then R is in position 4? But we have R in position 2? No? Actually, ""SKIRT"" would have S(1), K(2), I(3), R(4), T(5)? But we know position 3 must be I? But in ""SKIRT"", position 3 is I? And position 2 is K? But we have R? No: position 2 must be R? So ""SKIRT"" has R in position 4? That's inconsistent.

Therefore, the only possibility might be words ending in ""ST"" but with R and I in positions 2 and 3? Actually, if S is in position 1? And T in position 5? Then the word: S R I ? T? And position 4 must be the extra letter? 

Possible words: ""WRIT"" is not 5-letters? ""SPRIT""? Not common? ""SHIRT"" -> S H I R T? But then R is in position 4? But we require position 2 to be R? So ""SHIRT"": S(1) H(2) I(3) R(4) T(5) -> position 2 is H? Not R? That's not matching.

Therefore, words of the form S R I ? T? How about ""STR?T""? Wait, that would be S T... but T cannot be in position 2? And we fixed position 2 as R? So no S R I ? T word comes to mind.

Common words matching pattern: I think the most common is ""SPRIT""? Not English? ""SKIET""? Not word? ""SHIST""? Not common? 

Therefore, likely the secret word is of the form ? R I S T

We can list possible words ending with ""RIST"" and having R in position 2 and I in position 3? And 5-letter? So: A R I S T? But A is eliminated? BRIST? Not common? CRIST? C is eliminated? DRIST? Not word? ERIST? E eliminated? FRIST? Not common? GRIST? Yes, meaning grain. HRIST? Not word? WRIST? Yes? TRIST? But T is a letter? But then at position 5? TRIST: T R I S T? Then pattern: T at position 1? But wait, T cannot be in position 1? Because we tried T in position 1 and it was misplaced? Meaning T is not in position 1? So TRIST would have T in position 1? So conflict? Therefore, TRIST is invalid? Because T at 1 is prohibited? So that leaves us with:

GRIST? G in position 1? And R,I,S,T as above? Or WRIST? W in position 1? R,I,S,T.

Also, check BRIST? B in position 1? Not a common word? Or FRIST? F at position 1? Not common? Possibly valid? But let's see common ones: GRIST and WRIST? 

But GRIST and WRIST? Both valid? And the pattern: G/R/I/S/T or W/R/I/S/T? 

Also, DRIST? Not found? So likely GRIST or WRIST? 

But we also have the possibility with T in position 4? And S in position 1? I could not find any words? So let me double-check: SRI_T? Like ""Sri"" followed by something? But that's proper? Not common English words.

Other patterns: maybe the extra letter is repeated? But we have distinct letters? So unknown?

But perhaps ""STAIR"": S T A I R? But has A (eliminated) and position 3 must be I? But ""STAIR"": S(1) T(2) A(3) I(4) R(5) -> that has positions: 2:T (should be R) and 3:A (should be I)? Doesn't match? 

Therefore, the best candidates? Also, we have forgotten that in the first scenario, with S in position 1? And T in position 4? For example: S R I T Y? Not a word? Or S R I B T? No? Not likely.

Another candidate: maybe the word ""BIRTH""? But B I R T H? Then positions: 1:B, 2:I? But we have position 2 fixed as R? So conflict? The secret word has position 2 as R? So ""birth"" would have I at 2? Not matching.

Therefore, let's focus on _RIST.

Possible letters for first position: not C,A,N,E,P? And we also have eliminated T? From the feedback? T is present! So cannot be eliminated? T is in the word? So the first letter cannot be T? Because we know T cannot be in position 1? But _RIST: first letter is different? Then the word must have T? In position 5? So we have:

The word: ? R I S T? with T as the fifth letter? Therefore, the first letter must be a letter that exists? And pattern *RIST?

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But after removing eliminated ones: C,A,N,E,P.

Common possibilities: B, D, F, G, H, ... etc.

Words: WRIST (yes), GRIST (yes), FRIST (rare? Frist is a surname?), but let's see:

We have two main candidates: ""WRIST"" and ""GRIST"". 

Also, are there others? Such as ""HRIST""? Not common? ""KRIST""? K is for names? Not common English? 

So we have ""WRIST"" and ""GRIST""? Both valid.

Now, we also have S in the word? Position 4: which is S? So yes, both have S in position 4? And T in position 5? And R in 2? I in 3? Perfect.

So between ""GRIST"" and ""WRIST""? We don't know? So we need to disambiguate? 

What other letters can we test? We haven't tried G and W? So in our next guess, we can choose a word that helps distinguish? And also must avoid eliminated letters.

But we have limited tries? So we might guess one of them? Let me see:

But note: we have not used the letter O? U? L? Etc? Or we can pick one?

Alternatively, we can form a word that has both possibilities? But we don't need? We don't know? So let me see.

But time? We can guess ""WRIST"" or ""GRIST""? 

Wait, let me see feedback: also consider if the secret word has W or G? We don't know.

So for maximum information? We might try a word that covers both? But it's hard? Or simply guess one? 

We have 6 tries? This is our third guess? So we can afford.

But let me think: is there a word that starts with W? Or G? Or contains both? But we need to maintain known letters? 

Known: position 2: R, position 3: I? And we need to fill positions 1 and 4 and 5? But on different? No? We think it's *RIST.

So to test: we can try ""GRIST"" or ""WRIST"". 

But note: we know S and T are present? So we don't need to worry?

But another option: we can try a word that tests both? For example, guess ""GROWS""? But that doesn't have R in position 2? And I? 

Alternatively, guess ""GRIPS""? But P is eliminated? Not allowed? P is out.

Therefore, we have to form a word with remaining letters? 

But for guessing: we can try ""grist"" or ""wrist""? 

Let me pick ""GRIST"". Then:
- If correct, we win? If not, we'll know? Then next guess?

Similarly for ""WRIST"".

Alternatively, to be safe: we can guess a word that uses letters we haven't tried? But we know the word must be *RIST? So it's limited? 

But let me search: any other possibilities? What about ""BRIOS""? Not *RIST? ""SHRI""? Not 5 letters? 

I think ""GRIST"" and ""WRIST"" are the only common ones? That end with IST? With R and I fixed.

Also, we have ""TRIST"" but T in position 1? Not allowed? Also removed.

So we'll choose one? Say ""GRIST""? Because ""wrist"" is more common? 

But in terms of letter frequency? W is less common than G? Or vice versa? 

No: let's go with ""WRIST"" as more common? Or ""GRIST"" is less common? So ""WRIST"" might be likely? 

But we must guess.

I think we can guess ""WRIST"" for the next guess? But let's verify: 

Our next guess must not include eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,A,N,E,P? ""WRIST"" has W,R,I,S,T -> no eliminated? Ok.

Similarly, ""GRIST"" has G,R,I,S,T -> same? 

So either is fine? We choose ""WRIST"".

But wait: what if the secret word is ""BIRDS""? But in ""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S? Then positions: position 2: I? But we have R? And position 3: R? So pattern: B(1) I(2) R(3) D(4) S(5)? Then: position 2 is I? Should be R? Conflict? So no? Because we have R fixed at position 2? And I at position 3? So ""BIRDS"" would not match? 

Similarly, other words? So *RIST pattern seems solid? 

Therefore, we guess ""WRIST"". 

But let me see feedback: we have T and S present? In ""WRIST"": T is at position 5? But we have never tried T at position 5? So we might get T(-) if the secret word is ""GRIST""? Because then T is in position 5? Which would be correct? 

Actually, if we guess ""WRIST"":
- If correct? Then all ✓.
- If not, then the secret word may be ""GRIST""?

But in our guess ""WRIST"", if the secret word is ""GRIST"":
- W at position 1: should be G? So it should get W(x) because not in the word? 
- Then R(✓), I(✓), S(✓), T(✓)? But position 4: S? Yes, but also position 5: T? Both correct? But W is not in the word? So:

Feedback: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓) 

Then we know the first letter is wrong? Then we can guess ""GRIST"" next? But we have tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""grist"" now? Or to not waste a try? 

But we can try a word that covers both? For example: ""GRIFT""? But that means fraud? But P is eliminated? No? GRIFT: G,R,I,F,T? None eliminated? But then pattern: G R I F T? Then the word is GRIST or WRIST? But GRIFT doesn't help? Because G and F? 

Actually, if we guess ""GRIFT"", then if the secret word is ""GRIST"":
- G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) F(x) T(✓) -> because T is at position 5? In GRIST, T is at 5? So correct? And F not in word? Then we know S must be present? But not placed? 

Similarly, for ""WRIST"": if we guess ""GRIFT"", it would be G vs W? So position 1: G vs W? So feedback would be x or ✓?

But we don't know? 

It's simpler to guess one of them? 

I choose to guess ""WRIST"" because it's more common? 

So next guess: WRIST.

In the format: <guess>wrist</guess>

But step-by-step?
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
  This tells us:  
  - R is in the secret word and in position 2 (correct).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: trips → T(-), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)**  
  This tells us:  
  - R is still confirmed in position 2 (correct).  
  - I is in the secret word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1 (misplaced).  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5 (misplaced).  
  - P is not in the word.  

### Combined Information:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[ ? ] R I [ ? ] [ ? ]`.
- Positions:  
  - **Position 2**: R (fixed)  
  - **Position 3**: I (fixed)  
- Confirmed present letters: T and S (both must appear in the word).  
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, P (cannot be in the word).  
- Constraints for T and S:  
  - T cannot be in position 1 (from ""trips"" feedback).  
  - S cannot be in position 5 (from ""trips"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, T must be in position 4 or 5, and S must be in position 1 or 4.  

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- The secret word has the form `[ letter1 ] R I [ letter4 ] [ letter5 ]`.  
- Given the constraints:  
  - If S is in position 1, T must be in position 4 or 5, and `letter5`/`letter4` would be a new letter (not C, A, N, E, P).  
  - If S is in position 4, T must be in position 5 (since T cannot be in position 1, and position 2/3 are fixed), and `letter1` would be a new letter (not C, A, N, E, P).  
- Words ending in ""-RIST"" (like `?RIST`) fit the pattern well because:  
  - Position 4 must be S (S in position 4).  
  - Position 5 must be T (T in position 5).  
  - Position 1 can be tested with unused common letters (e.g., W, G, B).  
- With T and S confirmed present and positions 2–3 fixed, common words matching `?RIST` include **WRIST** and **GRIST**.  
- We prioritize **WRIST** for the next guess because:  
  - ""W"" is a common starting letter not eliminated yet.  
  - It tests S in position 4 and T in position 5, satisfying the previous constraints.  
  - If incorrect, the feedback (especially on W) will help confirm between WRIST/GRIST or other possibilities.  
- This guess avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, P) and adheres to ""T must not be in position 1"" and ""S must not be in position 5"".  

<guess>wrist</guess>",wrist,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Second guess: ""trips"" -> T(-), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (still ✓).
- I is now confirmed in the secret word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is in the word but not in the first position; it must be in another position.
- S is in the word but not in the fifth position; it must be elsewhere.
- P is not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know C, A, N, E, P are eliminated (absent).

So, the secret word must have:
- Second letter R
- Third letter I
- And contain T and S, but not in the positions guessed.

Moreover, we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, P.

Now, let's reconstruct what we know about the secret word:

Position 1: ? 
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

And the word has T and S in positions other than:
- T was in position 1 in our guess, but it's misplaced, so T cannot be in position 1, and must be in position 4 or 5? Or possibly position 4? Since position 5 was S in the guess.

We also know S is present but not in position 5. Since the word has positions 1,4,5 open for T and S, but position 1 is open, and S was tried in position 5 and was wrong.

Therefore, T must be in position 4 or 5? Or position 1? But T cannot be in position 1 because that's where we had it and feedback says wrong position (-). So T is not in position 1.

S cannot be in position 5? So S must be in position 1 or 4.

But the word has five positions: 
1: cannot be T, and must be either S or an unknown letter? But we have T and S to place, and only positions 1,4,5 left? Positions 2 and 3 are fixed.

Positions:
1: must be not T and also not S? Not necessarily: S could be in position 1.

Wait, let me list:

Fixed: 
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I

Open: positions 1, 4, 5.

We know T is in the word but not in position 1 (from feedback on ""trips"": T in position 1 got (-)).

Similarly, S is in the word but not in position 5 (from feedback: S in position 5 got (-)).

Therefore, T must be in position 4 or 5? And S must be in position 1 or 4? But we have only three positions: 1,4,5.

But note: the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we don't have duplication.

Also, we have T and S both to place. Therefore:

- Position 1: could be S or another letter?
- Position 4: could be T or S?
- Position 5: could be T? but S cannot be there.

Actually, we must assign T to either position 4 or 5? And S to position 1 or 4? But position 4 cannot be both T and S? So they must be in different positions.

Therefore, possible positions:

- For S: only positions 1 and 4 available? Because it cannot be in 5? And positions 2 and 3 are fixed? Yes.

Similarly, T can only be in positions 4 and 5? Because not 1? And positions 2 and 3 are fixed? Yes.

But position 4 is shared, so the possibilities are:

Either:
- T in position 4 and S in position 1? That might work.
Or:
- T in position 5 and S in position 4? That would work too.
Or:
- T in position 4 and S in position 4? Not possible, so crossed out.

But if T is in position - what about S? Two possibilities:

Scenario 1:
- Position 1: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: ? 

But we have an additional letter? No, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have to fill position 5 with a letter that hasn't appeared? Because we only know T and S are present, but there are three positions? Wait no: we know the word has T and S, and also the fixed R and I, and then there must be one more letter? Because five letters total.

We know: R, I, T, S -> that's four distinct letters? Then position 1,4,5 must have three letters: S, T, and one other letter? But wait: the secret word might have duplicated letters? However, from the feedback, we didn't see any duplication clues? But we haven't tested duplicates? So it could be that T and S are the same? But T and S are different? So in secret word: we have R, I, T, S and one more letter? Or duplicates.

But we have no information about duplicates? But T and S are distinct? So likely, the word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily? We must be cautious.

However, from our guesses: ""crane"" had five distinct and ""trips"" had five distinct? So we assume distinct? But actually, feedback might show duplicates? We haven't seen.

But for now, let's assume the secret word has no duplicates? Because we haven't found any? And the feedback symbols: if a letter appears twice? The rules handle it by marking only the occurrence? But we haven't seen that? So we'll proceed with distinct letters.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Letters: R, I, T, S, and one more letter? Say X.

And X must be in one of the positions: 1? But we have position 1 to fill? Alternatively, we know that positions:

1: ?
2: R
3: I
4: ?
5: ?

And ? must include T and S and one extra letter. But we know T and S are in the word? The extra letter is the fifth letter.

But we also have eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, P are absent.

Now, from the above, we know:
- Position 1: cannot be T (from feedback of ""trips"": T was in pos1 -> not correct)
- Position 1: can be S? Or the extra letter?
- Similarly, position 5: cannot be S? But we don't say it has to be T? Position 5 could be T or the extra letter.

But we also must place T and S: T must be in position 4 or 5? Because T cannot be in 1, and positions 2 and 3 are filled? Similarly, S cannot be in position 5? So S must be in 1 or 4? And T must be in 4 or 5? So:

If S is in position 1:
   - Then T must be in 4 or 5?
   - Then position 4 and 5: one with T and the other with an extra letter? Or T in 4 and extra in 5? Or T in 5 and extra in 4? But we have two positions: 4 and 5, and two things: T and an extra letter? Because if S is in 1, then positions 4 and 5: T and the extra letter.

Similarly, if S is in position 4:
   - Then position 1 must be the extra letter? Since S is in 4.
   - Then T must be in position 5? Because position 4 is taken by S? And T cannot be in position 1? So T must be in 5.

Thus, we have two possible scenarios:

Scenario A:
- Position 1: S
- Position 4: T or the extra letter?
- Position 5: the other? But wait, we have to assign T to one of them? So:
   Option A1: 
      Pos1: S
      Pos4: T
      Pos5: extra letter? Not necessarily? Because we don't know if T must be in that? Actually, yes: T must be in the word? So in positions 4 or 5? So:
      Either:
        A1a: Position 4: T and Position 5: ?
        A1b: Position 4: ? and Position 5: T

But wait: we have the same? Actually, we combine:

If position 1 is S, then:
   - Position 4: could be T or not? 
   - And Position 5: could be T or not? But T must be in the word? One of the positions 4 or 5 must be T? And the other is extra.

Similarly, Scenario B: position 1: not S? Then S must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in position 5? Then:
- Position 1: extra letter?
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T? Because we have to put T in position 5? Since position 1 cannot have T? Position 4 has S? So T must be in position 5? Then extra letter is in position 1.

Therefore, the secret word can be:

Case 1: S in position 1, then:
   - The word: S R I _ _
   - With T in position 4 or 5?
   - And an extra letter? Y? So either:
        Word: S R I T Y (if Y in position 5 and T in 4) -> ""SRITY""? Not a word? Or S R I Y T -> ""SRIYT""? Not a word? We need real words.

Case 2: S in position 4, then:
   - The word: ? R I S T? Because position 5 must be T? 
   - So: _ R I S T

And the first letter is the extra letter? Say: BRISK? WRIT? But wait: possibilities.

And note: we know the word must not contain: C, A, N, E, P.

Also, from the first guess, we tried ""crane"" and only R was correct? So other letters are out? Including A? So BRISK might be candidate.

Similarly, TRIPS was our guess? Which has T, R, I, P, S? But the secret word must not have P? Because P was eliminated? From ""trips"" feedback: P(x) -> not in the word? And P is eliminated.

Therefore, P is out? So we avoid P? So the extra letter must be something else? And not in the eliminated list.

What words are possible?

First possibility: _ R I S T? That is, words of the form x R I S T? Where x is a letter not eliminated? Not C,A,N,E,P.

Possible words: WRIST, GRIST? Or BRIST? But ""BRIST"" is not common? Or FRIST? Not words? But ""WRIST"" is a word: W R I S T.

Similarly, ""GRIST"" is a word: G R I S T.

But note: in this case, position 1 is W or G? And the word ends with S T? But S is in position 4.

Second possibility: S in position 1? So words: S R I _ _

Then T must be in position 4 or 5? 

For position 5: if T is there, word: S R I ? T? So SRI?T? And ? is a letter? Which must be not C,A,E,N,P? Also, must be real word? Like ""SPRIT""? Not valid? Or ""SKIRT"": but that would be S K I R T? But then R in position 4? But position 2 is R? Conflict? ""SKIRT"" -> positions: S K I R T? Then R is in position 4? But we have R in position 2? No? Actually, ""SKIRT"" would have S(1), K(2), I(3), R(4), T(5)? But we know position 3 must be I? But in ""SKIRT"", position 3 is I? And position 2 is K? But we have R? No: position 2 must be R? So ""SKIRT"" has R in position 4? That's inconsistent.

Therefore, the only possibility might be words ending in ""ST"" but with R and I in positions 2 and 3? Actually, if S is in position 1? And T in position 5? Then the word: S R I ? T? And position 4 must be the extra letter? 

Possible words: ""WRIT"" is not 5-letters? ""SPRIT""? Not common? ""SHIRT"" -> S H I R T? But then R is in position 4? But we require position 2 to be R? So ""SHIRT"": S(1) H(2) I(3) R(4) T(5) -> position 2 is H? Not R? That's not matching.

Therefore, words of the form S R I ? T? How about ""STR?T""? Wait, that would be S T... but T cannot be in position 2? And we fixed position 2 as R? So no S R I ? T word comes to mind.

Common words matching pattern: I think the most common is ""SPRIT""? Not English? ""SKIET""? Not word? ""SHIST""? Not common? 

Therefore, likely the secret word is of the form ? R I S T

We can list possible words ending with ""RIST"" and having R in position 2 and I in position 3? And 5-letter? So: A R I S T? But A is eliminated? BRIST? Not common? CRIST? C is eliminated? DRIST? Not word? ERIST? E eliminated? FRIST? Not common? GRIST? Yes, meaning grain. HRIST? Not word? WRIST? Yes? TRIST? But T is a letter? But then at position 5? TRIST: T R I S T? Then pattern: T at position 1? But wait, T cannot be in position 1? Because we tried T in position 1 and it was misplaced? Meaning T is not in position 1? So TRIST would have T in position 1? So conflict? Therefore, TRIST is invalid? Because T at 1 is prohibited? So that leaves us with:

GRIST? G in position 1? And R,I,S,T as above? Or WRIST? W in position 1? R,I,S,T.

Also, check BRIST? B in position 1? Not a common word? Or FRIST? F at position 1? Not common? Possibly valid? But let's see common ones: GRIST and WRIST? 

But GRIST and WRIST? Both valid? And the pattern: G/R/I/S/T or W/R/I/S/T? 

Also, DRIST? Not found? So likely GRIST or WRIST? 

But we also have the possibility with T in position 4? And S in position 1? I could not find any words? So let me double-check: SRI_T? Like ""Sri"" followed by something? But that's proper? Not common English words.

Other patterns: maybe the extra letter is repeated? But we have distinct letters? So unknown?

But perhaps ""STAIR"": S T A I R? But has A (eliminated) and position 3 must be I? But ""STAIR"": S(1) T(2) A(3) I(4) R(5) -> that has positions: 2:T (should be R) and 3:A (should be I)? Doesn't match? 

Therefore, the best candidates? Also, we have forgotten that in the first scenario, with S in position 1? And T in position 4? For example: S R I T Y? Not a word? Or S R I B T? No? Not likely.

Another candidate: maybe the word ""BIRTH""? But B I R T H? Then positions: 1:B, 2:I? But we have position 2 fixed as R? So conflict? The secret word has position 2 as R? So ""birth"" would have I at 2? Not matching.

Therefore, let's focus on _RIST.

Possible letters for first position: not C,A,N,E,P? And we also have eliminated T? From the feedback? T is present! So cannot be eliminated? T is in the word? So the first letter cannot be T? Because we know T cannot be in position 1? But _RIST: first letter is different? Then the word must have T? In position 5? So we have:

The word: ? R I S T? with T as the fifth letter? Therefore, the first letter must be a letter that exists? And pattern *RIST?

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But after removing eliminated ones: C,A,N,E,P.

Common possibilities: B, D, F, G, H, ... etc.

Words: WRIST (yes), GRIST (yes), FRIST (rare? Frist is a surname?), but let's see:

We have two main candidates: ""WRIST"" and ""GRIST"". 

Also, are there others? Such as ""HRIST""? Not common? ""KRIST""? K is for names? Not common English? 

So we have ""WRIST"" and ""GRIST""? Both valid.

Now, we also have S in the word? Position 4: which is S? So yes, both have S in position 4? And T in position 5? And R in 2? I in 3? Perfect.

So between ""GRIST"" and ""WRIST""? We don't know? So we need to disambiguate? 

What other letters can we test? We haven't tried G and W? So in our next guess, we can choose a word that helps distinguish? And also must avoid eliminated letters.

But we have limited tries? So we might guess one of them? Let me see:

But note: we have not used the letter O? U? L? Etc? Or we can pick one?

Alternatively, we can form a word that has both possibilities? But we don't need? We don't know? So let me see.

But time? We can guess ""WRIST"" or ""GRIST""? 

Wait, let me see feedback: also consider if the secret word has W or G? We don't know.

So for maximum information? We might try a word that covers both? But it's hard? Or simply guess one? 

We have 6 tries? This is our third guess? So we can afford.

But let me think: is there a word that starts with W? Or G? Or contains both? But we need to maintain known letters? 

Known: position 2: R, position 3: I? And we need to fill positions 1 and 4 and 5? But on different? No? We think it's *RIST.

So to test: we can try ""GRIST"" or ""WRIST"". 

But note: we know S and T are present? So we don't need to worry?

But another option: we can try a word that tests both? For example, guess ""GROWS""? But that doesn't have R in position 2? And I? 

Alternatively, guess ""GRIPS""? But P is eliminated? Not allowed? P is out.

Therefore, we have to form a word with remaining letters? 

But for guessing: we can try ""grist"" or ""wrist""? 

Let me pick ""GRIST"". Then:
- If correct, we win? If not, we'll know? Then next guess?

Similarly for ""WRIST"".

Alternatively, to be safe: we can guess a word that uses letters we haven't tried? But we know the word must be *RIST? So it's limited? 

But let me search: any other possibilities? What about ""BRIOS""? Not *RIST? ""SHRI""? Not 5 letters? 

I think ""GRIST"" and ""WRIST"" are the only common ones? That end with IST? With R and I fixed.

Also, we have ""TRIST"" but T in position 1? Not allowed? Also removed.

So we'll choose one? Say ""GRIST""? Because ""wrist"" is more common? 

But in terms of letter frequency? W is less common than G? Or vice versa? 

No: let's go with ""WRIST"" as more common? Or ""GRIST"" is less common? So ""WRIST"" might be likely? 

But we must guess.

I think we can guess ""WRIST"" for the next guess? But let's verify: 

Our next guess must not include eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,A,N,E,P? ""WRIST"" has W,R,I,S,T -> no eliminated? Ok.

Similarly, ""GRIST"" has G,R,I,S,T -> same? 

So either is fine? We choose ""WRIST"".

But wait: what if the secret word is ""BIRDS""? But in ""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S? Then positions: position 2: I? But we have R? And position 3: R? So pattern: B(1) I(2) R(3) D(4) S(5)? Then: position 2 is I? Should be R? Conflict? So no? Because we have R fixed at position 2? And I at position 3? So ""BIRDS"" would not match? 

Similarly, other words? So *RIST pattern seems solid? 

Therefore, we guess ""WRIST"". 

But let me see feedback: we have T and S present? In ""WRIST"": T is at position 5? But we have never tried T at position 5? So we might get T(-) if the secret word is ""GRIST""? Because then T is in position 5? Which would be correct? 

Actually, if we guess ""WRIST"":
- If correct? Then all ✓.
- If not, then the secret word may be ""GRIST""?

But in our guess ""WRIST"", if the secret word is ""GRIST"":
- W at position 1: should be G? So it should get W(x) because not in the word? 
- Then R(✓), I(✓), S(✓), T(✓)? But position 4: S? Yes, but also position 5: T? Both correct? But W is not in the word? So:

Feedback: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓) 

Then we know the first letter is wrong? Then we can guess ""GRIST"" next? But we have tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""grist"" now? Or to not waste a try? 

But we can try a word that covers both? For example: ""GRIFT""? But that means fraud? But P is eliminated? No? GRIFT: G,R,I,F,T? None eliminated? But then pattern: G R I F T? Then the word is GRIST or WRIST? But GRIFT doesn't help? Because G and F? 

Actually, if we guess ""GRIFT"", then if the secret word is ""GRIST"":
- G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) F(x) T(✓) -> because T is at position 5? In GRIST, T is at 5? So correct? And F not in word? Then we know S must be present? But not placed? 

Similarly, for ""WRIST"": if we guess ""GRIFT"", it would be G vs W? So position 1: G vs W? So feedback would be x or ✓?

But we don't know? 

It's simpler to guess one of them? 

I choose to guess ""WRIST"" because it's more common? 

So next guess: WRIST.

But step-by-step?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
  This tells us:  
  - R is in the secret word and in position 2 (correct).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: trips → T(-), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)**  
  This tells us:  
  - R is still confirmed in position 2 (correct).  
  - I is in the secret word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1 (misplaced).  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5 (misplaced).  
  - P is not in the word.  

### Combined Information:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[ ? ] R I [ ? ] [ ? ]`.
- Positions:  
  - **Position 2**: R (fixed)  
  - **Position 3**: I (fixed)  
- Confirmed present letters: T and S (both must appear in the word).  
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, P (cannot be in the word).  
- Constraints for T and S:  
  - T cannot be in position 1 (from ""trips"" feedback).  
  - S cannot be in position 5 (from ""trips"" feedback).  
  - Therefore, T must be in position 4 or 5, and S must be in position 1 or 4.  

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- The secret word has the form `[ letter1 ] R I [ letter4 ] [ letter5 ]`.  
- Given the constraints:  
  - If S is in position 1, T must be in position 4 or 5, and `letter5`/`letter4` would be a new letter (not C, A, N, E, P).  
  - If S is in position 4, T must be in position 5 (since T cannot be in position 1, and position 2/3 are fixed), and `letter1` would be a new letter (not C, A, N, E, P).  
- Words ending in ""-RIST"" (like `?RIST`) fit the pattern well because:  
  - Position 4 must be S (S in position 4).  
  - Position 5 must be T (T in position 5).  
  - Position 1 can be tested with unused common letters (e.g., W, G, B).  
- With T and S confirmed present and positions 2–3 fixed, common words matching `?RIST` include **WRIST** and **GRIST**.  
- We prioritize **WRIST** for the next guess because:  
  - ""W"" is a common starting letter not eliminated yet.  
  - It tests S in position 4 and T in position 5, satisfying the previous constraints.  
  - If incorrect, the feedback (especially on W) will help confirm between WRIST/GRIST or other possibilities.  
- This guess avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, P) and adheres to ""T must not be in position 1"" and ""S must not be in position 5"".",Guess 3: wrist -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
