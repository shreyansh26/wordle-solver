We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(✓), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all (so we avoid using R again).
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3? Wait, let's check positions).
   Recall: ""crane"" is C R A N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E.
   So A is at position 3 and is correct? But the feedback says A(✓) meaning it's in the correct position? 
   Actually, in the example above: for ""BRAVE"" against ""BRISK"", the A was in the word but not in the correct position? 
   Wait, looking back: 
   Secret: BRISK
   Guess: BRAVE -> B(✓) R(✓) A(x) ... so A is marked as (x) meaning not in the word? 
   But in the feedback example: 
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x) 
   The symbols are:
      ✓ for correct and in right position
      - for present but in wrong position
      x for not present

 Therefore, for our feedback on ""crane"":
   C(✓) -> C is in the word and at position 1.
   R(x) -> R is not in the word at all.
   A(✓) -> A is in the word and at position 3 (because that's where it is in ""crane"").
   N(x) -> N is not in the word at all.
   E(x) -> E is not in the word at all.

 So we know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: A
   The letters R, N, E are not in the word.

 Therefore, the word we are looking for has the form: C _ A _ _

 We must avoid the letters R, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have C at the start, A at position 3, and avoid R,N,E.

 Common letters that can be in the other positions: we need to fill positions 2,4,5.

 Possible words: 
   Possible candidates: 
     CHALK: C H A L K -> H is new, L and K are new. Avoided R,N,E.
     CHAMP: C H A M P -> avoids R,N,E? M and P are new.
     CHASE: but E is not allowed (E is excluded).
     CHASM: has S and M -> but E is avoided? CHASM: C H A S M -> all good.

 But note: We must use only letters that haven't been excluded and fit.

 However, we don't know if H, L, K, M, P, S, etc. are present. We need to maximize information.

 Since we have two positions to fill (positions 2,4,5) and we have only one guess so far, we might choose a word that uses new letters to test.

 Also note: We have 6 tries, so we can afford to test letters.

 Let's try to include common letters that haven't been tested yet: such as S, T, L, P, etc.

 Since positions 1 and 3 are fixed (C and A), we can try to vary positions 2,4,5.

 Let me pick ""chasm"": C H A S M
 However, note H, S, and M are new. But we don't know if any of these are present.

 But wait: we have three fixed positions? No: only two positions are fixed: 1 and 3. Position 3 is A? Actually, position 3 is the letter A? Yes.

 However, we must be cautious: what if A appears again? The feedback A(✓) tells us A is at position 3, but what if the word has another A? 
 The feedback doesn't rule that out. But typically, the feedback marks each letter only once? Not exactly: for repeated letters it can be tricky.

 But the rules? In standard Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it. However, our feedback symbols match the standard.

 Since the word has exactly one A? Not necessarily. But from the feedback, we only know that at least one A exists and at position 3. And the other positions might have A? 

 But in our case, the letter A was at position 3 and got a ✓, so that A is accounted for. If there was another A, it would have been marked with a dash if present elsewhere? 

 However, our feedback for ""crane"": only one A and it got a ✓. So if the word has two A's, then if we guess an A in a different position and it's present elsewhere, it would be marked with a dash.

 Since we have no information about other A's, we shouldn't rule it out? But in our next guess, we don't have to reuse A unless we want to test for duplicates? 

 But we have two constraints:
   Position 1 must be C.
   Position 3 must be A.

 And we cannot use R, N, E.

 Let's consider: words that start with C, have A at position 3.

 Possible words: 
   C* A *: where the * are filled with letters excluding R,N,E.

 Common letters for the second position: H, L, M, T, B, D, F, G, K, P, S, V, W, Y, Z? 
 For the fourth and fifth positions: many options.

 To gather maximum information, let's choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: 
   We haven't tried: T, L, S, O, H, I, D, P, U, Y, etc.

 But note: we have two fixed letters so we can only vary three letters. 

 Since position 2,4,5 are free, we can pick letters that are frequent.

 Also, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent (R,N,E).

 Consider ""champ"": C H A M P -> letters: H, M, P (all new).
 Or ""clasp"": C L A S P -> L, S, P new.

 But note: we must be careful: if the word has an H, we don't know if it's in the right position? 

 We have position 2 to fill: so if we pick ""champ"", then:
   Position 2: H -> if H is in the word but not at position 2, it would be marked with a dash? 
   Similarly, M at position 4 and P at position 5.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that tests letters that can go in multiple positions? 

 Since we are constrained to having C in position 1 and A in position 3, we choose:

 Guess: ""champ"" 

 But let me think: is there a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""catch"": but that ends with H? Also C A T? Wait: catch: C A T C H? No: 
   ""catch"" is C-A-T-C-H? Wait, spelling: C A T C H? Actually: 
   Position: 1:C, 2:A? Then position 3: T? Not A. 
 We need A at position 3: so ""catch"" isn't valid because A is at position 2.

 What about ""cabal""? But A is at position 2 and 4? But we need position 3 to be A? 
   ""cabal"": C A B A L -> position 3 is B? Not A. 

 How about ""loans""? Not starting with C.

 Another common word: ""clamp"": C L A M P -> avoids R,N,E? L, M, P are new.

 But we can also consider ""plate"", but it doesn't start with C.

 We are fixed to starting with C and having A in position 3.

 So let me list a few: 
   clash -> C L A S H 
   class -> but has two S's? Avoid E,N,R? 
   clasp -> C L A S P 
   clean -> but E is excluded? Clean has E and N -> excluded.

 We want to avoid E and N because we know they are not in the word.

 So ""clasp"", ""clash"", ""clamp"", ""champ"", ""chasm"", ""chaff"" (but chaff has F twice?).

 Which one tests more possible letters? 

 I think ""champ"" is a good choice: uses H, M, P.

 Alternatively, ""clasp"" uses L, S, P.

 Since we don't have much information, either is good.

 Let me pick ""champ"".

<guess>champ</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":  
- C is **correct** in position 1  
- A is **correct** in position 3  
- R, N, and E are **absent** from the secret word  

The secret word must follow the pattern: `C _ A _ _` (with positions 2, 4, and 5 unknown), and exclude R, N, and E.  

For this guess, I chose **CHAMP** because:  
- It preserves the known C (position 1) and A (position 3)  
- It tests new common consonants (H, M, P) not previously ruled out  
- Avoids excluded letters (R, N, E)  

<guess>champ</guess>",champ,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(✓), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).

 - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3? Wait, let's check positions).
   Recall: ""crane"" is C R A N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E.
   So A is at position 3 and is correct? But the feedback says A(✓) meaning it's in the correct position? 
   Actually, in the example above: for ""BRAVE"" against ""BRISK"", the A was in the word but not in the correct position? 
   Wait, looking back: 
   Secret: BRISK
   Guess: BRAVE -> B(✓) R(✓) A(x) ... so A is marked as (x) meaning not in the word? 
   But in the feedback example: 
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x) 
   The symbols are:
      ✓ for correct and in right position
      - for present but in wrong position
      x for not present

 Therefore, for our feedback on ""crane"":
   C(✓) -> C is in the word and at position 1.
   R(x) -> R is not in the word at all.
   A(✓) -> A is in the word and at position 3 (because that's where it is in ""crane"").
   N(x) -> N is not in the word at all.
   E(x) -> E is not in the word at all.

 So we know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: A
   The letters R, N, E are not in the word.

 Therefore, the word we are looking for has the form: C _ A _ _

 We must avoid the letters R, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have C at the start, A at position 3, and avoid R,N,E.

 Common letters that can be in the other positions: we need to fill positions 2,4,5.

 Possible words:

     CHASM: has S and M -> but E is avoided? CHASM: C H A S M -> all good.

 But note: We must use only letters that haven't been excluded and fit.

 However, we don't know if H, L, K, M, P, S, etc. are present. We need to maximize information.

   ""cabal"": C A B A L -> position 3 is B? Not A. 

 How about ""loans""? Not starting with C.

 However, note H, S, and M are new. But we don't know if any of these are present.

 But wait: we have three fixed positions? No: only two positions are fixed: 1 and 3. Position 3 is A? Actually, position 3 is the letter A? Yes.

 However, we must be cautious: what if A appears again? The feedback A(✓) tells us A is at position 3, but what if the word has another A? 
 The feedback doesn't rule that out. But typically, the feedback marks each letter only once? Not exactly: for repeated letters it can be tricky.

 But the rules? In standard Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it. However, our feedback symbols match the standard.

 Since the word has exactly one A? Not necessarily. But from the feedback, we only know that at least one A exists and at position 3. And the other positions might have A? 

 But in our case, the letter A was at position 3 and got a ✓, so that A is accounted for. If there was another A, it would have been marked with a dash if present elsewhere? 

 However, our feedback for ""crane"": only one A and it got a ✓. So if the word has two A's, then if we guess an A in a different position and it's present elsewhere, it would be marked with a dash.

 Since we have no information about other A's, we shouldn't rule it out? But in our next guess, we don't have to reuse A unless we want to test for duplicates? 

 But we have two constraints:
   Position 1 must be C.
   Position 3 must be A.

 And we cannot use R, N, E.

 Let's consider: words that start with C, have A at position 3.

 Possible words: 
   C* A *: where the * are filled with letters excluding R,N,E.

 Common letters for the second position: H, L, M, T, B, D, F, G, K, P, S, V, W, Y, Z? 
 For the fourth and fifth positions: many options.

 To gather maximum information, let's choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: 
   We haven't tried: T, L, S, O, H, I, D, P, U, Y, etc.

 But note: we have two fixed letters so we can only vary three letters. 

 Since position 2,4,5 are free, we can pick letters that are frequent.

 Also, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent (R,N,E).

 Consider ""champ"": C H A M P -> letters: H, M, P (all new).
 Or ""clasp"": C L A S P -> L, S, P new.

 But note: we must be careful: if the word has an H, we don't know if it's in the right position? 

 We have position 2 to fill: so if we pick ""champ"", then:
   Position 2: H -> if H is in the word but not at position 2, it would be marked with a dash? 
   Similarly, M at position 4 and P at position 5.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that tests letters that can go in multiple positions? 

 Since we are constrained to having C in position 1 and A in position 3, we choose:

 Guess: ""champ"" 

 But let me think: is there a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""catch"": but that ends with H? Also C A T? Wait: catch: C A T C H? No: 
   ""catch"" is C-A-T-C-H? Wait, spelling: C A T C H? Actually: 
   Position: 1:C, 2:A? Then position 3: T? Not A. 
 We need A at position 3: so ""catch"" isn't valid because A is at position 2.

 What about ""cabal""? But A is at position 2 and 4? But we need position 3 to be A? 
   ""cabal"": C A B A L -> position 3 is B? Not A. 

 How about ""loans""? Not starting with C.

 Another common word: ""clamp"": C L A M P -> avoids R,N,E? L, M, P are new.

 But we can also consider ""plate"", but it doesn't start with C.

 We are fixed to starting with C and having A in position 3.

 So let me list a few: 
   clash -> C L A S H 
   class -> but has two S's? Avoid E,N,R? 
   clasp -> C L A S P 
   clean -> but E is excluded? Clean has E and N -> excluded.

 We want to avoid E and N because we know they are not in the word.

 So ""clasp"", ""clash"", ""clamp"", ""champ"", ""chasm"", ""chaff"" (but chaff has F twice?).

 Which one tests more possible letters? 

 I think ""champ"" is a good choice: uses H, M, P.

 Alternatively, ""clasp"" uses L, S, P.

 Since we don't have much information, either is good.

 Let me pick ""champ"".

<guess>champ</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":  
- C is **correct** in position 1  
- A is **correct** in position 3  
- R, N, and E are **absent** from the secret word  

The secret word must follow the pattern: `C _ A _ _` (with positions 2, 4, and 5 unknown), and exclude R, N, and E.  

For this guess, I chose **CHAMP** because:  
- It preserves the known C (position 1) and A (position 3)  
- It tests new common consonants (H, M, P) not previously ruled out  
- Avoids excluded letters (R, N, E)

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- A is correct and in position 3.
- R, N, E are absent from the word.

So the word has the form: C _ A _ _

And we know R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""champ"" -> C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).
- H is correct and in position 2 (because in ""champ"", H is at position 2 and it's marked correct).
- A is correct and in position 3 (as before).
- M and P are absent from the word.

So now we know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: A
- M and P are absent.

Also, from the first guess, we know R, N, E are absent.

Therefore, the word is: C H A _ _

We need to fill the last two positions (4 and 5) with letters that are not R, N, E, M, P.

We also know the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for positions 4 and 5: any letter except C, H, A (but note: C, H, A are already used, but they might be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. The feedback for ""crane"" and ""champ"" didn't show any duplicate letters, but that doesn't mean the word can't have duplicates. However, since we have three fixed letters and two positions left, and we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, it's possible the word has no duplicates. But we can't be sure. We should consider the possibility of duplicates, but for now, let's assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

But note: in ""champ"", we used H and A again? Actually, in ""champ"", we have C, H, A, M, P. The C and A were already known, and we confirmed H. The M and P are new and are absent.

Now, the word is C H A _ _ and we must avoid R, N, E, M, P.

Common letters that can appear in the last two positions: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have two positions to fill, so we can try a word that uses two new letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2 out of 6). We are in a good position because we have three letters fixed.

We can try to guess the word directly if we can think of common words that fit.

What are common words that start with ""CHA"" and are 5 letters?

Examples:
- CHAOS: but O and S are new. Also, we haven't ruled out O or S.
- CHARD: but D is new, but R is ruled out? R is absent, so CHARD has R -> invalid.
- CHASE: but E is ruled out -> invalid.
- CHAFE: E is ruled out -> invalid.
- CHALK: K is new, L is new -> possible.
- CHAMP: we already tried, and M and P are absent.
- CHANT: N is absent -> invalid.
- CHART: R is absent -> invalid.
- CHASM: M is absent -> invalid.
- CHEAP: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHEAT: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHECK: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHEEK: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHEER: E and R absent -> invalid.
- CHILD: I, L, D are new -> possible.
- CHILL: I, L are new -> but double L? 
- CHIME: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHINA: N is absent -> invalid.
- CHIVE: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHOCK: O, K are new -> possible.
- CHOIR: O, I, R -> R is absent -> invalid.
- CHOKE: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHORD: R is absent -> invalid.
- CHORE: R and E absent -> invalid.
- CHOSE: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHUCK: U, K are new -> possible.
- CHUFF: U, F are new -> possible.
- CHUGS: U, G, S -> possible.
- CHUMP: M and P absent -> invalid.
- CHUNK: N is absent -> invalid.
- CHURL: R is absent -> invalid.
- CHURN: R and N absent -> invalid.

So possible words from above: CHALK, CHILD, CHOCK, CHUCK, CHUFF, CHUGS, etc.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, CHILL, but that has two L's. However, in CHILL, the positions would be: C H I L L. But we have position 4 and 5 to fill. If we try CHILL, then position 4 is L and position 5 is L? But that's a duplicate.

But note: we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The secret word might have duplicates.

However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, so it's less likely? But we can't rule out.

But to be safe, let's consider both.

We have two positions: 4 and 5. We need to choose two letters that are not in the excluded set.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters to get more information.

But we are very close: we have three letters fixed and only two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word in this turn.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: R, N, E, M, P

So the word must be: C H A ? ? 

Possible combinations for the last two letters:

We can consider common endings:

- CHA_ _ : 

Possible words:
- CHAIS (but S is new, but is it a word? CHAIS is not common, and might not be valid. Wordle uses common words.)
- CHAOS: C H A O S -> O and S are new. Valid word.
- CHATS: but T and S are new, but A is at position 3? CHATS: C H A T S -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S. T and S are not excluded. Valid.
- CHAWS: W and S -> valid? CHAWS is a word (to warm up, or a bird's mouth parts? but it's in dictionaries).
- CHAYS: Y and S -> might be a proper noun? Not common.
- CHAFT: F and T -> but F and T are new, but CHAFT is not a common word? (the horny part of a horse's hoof) - might not be in Wordle.
- CHALK: L and K -> common word.
- CHASM: but M is excluded -> invalid.
- CHILD: I, L, D -> but that's three letters? Wait, CHILD: C H I L D -> so position 4 is L, position 5 is D. So two letters: L and D. Valid.
- CHIRL: but R is excluded -> invalid.
- CHIRP: R and P excluded -> invalid.
- CHIVY: I, V, Y -> but that's three? CHIVY: C H I V Y -> positions 4:V, 5:Y. Valid? (to annoy persistently) - might be in Wordle.
- CHOCK: O, C, K -> but C is already at position 1? So if we use CHOCK, then position 4: O, position 5: K. But note: the word has two C's? The first C is fixed, and then at position 5? But in CHOCK, the last letter is K? CHOCK: C H O C K -> so positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:O? Wait, no: we need position 3 to be A. So CHOCK doesn't have A at position 3. It has O at position 3. So invalid for our pattern.

We must have A at position 3. So the word must be C H A ? ?

So the words that fit:
- CHAOS: C H A O S -> O at 4, S at 5.
- CHATS: C H A T S -> T at 4, S at 5.
- CHAWS: C H A W S -> W at 4, S at 5.
- CHAYS: C H A Y S -> Y at 4, S at 5. (but CHAYS might not be common)
- CHALK: C H A L K -> L at 4, K at 5.
- CHAMP: already tried and M and P absent.
- CHAFF: C H A F F -> F at 4 and 5? Duplicate F. Valid word? (to chaff is to tease, or the husk of grain). But we have F new.
- CHILD: C H I L D -> but wait, position 2 is H (fixed) and position 3 is A? In CHILD, position 3 is I, not A. So invalid.

CHILD doesn't have A at position 3. So we must have the pattern C H A ? ?

So the third letter must be A. So CHILD is not valid.

Similarly, CHUCK: C H U C K -> position 3 is U, not A -> invalid.

So the valid words are those that start with ""CHA"" and then two more letters.

Other possibilities:
- CHAAT: but double A? and T? But position 3 is A, then position 4 is A? That would be duplicate. And CHAAT is a food, might be in Wordle? But we have to avoid E, R, N, M, P. A is allowed again? But we don't know if duplicate A is present. However, in our first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3 and it was correct, but if there is another A, we don't know. But in ""champ"", we didn't have another A, so we didn't test it. So it's possible.

But let's list without worrying about duplicates for now.

Common words:
- CHAOS
- CHATS
- CHAWS
- CHAYS (less common)
- CHALK
- CHAFT (uncommon)
- CHAFE (but E is excluded) -> invalid.
- CHASE (E excluded) -> invalid.
- CHASM (M excluded) -> invalid.
- CHARD (R excluded) -> invalid.

Also:
- CHAIS: a type of chair? Uncommon.
- CHAPE: E excluded -> invalid.
- CHARE: E and R excluded -> invalid.
- CHARK: K is new? C H A R K -> R is excluded -> invalid.
- CHARR: R excluded -> invalid.
- CHAVE: E excluded -> invalid.
- CHAWK: W and K? C H A W K -> but is that a word? Not common.

So the most common ones are: CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHALK, CHAFF.

Now, we have to choose one to guess. We want to maximize information or guess the word.

But note: we have only two positions to fill, so if we guess one of these, we might get it right.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are common and might appear in other words, but since we are down to two positions, we can try to guess.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can afford to get more information? However, with two positions, there are limited possibilities.

How many possibilities? We have about 5-10 words? So we can try to guess one and if it's wrong, we get feedback and then we know.

But to be efficient, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess CHALK, we are testing L and K. If it's not the word, we get feedback on L and K.

Similarly, if we guess CHAOS, we test O and S.

But note: we are also testing the positions.

But since we are forced to use the pattern C H A ? ?, we are not testing other positions.

So let's just pick a common word: CHALK is a good candidate.

But we also have CHAOS and CHATS.

We can also consider that we haven't tested the letters: O, S, T, L, K, F, W, Y, etc.

If we guess CHALK, we test L and K.

If we guess CHAOS, we test O and S.

If we guess CHATS, we test T and S.

But note: S is common, so testing S might be good.

Also, if we guess CHAOS and it's not the word, we might get feedback that O is present but in wrong position? But in CHAOS, O is at position 4. If the word is CHATS, then O would be absent? 

But we are trying to cover the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.

For example, S appears in CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS. So if we can test S, that would be useful.

Similarly, if we test a word that has S in position 5, then if S is present and in position 5, we know the word ends with S. If S is present but not in position 5, then we know it's in position 4? But in our pattern, position 4 and 5 are both open.

But we don't have a word that has S in position 4? For example, CHAOS has S in position 5, CHATS has S in position 5, CHAWS has S in position 5, CHAYS has S in position 5. So all the words with S have it at the end? 

What about CHASM? But M is excluded.

So if we test a word that ends with S, we can check if the word ends with S.

Similarly, for other letters.

But we can also test a word that doesn't end with S to see if S is present at all? But we are constrained to the pattern.

We have to choose one of the possible words.

Let me count the possibilities:

1. CHAOS: ends with OS
2. CHATS: ends with TS
3. CHAWS: ends with WS
4. CHAYS: ends with YS
5. CHALK: ends with LK
6. CHAFF: ends with FF

And less common: CHAAT, etc.

We can try to use a word that covers more than one possibility? But we can't.

We can choose the most common word: CHALK is very common.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more frequent to increase the chance of being correct.

In English, the most common letters for the last two positions: S, T, L, etc.

But in our case, for the words:

- CHAOS: O and S
- CHATS: T and S
- CHAWS: W and S
- CHAYS: Y and S
- CHALK: L and K
- CHAFF: F and F

S is in four of them. So if we can confirm S, that would be good.

But how? We can guess a word that has S in position 5? Then if S is present and in position 5, then we know the word ends with S. If S is absent, then we know the word must be CHALK or CHAFF.

Similarly, if we guess CHAOS and S is present and in position 5, then the word ends with S. But we don't know about O.

But if we guess CHAOS and the word is CHATS, then we would get:
- C: correct
- H: correct
- A: correct
- O: absent (because CHATS has T at 4 and S at 5, so O is not in the word)
- S: present but in position 5? In CHAOS, S is at position 5, and in CHATS, S is also at position 5, so if the word is CHATS, then for CHAOS:
   - Position 1: C ✓
   - Position 2: H ✓
   - Position 3: A ✓
   - Position 4: O (absent, because CHATS has T, not O) -> so O would be marked absent (x)
   - Position 5: S (present and correct) -> ✓

But we would know that S is at position 5, and O is absent. Then we know the word is one of CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS (since CHAOS is eliminated because O is absent, and CHALK and CHAFF don't have S).

Then we can guess among those.

But if we guess CHALK and the word is CHAOS, we get:
- C ✓, H ✓, A ✓, L (absent? because CHAOS has O at 4, not L) -> x, K (absent? because CHAOS has S at 5, not K) -> x.

Then we know L and K are absent, so the word must be one with S at the end.

So both are informative.

But to minimize the worst case, we might choose a word that splits the possibilities.

Currently, we have about 6 possibilities. But let's list them again:

1. CHAOS
2. CHATS
3. CHAWS
4. CHAYS
5. CHALK
6. CHAFF

And possibly others, but these are the main ones.

If we guess CHAOS:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, and we get feedback:
   - If S is present and in position 5, then the word is one of CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS (because they end with S) and CHAOS is eliminated.
   - If S is absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF (since they don't have S).

But if S is present and in position 5, then we have three possibilities left: CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS.

Then we can guess, say, CHATS next. If it's not, then we have two left.

Similarly, if S is absent, then we have CHALK and CHAFF, and we can guess CHALK next.

So worst case, we take 3 more guesses? But we have 4 left, so it's okay.

But we can do better? We can choose a word that tests a letter that appears in multiple positions.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has a letter that is in the fourth position of some words and fifth in others? But in our pattern, the fourth and fifth positions are symmetric in terms of testing.

But note: we are forced to use the pattern C H A ? ?.

We cannot change the first three letters because they are fixed.

So we must choose one of the possible words.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But that might not be efficient because we have only two positions to fill.

For example, we could guess a word like ""CHAS?"" but we have to use valid letters.

But we are constrained to the pattern. We cannot change the first three letters.

So we must guess a word that starts with CHA.

Therefore, we have to choose from the candidates.

Let's pick CHAOS because it tests S (which is in many candidates) and O (which is only in CHAOS).

So if we guess CHAOS:

- If it's correct, we win.
- If not, and S is present and in position 5, then we know the word ends with S and is one of CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS.
- If S is absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF.

Then we can proceed.

Similarly, if we guess CHALK:

- If correct, win.
- If not, and L is absent and K is absent, then the word must end with S (one of CHAOS, CHATS, etc.) or CHAFF? But CHAFF has F, not L or K.

If we guess CHALK and it's not the word, and we get:
- C ✓, H ✓, A ✓, L (x), K (x)

Then we know that L and K are absent, so the word must be one that doesn't have L or K. So from our list: CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS, CHAFF.

But CHAFF has F, which we haven't tested. So we still have 5 possibilities? That's worse.

Whereas if we guess CHAOS and it's not the word, we might reduce to 3 or 2 possibilities.

Similarly, if we guess CHATS:

- If not correct, and we get feedback on T and S.

But S is common, so it might be present.

To minimize the maximum number of remaining possibilities, let's see:

If we guess CHAOS:
- Correct: 0 left
- S present and in position 5: then 3 left (CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS)
- S absent: then 2 left (CHALK, CHAFF)

Worst case: 3 left.

If we guess CHALK:
- Correct: 0
- If L and K absent: then 5 left (CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS, CHAFF) because we don't know about O, T, W, Y, F.
- If L is present but in wrong position? But in CHALK, L is at position 4. If the word is CHAFF, then L would be absent. Similarly, if the word is CHAOS, L is absent. So L and K will be absent for all other words? Because none of the other words have L or K? 

Let's check:
- CHAOS: no L, no K -> so L and K absent.
- CHATS: no L, no K -> absent.
- CHAWS: no L, no K -> absent.
- CHAYS: no L, no K -> absent.
- CHAFF: no L, no K -> absent.

So if we guess CHALK and it's not the word, we will always get L(x) and K(x). Then we know the word is one of the other 5: CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS, CHAFF.

That leaves 5 possibilities, which is worse than the 3 from guessing CHAOS.

Therefore, guessing CHAOS is better because it can reduce to at most 3 possibilities.

Similarly, if we guess CHATS:
- If not correct, and we get T and S feedback.
   - If S is present and in position 5, then the word is one of CHAOS, CHAWS, CHAYS (3 possibilities) because CHATS is eliminated.
   - If S is absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF (2 possibilities).

But S is present in CHAOS, CHAWS, CHAYS, and CHATS, so if we guess CHATS and it's not the word, S will be present and in position 5 (because all these words end with S) unless the word is CHALK or CHAFF, which don't have S.

So:
- If the word is CHAOS, CHAWS, or CHAYS, then for CHATS: S will be present and in position 5, and T will be absent (because CHAOS has O, not T; CHAWS has W, not T; CHAYS has Y, not T). So T will be absent.
- If the word is CHALK, then S and T are absent.
- If the word is CHAFF, then S and T are absent.

So if we guess CHATS:
- Correct: win.
- If S is present and in position 5 and T is absent, then the word is one of CHAOS, CHAWS, CHAYS (3 possibilities).
- If S and T are absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF (2 possibilities).

Worst case 3 possibilities.

Same as CHAOS.

But CHAOS has the advantage that O is only in CHAOS, so if O is present, then the word must be CHAOS? But we are guessing CHAOS, so if it's not correct, O might be absent.

In terms of worst case, both are 3.

But CHAOS is a very common word, so it might be more likely? But we don't know.

I think CHAOS is a good guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could guess ""CHASM"" but M is excluded, so it's invalid? We know M is absent, so we cannot use M.

Similarly, we cannot use R, N, E, M, P.

So we have to use only the allowed letters.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has duplicate letters to test for duplicates? For example, CHAFF. But if we guess CHAFF and it's not the word, we get feedback on F.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I think CHAOS is a reasonable guess.

So I'll go with CHAOS.

<guess>chaos</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word and in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.  
  Secret word pattern: `C _ A _ _` (excludes R, N, E).

- **Guess 2: CHAMP**  
  Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H is in the word and in position 2.  
  - M and P are absent from the word.  
  Updated secret word pattern: `C H A _ _` (excludes R, N, E, M, P).

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: H  
  - Position 3: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, M, P (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Unknown positions**: 4 and 5 (must be filled with letters not in the excluded set).  
- **Possible words**: Common English words fitting `C H A _ _` and excluding R, N, E, M, P include:  
  - `CHAOS` (O, S)  
  - `CHATS` (T, S)  
  - `CHALK` (L, K)  
  - `CHAFF` (F, F)  
  - `CHAWS` (W, S)  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test letters for positions 4 and 5 while maximizing information.  
- `CHAOS` is chosen because:  
  - It tests **O** (position 4) and **S** (position 5), two common letters not yet ruled out.  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, the feedback will:  
    - Confirm if **S** is present (appearing in 4/5 possible words).  
    - Reduce possibilities significantly (e.g., if S is present and in position 5, the word is likely `CHATS`, `CHAWS`, or `CHAYS`; if S is absent, it points to `CHALK` or `CHAFF`).  
- This guess optimizes for information gain and minimizes worst-case remaining possibilities.

<guess>chaos</guess>",chaos,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1.
- A is correct and in position 3.
- R, N, E are absent from the word.

So the word has the form: C _ A _ _

And we know R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""champ"" -> C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Meaning:
- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).
- H is correct and in position 2 (because in ""champ"", H is at position 2 and it's marked correct).
- A is correct and in position 3 (as before).
- M and P are absent from the word.

So now we know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: A
- M and P are absent.

Also, from the first guess, we know R, N, E are absent.

Therefore, the word is: C H A _ _

We need to fill the last two positions (4 and 5) with letters that are not R, N, E, M, P.

We also know the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for positions 4 and 5: any letter except C, H, A (but note: C, H, A are already used, but they might be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. The feedback for ""crane"" and ""champ"" didn't show any duplicate letters, but that doesn't mean the word can't have duplicates. However, since we have three fixed letters and two positions left, and we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, it's possible the word has no duplicates. But we can't be sure. We should consider the possibility of duplicates, but for now, let's assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

But note: in ""champ"", we used H and A again? Actually, in ""champ"", we have C, H, A, M, P. The C and A were already known, and we confirmed H. The M and P are new and are absent.

Now, the word is C H A _ _ and we must avoid R, N, E, M, P.

Common letters that can appear in the last two positions: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have two positions to fill, so we can try a word that uses two new letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2 out of 6). We are in a good position because we have three letters fixed.

We can try to guess the word directly if we can think of common words that fit.

What are common words that start with ""CHA"" and are 5 letters?

Examples:
- CHAOS: but O and S are new. Also, we haven't ruled out O or S.
- CHARD: but D is new, but R is ruled out? R is absent, so CHARD has R -> invalid.
- CHASE: but E is ruled out -> invalid.
- CHAFE: E is ruled out -> invalid.
- CHALK: K is new, L is new -> possible.
- CHAMP: we already tried, and M and P are absent.
- CHANT: N is absent -> invalid.
- CHART: R is absent -> invalid.
- CHASM: M is absent -> invalid.
- CHEAP: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHEAT: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHECK: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHEEK: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHEER: E and R absent -> invalid.
- CHILD: I, L, D are new -> possible.
- CHILL: I, L are new -> but double L? 
- CHIME: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHINA: N is absent -> invalid.
- CHIVE: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHOCK: O, K are new -> possible.
- CHOIR: O, I, R -> R is absent -> invalid.
- CHOKE: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHORD: R is absent -> invalid.
- CHORE: R and E absent -> invalid.
- CHOSE: E is absent -> invalid.
- CHUCK: U, K are new -> possible.
- CHUFF: U, F are new -> possible.
- CHUGS: U, G, S -> possible.
- CHUMP: M and P absent -> invalid.
- CHUNK: N is absent -> invalid.
- CHURL: R is absent -> invalid.
- CHURN: R and N absent -> invalid.

So possible words from above: CHALK, CHILD, CHOCK, CHUCK, CHUFF, CHUGS, etc.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, CHILL, but that has two L's. However, in CHILL, the positions would be: C H I L L. But we have position 4 and 5 to fill. If we try CHILL, then position 4 is L and position 5 is L? But that's a duplicate.

But note: we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The secret word might have duplicates.

However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, so it's less likely? But we can't rule out.

But to be safe, let's consider both.

We have two positions: 4 and 5. We need to choose two letters that are not in the excluded set.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters to get more information.

But we are very close: we have three letters fixed and only two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word in this turn.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: R, N, E, M, P

So the word must be: C H A ? ? 

Possible combinations for the last two letters:

We can consider common endings:

- CHA_ _ : 

Possible words:
- CHAIS (but S is new, but is it a word? CHAIS is not common, and might not be valid. Wordle uses common words.)
- CHAOS: C H A O S -> O and S are new. Valid word.
- CHATS: but T and S are new, but A is at position 3? CHATS: C H A T S -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S. T and S are not excluded. Valid.
- CHAWS: W and S -> valid? CHAWS is a word (to warm up, or a bird's mouth parts? but it's in dictionaries).
- CHAYS: Y and S -> might be a proper noun? Not common.
- CHAFT: F and T -> but F and T are new, but CHAFT is not a common word? (the horny part of a horse's hoof) - might not be in Wordle.
- CHALK: L and K -> common word.
- CHASM: but M is excluded -> invalid.
- CHILD: I, L, D -> but that's three letters? Wait, CHILD: C H I L D -> so position 4 is L, position 5 is D. So two letters: L and D. Valid.
- CHIRL: but R is excluded -> invalid.
- CHIRP: R and P excluded -> invalid.
- CHIVY: I, V, Y -> but that's three? CHIVY: C H I V Y -> positions 4:V, 5:Y. Valid? (to annoy persistently) - might be in Wordle.
- CHOCK: O, C, K -> but C is already at position 1? So if we use CHOCK, then position 4: O, position 5: K. But note: the word has two C's? The first C is fixed, and then at position 5? But in CHOCK, the last letter is K? CHOCK: C H O C K -> so positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:O? Wait, no: we need position 3 to be A. So CHOCK doesn't have A at position 3. It has O at position 3. So invalid for our pattern.

We must have A at position 3. So the word must be C H A ? ?

So the words that fit:
- CHAOS: C H A O S -> O at 4, S at 5.
- CHATS: C H A T S -> T at 4, S at 5.
- CHAWS: C H A W S -> W at 4, S at 5.
- CHAYS: C H A Y S -> Y at 4, S at 5. (but CHAYS might not be common)
- CHALK: C H A L K -> L at 4, K at 5.
- CHAMP: already tried and M and P absent.
- CHAFF: C H A F F -> F at 4 and 5? Duplicate F. Valid word? (to chaff is to tease, or the husk of grain). But we have F new.
- CHILD: C H I L D -> but wait, position 2 is H (fixed) and position 3 is A? In CHILD, position 3 is I, not A. So invalid.

CHILD doesn't have A at position 3. So we must have the pattern C H A ? ?

So the third letter must be A. So CHILD is not valid.

Similarly, CHUCK: C H U C K -> position 3 is U, not A -> invalid.

So the valid words are those that start with ""CHA"" and then two more letters.

Other possibilities:
- CHAAT: but double A? and T? But position 3 is A, then position 4 is A? That would be duplicate. And CHAAT is a food, might be in Wordle? But we have to avoid E, R, N, M, P. A is allowed again? But we don't know if duplicate A is present. However, in our first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3 and it was correct, but if there is another A, we don't know. But in ""champ"", we didn't have another A, so we didn't test it. So it's possible.

But let's list without worrying about duplicates for now.

Common words:
- CHAOS
- CHATS
- CHAWS
- CHAYS (less common)
- CHALK
- CHAFT (uncommon)
- CHAFE (but E is excluded) -> invalid.
- CHASE (E excluded) -> invalid.
- CHASM (M excluded) -> invalid.
- CHARD (R excluded) -> invalid.

Also:
- CHAIS: a type of chair? Uncommon.
- CHAPE: E excluded -> invalid.
- CHARE: E and R excluded -> invalid.
- CHARK: K is new? C H A R K -> R is excluded -> invalid.
- CHARR: R excluded -> invalid.
- CHAVE: E excluded -> invalid.
- CHAWK: W and K? C H A W K -> but is that a word? Not common.

So the most common ones are: CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHALK, CHAFF.

Now, we have to choose one to guess. We want to maximize information or guess the word.

But note: we have only two positions to fill, so if we guess one of these, we might get it right.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are common and might appear in other words, but since we are down to two positions, we can try to guess.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can afford to get more information? However, with two positions, there are limited possibilities.

How many possibilities? We have about 5-10 words? So we can try to guess one and if it's wrong, we get feedback and then we know.

But to be efficient, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess CHALK, we are testing L and K. If it's not the word, we get feedback on L and K.

Similarly, if we guess CHAOS, we test O and S.

But note: we are also testing the positions.

But since we are forced to use the pattern C H A ? ?, we are not testing other positions.

So let's just pick a common word: CHALK is a good candidate.

But we also have CHAOS and CHATS.

We can also consider that we haven't tested the letters: O, S, T, L, K, F, W, Y, etc.

If we guess CHALK, we test L and K.

If we guess CHAOS, we test O and S.

If we guess CHATS, we test T and S.

But note: S is common, so testing S might be good.

Also, if we guess CHAOS and it's not the word, we might get feedback that O is present but in wrong position? But in CHAOS, O is at position 4. If the word is CHATS, then O would be absent? 

But we are trying to cover the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.

For example, S appears in CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS. So if we can test S, that would be useful.

Similarly, if we test a word that has S in position 5, then if S is present and in position 5, we know the word ends with S. If S is present but not in position 5, then we know it's in position 4? But in our pattern, position 4 and 5 are both open.

But we don't have a word that has S in position 4? For example, CHAOS has S in position 5, CHATS has S in position 5, CHAWS has S in position 5, CHAYS has S in position 5. So all the words with S have it at the end? 

What about CHASM? But M is excluded.

So if we test a word that ends with S, we can check if the word ends with S.

Similarly, for other letters.

But we can also test a word that doesn't end with S to see if S is present at all? But we are constrained to the pattern.

We have to choose one of the possible words.

Let me count the possibilities:

1. CHAOS: ends with OS
2. CHATS: ends with TS
3. CHAWS: ends with WS
4. CHAYS: ends with YS
5. CHALK: ends with LK
6. CHAFF: ends with FF

And less common: CHAAT, etc.

We can try to use a word that covers more than one possibility? But we can't.

We can choose the most common word: CHALK is very common.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more frequent to increase the chance of being correct.

In English, the most common letters for the last two positions: S, T, L, etc.

But in our case, for the words:

- CHAOS: O and S
- CHATS: T and S
- CHAWS: W and S
- CHAYS: Y and S
- CHALK: L and K
- CHAFF: F and F

S is in four of them. So if we can confirm S, that would be good.

But how? We can guess a word that has S in position 5? Then if S is present and in position 5, then we know the word ends with S. If S is absent, then we know the word must be CHALK or CHAFF.

Similarly, if we guess CHAOS and S is present and in position 5, then the word ends with S. But we don't know about O.

But if we guess CHAOS and the word is CHATS, then we would get:
- C: correct
- H: correct
- A: correct
- O: absent (because CHATS has T at 4 and S at 5, so O is not in the word)
- S: present but in position 5? In CHAOS, S is at position 5, and in CHATS, S is also at position 5, so if the word is CHATS, then for CHAOS:
   - Position 1: C ✓
   - Position 2: H ✓
   - Position 3: A ✓
   - Position 4: O (absent, because CHATS has T, not O) -> so O would be marked absent (x)
   - Position 5: S (present and correct) -> ✓

But we would know that S is at position 5, and O is absent. Then we know the word is one of CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS (since CHAOS is eliminated because O is absent, and CHALK and CHAFF don't have S).

Then we can guess among those.

But if we guess CHALK and the word is CHAOS, we get:
- C ✓, H ✓, A ✓, L (absent? because CHAOS has O at 4, not L) -> x, K (absent? because CHAOS has S at 5, not K) -> x.

Then we know L and K are absent, so the word must be one with S at the end.

So both are informative.

But to minimize the worst case, we might choose a word that splits the possibilities.

Currently, we have about 6 possibilities. But let's list them again:

1. CHAOS
2. CHATS
3. CHAWS
4. CHAYS
5. CHALK
6. CHAFF

And possibly others, but these are the main ones.

If we guess CHAOS:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, and we get feedback:
   - If S is present and in position 5, then the word is one of CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS (because they end with S) and CHAOS is eliminated.
   - If S is absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF (since they don't have S).

But if S is present and in position 5, then we have three possibilities left: CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS.

Then we can guess, say, CHATS next. If it's not, then we have two left.

Similarly, if S is absent, then we have CHALK and CHAFF, and we can guess CHALK next.

So worst case, we take 3 more guesses? But we have 4 left, so it's okay.

But we can do better? We can choose a word that tests a letter that appears in multiple positions.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has a letter that is in the fourth position of some words and fifth in others? But in our pattern, the fourth and fifth positions are symmetric in terms of testing.

But note: we are forced to use the pattern C H A ? ?.

We cannot change the first three letters because they are fixed.

So we must choose one of the possible words.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But that might not be efficient because we have only two positions to fill.

For example, we could guess a word like ""CHAS?"" but we have to use valid letters.

But we are constrained to the pattern. We cannot change the first three letters.

So we must guess a word that starts with CHA.

Therefore, we have to choose from the candidates.

Let's pick CHAOS because it tests S (which is in many candidates) and O (which is only in CHAOS).

So if we guess CHAOS:

- If it's correct, we win.
- If not, and S is present and in position 5, then we know the word ends with S and is one of CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS.
- If S is absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF.

Then we can proceed.

Similarly, if we guess CHALK:

- If correct, win.
- If not, and L is absent and K is absent, then the word must end with S (one of CHAOS, CHATS, etc.) or CHAFF? But CHAFF has F, not L or K.

If we guess CHALK and it's not the word, and we get:
- C ✓, H ✓, A ✓, L (x), K (x)

Then we know that L and K are absent, so the word must be one that doesn't have L or K. So from our list: CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS, CHAFF.

But CHAFF has F, which we haven't tested. So we still have 5 possibilities? That's worse.

Whereas if we guess CHAOS and it's not the word, we might reduce to 3 or 2 possibilities.

Similarly, if we guess CHATS:

- If not correct, and we get feedback on T and S.

But S is common, so it might be present.

To minimize the maximum number of remaining possibilities, let's see:

If we guess CHAOS:
- Correct: 0 left
- S present and in position 5: then 3 left (CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS)
- S absent: then 2 left (CHALK, CHAFF)

Worst case: 3 left.

If we guess CHALK:
- Correct: 0
- If L and K absent: then 5 left (CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS, CHAFF) because we don't know about O, T, W, Y, F.
- If L is present but in wrong position? But in CHALK, L is at position 4. If the word is CHAFF, then L would be absent. Similarly, if the word is CHAOS, L is absent. So L and K will be absent for all other words? Because none of the other words have L or K? 

Let's check:
- CHAOS: no L, no K -> so L and K absent.
- CHATS: no L, no K -> absent.
- CHAWS: no L, no K -> absent.
- CHAYS: no L, no K -> absent.
- CHAFF: no L, no K -> absent.

So if we guess CHALK and it's not the word, we will always get L(x) and K(x). Then we know the word is one of the other 5: CHAOS, CHATS, CHAWS, CHAYS, CHAFF.

That leaves 5 possibilities, which is worse than the 3 from guessing CHAOS.

Therefore, guessing CHAOS is better because it can reduce to at most 3 possibilities.

Similarly, if we guess CHATS:
- If not correct, and we get T and S feedback.
   - If S is present and in position 5, then the word is one of CHAOS, CHAWS, CHAYS (3 possibilities) because CHATS is eliminated.
   - If S is absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF (2 possibilities).

But S is present in CHAOS, CHAWS, CHAYS, and CHATS, so if we guess CHATS and it's not the word, S will be present and in position 5 (because all these words end with S) unless the word is CHALK or CHAFF, which don't have S.

So:
- If the word is CHAOS, CHAWS, or CHAYS, then for CHATS: S will be present and in position 5, and T will be absent (because CHAOS has O, not T; CHAWS has W, not T; CHAYS has Y, not T). So T will be absent.
- If the word is CHALK, then S and T are absent.
- If the word is CHAFF, then S and T are absent.

So if we guess CHATS:
- Correct: win.
- If S is present and in position 5 and T is absent, then the word is one of CHAOS, CHAWS, CHAYS (3 possibilities).
- If S and T are absent, then the word is CHALK or CHAFF (2 possibilities).

Worst case 3 possibilities.

Same as CHAOS.

But CHAOS has the advantage that O is only in CHAOS, so if O is present, then the word must be CHAOS? But we are guessing CHAOS, so if it's not correct, O might be absent.

In terms of worst case, both are 3.

But CHAOS is a very common word, so it might be more likely? But we don't know.

I think CHAOS is a good guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could guess ""CHASM"" but M is excluded, so it's invalid? We know M is absent, so we cannot use M.

Similarly, we cannot use R, N, E, M, P.

So we have to use only the allowed letters.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has duplicate letters to test for duplicates? For example, CHAFF. But if we guess CHAFF and it's not the word, we get feedback on F.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I think CHAOS is a reasonable guess.

So I'll go with CHAOS.

<guess>chaos</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word and in position 1.  
  - A is in the word and in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are absent from the word.  
  Secret word pattern: `C _ A _ _` (excludes R, N, E).

- **Guess 2: CHAMP**  
  Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H is in the word and in position 2.  
  - M and P are absent from the word.  
  Updated secret word pattern: `C H A _ _` (excludes R, N, E, M, P).

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 1: C  
  - Position 2: H  
  - Position 3: A  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, M, P (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Unknown positions**: 4 and 5 (must be filled with letters not in the excluded set).  
- **Possible words**: Common English words fitting `C H A _ _` and excluding R, N, E, M, P include:  
  - `CHAOS` (O, S)  
  - `CHATS` (T, S)  
  - `CHALK` (L, K)  
  - `CHAFF` (F, F)  
  - `CHAWS` (W, S)  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test letters for positions 4 and 5 while maximizing information.  
- `CHAOS` is chosen because:  
  - It tests **O** (position 4) and **S** (position 5), two common letters not yet ruled out.  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, the feedback will:  
    - Confirm if **S** is present (appearing in 4/5 possible words).  
    - Reduce possibilities significantly (e.g., if S is present and in position 5, the word is likely `CHATS`, `CHAWS`, or `CHAYS`; if S is absent, it points to `CHALK` or `CHAFF`).  
- This guess optimizes for information gain and minimizes worst-case remaining possibilities.",Guess 3: chaos -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) O(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
