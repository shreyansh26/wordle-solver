We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Okay, let me tackle this Wordle puzzle step by step. The previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback given was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-). 

First, I need to interpret what this feedback means. The 'x' indicates that certain letters are not in the secret word at all. So C, R, and N are completely out. That's useful to know because it narrows down the possibilities. The '-' under A and E means that these letters are present in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed. 

So, for the next guess, I need to:
1. Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
2. Include both A and E since they're in the word.
3. Make sure A isn't the third letter and E isn't the fifth letter since that's where they were incorrectly placed before.

Now, thinking about possible words containing A and E but no C, R, or N. Common English words that fit this pattern come to mind—like ""SAUTE,"" ""PASTE,"" ""WASTE,"" ""TASTE,"" or ""BASED."" 

Considering which word might provide the most information: ""SAUTE"" uses S, A, U, T, E. But U might not be common. ""PASTE"" has P, A, S, T, E—covering frequent letters. ""WASTE"" is similar but starts with W instead. 

""TASTE"" repeats T, which might not be ideal since we want distinct letters to maximize feedback. ""BASED"" includes B and D, which haven't been tested yet. 

Hmm... ""PASTE"" seems good because:
- P and S are common consonants.
- A and E are confirmed and repositioned—A not third, E not fifth.
- T is a new letter to test.

So I'll proceed with ""PASTE"" as the second guess. This keeps things varied and helps probe whether S, T, or P are present.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are eliminated (not in the word).
- **A** is present but *not* in position 3.
- **E** is present but *not* in position 5.

For the next guess:

2. Must exclude **C, R, N**.
3. Choose a word with varied new letters to maximize information (e.g., testing common consonants like S, T, P).

- Positions **A** (2) ≠ 3 and **E** (5) ≠ 5? (Position 5 is problematic? Note: E *can* be in position 5 if not green previously—feedback only confirms it’s misplaced at position 5 before, so it could still be elsewhere including position 5?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: paste -> P(x) A(-) S(x) T(✓) E(-)
Meaning:
- P and S are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in ""paste"" and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- T is correct and in position 4 (because it got a checkmark at position 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before, and now confirmed again).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The word contains A, E, and T.
- T is fixed at position 4: so the 4th letter is T.
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, N, P, S.

Now, we need to think about the positions for A and E.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be 2 or 3, and the word is 5 letters, it can be in position 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is taken by T, so A can only be in position 1 or 5.

Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, and it must be somewhere. It can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is T, so E can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 5, then E cannot be in 5 (but we already know E isn't in 5).

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word has 5 letters: we know T at 4, and two more besides A and E? Actually, the word has A, E, T, and two other letters that we haven't found yet.

We have used two guesses and have 4 more tries.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Includes A and E, but A not in 2 or 3, and E not in 5.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, P, S.

Also, we want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions we haven't tried, and also test some new consonants.

Let's consider the possible positions:

Option 1: A in position 1, E in position 2 or 3.
Option 2: A in position 5, E in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if A is in position 5, then position 1 is open for E? But E can be in 1.

We need to cover both possibilities.

A good strategy is to try a word that places A in position 1 and E in position 2 or 3, to test that scenario. If it doesn't work, then A must be in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that fit the constraints.

Constraints for the next guess:
- Position 4 must be T.
- Must include A and E.
- A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 5.
- E cannot be in 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we must avoid C, R, N, P, S.

Let's try to put A in position 1 and E in position 3 (since position 2 for E is also possible, but we haven't tested position 3 for E).

For example, consider the word ""LATTE"": 
- L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
But A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (from guess2: A cannot be in position 2). Also, E is in position 5, which is not allowed. So ""LATTE"" is invalid.

Another idea: ""TABLE"": 
- T at 1? But we need T at 4. Not matching.

We need T at position 4.

So the word must be: _ _ _ T _

Now, A must be in 1 or 5, and E in 1,2,3 (but if A is in 1, then E can be in 2 or 3; if A is in 5, then E can be in 1,2,3).

Let me try to form words:

Option: A in 1, E in 2: e.g., ""A E _ T _""
But we need a valid word: like ""AEGIS""? But we have T at 4? No, ""AEGIS"" has no T at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be T.

So pattern: _ _ _ T _

With A in 1: ""A _ _ T _""
With E in 2: ""A E _ T _""

What words? ""AEGIS"" doesn't fit. ""ABETT""? Not a word. ""AUDIT""? But U and D are new. ""AUDIT"": A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4? But we need T at 4, so I at 4? No, ""AUDIT"" is A,U,D,I,T -> positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need T at 4, so not.

We need the fourth letter to be T, so the word ends with T and the next letter? Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is T, so the last letter is position 5.

So pattern: _ _ _ T _

With A at 1: ""A _ _ T _""
With E at 2: ""A E _ T _""

Now, what words? ""AERIE""? But E at 2, then R (eliminated) at 3? R is out. ""AESIR""? S is eliminated. ""AEGIS"" has G at 3 and I at 4? But we need T at 4, so no.

Perhaps E at 3: ""A _ E T _""

Words: ""ABETT""? Not a word. ""ALETT""? No. ""ADEPT""? But D and P (P is eliminated). ""ADEPT"" has P? A,D,E,P,T -> P is eliminated.

""AGENT""? But N is eliminated.

""AVERT""? R is eliminated.

""ALERT""? R and L? But R is eliminated.

It's hard to find a word with A at 1 and E at 3, and T at 4, without using eliminated letters.

Try E at 3: ""A _ E T _""

Possible words: ""AQUET""? Not a word. ""AMELT""? Not a word. ""ABLET""? A,B,L,E,T -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E? But we need T at 4, so no.

Wait, the pattern is: 1:A, 2:?, 3:E, 4:T, 5:?

But we have E at position 3? But we need to place E, and it can be at 3.

Word: ""A B E T T"" not a word. ""A C E T E"" but C eliminated.

Perhaps ""AISLE"" but no T at 4.

I think I need to consider the other option: A at position 5.

Then pattern: _ _ _ T A

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

For example, E at 1: ""E _ _ T A""

Words: ""EJECT"" -> but C and J? C eliminated. ""EIGHT"" -> G,H,T? But T at 4? ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> position 4 is H, not T. Not.

""ELOTA""? Not a word.

""EVITA"": E,V,I,T,A -> positions: 1:E, 2:V, 3:I, 4:T, 5:A -> that works! And V and I are new.

But is ""EVITA"" a word? Yes, a proper name, but sometimes Wordle allows proper nouns? Typically, Wordle uses common words, but ""EVITA"" might be accepted? To be safe, let's avoid.

""EXIST"": but S is eliminated.

""EDUCE"": but C and D? C eliminated.

""EMPTY"": P eliminated.

""ENACT"": N and C eliminated.

It's difficult.

Another idea: E at 2: pattern _ E _ T A

Words: ""BETTA"" -> B,E,T,T,A -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A -> but position 4 is T, which is good, but position 3 is T? That's two T's? But we don't know if the word has two T's.

""BETTA"" is a word (a fish). But let's see: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A. So T at 3 and 4? But we have T at 4 fixed, and if there is another T, that's possible.

But in our feedback, we only know one T is at position 4. There could be more.

Similarly, E at 3: pattern _ _ E T A

Words: ""QUETA"" not common. ""LIETA"" not word. ""DIETA"" -> D,I,E,T,A -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. That could work.

""DIETA"" might not be common, but ""DIET"" is, so perhaps.

But let's think of more common words.

Another common word: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:L, 4:T, 5:A. That fits the pattern: E at 2? No, in ""DELTA"", E is at position 2, and A at 5.

Pattern for A at 5 and E at 2: _ E _ T A

""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, T at 4, A at 5. Perfect.

And D and L are new letters, not eliminated.

Also, avoids C,R,N,P,S.

So ""DELTA"" is a valid guess.

But we have to consider that A might be at position 1, but we haven't tested that. However, by guessing ""DELTA"", we cover the case where A is at 5 and E at 2.

If the word has A at 1, then ""DELTA"" will have A at 5, which is wrong, but we'll get feedback that A is present but not at 5, and then we'll know A must be at 1.

Similarly, if E is not at 2, we'll get feedback.

Moreover, ""DELTA"" tests two new letters: D and L.

So it's a good candidate.

Another possibility: if we want to test A at 1, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have T at 4.

We must have T at 4.

Another word: for A at 1 and E at 3: I thought of ""ADEPT"" but P is eliminated.

""AGLET""? Not common.

""ALATE"": A,L,A,T,E -> but two A's? And E at 5? But E cannot be at 5. ""ALATE"": positions 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but E at 5 is not allowed, so invalid.

So ""DELTA"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L? But we need T at 4, so no.

""DELTA"" is good.

Another word: ""METAL"": M,E,T,A,L -> but T is at 3, not 4. We need T at 4.

""VETAL""? Not a word.

So I think ""DELTA"" is a solid guess.

Let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **C, R, N, P, S** are eliminated (not in the word).
- **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from ""paste"" and ""crane"" feedback).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed in both guesses).
- **T** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (from ""paste"" feedback).

The word must contain **A**, **E**, and **T**, with **T** fixed at position 4. Possible positions for **A** are 1 or 5 (since it can't be 2, 3, or 4). **E** can be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5). 

For the next guess, I chose **DELTA** because:
- It tests **A** in position 5 and **E** in position 2 (covering one of the possible configurations).
- It introduces new common letters **D** and **L**, which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids eliminated letters and maintains **T** at position 4.
- If **A** or **E** are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow down their positions (e.g., if **A** is not in position 5, it must be in position 1).

<guess>delta</guess>",delta,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: paste -> P(x) A(-) S(x) T(✓) E(-)
Meaning:
- P and S are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in ""paste"" and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- T is correct and in position 4 (because it got a checkmark at position 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before, and now confirmed again).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The word contains A, E, and T.
- T is fixed at position 4: so the 4th letter is T.
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, N, P, S.

Now, we need to think about the positions for A and E.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be 2 or 3, and the word is 5 letters, it can be in position 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is taken by T, so A can only be in position 1 or 5.

Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, and it must be somewhere. It can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is T, so E can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 5, then E cannot be in 5 (but we already know E isn't in 5).

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word has 5 letters: we know T at 4, and two more besides A and E? Actually, the word has A, E, T, and two other letters that we haven't found yet.

We have used two guesses and have 4 more tries.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Includes A and E, but A not in 2 or 3, and E not in 5.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, P, S.

Also, we want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions we haven't tried, and also test some new consonants.

Let's consider the possible positions:

Option 1: A in position 1, E in position 2 or 3.
Option 2: A in position 5, E in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if A is in position 5, then position 1 is open for E? But E can be in 1.

We need to cover both possibilities.

A good strategy is to try a word that places A in position 1 and E in position 2 or 3, to test that scenario. If it doesn't work, then A must be in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that fit the constraints.

Constraints for the next guess:
- Position 4 must be T.
- Must include A and E.
- A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 5.
- E cannot be in 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we must avoid C, R, N, P, S.

Let's try to put A in position 1 and E in position 3 (since position 2 for E is also possible, but we haven't tested position 3 for E).

For example, consider the word ""LATTE"": 
- L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
But A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (from guess2: A cannot be in position 2). Also, E is in position 5, which is not allowed. So ""LATTE"" is invalid.

Another idea: ""TABLE"": 
- T at 1? But we need T at 4. Not matching.

We need T at position 4.

So the word must be: _ _ _ T _

Now, A must be in 1 or 5, and E in 1,2,3 (but if A is in 1, then E can be in 2 or 3; if A is in 5, then E can be in 1,2,3).

Let me try to form words:

Option: A in 1, E in 2: e.g., ""A E _ T _""
But we need a valid word: like ""AEGIS""? But we have T at 4? No, ""AEGIS"" has no T at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be T.

So pattern: _ _ _ T _

With A in 1: ""A _ _ T _""
With E in 2: ""A E _ T _""

What words? ""AEGIS"" doesn't fit. ""ABETT""? Not a word. ""AUDIT""? But U and D are new. ""AUDIT"": A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4? But we need T at 4, so I at 4? No, ""AUDIT"" is A,U,D,I,T -> positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need T at 4, so not.

We need the fourth letter to be T, so the word ends with T and the next letter? Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is T, so the last letter is position 5.

So pattern: _ _ _ T _

With A at 1: ""A _ _ T _""
With E at 2: ""A E _ T _""

Now, what words? ""AERIE""? But E at 2, then R (eliminated) at 3? R is out. ""AESIR""? S is eliminated. ""AEGIS"" has G at 3 and I at 4? But we need T at 4, so no.

Perhaps E at 3: ""A _ E T _""

Words: ""ABETT""? Not a word. ""ALETT""? No. ""ADEPT""? But D and P (P is eliminated). ""ADEPT"" has P? A,D,E,P,T -> P is eliminated.

""AGENT""? But N is eliminated.

""AVERT""? R is eliminated.

""ALERT""? R and L? But R is eliminated.

It's hard to find a word with A at 1 and E at 3, and T at 4, without using eliminated letters.

Try E at 3: ""A _ E T _""

Possible words: ""AQUET""? Not a word. ""AMELT""? Not a word. ""ABLET""? A,B,L,E,T -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E? But we need T at 4, so no.

Wait, the pattern is: 1:A, 2:?, 3:E, 4:T, 5:?

But we have E at position 3? But we need to place E, and it can be at 3.

Word: ""A B E T T"" not a word. ""A C E T E"" but C eliminated.

Perhaps ""AISLE"" but no T at 4.

I think I need to consider the other option: A at position 5.

Then pattern: _ _ _ T A

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

For example, E at 1: ""E _ _ T A""

Words: ""EJECT"" -> but C and J? C eliminated. ""EIGHT"" -> G,H,T? But T at 4? ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> position 4 is H, not T. Not.

""ELOTA""? Not a word.

""EVITA"": E,V,I,T,A -> positions: 1:E, 2:V, 3:I, 4:T, 5:A -> that works! And V and I are new.

But is ""EVITA"" a word? Yes, a proper name, but sometimes Wordle allows proper nouns? Typically, Wordle uses common words, but ""EVITA"" might be accepted? To be safe, let's avoid.

""EXIST"": but S is eliminated.

""EDUCE"": but C and D? C eliminated.

""EMPTY"": P eliminated.

""ENACT"": N and C eliminated.

It's difficult.

Another idea: E at 2: pattern _ E _ T A

Words: ""BETTA"" -> B,E,T,T,A -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A -> but position 4 is T, which is good, but position 3 is T? That's two T's? But we don't know if the word has two T's.

""BETTA"" is a word (a fish). But let's see: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A. So T at 3 and 4? But we have T at 4 fixed, and if there is another T, that's possible.

But in our feedback, we only know one T is at position 4. There could be more.

Similarly, E at 3: pattern _ _ E T A

Words: ""QUETA"" not common. ""LIETA"" not word. ""DIETA"" -> D,I,E,T,A -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. That could work.

""DIETA"" might not be common, but ""DIET"" is, so perhaps.

But let's think of more common words.

Another common word: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:L, 4:T, 5:A. That fits the pattern: E at 2? No, in ""DELTA"", E is at position 2, and A at 5.

Pattern for A at 5 and E at 2: _ E _ T A

""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, T at 4, A at 5. Perfect.

And D and L are new letters, not eliminated.

Also, avoids C,R,N,P,S.

So ""DELTA"" is a valid guess.

But we have to consider that A might be at position 1, but we haven't tested that. However, by guessing ""DELTA"", we cover the case where A is at 5 and E at 2.

If the word has A at 1, then ""DELTA"" will have A at 5, which is wrong, but we'll get feedback that A is present but not at 5, and then we'll know A must be at 1.

Similarly, if E is not at 2, we'll get feedback.

Moreover, ""DELTA"" tests two new letters: D and L.

So it's a good candidate.

Another possibility: if we want to test A at 1, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have T at 4.

We must have T at 4.

Another word: for A at 1 and E at 3: I thought of ""ADEPT"" but P is eliminated.

""AGLET""? Not common.

""ALATE"": A,L,A,T,E -> but two A's? And E at 5? But E cannot be at 5. ""ALATE"": positions 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but E at 5 is not allowed, so invalid.

So ""DELTA"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L? But we need T at 4, so no.

""DELTA"" is good.

Another word: ""METAL"": M,E,T,A,L -> but T is at 3, not 4. We need T at 4.

""VETAL""? Not a word.

So I think ""DELTA"" is a solid guess.

Let's go with that.Based on the previous feedback:

- **C, R, N, P, S** are eliminated (not in the word).
- **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from ""paste"" and ""crane"" feedback).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed in both guesses).
- **T** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (from ""paste"" feedback).

The word must contain **A**, **E**, and **T**, with **T** fixed at position 4. Possible positions for **A** are 1 or 5 (since it can't be 2, 3, or 4). **E** can be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5). 

For the next guess, I chose **DELTA** because:
- It tests **A** in position 5 and **E** in position 2 (covering one of the possible configurations).
- It introduces new common letters **D** and **L**, which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids eliminated letters and maintains **T** at position 4.
- If **A** or **E** are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow down their positions (e.g., if **A** is not in position 5, it must be in position 1).",Guess 3: delta -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) L(x) T(✓) A(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let me tackle this Wordle puzzle step by step. The previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback given was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-). 

First, I need to interpret what this feedback means. The 'x' indicates that certain letters are not in the secret word at all. So C, R, and N are completely out. That's useful to know because it narrows down the possibilities. The '-' under A and E means that these letters are present in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed. 

So, for the next guess, I need to:
1. Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
2. Include both A and E since they're in the word.
3. Make sure A isn't the third letter and E isn't the fifth letter since that's where they were incorrectly placed before.

Now, thinking about possible words containing A and E but no C, R, or N. Common English words that fit this pattern come to mind—like ""SAUTE,"" ""PASTE,"" ""WASTE,"" ""TASTE,"" or ""BASED."" 

Considering which word might provide the most information: ""SAUTE"" uses S, A, U, T, E. But U might not be common. ""PASTE"" has P, A, S, T, E—covering frequent letters. ""WASTE"" is similar but starts with W instead. 

""TASTE"" repeats T, which might not be ideal since we want distinct letters to maximize feedback. ""BASED"" includes B and D, which haven't been tested yet. 

Hmm... ""PASTE"" seems good because:
- P and S are common consonants.
- A and E are confirmed and repositioned—A not third, E not fifth.
- T is a new letter to test.

So I'll proceed with ""PASTE"" as the second guess. This keeps things varied and helps probe whether S, T, or P are present.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are eliminated (not in the word).
- **A** is present but *not* in position 3.
- **E** is present but *not* in position 5.

For the next guess:
1. Must include **A** and **E**, avoiding positions 3 and 5 respectively.
2. Must exclude **C, R, N**.
3. Choose a word with varied new letters to maximize information (e.g., testing common consonants like S, T, P).

A strong candidate is **PASTE**:
- Positions **A** (2) ≠ 3 and **E** (5) ≠ 5? (Position 5 is problematic? Note: E *can* be in position 5 if not green previously—feedback only confirms it’s misplaced at position 5 before, so it could still be elsewhere including position 5? Correction: Feedback ""E(-)"" at position 5 means E *is* in the word but *not* at position 5. So **E cannot be in position 5** yet).
- Only new letters: **P**, **S**, **T** (all untested).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: paste -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) S(x) T(✓) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: paste -> P(x) A(-) S(x) T(✓) E(-)
Meaning:
- P and S are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in ""paste"" and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
- T is correct and in position 4 (because it got a checkmark at position 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before, and now confirmed again).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The word contains A, E, and T.
- T is fixed at position 4: so the 4th letter is T.
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, N, P, S.

Now, we need to think about the positions for A and E.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be 2 or 3, and the word is 5 letters, it can be in position 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is taken by T, so A can only be in position 1 or 5.

Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, and it must be somewhere. It can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is T, so E can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1. Similarly, if A is in position 5, then E cannot be in 5 (but we already know E isn't in 5).

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word has 5 letters: we know T at 4, and two more besides A and E? Actually, the word has A, E, T, and two other letters that we haven't found yet.

We have used two guesses and have 4 more tries.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Includes A and E, but A not in 2 or 3, and E not in 5.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, N, P, S.

Also, we want to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions we haven't tried, and also test some new consonants.

Let's consider the possible positions:

Option 1: A in position 1, E in position 2 or 3.
Option 2: A in position 5, E in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if A is in position 5, then position 1 is open for E? But E can be in 1.

We need to cover both possibilities.

A good strategy is to try a word that places A in position 1 and E in position 2 or 3, to test that scenario. If it doesn't work, then A must be in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that fit the constraints.

Constraints for the next guess:
- Position 4 must be T.
- Must include A and E.
- A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 1 or 5.
- E cannot be in 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we must avoid C, R, N, P, S.

Let's try to put A in position 1 and E in position 3 (since position 2 for E is also possible, but we haven't tested position 3 for E).

For example, consider the word ""LATTE"": 
- L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
But A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (from guess2: A cannot be in position 2). Also, E is in position 5, which is not allowed. So ""LATTE"" is invalid.

Another idea: ""TABLE"": 
- T at 1? But we need T at 4. Not matching.

We need T at position 4.

So the word must be: _ _ _ T _

Now, A must be in 1 or 5, and E in 1,2,3 (but if A is in 1, then E can be in 2 or 3; if A is in 5, then E can be in 1,2,3).

Let me try to form words:

Option: A in 1, E in 2: e.g., ""A E _ T _""
But we need a valid word: like ""AEGIS""? But we have T at 4? No, ""AEGIS"" has no T at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be T.

So pattern: _ _ _ T _

With A in 1: ""A _ _ T _""
With E in 2: ""A E _ T _""

What words? ""AEGIS"" doesn't fit. ""ABETT""? Not a word. ""AUDIT""? But U and D are new. ""AUDIT"": A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4? But we need T at 4, so I at 4? No, ""AUDIT"" is A,U,D,I,T -> positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need T at 4, so not.

We need the fourth letter to be T, so the word ends with T and the next letter? Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is T, so the last letter is position 5.

So pattern: _ _ _ T _

With A at 1: ""A _ _ T _""
With E at 2: ""A E _ T _""

Now, what words? ""AERIE""? But E at 2, then R (eliminated) at 3? R is out. ""AESIR""? S is eliminated. ""AEGIS"" has G at 3 and I at 4? But we need T at 4, so no.

Perhaps E at 3: ""A _ E T _""

Words: ""ABETT""? Not a word. ""ALETT""? No. ""ADEPT""? But D and P (P is eliminated). ""ADEPT"" has P? A,D,E,P,T -> P is eliminated.

""AGENT""? But N is eliminated.

""AVERT""? R is eliminated.

""ALERT""? R and L? But R is eliminated.

It's hard to find a word with A at 1 and E at 3, and T at 4, without using eliminated letters.

Try E at 3: ""A _ E T _""

Possible words: ""AQUET""? Not a word. ""AMELT""? Not a word. ""ABLET""? A,B,L,E,T -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E? But we need T at 4, so no.

Wait, the pattern is: 1:A, 2:?, 3:E, 4:T, 5:?

But we have E at position 3? But we need to place E, and it can be at 3.

Word: ""A B E T T"" not a word. ""A C E T E"" but C eliminated.

Perhaps ""AISLE"" but no T at 4.

I think I need to consider the other option: A at position 5.

Then pattern: _ _ _ T A

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

For example, E at 1: ""E _ _ T A""

Words: ""EJECT"" -> but C and J? C eliminated. ""EIGHT"" -> G,H,T? But T at 4? ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> position 4 is H, not T. Not.

""ELOTA""? Not a word.

""EVITA"": E,V,I,T,A -> positions: 1:E, 2:V, 3:I, 4:T, 5:A -> that works! And V and I are new.

But is ""EVITA"" a word? Yes, a proper name, but sometimes Wordle allows proper nouns? Typically, Wordle uses common words, but ""EVITA"" might be accepted? To be safe, let's avoid.

""EXIST"": but S is eliminated.

""EDUCE"": but C and D? C eliminated.

""EMPTY"": P eliminated.

""ENACT"": N and C eliminated.

It's difficult.

Another idea: E at 2: pattern _ E _ T A

Words: ""BETTA"" -> B,E,T,T,A -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A -> but position 4 is T, which is good, but position 3 is T? That's two T's? But we don't know if the word has two T's.

""BETTA"" is a word (a fish). But let's see: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A. So T at 3 and 4? But we have T at 4 fixed, and if there is another T, that's possible.

But in our feedback, we only know one T is at position 4. There could be more.

Similarly, E at 3: pattern _ _ E T A

Words: ""QUETA"" not common. ""LIETA"" not word. ""DIETA"" -> D,I,E,T,A -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. That could work.

""DIETA"" might not be common, but ""DIET"" is, so perhaps.

But let's think of more common words.

Another common word: ""DELTA"" -> D,E,L,T,A -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:L, 4:T, 5:A. That fits the pattern: E at 2? No, in ""DELTA"", E is at position 2, and A at 5.

Pattern for A at 5 and E at 2: _ E _ T A

""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, T at 4, A at 5. Perfect.

And D and L are new letters, not eliminated.

Also, avoids C,R,N,P,S.

So ""DELTA"" is a valid guess.

But we have to consider that A might be at position 1, but we haven't tested that. However, by guessing ""DELTA"", we cover the case where A is at 5 and E at 2.

If the word has A at 1, then ""DELTA"" will have A at 5, which is wrong, but we'll get feedback that A is present but not at 5, and then we'll know A must be at 1.

Similarly, if E is not at 2, we'll get feedback.

Moreover, ""DELTA"" tests two new letters: D and L.

So it's a good candidate.

Another possibility: if we want to test A at 1, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't have T at 4.

We must have T at 4.

Another word: for A at 1 and E at 3: I thought of ""ADEPT"" but P is eliminated.

""AGLET""? Not common.

""ALATE"": A,L,A,T,E -> but two A's? And E at 5? But E cannot be at 5. ""ALATE"": positions 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but E at 5 is not allowed, so invalid.

So ""DELTA"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""DEALT"": D,E,A,L,T -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L? But we need T at 4, so no.

""DELTA"" is good.

Another word: ""METAL"": M,E,T,A,L -> but T is at 3, not 4. We need T at 4.

""VETAL""? Not a word.

So I think ""DELTA"" is a solid guess.

Let's go with that.Based on the previous feedback:

- **C, R, N, P, S** are eliminated (not in the word).
- **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from ""paste"" and ""crane"" feedback).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed in both guesses).
- **T** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (from ""paste"" feedback).

The word must contain **A**, **E**, and **T**, with **T** fixed at position 4. Possible positions for **A** are 1 or 5 (since it can't be 2, 3, or 4). **E** can be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5). 

For the next guess, I chose **DELTA** because:
- It tests **A** in position 5 and **E** in position 2 (covering one of the possible configurations).
- It introduces new common letters **D** and **L**, which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids eliminated letters and maintains **T** at position 4.
- If **A** or **E** are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow down their positions (e.g., if **A** is not in position 5, it must be in position 1).

The previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback given was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-). \n\nFirst, I need to interpret what this feedback means. The \'x\' indicates that certain letters are not in the secret word at all. So C, R, and N are completely out. That\'s useful to know because it narrows down the possibilities. The \'-\' under A and E means that these letters are present in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed. \n\nSo, for the next guess, I need to:\n1. Exclude C, R, and N entirely.\n2. Include both A and E since they\'re in the word.\n3. Make sure A isn\'t the third letter and E isn\'t the fifth letter since that\'s where they were incorrectly placed before.\n\nNow, thinking about possible words containing A and E but no C, R, or N. Common English words that fit this pattern come to mind—like ""SAUTE,"" ""PASTE,"" ""WASTE,"" ""TASTE,"" or ""BASED."" \n\nConsidering which word might provide the most information: ""SAUTE"" uses S, A, U, T, E. But U might not be common. ""PASTE"" has P, A, S, T, E—covering frequent letters. ""WASTE"" is similar but starts with W instead. \n\n""TASTE"" repeats T, which might not be ideal since we want distinct letters to maximize feedback. ""BASED"" includes B and D, which haven\'t been tested yet. \n\nHmm... ""PASTE"" seems good because:\n- P and S are common consonants.\n- A and E are confirmed and repositioned—A not third, E not fifth.\n- T is a new letter to test.\n\nSo I\'ll proceed with ""PASTE"" as the second guess. This keeps things varied and helps probe whether S, T, or P are present.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N** are eliminated (not in the word).\n- **A** is present but *not* in position 3.\n- **E** is present but *not* in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n1.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
- Indicates: A is in the word but not in position 3, E is in the word but not in position 5. Eliminated letters: C, R, N.

Guess 2: paste -> P(x) A(-) S(x) T(✓) E(-)
- T is correct at position 4 (so we know the 4th letter is T).
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (from the '-').
- P and S are not in the word (eliminated).
- E is in the word (confirmed) but not at position 5 (same as before).

Guess 3: delta -> D(x) E(-) L(x) T(✓) A(✓)
- T(✓) at position 4 confirmed (expected).
- A is in the word and correct at position 5 (A(✓)). So now we know the 5th letter is A.
- E is in the word (-) but not at position 2 (since it showed '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- D and L are eliminated (not in the word).

Synthesizing:

- Positions known: 
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: A
- So word pattern: ...TA (4=T, 5=A)

- Letters in the word: 
  - A (at position 5), E (somewhere, but positions?), and T (position 4).
  - From guess1, A and E are present. From guess2, T is present. No other confirmed letters? Not necessarily: the word must have three more letters? No, we have two positions open: letters 1,2,3.

- Eliminated letters so far: C, R, N, P, S, D, L.

- From feedback:
  - E must be in the word, but cannot be at position 5 (known), position 2 (from delta feedback: E at position 2 got '-', so wrong), and position 3? Not directly, but let's see:

In delta, E at position 2 (guess) was a '-', meaning E is present but not at position 2. Similarly, in crane, E at position 5 was wrong. What about position 1 and 3? E must be at position 1 or position 3.

Also, from crane: A was at position 3 and got '-', meaning A is present but not at position 3. But now we know A is at position 5, so that's consistent.

So, E can only be at position 1 or 3? Because:
- Position 2: eliminated from delta feedback.
- Position 5: eliminated early because the word ends with A.
- Position 4: is T.

Therefore, E must be either in position 1 or position 3.

Now, we have positions 1,2,3 to figure out:
- Position 3 might be E? Or position 1 might be E? And position 2 is some new letter.

Additionally, we know that:
- The word contains A, E, T, and two more letters? Since it has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4=T,5=A.

Wait: we know T and A are in positions 4 and 5, so letters 1,2,3 must be the other letters, which include E and two more? But E is already present, so the two more letters could be repeats? Or new.

But we don't have duplicates so far? We need to consider.

From the feedback, we have E present, and it must be at 1 or 3.

The letter at position 3 from crane was A (guess) and got '-', so if E is at position 3? Then that's fine.

Similarly, position 1: could be E or another letter.

But note: in delta, when we had A at position 5 and T at 4, we got E at position 2 wrong? Yes.

Now, for the third guess: delta = [D,E,L,T,A] -> feedback [x,-,x,✓,✓]
We have D(x), L(x), so they are not in the word.

Also, the word: _ _ _ T A

And E must be at 1 or 3.

So possible structures:

1. E at position 1: E _ _ T A
2. E at position 3: _ _ E T A

Position 2 cannot be E.

Now, we need to guess one of these and test the other positions.

Moreover, we have eliminated: C,R,N,P,S,D,L.

Possible letters for position 2: many, but not eliminated ones.

Common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information.

Also, note that since we only have 3 tries left? After guess 3, we have 3 more guesses? Actually, we've used 3, so 3 left.

We can try to guess a word that covers E at 1 or E at 3 and tests common consonants.

But let's consider: if E is at position 1, then we have E _ X T A. Where X is the letter at position 3, which could be E? But if E is at 1, it might be the same E at 1? So we don't expect two E's? Unless the word has two E's? Possible.

Similarly, if E is at 3: then pattern: _ Y E T A.

But we don't know if there are repeated letters.

First, let's assume no repeated letters for simplicity? Since we haven't encountered duplicates yet? Wait, in the feedback, we haven't had any duplicates in guesses? But the secret word might have duplicates.

However, to minimize complexity, let's first try a word without duplicates.

For the pattern: if E is at position 1: E _ _ T A

What are common words? Like ""E? ? TA"" but the third position must be filled.

For example, ""EGGTA"" not a word. ""EJECT"" but C eliminated. ""E V E T A"" but not a word? How about ""EMMET"" but no A? Not.

""E V I T A"" but V,I: ""EVITA"" is a word? But positions: if E at1, V at2, I at3, T at4, A at5: then ""EVITA"". But I is not eliminated? However, S was eliminated? Not necessarily.

Eliminated letters: C,R,N,P,S,D,L.

So V and I are allowed.

But in the secret word, if E is at1, then ""EVITA"" would be a candidate? But wait, we have to guess.

Similarly, for E at position 3: pattern _ _ E T A -> e.g., ""B E T T A"" but T is repeated? Or ""QUETA"" not, ""DIETA"" D eliminated? D is eliminated from delta feedback.

""DELTA"" had D, which is eliminated, so ""DIETA"" would have D? Not allowed.

""FIESTA"" but S eliminated? And positions don't match? We need 5 letters.

Or ""MODEL"" but not matching pattern.

But let's list possible candidates:

For E at 1: ""EXITA""? Not common. ""ENVIA""? Not word. ""EDUCE"" but D and C eliminated? Not.

""EIGHT"" but T at4? ""EIGHT"" is E,I,G,H,T -> position4 is H, not T? So not.

How about ""EMBER"" no A. Not.

It's tough with E at1. Perhaps ""EQUIP"" but Q and P eliminated? P eliminated.

So maybe E at1 is less common? Perhaps E at position 3 is more plausible.

Pattern for E at3: _ _ E T A

Common words: ""QUIET"" no A? ""CATER"" C,R eliminated. ""LATER"" L? Eliminated? L is eliminated from delta feedback? Yes.

""WATER"": W,A,T,E,R? Positions: 1:W,2:A,3:T,4:E,5:R? But we need position4=T? So not matching.

We need position4=T and 5=A.

So words ending with ""TA"" and third letter E? Like ""? ? E T A""

Words: ""ASHET"" not. ""B E T T A"" -> ""BETTA"" which is a word (fish). Pattern: 1:B, 2:E, but wait: 3:T? ""BETTA"": B,E,T,T,A -> so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A. 

But in our pattern for E at3: the word would be _ _ E T A, so if ""BETTA"", it has E at position 2, not 3? And also has T at position 4? Yes, and T at position 3? So if the secret word is ""BETTA"", then E is at position 2? But we have eliminated position 2 for E? From delta, E at position 2 was present but wrong position? In delta, E was at position 2 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at2. Therefore, E cannot be at position 2, so ""BETTA"" cannot have E at2? Actually, in ""BETTA"", E is at position 2, so it would conflict with delta feedback? Because in delta we guessed E at2 and got '-', meaning E is not at position2? So the secret word cannot have E at position2? Therefore, ""BETTA"" has E at position2, which is invalid? So we can rule it out? But note: delta feedback said E is present but not at position2? Yes.

So E cannot be at position2? Therefore, the word cannot have E at2? So ""BETTA"" is impossible? Also, the pattern only fixes position4=T and position5=A? The rest flexible? But E must be at1 or 3? So ""BETTA"" has E at2, so not possible.

Similarly, another word: ""PIZZA"" no E. Not.

How about ""ARETA""? Not common.

""ONETA""? Place name.

Perhaps ""OLEATE"" too long? No.

Another word: ""METAL"" has T at3? Not.

""PETAL"" P eliminated? And T at3 not4.

Wait, we need words like X Y Z T A, with E at position1 or position3.

Let me think: with E at position3: so first two letters are unknown, and E at3, then T at4, A at5.

Possible words: ""ARETA"" not? How about ""ARE TA"" but ""AREA"" is 4 letters? ""ARETA"" not dictionary.

Maybe ""ALETA"" not common.

How about ""AHETA""? Not.

Perhaps ""UVEA"" not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""QUE T A"" -> ""QUETA"" not English.

Maybe ""FUETE"" not? Not.

Perhaps I missed a word: ""THE TA"" -> ""THETA"" is _ _ E T A? Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. But we need position4=T? Yes, in ""THETA"": position4=T? Position1:T, position2:H, position3:E, position4:T, position5:A.

So the word ""THETA"" has T at position1 and position4? And E at position3.

Now, let's check against our constraints and feedback:

- Position4: T - correct? Yes.
- Position5: A - correct.
- E at position3? Yes.

Check eliminated letters: T,H,E,T,A? T and H: H not eliminated? Eliminated letters: C,R,N,P,S,D,L. H is not eliminated.

Now, check if E at position3 is allowed? Yes, because E must be at1 or3? This uses position3.

Now, did we test position3? In crane, we had A at3 and got '-', but that doesn't relate to E at3? It just means A wasn't at3? But E can be at3 independently.

In delta, we didn't have E at3? So no conflict.

Moreover, position1: in ""THETA"" position1 is T? But we haven't fixed position1? Could be.

But wait: is there a conflict? Previously, T was only at position4? Could there be another T? Yes, possibly? Because we didn't have feedback about multiple T's? But we don't know.

Similarly, A at position5 is fixed.

But in guess3, ""delta"" gave T at4 and A at5 correct, but D,E,L wrong? Yes.

Now, if the word is ""THETA"", then:

- Position1: T? But we had T in guess2: ""paste"" had T at position4? And got T(✓) at4? But not at position3? So T might be elsewhere.

In ""THETA"", T is at position1 and position4? But we haven't tested position1? Similarly.

So let's see if ""THETA"" satisfies all feedback:

- crane: guessed C,R,A,N,E? With feedback A(-) meaning A in word but not position3? In ""THETA"", A is at position5? So not at position3? Good. E(-) meaning E in word but not position5? In ""THETA"", E at position3? So not position5? Good.

- paste: guessed P,A,S,T,E? With A(-) meaning A present but not at position2? In ""THETA"", A is at5? So not at2? Good. E(-) meaning E present but not at position5? Good. T(✓) at position4? Good.

- delta: guessed D,E,L,T,A? With D(x) - not in word? ""THETA"" has D? No? Good. E(-) meaning E not at position2? In ""THETA"", E is at position3? So not position2? Good. L(x) no L? Good. T(✓) and A(✓) for positions4 and5? Good.

So ""THETA"" is a candidate? But we don't know? It's possible.

Similarly, are there others? For E at position3: also ""????"" It might be ""THETA"".

If E at position1: pattern E _ _ T A? Could be ""EJECT"" eliminated? ""EXIST"" S eliminated? ""ETHAL""? Not word? I don't see common words.

""EHT A"" not? So probably E at position3 is more likely.

Another possibility: E at position1: E _ ? T A? For example, ""E X I T A"" -> ""EXITA"" not common? ""ENVOY"" no T? Not.

So likely the word is of the form _ _ E T A, with only E at3.

Common words: ""THETA"" as above, ""CARET"" C eliminated? Not? C,R eliminated? ""BARET"" B,A,R,E,T? R eliminated? ""TARET"" T,A,R,E,T? R eliminated.

""GAMET"" G,A,M,E,T? Positions: 1:G,2:A,3:M,4:E? But we need position4=T? So position4=E? No.

To have position4=T and position5=A, and position3=E, the word must be: [letter1][letter2]ETA.

Like ""THETA"", or ""PLETA""? Not? ""BLETA""? Not?

""THE TA"" -> ""THETA"" is one.

""ATHETA""? Too long? Not 5 letters.

So perhaps ""THETA"" is the only common word? Or ""????""

Another: ""SHE TA"" -> ""SHETA"" not word.

""WHETA"" not.

""CHETA"" C eliminated? Not.

So probably try ""THETA"" as a guess? It might be right.

But we have to guess with testing? Because we might have other possibilities: E at position1? But if we try ""THETA"", and it's not, we get feedback.

Moreover, we have eliminated many letters? Position1 in ""THETA"" is T? Could be.

So let's guess ""THETA"".

To confirm: pattern _ _ E T A? ""THETA"" fits: T in position1? But we don't have conflict? Because we never excluded position1 for T? The T is known at position4? But there could be another T? Yes.

Another possibility: ""DIETA"" but D eliminated? So not.

Therefore, I think ""THETA"" is a good guess.

If E is at1? But ""ETHAL"" not? or ""ETHER"" has R? Eliminated? E,T,H,E,R? Positions not match.

So I'll go with ""THETA"".Thinking algorithmically:

- The word ends with ""..."" + ""TA"" (positions 4 and 5 known).
- E must be at position 1 or 3.
- From ""delta"" feedback: E cannot be at position 2.
- ""THETA"" tests the case where E is at position 3 and includes an untested H. It covers all known constraints and uses only valid letters.

<guess>theta</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Crane** (Guess 1): Eliminated letters - C, R, N. Letters present - A (not position 3), E (not position 5).
- **Paste** (Guess 2): Eliminated letters - P, S. Position confirmed - T at position 4. Letters present - A (not position 2), E (not position 5, confirmed).
- **Delta** (Guess 3): Eliminated letters - D, L. Positions confirmed - T at position 4, A at position 5. E is present but not at position 2.

### Synthesis:
- The secret word must contain **A**, **E**, **T** and end with **TA** (positions 4 and 5 fixed as T and A).
- E cannot be in position 2 (from delta feedback) or position 5 (earlier feedback). Position 4 is T, so E must be in position 1 or 3.
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, P, S, D, L**. Permitted letters include B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Possible patterns:
  - E at position 1: E _ _ T A
  - E at position 3: _ _ E T A
- Common words ending in ""ETA"" (with E in position 3) include **THETA**, which fits the pattern [X][Y]ETA. This tests E in position 3 and introduces a new letter (H) for maximum information.

<guess>theta</guess>",theta,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
- Indicates: A is in the word but not in position 3, E is in the word but not in position 5. Eliminated letters: C, R, N.

Guess 2: paste -> P(x) A(-) S(x) T(✓) E(-)
- T is correct at position 4 (so we know the 4th letter is T).
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (from the '-').
- P and S are not in the word (eliminated).
- E is in the word (confirmed) but not at position 5 (same as before).

Guess 3: delta -> D(x) E(-) L(x) T(✓) A(✓)
- T(✓) at position 4 confirmed (expected).
- A is in the word and correct at position 5 (A(✓)). So now we know the 5th letter is A.
- E is in the word (-) but not at position 2 (since it showed '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- D and L are eliminated (not in the word).

Synthesizing:

- Positions known: 
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: A
- So word pattern: ...TA (4=T, 5=A)

- Letters in the word: 
  - A (at position 5), E (somewhere, but positions?), and T (position 4).
  - From guess1, A and E are present. From guess2, T is present. No other confirmed letters? Not necessarily: the word must have three more letters? No, we have two positions open: letters 1,2,3.

- Eliminated letters so far: C, R, N, P, S, D, L.

- From feedback:
  - E must be in the word, but cannot be at position 5 (known), position 2 (from delta feedback: E at position 2 got '-', so wrong), and position 3? Not directly, but let's see:

In delta, E at position 2 (guess) was a '-', meaning E is present but not at position 2. Similarly, in crane, E at position 5 was wrong. What about position 1 and 3? E must be at position 1 or position 3.

Also, from crane: A was at position 3 and got '-', meaning A is present but not at position 3. But now we know A is at position 5, so that's consistent.

So, E can only be at position 1 or 3? Because:
- Position 2: eliminated from delta feedback.
- Position 5: eliminated early because the word ends with A.
- Position 4: is T.

Therefore, E must be either in position 1 or position 3.

Now, we have positions 1,2,3 to figure out:
- Position 3 might be E? Or position 1 might be E? And position 2 is some new letter.

Additionally, we know that:
- The word contains A, E, T, and two more letters? Since it has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4=T,5=A.

Wait: we know T and A are in positions 4 and 5, so letters 1,2,3 must be the other letters, which include E and two more? But E is already present, so the two more letters could be repeats? Or new.

But we don't have duplicates so far? We need to consider.

From the feedback, we have E present, and it must be at 1 or 3.

The letter at position 3 from crane was A (guess) and got '-', so if E is at position 3? Then that's fine.

Similarly, position 1: could be E or another letter.

But note: in delta, when we had A at position 5 and T at 4, we got E at position 2 wrong? Yes.

Now, for the third guess: delta = [D,E,L,T,A] -> feedback [x,-,x,✓,✓]
We have D(x), L(x), so they are not in the word.

Also, the word: _ _ _ T A

And E must be at 1 or 3.

So possible structures:

1. E at position 1: E _ _ T A
2. E at position 3: _ _ E T A

Position 2 cannot be E.

Now, we need to guess one of these and test the other positions.

Moreover, we have eliminated: C,R,N,P,S,D,L.

Possible letters for position 2: many, but not eliminated ones.

Common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information.

Also, note that since we only have 3 tries left? After guess 3, we have 3 more guesses? Actually, we've used 3, so 3 left.

We can try to guess a word that covers E at 1 or E at 3 and tests common consonants.

But let's consider: if E is at position 1, then we have E _ X T A. Where X is the letter at position 3, which could be E? But if E is at 1, it might be the same E at 1? So we don't expect two E's? Unless the word has two E's? Possible.

Similarly, if E is at 3: then pattern: _ Y E T A.

But we don't know if there are repeated letters.

First, let's assume no repeated letters for simplicity? Since we haven't encountered duplicates yet? Wait, in the feedback, we haven't had any duplicates in guesses? But the secret word might have duplicates.

However, to minimize complexity, let's first try a word without duplicates.

For the pattern: if E is at position 1: E _ _ T A

What are common words? Like ""E? ? TA"" but the third position must be filled.

For example, ""EGGTA"" not a word. ""EJECT"" but C eliminated. ""E V E T A"" but not a word? How about ""EMMET"" but no A? Not.

""E V I T A"" but V,I: ""EVITA"" is a word? But positions: if E at1, V at2, I at3, T at4, A at5: then ""EVITA"". But I is not eliminated? However, S was eliminated? Not necessarily.

Eliminated letters: C,R,N,P,S,D,L.

So V and I are allowed.

But in the secret word, if E is at1, then ""EVITA"" would be a candidate? But wait, we have to guess.

Similarly, for E at position 3: pattern _ _ E T A -> e.g., ""B E T T A"" but T is repeated? Or ""QUETA"" not, ""DIETA"" D eliminated? D is eliminated from delta feedback.

""DELTA"" had D, which is eliminated, so ""DIETA"" would have D? Not allowed.

""FIESTA"" but S eliminated? And positions don't match? We need 5 letters.

Or ""MODEL"" but not matching pattern.

But let's list possible candidates:

For E at 1: ""EXITA""? Not common. ""ENVIA""? Not word. ""EDUCE"" but D and C eliminated? Not.

""EIGHT"" but T at4? ""EIGHT"" is E,I,G,H,T -> position4 is H, not T? So not.

How about ""EMBER"" no A. Not.

It's tough with E at1. Perhaps ""EQUIP"" but Q and P eliminated? P eliminated.

So maybe E at1 is less common? Perhaps E at position 3 is more plausible.

Pattern for E at3: _ _ E T A

Common words: ""QUIET"" no A? ""CATER"" C,R eliminated. ""LATER"" L? Eliminated? L is eliminated from delta feedback? Yes.

""WATER"": W,A,T,E,R? Positions: 1:W,2:A,3:T,4:E,5:R? But we need position4=T? So not matching.

We need position4=T and 5=A.

So words ending with ""TA"" and third letter E? Like ""? ? E T A""

Words: ""ASHET"" not. ""B E T T A"" -> ""BETTA"" which is a word (fish). Pattern: 1:B, 2:E, but wait: 3:T? ""BETTA"": B,E,T,T,A -> so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:A. 

But in our pattern for E at3: the word would be _ _ E T A, so if ""BETTA"", it has E at position 2, not 3? And also has T at position 4? Yes, and T at position 3? So if the secret word is ""BETTA"", then E is at position 2? But we have eliminated position 2 for E? From delta, E at position 2 was present but wrong position? In delta, E was at position 2 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at2. Therefore, E cannot be at position 2, so ""BETTA"" cannot have E at2? Actually, in ""BETTA"", E is at position 2, so it would conflict with delta feedback? Because in delta we guessed E at2 and got '-', meaning E is not at position2? So the secret word cannot have E at position2? Therefore, ""BETTA"" has E at position2, which is invalid? So we can rule it out? But note: delta feedback said E is present but not at position2? Yes.

So E cannot be at position2? Therefore, the word cannot have E at2? So ""BETTA"" is impossible? Also, the pattern only fixes position4=T and position5=A? The rest flexible? But E must be at1 or 3? So ""BETTA"" has E at2, so not possible.

Similarly, another word: ""PIZZA"" no E. Not.

How about ""ARETA""? Not common.

""ONETA""? Place name.

Perhaps ""OLEATE"" too long? No.

Another word: ""METAL"" has T at3? Not.

""PETAL"" P eliminated? And T at3 not4.

Wait, we need words like X Y Z T A, with E at position1 or position3.

Let me think: with E at position3: so first two letters are unknown, and E at3, then T at4, A at5.

Possible words: ""ARETA"" not? How about ""ARE TA"" but ""AREA"" is 4 letters? ""ARETA"" not dictionary.

Maybe ""ALETA"" not common.

How about ""AHETA""? Not.

Perhaps ""UVEA"" not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""QUE T A"" -> ""QUETA"" not English.

Maybe ""FUETE"" not? Not.

Perhaps I missed a word: ""THE TA"" -> ""THETA"" is _ _ E T A? Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. But we need position4=T? Yes, in ""THETA"": position4=T? Position1:T, position2:H, position3:E, position4:T, position5:A.

So the word ""THETA"" has T at position1 and position4? And E at position3.

Now, let's check against our constraints and feedback:

- Position4: T - correct? Yes.
- Position5: A - correct.
- E at position3? Yes.

Check eliminated letters: T,H,E,T,A? T and H: H not eliminated? Eliminated letters: C,R,N,P,S,D,L. H is not eliminated.

Now, check if E at position3 is allowed? Yes, because E must be at1 or3? This uses position3.

Now, did we test position3? In crane, we had A at3 and got '-', but that doesn't relate to E at3? It just means A wasn't at3? But E can be at3 independently.

In delta, we didn't have E at3? So no conflict.

Moreover, position1: in ""THETA"" position1 is T? But we haven't fixed position1? Could be.

But wait: is there a conflict? Previously, T was only at position4? Could there be another T? Yes, possibly? Because we didn't have feedback about multiple T's? But we don't know.

Similarly, A at position5 is fixed.

But in guess3, ""delta"" gave T at4 and A at5 correct, but D,E,L wrong? Yes.

Now, if the word is ""THETA"", then:

- Position1: T? But we had T in guess2: ""paste"" had T at position4? And got T(✓) at4? But not at position3? So T might be elsewhere.

In ""THETA"", T is at position1 and position4? But we haven't tested position1? Similarly.

So let's see if ""THETA"" satisfies all feedback:

- crane: guessed C,R,A,N,E? With feedback A(-) meaning A in word but not position3? In ""THETA"", A is at position5? So not at position3? Good. E(-) meaning E in word but not position5? In ""THETA"", E at position3? So not position5? Good.

- paste: guessed P,A,S,T,E? With A(-) meaning A present but not at position2? In ""THETA"", A is at5? So not at2? Good. E(-) meaning E present but not at position5? Good. T(✓) at position4? Good.

- delta: guessed D,E,L,T,A? With D(x) - not in word? ""THETA"" has D? No? Good. E(-) meaning E not at position2? In ""THETA"", E is at position3? So not position2? Good. L(x) no L? Good. T(✓) and A(✓) for positions4 and5? Good.

So ""THETA"" is a candidate? But we don't know? It's possible.

Similarly, are there others? For E at position3: also ""????"" It might be ""THETA"".

If E at position1: pattern E _ _ T A? Could be ""EJECT"" eliminated? ""EXIST"" S eliminated? ""ETHAL""? Not word? I don't see common words.

""EHT A"" not? So probably E at position3 is more likely.

Another possibility: E at position1: E _ ? T A? For example, ""E X I T A"" -> ""EXITA"" not common? ""ENVOY"" no T? Not.

So likely the word is of the form _ _ E T A, with only E at3.

Common words: ""THETA"" as above, ""CARET"" C eliminated? Not? C,R eliminated? ""BARET"" B,A,R,E,T? R eliminated? ""TARET"" T,A,R,E,T? R eliminated.

""GAMET"" G,A,M,E,T? Positions: 1:G,2:A,3:M,4:E? But we need position4=T? So position4=E? No.

To have position4=T and position5=A, and position3=E, the word must be: [letter1][letter2]ETA.

Like ""THETA"", or ""PLETA""? Not? ""BLETA""? Not?

""THE TA"" -> ""THETA"" is one.

""ATHETA""? Too long? Not 5 letters.

So perhaps ""THETA"" is the only common word? Or ""????""

Another: ""SHE TA"" -> ""SHETA"" not word.

""WHETA"" not.

""CHETA"" C eliminated? Not.

So probably try ""THETA"" as a guess? It might be right.

But we have to guess with testing? Because we might have other possibilities: E at position1? But if we try ""THETA"", and it's not, we get feedback.

Moreover, we have eliminated many letters? Position1 in ""THETA"" is T? Could be.

So let's guess ""THETA"".

To confirm: pattern _ _ E T A? ""THETA"" fits: T in position1? But we don't have conflict? Because we never excluded position1 for T? The T is known at position4? But there could be another T? Yes.

Another possibility: ""DIETA"" but D eliminated? So not.

Therefore, I think ""THETA"" is a good guess.

If E is at1? But ""ETHAL"" not? or ""ETHER"" has R? Eliminated? E,T,H,E,R? Positions not match.

So I'll go with ""THETA"".Thinking algorithmically:

- The word ends with ""..."" + ""TA"" (positions 4 and 5 known).
- E must be at position 1 or 3.
- From ""delta"" feedback: E cannot be at position 2.
- ""THETA"" tests the case where E is at position 3 and includes an untested H. It covers all known constraints and uses only valid letters.

<guess>theta</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Crane** (Guess 1): Eliminated letters - C, R, N. Letters present - A (not position 3), E (not position 5).
- **Paste** (Guess 2): Eliminated letters - P, S. Position confirmed - T at position 4. Letters present - A (not position 2), E (not position 5, confirmed).
- **Delta** (Guess 3): Eliminated letters - D, L. Positions confirmed - T at position 4, A at position 5. E is present but not at position 2.

### Synthesis:
- The secret word must contain **A**, **E**, **T** and end with **TA** (positions 4 and 5 fixed as T and A).
- E cannot be in position 2 (from delta feedback) or position 5 (earlier feedback). Position 4 is T, so E must be in position 1 or 3.
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, P, S, D, L**. Permitted letters include B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Possible patterns:
  - E at position 1: E _ _ T A
  - E at position 3: _ _ E T A
- Common words ending in ""ETA"" (with E in position 3) include **THETA**, which fits the pattern [X][Y]ETA. This tests E in position 3 and introduces a new letter (H) for maximum information.",Guess 4: theta -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) E(✓) T(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
