We are making our first guess. We have no previous feedback to go off of, so we want to pick a word that maximizes the information gained.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and avoiding duplicate letters to cover more possibilities.
 A popular starting word in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it has common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and no duplicates.
 Alternatively, other words like ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are used.

 However, note that the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ for correct letter and position
   - for present but wrong position
   x for absent

 Since we are on the first guess, we can choose a word that has a balanced set of common letters.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it covers five common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We have received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 This tells us:
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.

 Since we have three letters that are present (R, A, E) and two absent (C, N), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, along with two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

 The secret word has 5 letters. The positions we guessed were:
  1: C (absent) -> so position 1 is not C
  2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 2
  3: A (present but wrong position) -> A is in the word but not in position 3
  4: N (absent) -> so position 4 is not N and N is not in the word
  5: E (present but wrong position) -> E is in the word but not in position 5

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C or N (since they are absent).
 - Contains R, A, and E.
 - We have to consider that these letters (R, A, E) cannot be in the positions we guessed in the first attempt? Not exactly: they can be anywhere except the positions where we placed them? Actually, the feedback only tells they are not in the positions we guessed, but they could be in any other position.

 Also, note: the positions are fixed. So R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.

 Additionally, we need two more letters that we don't know. They cannot be C or N (because we know these are absent), and they haven't been tried.

 We should aim to cover more common letters and avoid repeating positions as much as possible.

 Let me think of words that include R, A, E and two other new letters. The new letters should be common consonants or vowels.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, P, etc.

 We also have to consider the positions:

 Constraints:
 - Position 1: not C, and we now know it must be one of the remaining letters (not R because R was in position 2 and that was wrong... wait no: R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, R cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is open. However, note that R was in position 2 and we were told it is in the word but not there. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions. However, we must avoid putting R in position 2 (which we already did and it was wrong). Similarly, A should avoid position 3 and E avoid position 5.

 For our next word, we can try:
 - Putting R in a different position, say position 1 or 4 or 5? (but avoid 2)
 - Putting A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5? but note: position 1 is also open)
 - Putting E in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4)

 However, we can also place one of these letters in the same position if we suspect it might be correct? But the feedback said they were in the word but not in that position, so we should avoid putting them in the same positions.

 For example, we should not put R at position 2 again? Actually, we don't have to avoid it, but we know it's wrong so it would waste a guess. So we avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, and position 5 for E.

 So the forbidden positions:
 - R: avoid position 2
 - A: avoid position 3
 - E: avoid position 5

 We need a word that has R, A, E and two new letters, and the letters are placed such that:
   R not in position 2
   A not in position 3
   E not in position 5

 Also, the word must not contain C or N.

 Let me think of words:

 One common word with R, A, E? And two new letters.

 Possibilities: 
  - Words like ""LATER"", ""ALERT"", ""ALTER"", etc.

 Check ""LATER"":
   L is a new letter (we haven't tried L) and T is new.
   Positions: 
     1: L (not forbidden by previous constraints on R,A,E positions) -> not at the forbidden positions for R,A,E? Actually, we care about R,A,E only: this word has R at position 4, A at position 2, E at position 5.

 But wait: E is at position 5? We were told E is present but not in position 5. Therefore, putting E at position 5 is forbidden? Actually, no: the feedback only said our E was in the word but not at position 5. So it cannot be at position 5? Yes, that's the meaning: the secret word's E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We can, but if we put it at 5 again, we will get an x? No: we'll get a '-' because the letter is present but in the wrong position? Actually, if we put E at a position where the secret word doesn't have it (and we know it cannot be at position 5), then if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get an '-'? Because the letter is still in the word, it's just not at position 5? However, we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 Therefore, it's better to avoid E at position 5.

 Similarly, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""LATER"":
   L (new) at position 1 -> we don't know yet
   A at position 2 -> That's okay because the feedback only said A is not at position 3? But position 2 is allowed? The secret word might have A at position 2? We don't know.
   T (new) at position 3 -> we don't know
   E at position 5 -> But we know the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we will definitely get a '-' for E? Which isn't wrong but doesn't get more information about positions? Also, we waste the chance to test E at a new position.

 Therefore, we might prefer a word that places E in a position we haven't tried (i.e., 1,2,3,4) and similarly for R and A.

 So let me avoid putting A at position 2? Actually, we don't have information about position 2 containing A. It could be, because in our first guess we only know position 3 is not A. Similarly, position 2: we have tried R there and it was wrong, so position 2 could be any letter except those we know are absent? Actually, it's open for A or E?

 Alternatively, consider ""ALTER"":
   Positions: 
     1: A -> but A is avoid in position 3? That doesn't forbid position 1. However, the feedback said the secret word has A, but not at position 3? So putting A at position 1 is acceptable? Yes.
     2: L
     3: T
     4: E -> here we are putting E at position 4 (which is new, so we can test if E is at 4).
     5: R -> R at position 5: which is allowed because R cannot be at position 2? Position 5 is okay.

 However, note: we must have R and E. In ""ALTER"": 
   A at position 1? -> if the word has A at position 1, we can test that.
   R at position 5? -> that avoids position 2.

 But now: what about the presence of R and A: we know they are in the word? Yes. But we are placing A at position 1: which is a new position for A (we had it at position 3 before). Similarly, R at position 5: we had R at position 2 before.

 But note: the secret word cannot have R at position 2? That we know. But position 5 is new? Then we can test if R is at position 5.

 Also, the word ""ALTER"" does not contain C or N? Yes.

 However, we also know that E cannot be at position 5? So if we put R at position 5 and E at position 4? That's acceptable.

 But there's another problem: we must include the letters R, A, E? Yes, and ""ALTER"" has A, L, T, E, R -> so it does have R, A, E? And L, T are new.

 Alternatively, consider ""ALERT"". It's similar.

 Another option: ""IRATE"", but we haven't tried I? It has I, R, A, T, E? Then:
   Positions: I at 1, R at 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we got feedback that R is not in position 2. So ""IRATE"" puts R at position 2? Then we would be putting R in a position we know it's not? So that would be inefficient? We'd get a '-' for R again? So better avoid position 2 for R.

 Similarly, we can try ""STARE"":
   S-T-A-R-E? 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because our first guess had A at position 3 and it was absent? Actually, the feedback was A(-) meaning A is present but not in position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Then putting A at position 3 would be wrong? And we already know that? So we get a '-'? But why? Actually, we don't need to test that again? So we avoid.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at 3? So ""STARE"" would have A at position 3? Which is forbidden? So we avoid.

 Alternatively, ""STEAR"" (but let me check: is that a word? STEER? But STEER has two E's and we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify. However, typically in wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicates yet? Our initial guess ""crane"" didn't have duplicates and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? But we don't know? Actually, the secret word could have duplicates? It's not ruled out.

 But in our feedback, we didn't get any duplicate? But we only had each letter once. Now, to be safe, I'll assume words can have duplicates? But we don't have any evidence.

 Actually, the feedback system: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get tricky? But we are not handling that in the first two guesses? Let's avoid duplicates for now? Because if the word had duplicates, we would have seen multiple '-'? But in our ""crane"" guess, each letter was unique? And we got three '-' so that matches? The secret word having R, A, E? Without duplication? So let's assume at this point that the word has distinct letters? We can try without duplicates unless we get evidence of duplicates.

 So back to ""ALTER""? It has distinct letters? ALTER: A, L, T, E, R -> yes, distinct.

 What about ""TARES""? It has T, A, R, E, S? 

 Check positions:
   We must avoid:
     R: position 2? Avoid? We can put R at other positions: e.g., position 3? We don't know about position 3? But R can be at 1,3,4,5? 
   But also A: avoid position 3.
   E: avoid position 5.

 ""TARES"":
   T (position 1)
   A (position 2) -> acceptable? (since A avoid position 3, so 2 is okay)
   R (position 3) -> acceptable? (R avoid only position 2? 3 is new)
   E (position 4) -> acceptable? (avoid position 5? position 4 is okay)
   S (position 5) -> but then E is at 4? That's okay.

 But note: we are testing E at position 4? Which is new? Then we can get more information.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE""? But we know R is in the word? And O would be a new letter? Then positions: R at 1, O at 2, A at 3? But wait, A cannot be at position 3? So we cannot use A at position 3? Then we avoid ""ROATE"" because we would have to put A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So waste.

 So what words are valid? 

 I think ""STARE"" is common? But I need to put A at position 3? Not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have A at position 3? So avoid?

 How about ""AREAS""? It has duplicate A? We don't want duplicates? Because we have only one A? So we assume distinct? Also, we already know A is present once? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiplicity? We might have to infer? But initially, we have only one A guessed? Then if the word had two A's? Then we would get '-' for both? But we don't have two A's? So we don't know? Better avoid? Also, ""AREAS"" has A at position 1 and 3 and 5? Then we put A at position 3? Forbidden? So it would be inefficient.

 Another idea: ""EARLY""

 EARLY: E, A, R, L, Y? 
 Positions:
   E at 1 -> avoid position 5? but position 1 is okay? And we are testing E at a new position? 
   A at 2 -> allowed (avoid position 3? position 2 is not 3? okay)
   R at 3 -> allowed? we had R at position 2 and avoid that? 3 is new? okay
   L at 4
   Y at 5

 But we have E at position 1? Which we haven't tried? Then we get two new letters L and Y? And we have R, A, E? 

 Let's check the positions against the forbidden ones:
   R: we are putting at position 3? And forbidden only for position 2? So okay.
   A: position 2? This is new? Previously we had A at position 3? So position 2 might be correct? Or might not? We don't know? But we avoid position 3? Not position 2? So okay.
   E: position 1? Previously E was at position 5? Now at 1? Avoids the forbidden position 5? Okay.

 Then we can try ""EARLY"".

 Another alternative: ""ALERT"": 
   A at 1 -> okay? (avoid position 3? 1 is okay)
   L at 2
   E at 3 -> okay? (avoid position 5? but not position 3? So putting E at 3 is okay? Because we had E at position 5 and it was not there? We don't know about position 3 for E? So we can put E at 3? 
   R at 4 -> okay? (only avoid 2? 4 is new)
   T at 5 -> then the letter E? Was placed at 3? 

 But note: E at position 3? That is acceptable? Because we haven't tried E at 3? Yes.

 However, the secret word might have E at position 3? Then we would get a ✓? That's good? Or the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""ALERT"" at position 3 we get a '-'? So we get information? 

 But now: we have to cover more letters? We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E? Now we need to try new letters? So the two new letters in ""ALERT"" are L and T? And ""EARLY"" are L and Y.

 I think both are okay? But I'll go with ""ALERT"" because it places E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? And R at position 4? And A at position 1? 

 But note: A was in position 3 in the first guess and we got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? So could it be at 1? Yes? Then we test that? 

 However, we are not forced to choose any particular word? Both are valid.

 Alternatively, consider ""RAISE"": 
   R at position 1? -> avoid position 2? 1 is okay? 
   A at position 2? -> okay? (avoid position 3? 2 is not 3? okay)
   I at position 3? -> new
   S at position 4? -> new
   E at position 5? -> forbidden? because E avoid position 5? So we cannot have E at 5? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? Avoid.

 So ""RAISE"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? So we choose another.

 I think ""ALERT"" is a good option. Also, ""LATER"" we rejected because of E at 5? So now:

 Final choice: ""ALERT"" 

 Checking: 
   A: placed at 1 -> not avoiding any constraint? Only constraint is A not at 3? So okay? 
   L: new letter, at position 2 -> okay? 
   E: placed at 3 -> avoids the constraint? The constraint for E is not at 5? So 3 is okay? 
   R: placed at 4 -> avoids constraint? constraint: not at 2? Okay? 
   T: new letter, at position 5.

 So we get to test two new letters: L and T? And R, A, E? But we are shifting their positions.

 Also, we avoid repeated letters? So we assume the secret word does not have duplicates? At least we haven't encountered any.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""ALERT"".

 But note: we have not tried letters L and T? So we are testing them? Yes? 

 We might get more information? 

 We'll output: <guess>alert</guess>

 Let's write it.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and N are absent → must exclude C and N
- R, A, and E are present but misplaced → must include R, A, and E, while avoiding their originally guessed positions:
  - R not at position 2
  - A not at position 3
  - E not at position 5

For the next guess:
- Include R, A, E in new positions
- Add two new letters to test common consonants (L and T)
- Ensure no C/N and no duplicates (so far, no evidence of duplicate letters)

**Selected word: ALERT**
- A at pos 1 (not 3, compliant)
- L (new) at pos 2
- E at pos 3 (not 5, compliant)
- R at pos 4 (not 2, compliant)
- T (new) at pos 5

This tests new positions for known letters and explores untried consonants.

<guess>alert</guess>",alert,"We have received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 This tells us:
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.

 Since we have three letters that are present (R, A, E) and two absent (C, N), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, along with two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

 The secret word has 5 letters. The positions we guessed were:
  1: C (absent) -> so position 1 is not C
  2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 2
  3: A (present but wrong position) -> A is in the word but not in position 3
  4: N (absent) -> so position 4 is not N and N is not in the word
  5: E (present but wrong position) -> E is in the word but not in position 5

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C or N (since they are absent).
 - Contains R, A, and E.
 - We have to consider that these letters (R, A, E) cannot be in the positions we guessed in the first attempt? Not exactly: they can be anywhere except the positions where we placed them? Actually, the feedback only tells they are not in the positions we guessed, but they could be in any other position.

 Also, note: the positions are fixed. So R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.

 Additionally, we need two more letters that we don't know. They cannot be C or N (because we know these are absent), and they haven't been tried.

 We should aim to cover more common letters and avoid repeating positions as much as possible.

 Let me think of words that include R, A, E and two other new letters. The new letters should be common consonants or vowels.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, P, etc.

 We also have to consider the positions:

 Constraints:
 - Position 1: not C, and we now know it must be one of the remaining letters (not R because R was in position 2 and that was wrong... wait no: R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, R cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is open. However, note that R was in position 2 and we were told it is in the word but not there. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions. However, we must avoid putting R in position 2 (which we already did and it was wrong). Similarly, A should avoid position 3 and E avoid position 5.

 For our next word, we can try:
 - Putting R in a different position, say position 1 or 4 or 5? (but avoid 2)
 - Putting A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5? but note: position 1 is also open)
 - Putting E in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4)

 However, we can also place one of these letters in the same position if we suspect it might be correct? But the feedback said they were in the word but not in that position, so we should avoid putting them in the same positions.

 For example, we should not put R at position 2 again? Actually, we don't have to avoid it, but we know it's wrong so it would waste a guess. So we avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, and position 5 for E.

 So the forbidden positions:
 - R: avoid position 2
 - A: avoid position 3
 - E: avoid position 5

 We need a word that has R, A, E and two new letters, and the letters are placed such that:
   R not in position 2
   A not in position 3
   E not in position 5

 Also, the word must not contain C or N.

 Let me think of words:

 One common word with R, A, E? And two new letters.

 Possibilities: 
  - Words like ""LATER"", ""ALERT"", ""ALTER"", etc.

 Check ""LATER"":
   L is a new letter (we haven't tried L) and T is new.
   Positions: 
     1: L (not forbidden by previous constraints on R,A,E positions) -> not at the forbidden positions for R,A,E? Actually, we care about R,A,E only: this word has R at position 4, A at position 2, E at position 5.

 But wait: E is at position 5? We were told E is present but not in position 5. Therefore, putting E at position 5 is forbidden? Actually, no: the feedback only said our E was in the word but not at position 5. So it cannot be at position 5? Yes, that's the meaning: the secret word's E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We can, but if we put it at 5 again, we will get an x? No: we'll get a '-' because the letter is present but in the wrong position? Actually, if we put E at a position where the secret word doesn't have it (and we know it cannot be at position 5), then if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get an '-'? Because the letter is still in the word, it's just not at position 5? However, we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 Therefore, it's better to avoid E at position 5.

 Similarly, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""LATER"":
   L (new) at position 1 -> we don't know yet
   A at position 2 -> That's okay because the feedback only said A is not at position 3? But position 2 is allowed? The secret word might have A at position 2? We don't know.
   T (new) at position 3 -> we don't know
   E at position 5 -> But we know the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we will definitely get a '-' for E? Which isn't wrong but doesn't get more information about positions? Also, we waste the chance to test E at a new position.

 Therefore, we might prefer a word that places E in a position we haven't tried (i.e., 1,2,3,4) and similarly for R and A.

 So let me avoid putting A at position 2? Actually, we don't have information about position 2 containing A. It could be, because in our first guess we only know position 3 is not A. Similarly, position 2: we have tried R there and it was wrong, so position 2 could be any letter except those we know are absent? Actually, it's open for A or E?

 Alternatively, consider ""ALTER"":
   Positions: 
     1: A -> but A is avoid in position 3? That doesn't forbid position 1. However, the feedback said the secret word has A, but not at position 3? So putting A at position 1 is acceptable? Yes.
     2: L
     3: T
     4: E -> here we are putting E at position 4 (which is new, so we can test if E is at 4).
     5: R -> R at position 5: which is allowed because R cannot be at position 2? Position 5 is okay.

 However, note: we must have R and E. In ""ALTER"": 
   A at position 1? -> if the word has A at position 1, we can test that.
   R at position 5? -> that avoids position 2.

 But now: what about the presence of R and A: we know they are in the word? Yes. But we are placing A at position 1: which is a new position for A (we had it at position 3 before). Similarly, R at position 5: we had R at position 2 before.

 But note: the secret word cannot have R at position 2? That we know. But position 5 is new? Then we can test if R is at position 5.

 Also, the word ""ALTER"" does not contain C or N? Yes.

 However, we also know that E cannot be at position 5? So if we put R at position 5 and E at position 4? That's acceptable.

 But there's another problem: we must include the letters R, A, E? Yes, and ""ALTER"" has A, L, T, E, R -> so it does have R, A, E? And L, T are new.

 Alternatively, consider ""ALERT"". It's similar.

 Another option: ""IRATE"", but we haven't tried I? It has I, R, A, T, E? Then:
   Positions: I at 1, R at 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we got feedback that R is not in position 2. So ""IRATE"" puts R at position 2? Then we would be putting R in a position we know it's not? So that would be inefficient? We'd get a '-' for R again? So better avoid position 2 for R.

 Similarly, we can try ""STARE"":
   S-T-A-R-E? 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because our first guess had A at position 3 and it was absent? Actually, the feedback was A(-) meaning A is present but not in position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Then putting A at position 3 would be wrong? And we already know that? So we get a '-'? But why? Actually, we don't need to test that again? So we avoid.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at 3? So ""STARE"" would have A at position 3? Which is forbidden? So we avoid.

 Alternatively, ""STEAR"" (but let me check: is that a word? STEER? But STEER has two E's and we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify. However, typically in wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicates yet? Our initial guess ""crane"" didn't have duplicates and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? But we don't know? Actually, the secret word could have duplicates? It's not ruled out.

 But in our feedback, we didn't get any duplicate? But we only had each letter once. Now, to be safe, I'll assume words can have duplicates? But we don't have any evidence.

 Actually, the feedback system: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get tricky? But we are not handling that in the first two guesses? Let's avoid duplicates for now? Because if the word had duplicates, we would have seen multiple '-'? But in our ""crane"" guess, each letter was unique? And we got three '-' so that matches? The secret word having R, A, E? Without duplication? So let's assume at this point that the word has distinct letters? We can try without duplicates unless we get evidence of duplicates.

 So back to ""ALTER""? It has distinct letters? ALTER: A, L, T, E, R -> yes, distinct.

 What about ""TARES""? It has T, A, R, E, S? 

 Check positions:
   We must avoid:
     R: position 2? Avoid? We can put R at other positions: e.g., position 3? We don't know about position 3? But R can be at 1,3,4,5? 
   But also A: avoid position 3.
   E: avoid position 5.

 ""TARES"":
   T (position 1)
   A (position 2) -> acceptable? (since A avoid position 3, so 2 is okay)
   R (position 3) -> acceptable? (R avoid only position 2? 3 is new)
   E (position 4) -> acceptable? (avoid position 5? position 4 is okay)
   S (position 5) -> but then E is at 4? That's okay.

 But note: we are testing E at position 4? Which is new? Then we can get more information.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE""? But we know R is in the word? And O would be a new letter? Then positions: R at 1, O at 2, A at 3? But wait, A cannot be at position 3? So we cannot use A at position 3? Then we avoid ""ROATE"" because we would have to put A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So waste.

 So what words are valid? 

 I think ""STARE"" is common? But I need to put A at position 3? Not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have A at position 3? So avoid?

 How about ""AREAS""? It has duplicate A? We don't want duplicates? Because we have only one A? So we assume distinct? Also, we already know A is present once? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiplicity? We might have to infer? But initially, we have only one A guessed? Then if the word had two A's? Then we would get '-' for both? But we don't have two A's? So we don't know? Better avoid? Also, ""AREAS"" has A at position 1 and 3 and 5? Then we put A at position 3? Forbidden? So it would be inefficient.

 Another idea: ""EARLY""

 EARLY: E, A, R, L, Y? 
 Positions:
   E at 1 -> avoid position 5? but position 1 is okay? And we are testing E at a new position? 
   A at 2 -> allowed (avoid position 3? position 2 is not 3? okay)
   R at 3 -> allowed? we had R at position 2 and avoid that? 3 is new? okay
   L at 4
   Y at 5

 But we have E at position 1? Which we haven't tried? Then we get two new letters L and Y? And we have R, A, E? 

 Let's check the positions against the forbidden ones:
   R: we are putting at position 3? And forbidden only for position 2? So okay.
   A: position 2? This is new? Previously we had A at position 3? So position 2 might be correct? Or might not? We don't know? But we avoid position 3? Not position 2? So okay.
   E: position 1? Previously E was at position 5? Now at 1? Avoids the forbidden position 5? Okay.

 Then we can try ""EARLY"".

 Another alternative: ""ALERT"": 
   A at 1 -> okay? (avoid position 3? 1 is okay)
   L at 2
   E at 3 -> okay? (avoid position 5? but not position 3? So putting E at 3 is okay? Because we had E at position 5 and it was not there? We don't know about position 3 for E? So we can put E at 3? 
   R at 4 -> okay? (only avoid 2? 4 is new)
   T at 5 -> then the letter E? Was placed at 3? 

 But note: E at position 3? That is acceptable? Because we haven't tried E at 3? Yes.

 However, the secret word might have E at position 3? Then we would get a ✓? That's good? Or the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""ALERT"" at position 3 we get a '-'? So we get information? 

 But now: we have to cover more letters? We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E? Now we need to try new letters? So the two new letters in ""ALERT"" are L and T? And ""EARLY"" are L and Y.

 I think both are okay? But I'll go with ""ALERT"" because it places E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? And R at position 4? And A at position 1? 

 But note: A was in position 3 in the first guess and we got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? So could it be at 1? Yes? Then we test that? 

 However, we are not forced to choose any particular word? Both are valid.

 Alternatively, consider ""RAISE"": 
   R at position 1? -> avoid position 2? 1 is okay? 
   A at position 2? -> okay? (avoid position 3? 2 is not 3? okay)
   I at position 3? -> new
   S at position 4? -> new
   E at position 5? -> forbidden? because E avoid position 5? So we cannot have E at 5? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? Avoid.

 So ""RAISE"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? So we choose another.

 I think ""ALERT"" is a good option. Also, ""LATER"" we rejected because of E at 5? So now:

 Final choice: ""ALERT"" 

 Checking: 
   A: placed at 1 -> not avoiding any constraint? Only constraint is A not at 3? So okay? 
   L: new letter, at position 2 -> okay? 
   E: placed at 3 -> avoids the constraint? The constraint for E is not at 5? So 3 is okay? 
   R: placed at 4 -> avoids constraint? constraint: not at 2? Okay? 
   T: new letter, at position 5.

 So we get to test two new letters: L and T? And R, A, E? But we are shifting their positions.

 Also, we avoid repeated letters? So we assume the secret word does not have duplicates? At least we haven't encountered any.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""ALERT"".

 But note: we have not tried letters L and T? So we are testing them? Yes? 

 We might get more information? 

 We'll output: <guess>alert</guess>

 Let's write it.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and N are absent → must exclude C and N
- R, A, and E are present but misplaced → must include R, A, and E, while avoiding their originally guessed positions:
  - R not at position 2
  - A not at position 3
  - E not at position 5

For the next guess:
- Include R, A, E in new positions
- Add two new letters to test common consonants (L and T)
- Ensure no C/N and no duplicates (so far, no evidence of duplicate letters)

**Selected word: ALERT**
- A at pos 1 (not 3, compliant)
- L (new) at pos 2
- E at pos 3 (not 5, compliant)
- R at pos 4 (not 2, compliant)
- T (new) at pos 5

This tests new positions for known letters and explores untried consonants.",Guess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,avert,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. We have no previous feedback to go off of, so we want to pick a word that maximizes the information gained.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and avoiding duplicate letters to cover more possibilities.
 A popular starting word in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it has common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and no duplicates.
 Alternatively, other words like ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are used.

 However, note that the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ for correct letter and position
   - for present but wrong position
   x for absent

 Since we are on the first guess, we can choose a word that has a balanced set of common letters.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it covers five common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Format our response as <guess>crane</guess>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 This tells us:
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.

 Since we have three letters that are present (R, A, E) and two absent (C, N), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, along with two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

 The secret word has 5 letters. The positions we guessed were:
  1: C (absent) -> so position 1 is not C
  2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 2
  3: A (present but wrong position) -> A is in the word but not in position 3
  4: N (absent) -> so position 4 is not N and N is not in the word
  5: E (present but wrong position) -> E is in the word but not in position 5

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C or N (since they are absent).
 - Contains R, A, and E.
 - We have to consider that these letters (R, A, E) cannot be in the positions we guessed in the first attempt? Not exactly: they can be anywhere except the positions where we placed them? Actually, the feedback only tells they are not in the positions we guessed, but they could be in any other position.

 Also, note: the positions are fixed. So R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.

 Additionally, we need two more letters that we don't know. They cannot be C or N (because we know these are absent), and they haven't been tried.

 We should aim to cover more common letters and avoid repeating positions as much as possible.

 Let me think of words that include R, A, E and two other new letters. The new letters should be common consonants or vowels.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, P, etc.

 We also have to consider the positions:

 Constraints:
 - Position 1: not C, and we now know it must be one of the remaining letters (not R because R was in position 2 and that was wrong... wait no: R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, R cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is open. However, note that R was in position 2 and we were told it is in the word but not there. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions. However, we must avoid putting R in position 2 (which we already did and it was wrong). Similarly, A should avoid position 3 and E avoid position 5.

 For our next word, we can try:
 - Putting R in a different position, say position 1 or 4 or 5? (but avoid 2)
 - Putting A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5? but note: position 1 is also open)
 - Putting E in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4)

 However, we can also place one of these letters in the same position if we suspect it might be correct? But the feedback said they were in the word but not in that position, so we should avoid putting them in the same positions.

 For example, we should not put R at position 2 again? Actually, we don't have to avoid it, but we know it's wrong so it would waste a guess. So we avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, and position 5 for E.

 So the forbidden positions:
 - R: avoid position 2
 - A: avoid position 3
 - E: avoid position 5

 We need a word that has R, A, E and two new letters, and the letters are placed such that:
   R not in position 2
   A not in position 3
   E not in position 5

 Also, the word must not contain C or N.

 Let me think of words:

 One common word with R, A, E? And two new letters.

 Possibilities: 
  - Words like ""LATER"", ""ALERT"", ""ALTER"", etc.

 Check ""LATER"":
   L is a new letter (we haven't tried L) and T is new.
   Positions: 
     1: L (not forbidden by previous constraints on R,A,E positions) -> not at the forbidden positions for R,A,E? Actually, we care about R,A,E only: this word has R at position 4, A at position 2, E at position 5.

 But wait: E is at position 5? We were told E is present but not in position 5. Therefore, putting E at position 5 is forbidden? Actually, no: the feedback only said our E was in the word but not at position 5. So it cannot be at position 5? Yes, that's the meaning: the secret word's E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We can, but if we put it at 5 again, we will get an x? No: we'll get a '-' because the letter is present but in the wrong position? Actually, if we put E at a position where the secret word doesn't have it (and we know it cannot be at position 5), then if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get an '-'? Because the letter is still in the word, it's just not at position 5? However, we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 Therefore, it's better to avoid E at position 5.

 Similarly, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""LATER"":
   L (new) at position 1 -> we don't know yet
   A at position 2 -> That's okay because the feedback only said A is not at position 3? But position 2 is allowed? The secret word might have A at position 2? We don't know.
   T (new) at position 3 -> we don't know
   E at position 5 -> But we know the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we will definitely get a '-' for E? Which isn't wrong but doesn't get more information about positions? Also, we waste the chance to test E at a new position.

 Therefore, we might prefer a word that places E in a position we haven't tried (i.e., 1,2,3,4) and similarly for R and A.

 So let me avoid putting A at position 2? Actually, we don't have information about position 2 containing A. It could be, because in our first guess we only know position 3 is not A. Similarly, position 2: we have tried R there and it was wrong, so position 2 could be any letter except those we know are absent? Actually, it's open for A or E?

 Alternatively, consider ""ALTER"":
   Positions: 
     1: A -> but A is avoid in position 3? That doesn't forbid position 1. However, the feedback said the secret word has A, but not at position 3? So putting A at position 1 is acceptable? Yes.
     2: L
     3: T
     4: E -> here we are putting E at position 4 (which is new, so we can test if E is at 4).
     5: R -> R at position 5: which is allowed because R cannot be at position 2? Position 5 is okay.

 However, note: we must have R and E. In ""ALTER"": 
   A at position 1? -> if the word has A at position 1, we can test that.
   R at position 5? -> that avoids position 2.

 But now: what about the presence of R and A: we know they are in the word? Yes. But we are placing A at position 1: which is a new position for A (we had it at position 3 before). Similarly, R at position 5: we had R at position 2 before.

 But note: the secret word cannot have R at position 2? That we know. But position 5 is new? Then we can test if R is at position 5.

 Also, the word ""ALTER"" does not contain C or N? Yes.

 However, we also know that E cannot be at position 5? So if we put R at position 5 and E at position 4? That's acceptable.

 But there's another problem: we must include the letters R, A, E? Yes, and ""ALTER"" has A, L, T, E, R -> so it does have R, A, E? And L, T are new.

 Alternatively, consider ""ALERT"". It's similar.

 Another option: ""IRATE"", but we haven't tried I? It has I, R, A, T, E? Then:
   Positions: I at 1, R at 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we got feedback that R is not in position 2. So ""IRATE"" puts R at position 2? Then we would be putting R in a position we know it's not? So that would be inefficient? We'd get a '-' for R again? So better avoid position 2 for R.

 Similarly, we can try ""STARE"":
   S-T-A-R-E? 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because our first guess had A at position 3 and it was absent? Actually, the feedback was A(-) meaning A is present but not in position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Then putting A at position 3 would be wrong? And we already know that? So we get a '-'? But why? Actually, we don't need to test that again? So we avoid.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at 3? So ""STARE"" would have A at position 3? Which is forbidden? So we avoid.

 Alternatively, ""STEAR"" (but let me check: is that a word? STEER? But STEER has two E's and we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify. However, typically in wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicates yet? Our initial guess ""crane"" didn't have duplicates and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? But we don't know? Actually, the secret word could have duplicates? It's not ruled out.

 But in our feedback, we didn't get any duplicate? But we only had each letter once. Now, to be safe, I'll assume words can have duplicates? But we don't have any evidence.

 Actually, the feedback system: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get tricky? But we are not handling that in the first two guesses? Let's avoid duplicates for now? Because if the word had duplicates, we would have seen multiple '-'? But in our ""crane"" guess, each letter was unique? And we got three '-' so that matches? The secret word having R, A, E? Without duplication? So let's assume at this point that the word has distinct letters? We can try without duplicates unless we get evidence of duplicates.

 So back to ""ALTER""? It has distinct letters? ALTER: A, L, T, E, R -> yes, distinct.

 What about ""TARES""? It has T, A, R, E, S? 

 Check positions:
   We must avoid:
     R: position 2? Avoid? We can put R at other positions: e.g., position 3? We don't know about position 3? But R can be at 1,3,4,5? 
   But also A: avoid position 3.
   E: avoid position 5.

 ""TARES"":
   T (position 1)
   A (position 2) -> acceptable? (since A avoid position 3, so 2 is okay)
   R (position 3) -> acceptable? (R avoid only position 2? 3 is new)
   E (position 4) -> acceptable? (avoid position 5? position 4 is okay)
   S (position 5) -> but then E is at 4? That's okay.

 But note: we are testing E at position 4? Which is new? Then we can get more information.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE""? But we know R is in the word? And O would be a new letter? Then positions: R at 1, O at 2, A at 3? But wait, A cannot be at position 3? So we cannot use A at position 3? Then we avoid ""ROATE"" because we would have to put A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So waste.

 So what words are valid? 

 I think ""STARE"" is common? But I need to put A at position 3? Not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have A at position 3? So avoid?

 How about ""AREAS""? It has duplicate A? We don't want duplicates? Because we have only one A? So we assume distinct? Also, we already know A is present once? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiplicity? We might have to infer? But initially, we have only one A guessed? Then if the word had two A's? Then we would get '-' for both? But we don't have two A's? So we don't know? Better avoid? Also, ""AREAS"" has A at position 1 and 3 and 5? Then we put A at position 3? Forbidden? So it would be inefficient.

 Another idea: ""EARLY""

 EARLY: E, A, R, L, Y? 
 Positions:
   E at 1 -> avoid position 5? but position 1 is okay? And we are testing E at a new position? 
   A at 2 -> allowed (avoid position 3? position 2 is not 3? okay)
   R at 3 -> allowed? we had R at position 2 and avoid that? 3 is new? okay
   L at 4
   Y at 5

 But we have E at position 1? Which we haven't tried? Then we get two new letters L and Y? And we have R, A, E? 

 Let's check the positions against the forbidden ones:
   R: we are putting at position 3? And forbidden only for position 2? So okay.
   A: position 2? This is new? Previously we had A at position 3? So position 2 might be correct? Or might not? We don't know? But we avoid position 3? Not position 2? So okay.
   E: position 1? Previously E was at position 5? Now at 1? Avoids the forbidden position 5? Okay.

 Then we can try ""EARLY"".

 Another alternative: ""ALERT"": 
   A at 1 -> okay? (avoid position 3? 1 is okay)
   L at 2
   E at 3 -> okay? (avoid position 5? but not position 3? So putting E at 3 is okay? Because we had E at position 5 and it was not there? We don't know about position 3 for E? So we can put E at 3? 
   R at 4 -> okay? (only avoid 2? 4 is new)
   T at 5 -> then the letter E? Was placed at 3? 

 But note: E at position 3? That is acceptable? Because we haven't tried E at 3? Yes.

 However, the secret word might have E at position 3? Then we would get a ✓? That's good? Or the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""ALERT"" at position 3 we get a '-'? So we get information? 

 But now: we have to cover more letters? We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E? Now we need to try new letters? So the two new letters in ""ALERT"" are L and T? And ""EARLY"" are L and Y.

 I think both are okay? But I'll go with ""ALERT"" because it places E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? And R at position 4? And A at position 1? 

 But note: A was in position 3 in the first guess and we got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? So could it be at 1? Yes? Then we test that? 

 However, we are not forced to choose any particular word? Both are valid.

 Alternatively, consider ""RAISE"": 
   R at position 1? -> avoid position 2? 1 is okay? 
   A at position 2? -> okay? (avoid position 3? 2 is not 3? okay)
   I at position 3? -> new
   S at position 4? -> new
   E at position 5? -> forbidden? because E avoid position 5? So we cannot have E at 5? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? Avoid.

 So ""RAISE"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? So we choose another.

 I think ""ALERT"" is a good option. Also, ""LATER"" we rejected because of E at 5? So now:

 Final choice: ""ALERT"" 

 Checking: 
   A: placed at 1 -> not avoiding any constraint? Only constraint is A not at 3? So okay? 
   L: new letter, at position 2 -> okay? 
   E: placed at 3 -> avoids the constraint? The constraint for E is not at 5? So 3 is okay? 
   R: placed at 4 -> avoids constraint? constraint: not at 2? Okay? 
   T: new letter, at position 5.

 So we get to test two new letters: L and T? And R, A, E? But we are shifting their positions.

 Also, we avoid repeated letters? So we assume the secret word does not have duplicates? At least we haven't encountered any.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""ALERT"".

 But note: we have not tried letters L and T? So we are testing them? Yes? 

 We might get more information? 

 We'll output: <guess>alert</guess>

 Let's write it.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and N are absent → must exclude C and N
- R, A, and E are present but misplaced → must include R, A, and E, while avoiding their originally guessed positions:
  - R not at position 2
  - A not at position 3
  - E not at position 5

For the next guess:
- Include R, A, E in new positions
- Add two new letters to test common consonants (L and T)
- Ensure no C/N and no duplicates (so far, no evidence of duplicate letters)

**Selected word: ALERT**
- A at pos 1 (not 3, compliant)
- L (new) at pos 2
- E at pos 3 (not 5, compliant)
- R at pos 4 (not 2, compliant)
- T (new) at pos 5

This tests new positions for known letters and explores untried consonants.

The positions we guessed were:\n  1: C (absent) -> so position 1 is not C\n  2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 2\n  3: A (present but wrong position) -> A is in the word but not in position 3\n  4: N (absent) -> so position 4 is not N and N is not in the word\n  5: E (present but wrong position) -> E is in the word but not in position 5\n\n Therefore, we must choose a new word that:\n - Does not contain C or N (since they are absent).\n - Contains R, A, and E.\n - We have to consider that these letters (R, A, E) cannot be in the positions we guessed in the first attempt? Not exactly: they can be anywhere except the positions where we placed them? Actually, the feedback only tells they are not in the positions we guessed, but they could be in any other position.\n\n Also, note: the positions are fixed. So R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.\n\n Additionally, we need two more letters that we don\'t know. They cannot be C or N (because we know these are absent), and they haven\'t been tried.\n\n We should aim to cover more common letters and avoid repeating positions as much as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that include R, A, E and two other new letters. The new letters should be common consonants or vowels.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, P, etc.\n\n We also have to consider the positions:\n\n Constraints:\n - Position 1: not C, and we now know it must be one of the remaining letters (not R because R was in position 2 and that was wrong... wait no: R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, R cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is open. However, note that R was in position 2 and we were told it is in the word but not there. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions. However, we must avoid putting R in position 2 (which we already did and it was wrong). Similarly, A should avoid position 3 and E avoid position 5.\n\n For our next word, we can try:\n - Putting R in a different position, say position 1 or 4 or 5? (but avoid 2)\n - Putting A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5? but note: position 1 is also open)\n - Putting E in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4)\n\n However, we can also place one of these letters in the same position if we suspect it might be correct? But the feedback said they were in the word but not in that position, so we should avoid putting them in the same positions.\n\n For example, we should not put R at position 2 again? Actually, we don\'t have to avoid it, but we know it\'s wrong so it would waste a guess. So we avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, and position 5 for E.\n\n So the forbidden positions:\n - R: avoid position 2\n - A: avoid position 3\n - E: avoid position 5\n\n We need a word that has R, A, E and two new letters, and the letters are placed such that:\n   R not in position 2\n   A not in position 3\n   E not in position 5\n\n Also, the word must not contain C or N.\n\n Let me think of words:\n\n One common word with R, A, E? And two new letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n  - Words like ""LATER"", ""ALERT"", ""ALTER"", etc.\n\n Check ""LATER"":\n   L is a new letter (we haven\'t tried L) and T is new.\n   Positions: \n     1: L (not forbidden by previous constraints on R,A,E positions) -> not at the forbidden positions for R,A,E? Actually, we care about R,A,E only: this word has R at position 4, A at position 2, E at position 5.\n\n But wait: E is at position 5? We were told E is present but not in position 5. Therefore, putting E at position 5 is forbidden? Actually, no: the feedback only said our E was in the word but not at position 5. So it cannot be at position 5? Yes, that\'s the meaning: the secret word\'s E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We can, but if we put it at 5 again, we will get an x? No: we\'ll get a \'-\' because the letter is present but in the wrong position? Actually, if we put E at a position where the secret word doesn\'t have it (and we know it cannot be at position 5), then if we put E at position 5 again, we\'ll get an \'-\'? Because the letter is still in the word, it\'s just not at position 5? However, we know it\'s wrong, so it would be inefficient.\n\n Therefore, it\'s better to avoid E at position 5.\n\n Similarly, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n In ""LATER"":\n   L (new) at position 1 -> we don\'t know yet\n   A at position 2 -> That\'s okay because the feedback only said A is not at position 3? But position 2 is allowed? The secret word might have A at position 2? We don\'t know.\n   T (new) at position 3 -> we don\'t know\n   E at position 5 -> But we know the secret word\'s E is not at position 5? So we will definitely get a \'-\' for E? Which isn\'t wrong but doesn\'t get more information about positions? Also, we waste the chance to test E at a new position.\n\n Therefore, we might prefer a word that places E in a position we haven\'t tried (i.e., 1,2,3,4) and similarly for R and A.\n\n So let me avoid putting A at position 2? Actually, we don\'t have information about position 2 containing A. It could be, because in our first guess we only know position 3 is not A. Similarly, position 2: we have tried R there and it was wrong, so position 2 could be any letter except those we know are absent? Actually, it\'s open for A or E?\n\n Alternatively, consider ""ALTER"":\n   Positions: \n     1: A -> but A is avoid in position 3? That doesn\'t forbid position 1. However, the feedback said the secret word has A, but not at position 3? So putting A at position 1 is acceptable? Yes.\n     2: L\n     3: T\n     4: E -> here we are putting E at position 4 (which is new, so we can test if E is at 4).\n     5: R -> R at position 5: which is allowed because R cannot be at position 2? Position 5 is okay.\n\n However, note: we must have R and E. In ""ALTER"": \n   A at position 1? -> if the word has A at position 1, we can test that.\n   R at position 5? -> that avoids position 2.\n\n But now: what about the presence of R and A: we know they are in the word? Yes. But we are placing A at position 1: which is a new position for A (we had it at position 3 before). Similarly, R at position 5: we had R at position 2 before.\n\n But note: the secret word cannot have R at position 2? That we know. But position 5 is new? Then we can test if R is at position 5.\n\n Also, the word ""ALTER"" does not contain C or N? Yes.\n\n However, we also know that E cannot be at position 5? So if we put R at position 5 and E at position 4? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But there\'s another problem: we must include the letters R, A, E? Yes, and ""ALTER"" has A, L, T, E, R -> so it does have R, A, E? And L, T are new.\n\n Alternatively, consider ""ALERT"". It\'s similar.\n\n Another option: ""IRATE"", but we haven\'t tried I? It has I, R, A, T, E? Then:\n   Positions: I at 1, R at 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we got feedback that R is not in position 2. So ""IRATE"" puts R at position 2? Then we would be putting R in a position we know it\'s not? So that would be inefficient? We\'d get a \'-\' for R again? So better avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Similarly, we can try ""STARE"":\n   S-T-A-R-E? \n   Positions:\n     1: S\n     2: T\n     3: A -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because our first guess had A at position 3 and it was absent? Actually, the feedback was A(-) meaning A is present but not in position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Then putting A at position 3 would be wrong? And we already know that? So we get a \'-\'? But why? Actually, we don\'t need to test that again? So we avoid.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting A at 3? So ""STARE"" would have A at position 3? Which is forbidden? So we avoid.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEAR"" (but let me check: is that a word? STEER? But STEER has two E\'s and we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t specify. However, typically in wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicates yet? Our initial guess ""crane"" didn\'t have duplicates and the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates? But we don\'t know? Actually, the secret word could have duplicates? It\'s not ruled out.\n\n But in our feedback, we didn\'t get any duplicate? But we only had each letter once. Now, to be safe, I\'ll assume words can have duplicates? But we don\'t have any evidence.\n\n Actually, the feedback system: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get tricky? But we are not handling that in the first two guesses? Let\'s avoid duplicates for now? Because if the word had duplicates, we would have seen multiple \'-\'? But in our ""crane"" guess, each letter was unique? And we got three \'-\' so that matches? The secret word having R, A, E? Without duplication? So let\'s assume at this point that the word has distinct letters? We can try without duplicates unless we get evidence of duplicates.\n\n So back to ""ALTER""? It has distinct letters? ALTER: A, L, T, E, R -> yes, distinct.\n\n What about ""TARES""? It has T, A, R, E, S? \n\n Check positions:\n   We must avoid:\n     R: position 2? Avoid? We can put R at other positions: e.g., position 3? We don\'t know about position 3? But R can be at 1,3,4,5? \n   But also A: avoid position 3.\n   E: avoid position 5.\n\n ""TARES"":\n   T (position 1)\n   A (position 2) -> acceptable? (since A avoid position 3, so 2 is okay)\n   R (position 3) -> acceptable? (R avoid only position 2? 3 is new)\n   E (position 4) -> acceptable? (avoid position 5? position 4 is okay)\n   S (position 5) -> but then E is at 4? That\'s okay.\n\n But note: we are testing E at position 4? Which is new? Then we can get more information.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE""? But we know R is in the word? And O would be a new letter? Then positions: R at 1, O at 2, A at 3? But wait, A cannot be at position 3? So we cannot use A at position 3? Then we avoid ""ROATE"" because we would have to put A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So waste.\n\n So what words are valid? \n\n I think ""STARE"" is common? But I need to put A at position 3? Not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn\'t have A at position 3? So avoid?\n\n How about ""AREAS""? It has duplicate A? We don\'t want duplicates? Because we have only one A? So we assume distinct? Also, we already know A is present once? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiplicity? We might have to infer? But initially, we have only one A guessed? Then if the word had two A\'s? Then we would get \'-\' for both? But we don\'t have two A\'s? So we don\'t know? Better avoid? Also, ""AREAS"" has A at position 1 and 3 and 5? Then we put A at position 3? Forbidden? So it would be inefficient.\n\n Another idea: ""EARLY""\n\n EARLY: E, A, R, L, Y? \n Positions:\n   E at 1 -> avoid position 5? but position 1 is okay? And we are testing E at a new position? \n   A at 2 -> allowed (avoid position 3? position 2 is not 3? okay)\n   R at 3 -> allowed? we had R at position 2 and avoid that? 3 is new? okay\n   L at 4\n   Y at 5\n\n But we have E at position 1? Which we haven\'t tried? Then we get two new letters L and Y? And we have R, A, E? \n\n Let\'s check the positions against the forbidden ones:\n   R: we are putting at position 3? And forbidden only for position 2? So okay.\n   A: position 2? This is new? Previously we had A at position 3? So position 2 might be correct? Or might not? We don\'t know? But we avoid position 3? Not position 2? So okay.\n   E: position 1? Previously E was at position 5? Now at 1? Avoids the forbidden position 5? Okay.\n\n Then we can try ""EARLY"".\n\n Another alternative: ""ALERT"": \n   A at 1 -> okay? (avoid position 3? 1 is okay)\n   L at 2\n   E at 3 -> okay? (avoid position 5? but not position 3? So putting E at 3 is okay? Because we had E at position 5 and it was not there? We don\'t know about position 3 for E? So we can put E at 3? \n   R at 4 -> okay? (only avoid 2? 4 is new)\n   T at 5 -> then the letter E? Was placed at 3? \n\n But note: E at position 3? That is acceptable? Because we haven\'t tried E at 3? Yes.\n\n However, the secret word might have E at position 3? Then we would get a ✓? That\'s good? Or the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""ALERT"" at position 3 we get a \'-\'? So we get information? \n\n But now: we have to cover more letters? We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E? Now we need to try new letters? So the two new letters in ""ALERT"" are L and T? And ""EARLY"" are L and Y.\n\n I think both are okay? But I\'ll go with ""ALERT"" because it places E at position 3? Which we haven\'t tried? And R at position 4? And A at position 1? \n\n But note: A was in position 3 in the first guess and we got \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 3? So could it be at 1? Yes? Then we test that? \n\n However, we are not forced to choose any particular word? Both are valid.\n\n Alternatively, consider ""RAISE"": \n   R at position 1? -> avoid position 2? 1 is okay? \n   A at position 2? -> okay? (avoid position 3? 2 is not 3? okay)\n   I at position 3? -> new\n   S at position 4? -> new\n   E at position 5? -> forbidden? because E avoid position 5? So we cannot have E at 5? Then we get a \'-\'? Which we already know? So inefficient? Avoid.\n\n So ""RAISE"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? So we choose another.\n\n I think ""ALERT"" is a good option. Also, ""LATER"" we rejected because of E at 5? So now:\n\n Final choice: ""ALERT"" \n\n Checking: \n   A: placed at 1 -> not avoiding any constraint? Only constraint is A not at 3? So okay? \n   L: new letter, at position 2 -> okay? \n   E: placed at 3 -> avoids the constraint? The constraint for E is not at 5? So 3 is okay? \n   R: placed at 4 -> avoids constraint? constraint: not at 2? Okay? \n   T: new letter, at position 5.\n\n So we get to test two new letters: L and T? And R, A, E? But we are shifting their positions.\n\n Also, we avoid repeated letters? So we assume the secret word does not have duplicates? At least we haven\'t encountered any.\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""ALERT"".\n\n But note: we have not tried letters L and T? So we are testing them? Yes? \n\n We might get more information? \n\n We\'ll output: <guess>alert</guess>\n\n Let\'s write it.Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- C and N are absent → must exclude C and N\n- R, A, and E are present but misplaced → must include R, A, and E, while avoiding their originally guessed positions:\n  - R not at position 2\n  - A not at position 3\n  - E not at position 5\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Include R, A, E in new positions\n- Add two new letters to test common consonants (L and T)\n- Ensure no C/N and no duplicates (so far, no evidence of duplicate letters)\n\n**Selected word: ALERT**\n- A at pos 1 (not 3, compliant)\n- L (new) at pos 2\n- E at pos 3 (not 5, compliant)\n- R at pos 4 (not 2, compliant)\n- T (new) at pos 5\n\nThis tests new positions for known letters and explores untried consonants.\n\n<guess>alert</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C and N are absent.
- R, A, E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
  - R is not at position 2.
  - A is not at position 3.
  - E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(✓), L(x), E(✓), R(✓), T(✓)
Meaning:
- A is correct at position 1 (since we got ✓ for A at position 1).
- E is correct at position 3 (since we got ✓ for E at position 3).
- R is correct at position 4 (since we got ✓ for R at position 4).
- T is correct at position 5 (since we got ✓ for T at position 5).
- L is absent (x) from the word.

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1, E at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.
- The letter L is not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the word contains R, A, E (which we now know the positions for) and that C and N are absent.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: A _ E R T

We are missing the second letter.

We know the second letter cannot be:
- C, N, L (because they are absent)
- Also, from guess 1, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced (so R is in the word but not at position 2, which we now know because R is at position 4). Similarly, A and E were misplaced in the first guess but now we know their correct positions.

The second letter must be a letter that we haven't eliminated and that is not in the set of absent letters: C, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have placed) and one more letter (the second position) and we know T is also in the word (from the second guess) and placed at position 5.

But note: the word has 5 letters. We have A, [missing], E, R, T.

So the missing letter is the second letter.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What could the second letter be?

We have to consider that in the first guess, we had the letter A at position 3 and it was misplaced. Now we have A at position 1 and it's correct. Similarly, E was at position 5 and misplaced, now at position 3 and correct. R was at position 2 and misplaced, now at position 4 and correct.

The second letter must be a letter that is not C, N, L, and also not A, E, R, T (because we have those letters already in their positions? But wait, could there be duplicate letters? We don't have evidence of duplicates. In the feedback for ""alert"", we have A, E, R, T as correct and L absent. The secret word has A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5, and one more letter at 2. Since we have no duplicates so far, we assume the second letter is a new letter that is not A, E, R, T.

But note: the first guess had R, A, E and we now have them placed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback for ""alert"", we have:
- A at 1: ✓ (so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? But we didn't test any other positions for A? Actually, we only tested one A. Similarly for E, R, T. So duplicates are still possible? But we have no indication.

Given that we have four letters fixed and one missing, and we have eliminated C, N, L, we can try to think of words that fit A _ E R T.

Common English words with this pattern: 
- After? But we know that F is a possible letter? And we haven't tried F? But we must check if F is eliminated? We haven't eliminated F.
- Alter? But we have L eliminated? So ""alter"" has L? But we know L is absent? So ""alter"" is not possible.
- Amber? But B is not eliminated? But we have M? Also, we have to check the pattern: A M B E R? No, that's 5 letters: A, M, B, E, R? But our pattern is A _ E R T, so the last letter is T, not R? So ""amber"" ends with R, not T.

The pattern is A _ E R T, so the word must end with T.

Possible words: 
- After: A, F, E, R, T -> matches A _ E R T? Let's see: position 1: A, 2: F, 3: E, 4: R, 5: T -> that matches.
- Avert: A, V, E, R, T -> matches.
- Apart: A, P, A, R, T? But that has two A's? And the pattern: position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A? But we have E at position 3? So no, because we need E at position 3? So ""apart"" has A at 1, P at 2, A at 3? But we need E at 3? So not.

We need the third letter to be E? So the word must be A ? E R T.

So the only possibilities are words like:
- After (if F is allowed)
- Avert (if V is allowed)
- Later? But L is eliminated? So no.
- Water? But W is not eliminated? But the first letter is A? So ""water"" starts with W? Not A.
- Aster? But S is not eliminated? And the pattern: A, S, T, E, R? That would be A at 1, S at 2, T at 3? But we need E at 3? So no.

Wait, let's list words that start with A, have E at the third position, R at the fourth, and T at the fifth? And the second letter is to be determined.

So: A ? E R T

Possible second letters? We can try to think of common letters that can go there.

We know the second letter cannot be C, N, L (from previous feedback). Also, it cannot be A, E, R, T? Because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure? However, if we allow duplicates, then the second letter could be A? But then the word would be A A E R T? Is that a word? Not in English? Similarly, E? A E E R T? Not a word. R? A R E R T? Not a word. T? A T E R T? Not a word. So duplicates are unlikely? So we assume the second letter is a new letter.

Therefore, we need a letter that is not in {A, E, R, T, C, N, L}.

Now, from the first guess, we also know that the word contains the letters R, A, E (which we have) and one more letter? Actually, the secret word has five letters: we have four known (A, E, R, T) and one missing? So the missing letter is the only one we don't have? But we also know that the first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We were told that R, A, E are present? So the secret word has R, A, E? And we now have A, E, R, T? So T is an additional letter? That's fine? Because the first guess didn't have T? So the secret word has R, A, E, T, and one more.

Now, what about the feedback from the first guess? We had R at position 2 and it was misplaced? But now we know R is at position 4? So that's consistent? Similarly, A was at position 3 and misplaced? Now we have A at position 1? And E was at position 5 and misplaced? Now we have E at position 3? So all consistent.

Now, the second letter must be a letter that we haven't tried? And not eliminated.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And we know C, N, L are absent? So the set of tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And absent: C, N, L? Present: A, E, R, T? And one more letter (the second position) which is not in the absent set.

So the second letter must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not in {A, E, R, T}? Because we are assuming no duplicates? And we haven't seen duplicates? So we look for a letter that is not in the set of absent and not in the set of already placed.

So available letters: any letter except A, E, R, T, C, N, L.

Now, common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, what words fit A ? E R T?

Possible words:
- AFTER: A, F, E, R, T -> F is available? Yes.
- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> V is available? Yes.
- APERT: but ""apert"" is not a common word? It might be a root? But let's stick to common words? Wordle uses common words.
- ALERT: but we tried that? And L is absent? So not.
- ABERT: not a word.

So the most common words are AFTER and AVERT.

We need to choose one? But we have to make a guess? We can choose either? But note: we have only one missing letter? And we have two possibilities? We can guess one? If it's not correct, we know the other? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can.

But we can also think: is there a way to get more information? But we are at the third guess? And we have four letters fixed? So we can guess one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has both F and V? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and has both? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to fill the second position with one letter.

So we must choose either AFTER or AVERT? Or are there more?

Another word: ""avert"" and ""after"" are the main ones? Also, ""airth""? Not a word? ""award""? But that would be A, W, A, R, D? Doesn't have E at position 3? So no.

So likely: AFTER or AVERT.

We can also consider: did we get any information about F or V? No? So we have to test one.

But note: we have not used many letters? We can try to guess a word that uses one of these and see? But we are forced to have the pattern A ? E R T? So we can only change the second letter.

So we can guess ""after"". If it's not correct, then we try ""avert"".

But we have 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? So we can do that.

Alternatively, we can try to think if there is a word that uses more new letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? We have to have A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? So the second letter is the only one we can vary? So we cannot test multiple new letters? We have to choose one.

Therefore, I'll go with ""after"" because it's a common word.

But let's check the feedback we might get? If we guess ""after"", then:
- If the second letter is F, we get all correct? Then we win? 
- If not, then we know it must be V? Then we guess ""avert"" next.

So we can do that.

But note: we are at guess 3? We can also consider if there are other possibilities? For example, is ""aster"" a word? But ""aster"" has S at position 2 and T at position 3? But we need E at position 3? So no? ""aster"" is A, S, T, E, R? So positions: A(1), S(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need E at 3 and R at 4? So not.

Similarly, ""aegis""? Not matching pattern.

So I think only two possibilities: AFTER and AVERT.

We'll go with ""after"".

But note: we must ensure that F is not eliminated? We haven't tried F? So it's okay.

So the guess is ""after"".

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: A (should be ✓)
Position 2: F (unknown)
Position 3: E (should be ✓)
Position 4: R (should be ✓)
Position 5: T (should be ✓)

So if the word is ""after"", we get all ✓? If not, then we get A(✓), F(x or -? but if F is not in the word, then x? But we know the word must have a letter at position 2? And if it's not F, then we get x for F? But then the second letter must be V? So we can then guess ""avert"" next.

But if we get a ✓ for F? Then we win.

So we output: <guess>after</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x). R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-), meaning:
  - R is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
  - E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (alert)**: 
  - A is correct at position 1 (✓).
  - L is absent (x).
  - E is correct at position 3 (✓).
  - R is correct at position 4 (✓).
  - T is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **A _ E R T** (positions: 1=A, 3=E, 4=R, 5=T).
- The missing letter is at position 2.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, N, L (from feedback).
- **Present/Correct letters (already placed)**: A, E, R, T (so position 2 must be a new letter, not a duplicate).
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern.

### Possible Words:
- Common words matching **A _ E R T**:
  - **AFTER**: Second letter = F (F is untested and not eliminated).
  - **AVERT**: Second letter = V (V is untested and not eliminated).
- Other combinations (e.g., with B, D, S) do not form valid common words (e.g., ""abert"" and ""aster"" are invalid per pattern).

### Strategy:
- With only one unknown letter, guess **AFTER** to test F at position 2.
- If incorrect, the answer must be **AVERT** (next guess).
- This leverages the fixed pattern to resolve the word efficiently.

<guess>after</guess>",after,"We have the feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C and N are absent.
- R, A, E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
  - R is not at position 2.
  - A is not at position 3.
  - E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(✓), L(x), E(✓), R(✓), T(✓)
Meaning:
- A is correct at position 1 (since we got ✓ for A at position 1).
- E is correct at position 3 (since we got ✓ for E at position 3).
- R is correct at position 4 (since we got ✓ for R at position 4).
- T is correct at position 5 (since we got ✓ for T at position 5).
- L is absent (x) from the word.

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1, E at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.
- The letter L is not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the word contains R, A, E (which we now know the positions for) and that C and N are absent.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: A _ E R T

We are missing the second letter.

We know the second letter cannot be:
- C, N, L (because they are absent)
- Also, from guess 1, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced (so R is in the word but not at position 2, which we now know because R is at position 4). Similarly, A and E were misplaced in the first guess but now we know their correct positions.

The second letter must be a letter that we haven't eliminated and that is not in the set of absent letters: C, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have placed) and one more letter (the second position) and we know T is also in the word (from the second guess) and placed at position 5.

But note: the word has 5 letters. We have A, [missing], E, R, T.

So the missing letter is the second letter.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What could the second letter be?

We have to consider that in the first guess, we had the letter A at position 3 and it was misplaced. Now we have A at position 1 and it's correct. Similarly, E was at position 5 and misplaced, now at position 3 and correct. R was at position 2 and misplaced, now at position 4 and correct.

The second letter must be a letter that is not C, N, L, and also not A, E, R, T (because we have those letters already in their positions? But wait, could there be duplicate letters? We don't have evidence of duplicates. In the feedback for ""alert"", we have A, E, R, T as correct and L absent. The secret word has A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5, and one more letter at 2. Since we have no duplicates so far, we assume the second letter is a new letter that is not A, E, R, T.

But note: the first guess had R, A, E and we now have them placed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback for ""alert"", we have:
- A at 1: ✓ (so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? But we didn't test any other positions for A? Actually, we only tested one A. Similarly for E, R, T. So duplicates are still possible? But we have no indication.

Given that we have four letters fixed and one missing, and we have eliminated C, N, L, we can try to think of words that fit A _ E R T.

Common English words with this pattern: 
- After? But we know that F is a possible letter? And we haven't tried F? But we must check if F is eliminated? We haven't eliminated F.
- Alter? But we have L eliminated? So ""alter"" has L? But we know L is absent? So ""alter"" is not possible.
- Amber? But B is not eliminated? But we have M? Also, we have to check the pattern: A M B E R? No, that's 5 letters: A, M, B, E, R? But our pattern is A _ E R T, so the last letter is T, not R? So ""amber"" ends with R, not T.

The pattern is A _ E R T, so the word must end with T.

Possible words: 
- After: A, F, E, R, T -> matches A _ E R T? Let's see: position 1: A, 2: F, 3: E, 4: R, 5: T -> that matches.
- Avert: A, V, E, R, T -> matches.
- Apart: A, P, A, R, T? But that has two A's? And the pattern: position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A? But we have E at position 3? So no, because we need E at position 3? So ""apart"" has A at 1, P at 2, A at 3? But we need E at 3? So not.

We need the third letter to be E? So the word must be A ? E R T.

So the only possibilities are words like:
- After (if F is allowed)
- Avert (if V is allowed)
- Later? But L is eliminated? So no.
- Water? But W is not eliminated? But the first letter is A? So ""water"" starts with W? Not A.
- Aster? But S is not eliminated? And the pattern: A, S, T, E, R? That would be A at 1, S at 2, T at 3? But we need E at 3? So no.

Wait, let's list words that start with A, have E at the third position, R at the fourth, and T at the fifth? And the second letter is to be determined.

So: A ? E R T

Possible second letters? We can try to think of common letters that can go there.

We know the second letter cannot be C, N, L (from previous feedback). Also, it cannot be A, E, R, T? Because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure? However, if we allow duplicates, then the second letter could be A? But then the word would be A A E R T? Is that a word? Not in English? Similarly, E? A E E R T? Not a word. R? A R E R T? Not a word. T? A T E R T? Not a word. So duplicates are unlikely? So we assume the second letter is a new letter.

Therefore, we need a letter that is not in {A, E, R, T, C, N, L}.

Now, from the first guess, we also know that the word contains the letters R, A, E (which we have) and one more letter? Actually, the secret word has five letters: we have four known (A, E, R, T) and one missing? So the missing letter is the only one we don't have? But we also know that the first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We were told that R, A, E are present? So the secret word has R, A, E? And we now have A, E, R, T? So T is an additional letter? That's fine? Because the first guess didn't have T? So the secret word has R, A, E, T, and one more.

Now, what about the feedback from the first guess? We had R at position 2 and it was misplaced? But now we know R is at position 4? So that's consistent? Similarly, A was at position 3 and misplaced? Now we have A at position 1? And E was at position 5 and misplaced? Now we have E at position 3? So all consistent.

Now, the second letter must be a letter that we haven't tried? And not eliminated.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And we know C, N, L are absent? So the set of tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And absent: C, N, L? Present: A, E, R, T? And one more letter (the second position) which is not in the absent set.

So the second letter must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not in {A, E, R, T}? Because we are assuming no duplicates? And we haven't seen duplicates? So we look for a letter that is not in the set of absent and not in the set of already placed.

So available letters: any letter except A, E, R, T, C, N, L.

Now, common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, what words fit A ? E R T?

Possible words:
- AFTER: A, F, E, R, T -> F is available? Yes.
- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> V is available? Yes.
- APERT: but ""apert"" is not a common word? It might be a root? But let's stick to common words? Wordle uses common words.
- ALERT: but we tried that? And L is absent? So not.
- ABERT: not a word.

So the most common words are AFTER and AVERT.

We need to choose one? But we have to make a guess? We can choose either? But note: we have only one missing letter? And we have two possibilities? We can guess one? If it's not correct, we know the other? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can.

But we can also think: is there a way to get more information? But we are at the third guess? And we have four letters fixed? So we can guess one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has both F and V? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and has both? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to fill the second position with one letter.

So we must choose either AFTER or AVERT? Or are there more?

Another word: ""avert"" and ""after"" are the main ones? Also, ""airth""? Not a word? ""award""? But that would be A, W, A, R, D? Doesn't have E at position 3? So no.

So likely: AFTER or AVERT.

We can also consider: did we get any information about F or V? No? So we have to test one.

But note: we have not used many letters? We can try to guess a word that uses one of these and see? But we are forced to have the pattern A ? E R T? So we can only change the second letter.

So we can guess ""after"". If it's not correct, then we try ""avert"".

But we have 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? So we can do that.

Alternatively, we can try to think if there is a word that uses more new letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? We have to have A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? So the second letter is the only one we can vary? So we cannot test multiple new letters? We have to choose one.

Therefore, I'll go with ""after"" because it's a common word.

But let's check the feedback we might get? If we guess ""after"", then:
- If the second letter is F, we get all correct? Then we win? 
- If not, then we know it must be V? Then we guess ""avert"" next.

So we can do that.

But note: we are at guess 3? We can also consider if there are other possibilities? For example, is ""aster"" a word? But ""aster"" has S at position 2 and T at position 3? But we need E at position 3? So no? ""aster"" is A, S, T, E, R? So positions: A(1), S(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need E at 3 and R at 4? So not.

Similarly, ""aegis""? Not matching pattern.

So I think only two possibilities: AFTER and AVERT.

We'll go with ""after"".

But note: we must ensure that F is not eliminated? We haven't tried F? So it's okay.

So the guess is ""after"".

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: A (should be ✓)
Position 2: F (unknown)
Position 3: E (should be ✓)
Position 4: R (should be ✓)
Position 5: T (should be ✓)

So if the word is ""after"", we get all ✓? If not, then we get A(✓), F(x or -? but if F is not in the word, then x? But we know the word must have a letter at position 2? And if it's not F, then we get x for F? But then the second letter must be V? So we can then guess ""avert"" next.

But if we get a ✓ for F? Then we win.

So we output: <guess>after</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x). R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-), meaning:
  - R is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
  - E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (alert)**: 
  - A is correct at position 1 (✓).
  - L is absent (x).
  - E is correct at position 3 (✓).
  - R is correct at position 4 (✓).
  - T is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **A _ E R T** (positions: 1=A, 3=E, 4=R, 5=T).
- The missing letter is at position 2.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, N, L (from feedback).
- **Present/Correct letters (already placed)**: A, E, R, T (so position 2 must be a new letter, not a duplicate).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,avert,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. We have no previous feedback to go off of, so we want to pick a word that maximizes the information gained.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and avoiding duplicate letters to cover more possibilities.
 A popular starting word in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it has common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and no duplicates.
 Alternatively, other words like ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are used.

 However, note that the feedback symbols are:
   ✓ for correct letter and position
   - for present but wrong position
   x for absent

 Since we are on the first guess, we can choose a word that has a balanced set of common letters.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it covers five common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Format our response as <guess>crane</guess>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 This tells us:
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.

 Since we have three letters that are present (R, A, E) and two absent (C, N), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, along with two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

 The secret word has 5 letters. The positions we guessed were:
  1: C (absent) -> so position 1 is not C
  2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 2
  3: A (present but wrong position) -> A is in the word but not in position 3
  4: N (absent) -> so position 4 is not N and N is not in the word
  5: E (present but wrong position) -> E is in the word but not in position 5

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that:
 - Does not contain C or N (since they are absent).
 - Contains R, A, and E.
 - We have to consider that these letters (R, A, E) cannot be in the positions we guessed in the first attempt? Not exactly: they can be anywhere except the positions where we placed them? Actually, the feedback only tells they are not in the positions we guessed, but they could be in any other position.

 Also, note: the positions are fixed. So R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.

 Additionally, we need two more letters that we don't know. They cannot be C or N (because we know these are absent), and they haven't been tried.

 We should aim to cover more common letters and avoid repeating positions as much as possible.

 Let me think of words that include R, A, E and two other new letters. The new letters should be common consonants or vowels.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, P, etc.

 We also have to consider the positions:

 Constraints:
 - Position 1: not C, and we now know it must be one of the remaining letters (not R because R was in position 2 and that was wrong... wait no: R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, R cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is open. However, note that R was in position 2 and we were told it is in the word but not there. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions. However, we must avoid putting R in position 2 (which we already did and it was wrong). Similarly, A should avoid position 3 and E avoid position 5.

 For our next word, we can try:
 - Putting R in a different position, say position 1 or 4 or 5? (but avoid 2)
 - Putting A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5? but note: position 1 is also open)
 - Putting E in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4)

 However, we can also place one of these letters in the same position if we suspect it might be correct? But the feedback said they were in the word but not in that position, so we should avoid putting them in the same positions.

 For example, we should not put R at position 2 again? Actually, we don't have to avoid it, but we know it's wrong so it would waste a guess. So we avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, and position 5 for E.

 So the forbidden positions:
 - R: avoid position 2
 - A: avoid position 3
 - E: avoid position 5

 We need a word that has R, A, E and two new letters, and the letters are placed such that:
   R not in position 2
   A not in position 3
   E not in position 5

 Also, the word must not contain C or N.

 Let me think of words:

 One common word with R, A, E? And two new letters.

 Possibilities: 
  - Words like ""LATER"", ""ALERT"", ""ALTER"", etc.

 Check ""LATER"":
   L is a new letter (we haven't tried L) and T is new.
   Positions: 
     1: L (not forbidden by previous constraints on R,A,E positions) -> not at the forbidden positions for R,A,E? Actually, we care about R,A,E only: this word has R at position 4, A at position 2, E at position 5.

 But wait: E is at position 5? We were told E is present but not in position 5. Therefore, putting E at position 5 is forbidden? Actually, no: the feedback only said our E was in the word but not at position 5. So it cannot be at position 5? Yes, that's the meaning: the secret word's E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We can, but if we put it at 5 again, we will get an x? No: we'll get a '-' because the letter is present but in the wrong position? Actually, if we put E at a position where the secret word doesn't have it (and we know it cannot be at position 5), then if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get an '-'? Because the letter is still in the word, it's just not at position 5? However, we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 Therefore, it's better to avoid E at position 5.

 Similarly, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""LATER"":
   L (new) at position 1 -> we don't know yet
   A at position 2 -> That's okay because the feedback only said A is not at position 3? But position 2 is allowed? The secret word might have A at position 2? We don't know.
   T (new) at position 3 -> we don't know
   E at position 5 -> But we know the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we will definitely get a '-' for E? Which isn't wrong but doesn't get more information about positions? Also, we waste the chance to test E at a new position.

 Therefore, we might prefer a word that places E in a position we haven't tried (i.e., 1,2,3,4) and similarly for R and A.

 So let me avoid putting A at position 2? Actually, we don't have information about position 2 containing A. It could be, because in our first guess we only know position 3 is not A. Similarly, position 2: we have tried R there and it was wrong, so position 2 could be any letter except those we know are absent? Actually, it's open for A or E?

 Alternatively, consider ""ALTER"":
   Positions: 
     1: A -> but A is avoid in position 3? That doesn't forbid position 1. However, the feedback said the secret word has A, but not at position 3? So putting A at position 1 is acceptable? Yes.
     2: L
     3: T
     4: E -> here we are putting E at position 4 (which is new, so we can test if E is at 4).
     5: R -> R at position 5: which is allowed because R cannot be at position 2? Position 5 is okay.

 However, note: we must have R and E. In ""ALTER"": 
   A at position 1? -> if the word has A at position 1, we can test that.
   R at position 5? -> that avoids position 2.

 But now: what about the presence of R and A: we know they are in the word? Yes. But we are placing A at position 1: which is a new position for A (we had it at position 3 before). Similarly, R at position 5: we had R at position 2 before.

 But note: the secret word cannot have R at position 2? That we know. But position 5 is new? Then we can test if R is at position 5.

 Also, the word ""ALTER"" does not contain C or N? Yes.

 However, we also know that E cannot be at position 5? So if we put R at position 5 and E at position 4? That's acceptable.

 But there's another problem: we must include the letters R, A, E? Yes, and ""ALTER"" has A, L, T, E, R -> so it does have R, A, E? And L, T are new.

 Alternatively, consider ""ALERT"". It's similar.

 Another option: ""IRATE"", but we haven't tried I? It has I, R, A, T, E? Then:
   Positions: I at 1, R at 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we got feedback that R is not in position 2. So ""IRATE"" puts R at position 2? Then we would be putting R in a position we know it's not? So that would be inefficient? We'd get a '-' for R again? So better avoid position 2 for R.

 Similarly, we can try ""STARE"":
   S-T-A-R-E? 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because our first guess had A at position 3 and it was absent? Actually, the feedback was A(-) meaning A is present but not in position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Then putting A at position 3 would be wrong? And we already know that? So we get a '-'? But why? Actually, we don't need to test that again? So we avoid.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at 3? So ""STARE"" would have A at position 3? Which is forbidden? So we avoid.

 Alternatively, ""STEAR"" (but let me check: is that a word? STEER? But STEER has two E's and we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify. However, typically in wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicates yet? Our initial guess ""crane"" didn't have duplicates and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? But we don't know? Actually, the secret word could have duplicates? It's not ruled out.

 But in our feedback, we didn't get any duplicate? But we only had each letter once. Now, to be safe, I'll assume words can have duplicates? But we don't have any evidence.

 Actually, the feedback system: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get tricky? But we are not handling that in the first two guesses? Let's avoid duplicates for now? Because if the word had duplicates, we would have seen multiple '-'? But in our ""crane"" guess, each letter was unique? And we got three '-' so that matches? The secret word having R, A, E? Without duplication? So let's assume at this point that the word has distinct letters? We can try without duplicates unless we get evidence of duplicates.

 So back to ""ALTER""? It has distinct letters? ALTER: A, L, T, E, R -> yes, distinct.

 What about ""TARES""? It has T, A, R, E, S? 

 Check positions:
   We must avoid:
     R: position 2? Avoid? We can put R at other positions: e.g., position 3? We don't know about position 3? But R can be at 1,3,4,5? 
   But also A: avoid position 3.
   E: avoid position 5.

 ""TARES"":
   T (position 1)
   A (position 2) -> acceptable? (since A avoid position 3, so 2 is okay)
   R (position 3) -> acceptable? (R avoid only position 2? 3 is new)
   E (position 4) -> acceptable? (avoid position 5? position 4 is okay)
   S (position 5) -> but then E is at 4? That's okay.

 But note: we are testing E at position 4? Which is new? Then we can get more information.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE""? But we know R is in the word? And O would be a new letter? Then positions: R at 1, O at 2, A at 3? But wait, A cannot be at position 3? So we cannot use A at position 3? Then we avoid ""ROATE"" because we would have to put A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So waste.

 So what words are valid? 

 I think ""STARE"" is common? But I need to put A at position 3? Not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have A at position 3? So avoid?

 How about ""AREAS""? It has duplicate A? We don't want duplicates? Because we have only one A? So we assume distinct? Also, we already know A is present once? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiplicity? We might have to infer? But initially, we have only one A guessed? Then if the word had two A's? Then we would get '-' for both? But we don't have two A's? So we don't know? Better avoid? Also, ""AREAS"" has A at position 1 and 3 and 5? Then we put A at position 3? Forbidden? So it would be inefficient.

 Another idea: ""EARLY""

 EARLY: E, A, R, L, Y? 
 Positions:
   E at 1 -> avoid position 5? but position 1 is okay? And we are testing E at a new position? 
   A at 2 -> allowed (avoid position 3? position 2 is not 3? okay)
   R at 3 -> allowed? we had R at position 2 and avoid that? 3 is new? okay
   L at 4
   Y at 5

 But we have E at position 1? Which we haven't tried? Then we get two new letters L and Y? And we have R, A, E? 

 Let's check the positions against the forbidden ones:
   R: we are putting at position 3? And forbidden only for position 2? So okay.
   A: position 2? This is new? Previously we had A at position 3? So position 2 might be correct? Or might not? We don't know? But we avoid position 3? Not position 2? So okay.
   E: position 1? Previously E was at position 5? Now at 1? Avoids the forbidden position 5? Okay.

 Then we can try ""EARLY"".

 Another alternative: ""ALERT"": 
   A at 1 -> okay? (avoid position 3? 1 is okay)
   L at 2
   E at 3 -> okay? (avoid position 5? but not position 3? So putting E at 3 is okay? Because we had E at position 5 and it was not there? We don't know about position 3 for E? So we can put E at 3? 
   R at 4 -> okay? (only avoid 2? 4 is new)
   T at 5 -> then the letter E? Was placed at 3? 

 But note: E at position 3? That is acceptable? Because we haven't tried E at 3? Yes.

 However, the secret word might have E at position 3? Then we would get a ✓? That's good? Or the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""ALERT"" at position 3 we get a '-'? So we get information? 

 But now: we have to cover more letters? We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E? Now we need to try new letters? So the two new letters in ""ALERT"" are L and T? And ""EARLY"" are L and Y.

 I think both are okay? But I'll go with ""ALERT"" because it places E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? And R at position 4? And A at position 1? 

 But note: A was in position 3 in the first guess and we got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? So could it be at 1? Yes? Then we test that? 

 However, we are not forced to choose any particular word? Both are valid.

 Alternatively, consider ""RAISE"": 
   R at position 1? -> avoid position 2? 1 is okay? 
   A at position 2? -> okay? (avoid position 3? 2 is not 3? okay)
   I at position 3? -> new
   S at position 4? -> new
   E at position 5? -> forbidden? because E avoid position 5? So we cannot have E at 5? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? Avoid.

 So ""RAISE"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? So we choose another.

 I think ""ALERT"" is a good option. Also, ""LATER"" we rejected because of E at 5? So now:

 Final choice: ""ALERT"" 

 Checking: 
   A: placed at 1 -> not avoiding any constraint? Only constraint is A not at 3? So okay? 
   L: new letter, at position 2 -> okay? 
   E: placed at 3 -> avoids the constraint? The constraint for E is not at 5? So 3 is okay? 
   R: placed at 4 -> avoids constraint? constraint: not at 2? Okay? 
   T: new letter, at position 5.

 So we get to test two new letters: L and T? And R, A, E? But we are shifting their positions.

 Also, we avoid repeated letters? So we assume the secret word does not have duplicates? At least we haven't encountered any.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""ALERT"".

 But note: we have not tried letters L and T? So we are testing them? Yes? 

 We might get more information? 

 We'll output: <guess>alert</guess>

 Let's write it.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- C and N are absent → must exclude C and N
- R, A, and E are present but misplaced → must include R, A, and E, while avoiding their originally guessed positions:
  - R not at position 2
  - A not at position 3
  - E not at position 5

For the next guess:
- Include R, A, E in new positions
- Add two new letters to test common consonants (L and T)
- Ensure no C/N and no duplicates (so far, no evidence of duplicate letters)

**Selected word: ALERT**
- A at pos 1 (not 3, compliant)
- L (new) at pos 2
- E at pos 3 (not 5, compliant)
- R at pos 4 (not 2, compliant)
- T (new) at pos 5

This tests new positions for known letters and explores untried consonants.

<guess>alert</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C and N are absent.
- R, A, E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
  - R is not at position 2.
  - A is not at position 3.
  - E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(✓), L(x), E(✓), R(✓), T(✓)
Meaning:
- A is correct at position 1 (since we got ✓ for A at position 1).
- E is correct at position 3 (since we got ✓ for E at position 3).
- R is correct at position 4 (since we got ✓ for R at position 4).
- T is correct at position 5 (since we got ✓ for T at position 5).
- L is absent (x) from the word.

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1, E at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.
- The letter L is not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the word contains R, A, E (which we now know the positions for) and that C and N are absent.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: A _ E R T

We are missing the second letter.

We know the second letter cannot be:
- C, N, L (because they are absent)
- Also, from guess 1, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced (so R is in the word but not at position 2, which we now know because R is at position 4). Similarly, A and E were misplaced in the first guess but now we know their correct positions.

The second letter must be a letter that we haven't eliminated and that is not in the set of absent letters: C, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have placed) and one more letter (the second position) and we know T is also in the word (from the second guess) and placed at position 5.

But note: the word has 5 letters. We have A, [missing], E, R, T.

So the missing letter is the second letter.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What could the second letter be?

We have to consider that in the first guess, we had the letter A at position 3 and it was misplaced. Now we have A at position 1 and it's correct. Similarly, E was at position 5 and misplaced, now at position 3 and correct. R was at position 2 and misplaced, now at position 4 and correct.

The second letter must be a letter that is not C, N, L, and also not A, E, R, T (because we have those letters already in their positions? But wait, could there be duplicate letters? We don't have evidence of duplicates. In the feedback for ""alert"", we have A, E, R, T as correct and L absent. The secret word has A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5, and one more letter at 2. Since we have no duplicates so far, we assume the second letter is a new letter that is not A, E, R, T.

But note: the first guess had R, A, E and we now have them placed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback for ""alert"", we have:
- A at 1: ✓ (so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? But we didn't test any other positions for A? Actually, we only tested one A. Similarly for E, R, T. So duplicates are still possible? But we have no indication.

Given that we have four letters fixed and one missing, and we have eliminated C, N, L, we can try to think of words that fit A _ E R T.

Common English words with this pattern: 
- After? But we know that F is a possible letter? And we haven't tried F? But we must check if F is eliminated? We haven't eliminated F.
- Alter? But we have L eliminated? So ""alter"" has L? But we know L is absent? So ""alter"" is not possible.
- Amber? But B is not eliminated? But we have M? Also, we have to check the pattern: A M B E R? No, that's 5 letters: A, M, B, E, R? But our pattern is A _ E R T, so the last letter is T, not R? So ""amber"" ends with R, not T.

The pattern is A _ E R T, so the word must end with T.

Possible words: 
- After: A, F, E, R, T -> matches A _ E R T? Let's see: position 1: A, 2: F, 3: E, 4: R, 5: T -> that matches.
- Avert: A, V, E, R, T -> matches.
- Apart: A, P, A, R, T? But that has two A's? And the pattern: position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A? But we have E at position 3? So no, because we need E at position 3? So ""apart"" has A at 1, P at 2, A at 3? But we need E at 3? So not.

We need the third letter to be E? So the word must be A ? E R T.

So the only possibilities are words like:
- After (if F is allowed)
- Avert (if V is allowed)
- Later? But L is eliminated? So no.
- Water? But W is not eliminated? But the first letter is A? So ""water"" starts with W? Not A.
- Aster? But S is not eliminated? And the pattern: A, S, T, E, R? That would be A at 1, S at 2, T at 3? But we need E at 3? So no.

Wait, let's list words that start with A, have E at the third position, R at the fourth, and T at the fifth? And the second letter is to be determined.

So: A ? E R T

Possible second letters? We can try to think of common letters that can go there.

We know the second letter cannot be C, N, L (from previous feedback). Also, it cannot be A, E, R, T? Because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure? However, if we allow duplicates, then the second letter could be A? But then the word would be A A E R T? Is that a word? Not in English? Similarly, E? A E E R T? Not a word. R? A R E R T? Not a word. T? A T E R T? Not a word. So duplicates are unlikely? So we assume the second letter is a new letter.

Therefore, we need a letter that is not in {A, E, R, T, C, N, L}.

Now, from the first guess, we also know that the word contains the letters R, A, E (which we have) and one more letter? Actually, the secret word has five letters: we have four known (A, E, R, T) and one missing? So the missing letter is the only one we don't have? But we also know that the first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We were told that R, A, E are present? So the secret word has R, A, E? And we now have A, E, R, T? So T is an additional letter? That's fine? Because the first guess didn't have T? So the secret word has R, A, E, T, and one more.

Now, what about the feedback from the first guess? We had R at position 2 and it was misplaced? But now we know R is at position 4? So that's consistent? Similarly, A was at position 3 and misplaced? Now we have A at position 1? And E was at position 5 and misplaced? Now we have E at position 3? So all consistent.

Now, the second letter must be a letter that we haven't tried? And not eliminated.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And we know C, N, L are absent? So the set of tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And absent: C, N, L? Present: A, E, R, T? And one more letter (the second position) which is not in the absent set.

So the second letter must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not in {A, E, R, T}? Because we are assuming no duplicates? And we haven't seen duplicates? So we look for a letter that is not in the set of absent and not in the set of already placed.

So available letters: any letter except A, E, R, T, C, N, L.

Now, common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, what words fit A ? E R T?

Possible words:
- AFTER: A, F, E, R, T -> F is available? Yes.
- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> V is available? Yes.
- APERT: but ""apert"" is not a common word? It might be a root? But let's stick to common words? Wordle uses common words.
- ALERT: but we tried that? And L is absent? So not.
- ABERT: not a word.

So the most common words are AFTER and AVERT.

We need to choose one? But we have to make a guess? We can choose either? But note: we have only one missing letter? And we have two possibilities? We can guess one? If it's not correct, we know the other? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can.

But we can also think: is there a way to get more information? But we are at the third guess? And we have four letters fixed? So we can guess one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has both F and V? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and has both? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to fill the second position with one letter.

So we must choose either AFTER or AVERT? Or are there more?

Another word: ""avert"" and ""after"" are the main ones? Also, ""airth""? Not a word? ""award""? But that would be A, W, A, R, D? Doesn't have E at position 3? So no.

So likely: AFTER or AVERT.

We can also consider: did we get any information about F or V? No? So we have to test one.

But note: we have not used many letters? We can try to guess a word that uses one of these and see? But we are forced to have the pattern A ? E R T? So we can only change the second letter.

So we can guess ""after"". If it's not correct, then we try ""avert"".

But we have 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? So we can do that.

Alternatively, we can try to think if there is a word that uses more new letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? We have to have A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? So the second letter is the only one we can vary? So we cannot test multiple new letters? We have to choose one.

Therefore, I'll go with ""after"" because it's a common word.

But let's check the feedback we might get? If we guess ""after"", then:
- If the second letter is F, we get all correct? Then we win? 
- If not, then we know it must be V? Then we guess ""avert"" next.

So we can do that.

But note: we are at guess 3? We can also consider if there are other possibilities? For example, is ""aster"" a word? But ""aster"" has S at position 2 and T at position 3? But we need E at position 3? So no? ""aster"" is A, S, T, E, R? So positions: A(1), S(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need E at 3 and R at 4? So not.

Similarly, ""aegis""? Not matching pattern.

So I think only two possibilities: AFTER and AVERT.

We'll go with ""after"".

But note: we must ensure that F is not eliminated? We haven't tried F? So it's okay.

So the guess is ""after"".

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: A (should be ✓)
Position 2: F (unknown)
Position 3: E (should be ✓)
Position 4: R (should be ✓)
Position 5: T (should be ✓)

So if the word is ""after"", we get all ✓? If not, then we get A(✓), F(x or -? but if F is not in the word, then x? But we know the word must have a letter at position 2? And if it's not F, then we get x for F? But then the second letter must be V? So we can then guess ""avert"" next.

But if we get a ✓ for F? Then we win.

So we output: <guess>after</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x). R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-), meaning:
  - R is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
  - E is not in position 5.
- **Guess 2 (alert)**: 
  - A is correct at position 1 (✓).
  - L is absent (x).
  - E is correct at position 3 (✓).
  - R is correct at position 4 (✓).
  - T is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **A _ E R T** (positions: 1=A, 3=E, 4=R, 5=T).
- The missing letter is at position 2.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, N, L (from feedback).
- **Present/Correct letters (already placed)**: A, E, R, T (so position 2 must be a new letter, not a duplicate).
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern.

### Possible Words:
- Common words matching **A _ E R T**:
  - **AFTER**: Second letter = F (F is untested and not eliminated).
  - **AVERT**: Second letter = V (V is untested and not eliminated).
- Other combinations (e.g., with B, D, S) do not form valid common words (e.g., ""abert"" and ""aster"" are invalid per pattern).

### Strategy:
- With only one unknown letter, guess **AFTER** to test F at position 2.
- If incorrect, the answer must be **AVERT** (next guess).
- This leverages the fixed pattern to resolve the word efficiently.

We have no previous feedback to go off of, so we want to pick a word that maximizes the information gained.\n Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and avoiding duplicate letters to cover more possibilities.\n A popular starting word in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it has common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and no duplicates.\n Alternatively, other words like ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are used.\n\n However, note that the feedback symbols are:\n   ✓ for correct letter and position\n   - for present but wrong position\n   x for absent\n\n Since we are on the first guess, we can choose a word that has a balanced set of common letters.\n\n I will choose ""CRANE"" because it covers five common letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s go with ""CRANE"".\n\n Important: The word must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n Format our response as <guess>crane</guess>\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": \n C: x (not in the word)\n R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n N: x (not in the word)\n E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\n This tells us:\n - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.\n - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.\n\n Since we have three letters that are present (R, A, E) and two absent (C, N), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, along with two other letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n The secret word has 5 letters. The positions we guessed were:\n  1: C (absent) -> so position 1 is not C\n  2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 2\n  3: A (present but wrong position) -> A is in the word but not in position 3\n  4: N (absent) -> so position 4 is not N and N is not in the word\n  5: E (present but wrong position) -> E is in the word but not in position 5\n\n Therefore, we must choose a new word that:\n - Does not contain C or N (since they are absent).\n - Contains R, A, and E.\n - We have to consider that these letters (R, A, E) cannot be in the positions we guessed in the first attempt? Not exactly: they can be anywhere except the positions where we placed them? Actually, the feedback only tells they are not in the positions we guessed, but they could be in any other position.\n\n Also, note: the positions are fixed. So R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.\n\n Additionally, we need two more letters that we don\'t know. They cannot be C or N (because we know these are absent), and they haven\'t been tried.\n\n We should aim to cover more common letters and avoid repeating positions as much as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that include R, A, E and two other new letters. The new letters should be common consonants or vowels.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, P, etc.\n\n We also have to consider the positions:\n\n Constraints:\n - Position 1: not C, and we now know it must be one of the remaining letters (not R because R was in position 2 and that was wrong... wait no: R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, R cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is open. However, note that R was in position 2 and we were told it is in the word but not there. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But wait: the word has 5 positions. However, we must avoid putting R in position 2 (which we already did and it was wrong). Similarly, A should avoid position 3 and E avoid position 5.\n\n For our next word, we can try:\n - Putting R in a different position, say position 1 or 4 or 5? (but avoid 2)\n - Putting A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5? but note: position 1 is also open)\n - Putting E in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4)\n\n However, we can also place one of these letters in the same position if we suspect it might be correct? But the feedback said they were in the word but not in that position, so we should avoid putting them in the same positions.\n\n For example, we should not put R at position 2 again? Actually, we don\'t have to avoid it, but we know it\'s wrong so it would waste a guess. So we avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, and position 5 for E.\n\n So the forbidden positions:\n - R: avoid position 2\n - A: avoid position 3\n - E: avoid position 5\n\n We need a word that has R, A, E and two new letters, and the letters are placed such that:\n   R not in position 2\n   A not in position 3\n   E not in position 5\n\n Also, the word must not contain C or N.\n\n Let me think of words:\n\n One common word with R, A, E? And two new letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n  - Words like ""LATER"", ""ALERT"", ""ALTER"", etc.\n\n Check ""LATER"":\n   L is a new letter (we haven\'t tried L) and T is new.\n   Positions: \n     1: L (not forbidden by previous constraints on R,A,E positions) -> not at the forbidden positions for R,A,E? Actually, we care about R,A,E only: this word has R at position 4, A at position 2, E at position 5.\n\n But wait: E is at position 5? We were told E is present but not in position 5. Therefore, putting E at position 5 is forbidden? Actually, no: the feedback only said our E was in the word but not at position 5. So it cannot be at position 5? Yes, that\'s the meaning: the secret word\'s E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We can, but if we put it at 5 again, we will get an x? No: we\'ll get a \'-\' because the letter is present but in the wrong position? Actually, if we put E at a position where the secret word doesn\'t have it (and we know it cannot be at position 5), then if we put E at position 5 again, we\'ll get an \'-\'? Because the letter is still in the word, it\'s just not at position 5? However, we know it\'s wrong, so it would be inefficient.\n\n Therefore, it\'s better to avoid E at position 5.\n\n Similarly, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n In ""LATER"":\n   L (new) at position 1 -> we don\'t know yet\n   A at position 2 -> That\'s okay because the feedback only said A is not at position 3? But position 2 is allowed? The secret word might have A at position 2? We don\'t know.\n   T (new) at position 3 -> we don\'t know\n   E at position 5 -> But we know the secret word\'s E is not at position 5? So we will definitely get a \'-\' for E? Which isn\'t wrong but doesn\'t get more information about positions? Also, we waste the chance to test E at a new position.\n\n Therefore, we might prefer a word that places E in a position we haven\'t tried (i.e., 1,2,3,4) and similarly for R and A.\n\n So let me avoid putting A at position 2? Actually, we don\'t have information about position 2 containing A. It could be, because in our first guess we only know position 3 is not A. Similarly, position 2: we have tried R there and it was wrong, so position 2 could be any letter except those we know are absent? Actually, it\'s open for A or E?\n\n Alternatively, consider ""ALTER"":\n   Positions: \n     1: A -> but A is avoid in position 3? That doesn\'t forbid position 1. However, the feedback said the secret word has A, but not at position 3? So putting A at position 1 is acceptable? Yes.\n     2: L\n     3: T\n     4: E -> here we are putting E at position 4 (which is new, so we can test if E is at 4).\n     5: R -> R at position 5: which is allowed because R cannot be at position 2? Position 5 is okay.\n\n However, note: we must have R and E. In ""ALTER"": \n   A at position 1? -> if the word has A at position 1, we can test that.\n   R at position 5? -> that avoids position 2.\n\n But now: what about the presence of R and A: we know they are in the word? Yes. But we are placing A at position 1: which is a new position for A (we had it at position 3 before). Similarly, R at position 5: we had R at position 2 before.\n\n But note: the secret word cannot have R at position 2? That we know. But position 5 is new? Then we can test if R is at position 5.\n\n Also, the word ""ALTER"" does not contain C or N? Yes.\n\n However, we also know that E cannot be at position 5? So if we put R at position 5 and E at position 4? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But there\'s another problem: we must include the letters R, A, E? Yes, and ""ALTER"" has A, L, T, E, R -> so it does have R, A, E? And L, T are new.\n\n Alternatively, consider ""ALERT"". It\'s similar.\n\n Another option: ""IRATE"", but we haven\'t tried I? It has I, R, A, T, E? Then:\n   Positions: I at 1, R at 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we got feedback that R is not in position 2. So ""IRATE"" puts R at position 2? Then we would be putting R in a position we know it\'s not? So that would be inefficient? We\'d get a \'-\' for R again? So better avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Similarly, we can try ""STARE"":\n   S-T-A-R-E? \n   Positions:\n     1: S\n     2: T\n     3: A -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because our first guess had A at position 3 and it was absent? Actually, the feedback was A(-) meaning A is present but not in position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Then putting A at position 3 would be wrong? And we already know that? So we get a \'-\'? But why? Actually, we don\'t need to test that again? So we avoid.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting A at 3? So ""STARE"" would have A at position 3? Which is forbidden? So we avoid.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEAR"" (but let me check: is that a word? STEER? But STEER has two E\'s and we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t specify. However, typically in wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicates yet? Our initial guess ""crane"" didn\'t have duplicates and the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates? But we don\'t know? Actually, the secret word could have duplicates? It\'s not ruled out.\n\n But in our feedback, we didn\'t get any duplicate? But we only had each letter once. Now, to be safe, I\'ll assume words can have duplicates? But we don\'t have any evidence.\n\n Actually, the feedback system: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get tricky? But we are not handling that in the first two guesses? Let\'s avoid duplicates for now? Because if the word had duplicates, we would have seen multiple \'-\'? But in our ""crane"" guess, each letter was unique? And we got three \'-\' so that matches? The secret word having R, A, E? Without duplication? So let\'s assume at this point that the word has distinct letters? We can try without duplicates unless we get evidence of duplicates.\n\n So back to ""ALTER""? It has distinct letters? ALTER: A, L, T, E, R -> yes, distinct.\n\n What about ""TARES""? It has T, A, R, E, S? \n\n Check positions:\n   We must avoid:\n     R: position 2? Avoid? We can put R at other positions: e.g., position 3? We don\'t know about position 3? But R can be at 1,3,4,5? \n   But also A: avoid position 3.\n   E: avoid position 5.\n\n ""TARES"":\n   T (position 1)\n   A (position 2) -> acceptable? (since A avoid position 3, so 2 is okay)\n   R (position 3) -> acceptable? (R avoid only position 2? 3 is new)\n   E (position 4) -> acceptable? (avoid position 5? position 4 is okay)\n   S (position 5) -> but then E is at 4? That\'s okay.\n\n But note: we are testing E at position 4? Which is new? Then we can get more information.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE""? But we know R is in the word? And O would be a new letter? Then positions: R at 1, O at 2, A at 3? But wait, A cannot be at position 3? So we cannot use A at position 3? Then we avoid ""ROATE"" because we would have to put A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So waste.\n\n So what words are valid? \n\n I think ""STARE"" is common? But I need to put A at position 3? Not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn\'t have A at position 3? So avoid?\n\n How about ""AREAS""? It has duplicate A? We don\'t want duplicates? Because we have only one A? So we assume distinct? Also, we already know A is present once? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiplicity? We might have to infer? But initially, we have only one A guessed? Then if the word had two A\'s? Then we would get \'-\' for both? But we don\'t have two A\'s? So we don\'t know? Better avoid? Also, ""AREAS"" has A at position 1 and 3 and 5? Then we put A at position 3? Forbidden? So it would be inefficient.\n\n Another idea: ""EARLY""\n\n EARLY: E, A, R, L, Y? \n Positions:\n   E at 1 -> avoid position 5? but position 1 is okay? And we are testing E at a new position? \n   A at 2 -> allowed (avoid position 3? position 2 is not 3? okay)\n   R at 3 -> allowed? we had R at position 2 and avoid that? 3 is new? okay\n   L at 4\n   Y at 5\n\n But we have E at position 1? Which we haven\'t tried? Then we get two new letters L and Y? And we have R, A, E? \n\n Let\'s check the positions against the forbidden ones:\n   R: we are putting at position 3? And forbidden only for position 2? So okay.\n   A: position 2? This is new? Previously we had A at position 3? So position 2 might be correct? Or might not? We don\'t know? But we avoid position 3? Not position 2? So okay.\n   E: position 1? Previously E was at position 5? Now at 1? Avoids the forbidden position 5? Okay.\n\n Then we can try ""EARLY"".\n\n Another alternative: ""ALERT"": \n   A at 1 -> okay? (avoid position 3? 1 is okay)\n   L at 2\n   E at 3 -> okay? (avoid position 5? but not position 3? So putting E at 3 is okay? Because we had E at position 5 and it was not there? We don\'t know about position 3 for E? So we can put E at 3? \n   R at 4 -> okay? (only avoid 2? 4 is new)\n   T at 5 -> then the letter E? Was placed at 3? \n\n But note: E at position 3? That is acceptable? Because we haven\'t tried E at 3? Yes.\n\n However, the secret word might have E at position 3? Then we would get a ✓? That\'s good? Or the secret word has E at position 1? Then in ""ALERT"" at position 3 we get a \'-\'? So we get information? \n\n But now: we have to cover more letters? We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E? Now we need to try new letters? So the two new letters in ""ALERT"" are L and T? And ""EARLY"" are L and Y.\n\n I think both are okay? But I\'ll go with ""ALERT"" because it places E at position 3? Which we haven\'t tried? And R at position 4? And A at position 1? \n\n But note: A was in position 3 in the first guess and we got \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 3? So could it be at 1? Yes? Then we test that? \n\n However, we are not forced to choose any particular word? Both are valid.\n\n Alternatively, consider ""RAISE"": \n   R at position 1? -> avoid position 2? 1 is okay? \n   A at position 2? -> okay? (avoid position 3? 2 is not 3? okay)\n   I at position 3? -> new\n   S at position 4? -> new\n   E at position 5? -> forbidden? because E avoid position 5? So we cannot have E at 5? Then we get a \'-\'? Which we already know? So inefficient? Avoid.\n\n So ""RAISE"" has E at position 5? Which is forbidden? So we choose another.\n\n I think ""ALERT"" is a good option. Also, ""LATER"" we rejected because of E at 5? So now:\n\n Final choice: ""ALERT"" \n\n Checking: \n   A: placed at 1 -> not avoiding any constraint? Only constraint is A not at 3? So okay? \n   L: new letter, at position 2 -> okay? \n   E: placed at 3 -> avoids the constraint? The constraint for E is not at 5? So 3 is okay? \n   R: placed at 4 -> avoids constraint? constraint: not at 2? Okay? \n   T: new letter, at position 5.\n\n So we get to test two new letters: L and T? And R, A, E? But we are shifting their positions.\n\n Also, we avoid repeated letters? So we assume the secret word does not have duplicates? At least we haven\'t encountered any.\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""ALERT"".\n\n But note: we have not tried letters L and T? So we are testing them? Yes? \n\n We might get more information? \n\n We\'ll output: <guess>alert</guess>\n\n Let\'s write it.Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- C and N are absent → must exclude C and N\n- R, A, and E are present but misplaced → must include R, A, and E, while avoiding their originally guessed positions:\n  - R not at position 2\n  - A not at position 3\n  - E not at position 5\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Include R, A, E in new positions\n- Add two new letters to test common consonants (L and T)\n- Ensure no C/N and no duplicates (so far, no evidence of duplicate letters)\n\n**Selected word: ALERT**\n- A at pos 1 (not 3, compliant)\n- L (new) at pos 2\n- E at pos 3 (not 5, compliant)\n- R at pos 4 (not 2, compliant)\n- T (new) at pos 5\n\nThis tests new positions for known letters and explores untried consonants.\n\n<guess>alert</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C and N are absent.\n- R, A, E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n  - R is not at position 2.\n  - A is not at position 3.\n  - E is not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""alert"" -> A(✓), L(x), E(✓), R(✓), T(✓)\nMeaning:\n- A is correct at position 1 (since we got ✓ for A at position 1).\n- E is correct at position 3 (since we got ✓ for E at position 3).\n- R is correct at position 4 (since we got ✓ for R at position 4).\n- T is correct at position 5 (since we got ✓ for T at position 5).\n- L is absent (x) from the word.\n\nSo, from guess 2, we know:\n- The secret word has A at position 1, E at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.\n- The letter L is not in the word.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know that the word contains R, A, E (which we now know the positions for) and that C and N are absent.\n\nNow, the secret word has the pattern: A _ E R T\n\nWe are missing the second letter.\n\nWe know the second letter cannot be:\n- C, N, L (because they are absent)\n- Also, from guess 1, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced (so R is in the word but not at position 2, which we now know because R is at position 4). Similarly, A and E were misplaced in the first guess but now we know their correct positions.\n\nThe second letter must be a letter that we haven\'t eliminated and that is not in the set of absent letters: C, N, L.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have placed) and one more letter (the second position) and we know T is also in the word (from the second guess) and placed at position 5.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters. We have A, [missing], E, R, T.\n\nSo the missing letter is the second letter.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWhat could the second letter be?\n\nWe have to consider that in the first guess, we had the letter A at position 3 and it was misplaced. Now we have A at position 1 and it\'s correct. Similarly, E was at position 5 and misplaced, now at position 3 and correct. R was at position 2 and misplaced, now at position 4 and correct.\n\nThe second letter must be a letter that is not C, N, L, and also not A, E, R, T (because we have those letters already in their positions? But wait, could there be duplicate letters? We don\'t have evidence of duplicates. In the feedback for ""alert"", we have A, E, R, T as correct and L absent. The secret word has A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5, and one more letter at 2. Since we have no duplicates so far, we assume the second letter is a new letter that is not A, E, R, T.\n\nBut note: the first guess had R, A, E and we now have them placed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback for ""alert"", we have:\n- A at 1: ✓ (so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? But we didn\'t test any other positions for A? Actually, we only tested one A. Similarly for E, R, T. So duplicates are still possible? But we have no indication.\n\nGiven that we have four letters fixed and one missing, and we have eliminated C, N, L, we can try to think of words that fit A _ E R T.\n\nCommon English words with this pattern: \n- After? But we know that F is a possible letter? And we haven\'t tried F? But we must check if F is eliminated? We haven\'t eliminated F.\n- Alter? But we have L eliminated? So ""alter"" has L? But we know L is absent? So ""alter"" is not possible.\n- Amber? But B is not eliminated? But we have M? Also, we have to check the pattern: A M B E R? No, that\'s 5 letters: A, M, B, E, R? But our pattern is A _ E R T, so the last letter is T, not R? So ""amber"" ends with R, not T.\n\nThe pattern is A _ E R T, so the word must end with T.\n\nPossible words: \n- After: A, F, E, R, T -> matches A _ E R T? Let\'s see: position 1: A, 2: F, 3: E, 4: R, 5: T -> that matches.\n- Avert: A, V, E, R, T -> matches.\n- Apart: A, P, A, R, T? But that has two A\'s? And the pattern: position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A? But we have E at position 3? So no, because we need E at position 3? So ""apart"" has A at 1, P at 2, A at 3? But we need E at 3? So not.\n\nWe need the third letter to be E? So the word must be A ? E R T.\n\nSo the only possibilities are words like:\n- After (if F is allowed)\n- Avert (if V is allowed)\n- Later? But L is eliminated? So no.\n- Water? But W is not eliminated? But the first letter is A? So ""water"" starts with W? Not A.\n- Aster? But S is not eliminated? And the pattern: A, S, T, E, R? That would be A at 1, S at 2, T at 3? But we need E at 3? So no.\n\nWait, let\'s list words that start with A, have E at the third position, R at the fourth, and T at the fifth? And the second letter is to be determined.\n\nSo: A ? E R T\n\nPossible second letters? We can try to think of common letters that can go there.\n\nWe know the second letter cannot be C, N, L (from previous feedback). Also, it cannot be A, E, R, T? Because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don\'t know for sure? However, if we allow duplicates, then the second letter could be A? But then the word would be A A E R T? Is that a word? Not in English? Similarly, E? A E E R T? Not a word. R? A R E R T? Not a word. T? A T E R T? Not a word. So duplicates are unlikely? So we assume the second letter is a new letter.\n\nTherefore, we need a letter that is not in {A, E, R, T, C, N, L}.\n\nNow, from the first guess, we also know that the word contains the letters R, A, E (which we have) and one more letter? Actually, the secret word has five letters: we have four known (A, E, R, T) and one missing? So the missing letter is the only one we don\'t have? But we also know that the first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We were told that R, A, E are present? So the secret word has R, A, E? And we now have A, E, R, T? So T is an additional letter? That\'s fine? Because the first guess didn\'t have T? So the secret word has R, A, E, T, and one more.\n\nNow, what about the feedback from the first guess? We had R at position 2 and it was misplaced? But now we know R is at position 4? So that\'s consistent? Similarly, A was at position 3 and misplaced? Now we have A at position 1? And E was at position 5 and misplaced? Now we have E at position 3? So all consistent.\n\nNow, the second letter must be a letter that we haven\'t tried? And not eliminated.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And we know C, N, L are absent? So the set of tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, T? And absent: C, N, L? Present: A, E, R, T? And one more letter (the second position) which is not in the absent set.\n\nSo the second letter must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not in {A, E, R, T}? Because we are assuming no duplicates? And we haven\'t seen duplicates? So we look for a letter that is not in the set of absent and not in the set of already placed.\n\nSo available letters: any letter except A, E, R, T, C, N, L.\n\nNow, common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nNow, what words fit A ? E R T?\n\nPossible words:\n- AFTER: A, F, E, R, T -> F is available? Yes.\n- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> V is available? Yes.\n- APERT: but ""apert"" is not a common word? It might be a root? But let\'s stick to common words? Wordle uses common words.\n- ALERT: but we tried that? And L is absent? So not.\n- ABERT: not a word.\n\nSo the most common words are AFTER and AVERT.\n\nWe need to choose one? But we have to make a guess? We can choose either? But note: we have only one missing letter? And we have two possibilities? We can guess one? If it\'s not correct, we know the other? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can.\n\nBut we can also think: is there a way to get more information? But we are at the third guess? And we have four letters fixed? So we can guess one of the possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has both F and V? But we don\'t have a word that fits the pattern and has both? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to fill the second position with one letter.\n\nSo we must choose either AFTER or AVERT? Or are there more?\n\nAnother word: ""avert"" and ""after"" are the main ones? Also, ""airth""? Not a word? ""award""? But that would be A, W, A, R, D? Doesn\'t have E at position 3? So no.\n\nSo likely: AFTER or AVERT.\n\nWe can also consider: did we get any information about F or V? No? So we have to test one.\n\nBut note: we have not used many letters? We can try to guess a word that uses one of these and see? But we are forced to have the pattern A ? E R T? So we can only change the second letter.\n\nSo we can guess ""after"". If it\'s not correct, then we try ""avert"".\n\nBut we have 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? So we can do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to think if there is a word that uses more new letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? We have to have A at 1, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5? So the second letter is the only one we can vary? So we cannot test multiple new letters? We have to choose one.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""after"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback we might get? If we guess ""after"", then:\n- If the second letter is F, we get all correct? Then we win? \n- If not, then we know it must be V? Then we guess ""avert"" next.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut note: we are at guess 3? We can also consider if there are other possibilities? For example, is ""aster"" a word? But ""aster"" has S at position 2 and T at position 3? But we need E at position 3? So no? ""aster"" is A, S, T, E, R? So positions: A(1), S(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need E at 3 and R at 4? So not.\n\nSimilarly, ""aegis""? Not matching pattern.\n\nSo I think only two possibilities: AFTER and AVERT.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""after"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that F is not eliminated? We haven\'t tried F? So it\'s okay.\n\nSo the guess is ""after"".\n\nBut let me confirm the pattern: \nPosition 1: A (should be ✓)\nPosition 2: F (unknown)\nPosition 3: E (should be ✓)\nPosition 4: R (should be ✓)\nPosition 5: T (should be ✓)\n\nSo if the word is ""after"", we get all ✓? If not, then we get A(✓), F(x or -? but if F is not in the word, then x? But we know the word must have a letter at position 2? And if it\'s not F, then we get x for F? But then the second letter must be V? So we can then guess ""avert"" next.\n\nBut if we get a ✓ for F? Then we win.\n\nSo we output: <guess>after</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x).

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C and N are absent.
- R, A, E are present but in the wrong positions.

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(✓), L(x), E(✓), R(✓), T(✓)
Meaning:
- A is correct at position 1.
- L is absent.
- E is correct at position 3.
- R is correct at position 4.
- T is correct at position 5.

So after guess 2, we know the word has the pattern: A _ E R T, and the missing letter at position 2 must be a letter that is not C, N, L (absent) and not A, E, R, T (assuming no duplicates, as we have no evidence of duplicates).

Then we guessed ""after"" for guess 3.

Guess 3: ""after"" -> A(✓), F(x), T(-), E(-), R(-)
Meaning:
- A is correct at position 1 (as expected).
- F is absent (x) from the word.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-).
- E is present but in the wrong position (-).
- R is present but in the wrong position (-).

This feedback is confusing because from guess 2, we already know that E is at position 3 and R is at position 4 and T is at position 5. But now in guess 3, we have:
- T is present but wrong position? But we have T at position 5 in the pattern? And it was correct in guess 2? Why is it now wrong position?
- Similarly, E is at position 3 in the pattern? But now we are told it's in the word but wrong position? And R is also wrong position?

This seems contradictory. Let me reexamine.

In guess 2, we have:
  Position 1: A (✓) -> correct and in place.
  Position 2: L (x) -> absent.
  Position 3: E (✓) -> correct and in place.
  Position 4: R (✓) -> correct and in place.
  Position 5: T (✓) -> correct and in place.

So the secret word must be A _ E R T, with the second letter missing.

Now, in guess 3, we guessed ""after"":
  Position 1: A -> we get ✓ (as expected).
  Position 2: F -> we get x (absent).
  Position 3: T -> we put T at position 3? But in the pattern, position 3 is E? So we are putting T at position 3? 
  Position 4: E -> we put E at position 4? But in the pattern, position 4 is R? 
  Position 5: R -> we put R at position 5? But in the pattern, position 5 is T?

So we have:
  ""after"": 
    pos1: A (same as pattern, so ✓)
    pos2: F (new letter, but we get x, so F is absent)
    pos3: T (but the pattern has E at pos3, so we are putting T there? Then we get feedback for T: present but wrong position? Meaning T is in the word, but not at position 3? But we know from guess2 that T is at position 5? So why is it present but wrong position? It should be at position 5? But we are not putting it at position 5? We are putting R at position 5? 

Let me write the secret word as: let S = [A, X, E, R, T] where X is the unknown second letter.

In guess3 ""after"":
  We have: 
    pos1: A -> matches S[0] (A) -> ✓
    pos2: F -> but S[1] is X (which is not F, and F is absent) -> x
    pos3: T -> but S[2] is E (not T), and T is in the word? Yes, at S[4]? So T is present but not at position 3 -> so we get (-) for T? That makes sense? 
    pos4: E -> but S[3] is R (not E), and E is in the word at S[2]? So E is present but not at position 4 -> (-) for E? 
    pos5: R -> but S[4] is T (not R), and R is in the word at S[3]? So R is present but not at position 5 -> (-) for R? 

So the feedback is consistent? But note: we already knew the positions of E, R, T from guess2? So why are we getting (-) for them? Because in this guess, we put them in the wrong positions? 

But the important new information is:
- F is absent? So we can eliminate F? 
- And the pattern A _ E R T is still valid? Because we didn't get any ✓ for the other positions? But we didn't test the pattern? We tested a different arrangement? 

Actually, we know the pattern is fixed? But in guess3, we didn't test the pattern? We tested a word that has A at 1, then F (which is wrong), and then T, E, R in positions 3,4,5? Which are not the correct positions? Because the correct positions for E, R, T are 3,4,5? But we moved them? 

Wait, no: in the secret word, E is at 3, R at 4, T at 5? In guess3, we have:
  pos3: T (should be E) -> so T is not at 3? But T is at 5? So we get (-) for T? Meaning T is in the word but not at 3? Which is true? 
  Similarly, E is at pos4? But should be at 3? So E is present but not at 4? 
  R is at pos5? But should be at 4? So R is present but not at 5? 

So the feedback is consistent? But it doesn't give us new information about the pattern? We already know the pattern? 

But we did learn that F is absent? So the second letter cannot be F? 

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is ""avert""? Because we have two candidates: after and avert? And after is eliminated because F is absent? 

So the secret word must be ""avert""? 

But let me confirm: 
  ""avert"": A, V, E, R, T? 
  Position 1: A -> matches
  Position 2: V -> we haven't tried V? 
  Position 3: E -> matches
  Position 4: R -> matches
  Position 5: T -> matches

And we have eliminated F? So it must be ""avert""? 

But we have to make sure there are no other possibilities? 

What about other words? For example, ""apert""? Not common? ""award""? Doesn't fit? ""aorta""? No E? 

So ""avert"" is the only common word? 

But note: in the feedback for guess3, we got T(-) for position 3? But in ""avert"", T is at position 5? So if we guess ""avert"", we should get all ✓? 

So we can guess ""avert"" for the next guess? 

But we are at guess 4? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there any other letter that could be at position 2? 

We have eliminated: C, N, L, F? And we know the second letter cannot be A, E, R, T? So the only common letters left for position 2 that form a word are V? 

What about ""aster""? But ""aster"" is A, S, T, E, R? Then positions: 
  1: A
  2: S
  3: T? But we need E at 3? So no? 

Or ""askew""? Not matching pattern? 

So I think ""avert"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore, we guess ""avert"". 

But let me double-check the feedback from guess3: 
  We guessed ""after"": 
    A(✓) -> correct
    F(x) -> absent
    T(-) -> T is in the word but not at position 3? Which is true? 
    E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 4? True? 
    R(-) -> R is in the word but not at position 5? True? 

And we know the pattern is A _ E R T? 

So the second letter must be V? 

Thus, the next guess is ""avert"". 

We output: <guess>avert</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (crane)**:
   - `C` and `N` are absent (x).
   - `R`, `A`, `E` are present but misplaced (-), meaning:
     - `R` is not in position 2.
     - `A` is not in position 3.
     - `E` is not in position 5.

2. **Guess 2 (alert)**:
   - `A` is correct at position 1 (✓).
   - `L` is absent (x).
   - `E` is correct at position 3 (✓).
   - `R` is correct at position 4 (✓).
   - `T` is correct at position 5 (✓).
   - **Conclusion**: The secret word has the pattern **A _ E R T** (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 fixed). The missing letter (position 2) must be a new letter (not `A`, `E`, `R`, `T` due to no duplicates) and not `C`, `N`, `L` (absent).

3. **Guess 3 (after)**:
   - `A` is correct at position 1 (✓) — expected.
   - `F` is absent (x) — new elimination.
   - `T` is misplaced (-) — present but not at position 3.
   - `E` is misplaced (-) — present but not at position 4.
   - `R` is misplaced (-) — present but not at position 5.
   - **Conclusion**: 
     - `F` is eliminated (absent).
     - The pattern **A _ E R T** remains valid (feedback for `T`, `E`, `R` is consistent with their known positions: `T` belongs at 5, `E` at 3, `R` at 4).
     - The only remaining common word fitting the pattern and constraints is **AVERT** (position 2 = `V`).

### Next Guess:
- **AVERT** is the only feasible solution:
  - Matches the pattern **A _ E R T**.
  - Position 2 = `V` (untested letter, not eliminated).
  - All other possibilities (e.g., AFTER) are eliminated by feedback.
