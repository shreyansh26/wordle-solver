We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but in the wrong position

 So, from this, we know:
 - The word does not contain C, R, A, or N.
 - The word does contain E, but not in the last position (since E was the fifth letter in ""crane"", and it's marked as '-' meaning it's present but not in that position).

 We also used up one of our six tries, and we have five left.

 Now, we need to make a new guess that:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Must include the letter E (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fifth position.
 3. Must not include C, R, A, or N.

 Additionally, to maximize information, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note E is in the word)
 Common vowels: We know E is present, and we haven't tried I, O, U? Actually, we only tried A (which is absent), but E is present.

 So we should try to include E in a position that is not the last, and avoid positions 1,2,3,4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and it was wrong. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 We need to test new positions for E and introduce new letters.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Contains E, but not at the end (position 5) and also avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 - We might also want to include other vowels or common consonants.

 Idea: Try words starting with E? But we don't know if E is in the first position. Alternatively, place E in the middle.

 Example words:
 - ""SPIEL"" -> but this has I and L, however, we haven't tested I or L yet.
 - ""QUERY"" -> has Q and U, which are less common. Also, we know R is absent? Wait, R was marked x in first guess, so no.

 But from feedback, R is not in the word, so avoid R.

 Since E is present and not at the end, and we avoid C, R, A, N, let's choose a word with E in position 1 to 4.

 How about ""TIGER""? But we must avoid R. So no.

 Another idea: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E. But note, E is at the end? Then it would be position 5, which we know from feedback is wrong for E. So we must avoid having E at the end.

 So we need E not at the fifth position.

 Possible word: ""SPITE"" -> E is at the end? Position 5. Avoid.

 How about ""TIMES""? Let's check:
 - T, I, M, E, S -> E is at position 4 (not 5).
 - Letters: T, I, M, E, S, none of which are C, R, A, N.

 This seems good.

 But let me think of other possibilities: ""MEETS"" -> but this has double E? And E in positions 2 and 5? We avoid position 5, but we also have E in position 2. However, since we don't know the positions, it's okay to have E in multiple positions? Actually, we don't know if the word has one or two E's. However, the feedback only indicated one E? No, the feedback might not show all occurrences? Actually, in Wordle-like games, the feedback shows each instance. Since we only have one E and it was marked as present but wrong position, that means there is at least one E. But there could be more.

 However, we should be cautious: if we use two E's, we might get information about another position. But let's stick to distinct letters as much as possible for maximum information.

 So ""TIMES"" has distinct letters: T, I, M, E, S. All distinct? T, I, M, E, S -> yes, five distinct.

 Also, we haven't tested T, I, M, S yet.

 So we guess ""TIMES"".

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> distinct and avoids C,R,A,N and ends with L, so E is not at the end? Let's see positions: 
 Position 1: S, 2: P, 3: I, 4: E, 5: L -> E is at position 4 (not 5). It also has I and E (a vowel).

 But ""SPIEL"" is a valid English word? It means a game or a match in German? Sometimes accepted in word games? We should choose words that are common.

 Another word: ""PULSE"" -> E is at the end? Position 5 -> avoid.

 Word: ""SHINE"" -> E at the end -> avoid.

 Word: ""DIKES"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 Word: ""BIDET"" -> letters B,I,D,E,T. E at position 4? Then position 1: B, 2: I, 3: D, 4: E, 5: T -> E is fourth. And avoids C,R,A,N.

 But I think ""TIMES"" is more common. I'll go with ""TIMES"".

 So the guess is ""times"".

 But note: we are avoiding the letters that were absent: C, R, A, N. And we are including E, which is present.

 Therefore, second guess: ""TIMES""

 Let me write it: T-I-M-E-S

 We'll get feedback for each letter.

 Now, output in the required format.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- The word does not contain C, R, A, or N (all marked ""x"").
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"").
- The new guess must include E in a position other than 5th and avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

A strategic next guess should:
1. Place E in a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th) to test for its correct placement.
2. Introduce common untested letters (e.g., T, I, M, S) for maximum information.
3. Avoid repeating absent letters.

""TIMES"" meets these criteria:
- T, I, M, E, S are untested letters.
- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).
- All letters are distinct and avoided from the absent set (C, R, A, N).

 So, from this, we know:

Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n 2. Must include the letter E (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the fifth position.\n 3. Must not include C, R, A, or N.\n\n Additionally, to maximize information, we should try to include other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note E is in the word)\n Common vowels: We know E is present, and we haven\'t tried I, O, U? Actually, we only tried A (which is absent), but E is present.\n\n So we should try to include E in a position that is not the last, and avoid positions 1,2,3,4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and it was wrong. So E could be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n We need to test new positions for E and introduce new letters.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that:\n - Contains E, but not at the end (position 5) and also avoids the letters C, R, A, N.\n - We might also want to include other vowels or common consonants.\n\n Idea: Try words starting with E? But we don\'t know if E is in the first position. Alternatively, place E in the middle.\n\n Example words:\n - ""SPIEL"" -> but this has I and L, however, we haven\'t tested I or L yet.\n - ""QUERY"" -> has Q and U, which are less common. Also, we know R is absent? Wait, R was marked x in first guess, so no.\n\n But from feedback, R is not in the word, so avoid R.\n\n Since E is present and not at the end, and we avoid C, R, A, N, let\'s choose a word with E in position 1 to 4.\n\n How about ""TIGER""? But we must avoid R. So no.\n\n Another idea: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E. But note, E is at the end? Then it would be position 5, which we know from feedback is wrong for E. So we must avoid having E at the end.\n\n So we need E not at the fifth position.\n\n Possible word: ""SPITE"" -> E is at the end? Position 5. Avoid.\n\n How about ""TIMES""? Let\'s check:\n - T, I, M, E, S -> E is at position 4 (not 5).\n - Letters: T, I, M, E, S, none of which are C, R, A, N.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But let me think of other possibilities: ""MEETS"" -> but this has double E? And E in positions 2 and 5? We avoid position 5, but we also have E in position 2. However, since we don\'t know the positions, it\'s okay to have E in multiple positions? Actually, we don\'t know if the word has one or two E\'s. However, the feedback only indicated one E? No, the feedback might not show all occurrences? Actually, in Wordle-like games, the feedback shows each instance. Since we only have one E and it was marked as present but wrong position, that means there is at least one E. But there could be more.\n\n However, we should be cautious: if we use two E\'s, we might get information about another position. But let\'s stick to distinct letters as much as possible for maximum information.\n\n So ""TIMES"" has distinct letters: T, I, M, E, S. All distinct? T, I, M, E, S -> yes, five distinct.\n\n Also, we haven\'t tested T, I, M, S yet.\n\n So we guess ""TIMES"".\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> distinct and avoids C,R,A,N and ends with L, so E is not at the end? Let\'s see positions: \n Position 1: S, 2: P, 3: I, 4: E, 5: L -> E is at position 4 (not 5). It also has I and E (a vowel).\n\n But ""SPIEL"" is a valid English word? It means a game or a match in German? Sometimes accepted in word games? We should choose words that are common.\n\n Another word: ""PULSE"" -> E is at the end? Position 5 -> avoid.\n\n Word: ""SHINE"" -> E at the end -> avoid.\n\n Word: ""DIKES"" -> E at the end? Avoid.\n\n Word: ""BIDET"" -> letters B,I,D,E,T. E at position 4? Then position 1: B, 2: I, 3: D, 4: E, 5: T -> E is fourth. And avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n But I think ""TIMES"" is more common. I\'ll go with ""TIMES"".\n\n So the guess is ""times"".\n\n But note: we are avoiding the letters that were absent: C, R, A, N. And we are including E, which is present.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""TIMES""\n\n Let me write it: T-I-M-E-S\n\n We\'ll get feedback for each letter.\n\n Now, output in the required format.Based on the previous feedback:\n- The word does not contain C, R, A, or N (all marked ""x"").\n- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"").\n- The new guess must include E in a position other than 5th and avoid the letters C, R, A, N.\n\nA strategic next guess should:\n1. Place E in a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th) to test for its correct placement.\n2. Introduce common untested letters (e.g., T, I, M, S) for maximum information.\n3. Avoid repeating absent letters.\n\n""TIMES"" meets these criteria:\n- T, I, M, E, S are untested letters.\n- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).\n- All letters are distinct and avoided from the absent set (C, R, A, N).\n\n<guess>times</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(-) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the second guess ""times"":
 T: ✓ -> correct letter in correct position (so the first letter is T)
 I: - -> in the word but wrong position (so I is in the word, but not in the second position)
 M: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position (we already knew E was in the word, now we know it's not in the fourth position either)
 S: x -> not in the word

 Now, combining with the first guess:
 - We know the word starts with T (from the ✓ on T in ""times"").
 - We know E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5 (from the two guesses: in ""crane"" it was position 5, in ""times"" position 4, both wrong).
 - We know I is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""times"").
 - We know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, M, S (from the x's in both guesses).

 Also, from the first guess, we had E present, and now we have I present.

 So the word has at least T (in position 1), I, and E.

 Now, we need to make a new guess that:
 1. Starts with T (since T is fixed in position 1).
 2. Contains I (but not in position 2) and E (but not in position 4 or 5).
 3. Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, S.

 We have 5 positions: T _ _ _ _

 We know I is in the word but not in position 2, so I must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5, so E must be in position 2 or 3? 
 But wait: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. 
 We know E is not in 4 or 5 (from the two guesses). 
 Also, in the first guess, E was in position 5 (wrong) and in the second guess, E was in position 4 (wrong). 
 So E cannot be in position 4 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

 However, position 1 is T, so E cannot be in position 1. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

 But note: we also have I that must be in position 3,4, or 5. And we have two letters to place: I and E, and they might be the same? No, because they are different letters.

 So the word has T in position 1, and then in the remaining four positions, we have to place E (in 2 or 3) and I (in 3,4, or 5) and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, M, S.

 We need to choose a word that fits these constraints and tests new letters.

 Let's list the available positions:

 Position 1: T (fixed)
 Position 2: cannot be I (because I is not in position 2) and cannot be E? Not necessarily, E can be in position 2.

 Possibilities for position 2: 
   - It could be E (if E is in position 2) or a new letter that we haven't tested.

 But we also have to place I in one of the positions 3,4,5.

 We should try to test E in position 2 or 3? Since we know E is in 2 or 3, we can try to put E in position 2 to see if it's there.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 3 and see.

 However, we also have to introduce new letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are not in the absent list: 
   Absent: C, R, A, N, M, S
   Present: T, E, I (and we know T is fixed at 1, E and I are somewhere)

 Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We should try to use common letters: like L, O, P, U, D, G, etc.

 Now, we need a word that starts with T, and then has E in position 2 or 3, and I in position 3,4, or 5, and avoids the absent letters.

 Let's try to form words:

 Option 1: E in position 2 -> then the word is T E _ _ _
   Then we need I in position 3,4, or 5.
   Also, we have two more letters to fill.

   Example: 
     T E N I S -> but N and S are absent -> invalid.
     T E D D Y -> but D and Y are available? But we have two D's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we should avoid using absent letters.

   How about: T E P I D -> T E P I D
     Letters: T, E, P, I, D -> all not in the absent list? 
        P and D are new.
        But note: we have E in position 2 (which we are testing) and I in position 4 (which is allowed because I is not in position 2).

   But we must check if ""tepid"" is a word? Yes, meaning lukewarm.

   However, we have to consider: in this word, E is in position 2 and I in position 4. 
   But we don't know if E is actually in position 2 or 3. We are testing.

   Alternatively, we could put E in position 3 and I in position 2? But wait, we know I cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""times"": I was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, meaning it's not there). So I cannot be in position 2. Therefore, if we put E in position 2, then I must be in 3,4, or 5.

   So ""tepid"" is a candidate.

 Option 2: E in position 3 -> then the word is T _ E _ _
   Then I must be in position 2,4, or 5? But position 2: we cannot put I there because we know I is not in position 2. So I must be in position 4 or 5.

   Example: T O E I S -> but O is new, but S is absent -> invalid.
            T I E D -> too short? 5 letters: T I E D? Not 5. 
            T I E R S -> but R and S absent -> invalid.
            T H E I R -> but R is absent -> invalid.
            T H E M E -> but M is absent -> invalid.

   How about: T O E P I -> not a word? 
            T O I L E -> but E is at the end? We cannot have E at position 5? But in this case, we are putting E at position 3? Then the word would be T O I L E -> but then E is at position 5? That's not allowed because we know E is not in position 5. So we must avoid E at 5.

   Actually, if we put E at position 3, then the last two positions must be filled without E? Because E is only once? Or could there be two E's? We don't know. The feedback only told us there is at least one E. But we have to consider the possibility of two E's? However, in the first guess, we had one E and it was marked, and in the second guess we had one E and it was marked. So if there were two E's, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks the ones that are present. Actually, if there are two E's, then both would be marked? But in the second guess, we only had one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So it's possible that there is only one E.

   But to be safe, we should not assume only one E. However, we have no evidence of two E's. So we can try to avoid putting E in position 5? Because we know from the first guess that position 5 is not E. Similarly, from the second guess, position 4 is not E. So E must be in 2 or 3.

   Therefore, in the word, E is only in 2 or 3? But if we put E in position 3, then we don't put E in 5. So that's safe.

   Now, for I: we cannot put I in position 2. So if we have T _ E _ _, then I must be in position 4 or 5.

   Example: T I E ? ? -> but I cannot be in position 2 -> so we cannot have I in position 2. So we must have a letter that is not I in position 2.

   So: T ? E I ? -> then I is in position 4? 
        T ? E ? I -> then I is in position 5.

   How about: T U E D I -> not a word? 
        T O E I L -> but L is new, and E in 3, I in 4? Then the word is T O E I L? Not a common word.

   Another: T I E L D -> but I in position 2? Not allowed.

   How about: T H E I R -> but R is absent.

   It's hard to find a word with E in position 3 and I in 4 or 5 without using absent letters.

   So let's go back to the first option: E in position 2.

   Candidate: ""tepid"" -> T E P I D

   But let's check the letters: 
        T: we know is correct in position 1 (so we don't need to test it again, but it's fixed so it's okay)
        E: we are testing position 2
        P: new letter
        I: we are putting in position 4 (which is allowed because I is not in position 2, and we don't know about position 4)
        D: new letter

   This word uses two new letters: P and D.

   Alternatively, we could try ""T E C H Y"" -> but C is absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E N T S"" -> N and S absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E A L S"" -> A and S absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E D I S"" -> S absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E N T H"" -> N absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E L L Y"" -> L and Y, but we have two L's? And E in position 2, I is not included? But we must include I because we know I is in the word. So we cannot skip I.

   We must include I because we know it's in the word. So the word must have I.

   Therefore, ""tepid"" is a good candidate because it has I in position 4.

   Another candidate: ""T E X I T"" -> but X is new, but we have T at the end? And we already have T at the beginning? And we don't know if T can be repeated? But the feedback for T in the second guess was correct in position 1, but if there is another T, it might be marked? However, we don't have any indication of a second T. Also, ""text"" is 4 letters, ""texit"" is not a word.

   How about ""T E M P T"" -> but M is absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E P I D"" is the best so far.

   But note: we have to avoid M and S, which we are.

   Another possibility: ""T E A C H"" -> A and C absent -> invalid.

   So I think ""tepid"" is a good guess.

   However, we are using E in position 2 and I in position 4. If the word actually has E in position 3 and I in position 5, then we might not get much information? But we are testing two positions at once.

   Alternatively, we could try to put E in position 3 and I in position 5? But we need a word that starts with T, then a new letter (not I) in position 2, then E in position 3, then a new letter in position 4, then I in position 5.

   Example: T ? E ? I

   With ? not in {C,R,A,N,M,S} and not I (for position 2) and not E (for position 4, but we are putting E in 3) and the last letter is I.

   How about: T O K E I? Not a word.
            T U N E I? N absent -> invalid.
            T A K E I? A absent -> invalid.
            T I L E I? I in position 2? Not allowed and also two I's? 
            T H E B I? H, E, B, I -> then the word is T H E B I? Not a word.
            T H E Y I? Not a word.

   It's difficult. So let's stick with ""tepid"".

   But note: we are also testing the letter P and D. If they are absent, we get x, which is also information.

   So I'll go with ""tepid"".

   Therefore, third guess: ""tepid""

   Format: <guess>tepid</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **T(✓)**: The first letter is **T** (fixed).
- **I(-)**: **I** is in the word but not in position 2.
- **M(x)**: **M** is absent (newly excluded).
- **E(-)**: **E** is in the word but not in position 4 (and not in position 5, from the first guess).
- **S(x)**: **S** is absent (newly excluded).

### Key Constraints:
- The word starts with **T**.
- **I** must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **E** must be in position 2 or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid for E).
- Excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, M, S**.
- New guess must include **I** and **E** while testing new common letters.

### Strategy:
- Test **E** in position 2 and **I** in position 4 (to cover common positions).
- Use new high-frequency letters (**P**, **D**) for the remaining positions.
- Avoid excluded letters and positions.

**Guess: ""tepid""**  
- **T** (position 1): Correct (✓), fixed.  
- **E** (position 2): Tests if E is in position 2.  
- **P** (position 3): New letter test.  
- **I** (position 4): Tests I in position 4 (valid per feedback).  
- **D** (position 5): New letter test.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities for **E** and **I** while probing new letters.

<guess>tepid</guess>",tepid,"We have feedback from the second guess ""times"":
 T: ✓ -> correct letter in correct position (so the first letter is T)
 I: - -> in the word but wrong position (so I is in the word, but not in the second position)
 M: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position (we already knew E was in the word, now we know it's not in the fourth position either)
 S: x -> not in the word

 Now, combining with the first guess:
 - We know the word starts with T (from the ✓ on T in ""times"").
 - We know E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5 (from the two guesses: in ""crane"" it was position 5, in ""times"" position 4, both wrong).
 - We know I is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""times"").
 - We know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, M, S (from the x's in both guesses).

 Also, from the first guess, we had E present, and now we have I present.

 So the word has at least T (in position 1), I, and E.

 Now, we need to make a new guess that:
 1. Starts with T (since T is fixed in position 1).
 2. Contains I (but not in position 2) and E (but not in position 4 or 5).
 3. Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, S.

 We have 5 positions: T _ _ _ _

 We know I is in the word but not in position 2, so I must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5, so E must be in position 2 or 3? 
 But wait: positions are 1,2,3,4,5. 
 We know E is not in 4 or 5 (from the two guesses). 
 Also, in the first guess, E was in position 5 (wrong) and in the second guess, E was in position 4 (wrong). 
 So E cannot be in position 4 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

 However, position 1 is T, so E cannot be in position 1. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

 But note: we also have I that must be in position 3,4, or 5. And we have two letters to place: I and E, and they might be the same? No, because they are different letters.

 So the word has T in position 1, and then in the remaining four positions, we have to place E (in 2 or 3) and I (in 3,4, or 5) and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, M, S.

 We need to choose a word that fits these constraints and tests new letters.

 Let's list the available positions:

 Position 1: T (fixed)
 Position 2: cannot be I (because I is not in position 2) and cannot be E? Not necessarily, E can be in position 2.

 Possibilities for position 2: 
   - It could be E (if E is in position 2) or a new letter that we haven't tested.

 But we also have to place I in one of the positions 3,4,5.

 We should try to test E in position 2 or 3? Since we know E is in 2 or 3, we can try to put E in position 2 to see if it's there.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 3 and see.

 However, we also have to introduce new letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are not in the absent list: 
   Absent: C, R, A, N, M, S
   Present: T, E, I (and we know T is fixed at 1, E and I are somewhere)

 Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We should try to use common letters: like L, O, P, U, D, G, etc.

 Now, we need a word that starts with T, and then has E in position 2 or 3, and I in position 3,4, or 5, and avoids the absent letters.

 Let's try to form words:

 Option 1: E in position 2 -> then the word is T E _ _ _
   Then we need I in position 3,4, or 5.
   Also, we have two more letters to fill.

   Example: 
     T E N I S -> but N and S are absent -> invalid.
     T E D D Y -> but D and Y are available? But we have two D's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we should avoid using absent letters.

   How about: T E P I D -> T E P I D
     Letters: T, E, P, I, D -> all not in the absent list? 
        P and D are new.
        But note: we have E in position 2 (which we are testing) and I in position 4 (which is allowed because I is not in position 2).

   But we must check if ""tepid"" is a word? Yes, meaning lukewarm.

   However, we have to consider: in this word, E is in position 2 and I in position 4.

Therefore, if we put E in position 2, then I must be in 3,4, or 5.

   So ""tepid"" is a candidate.

 Option 2: E in position 3 -> then the word is T _ E _ _
   Then I must be in position 2,4, or 5? But position 2: we cannot put I there because we know I is not in position 2. So I must be in position 4 or 5.

   Example: T O E I S -> but O is new, but S is absent -> invalid.
            T I E D -> too short? 5 letters: T I E D? Not 5. 
            T I E R S -> but R and S absent -> invalid.
            T H E I R -> but R is absent -> invalid.
            T H E M E -> but M is absent -> invalid.

   How about: T O E P I -> not a word? 
            T O I L E -> but E is at the end? We cannot have E at position 5? But in this case, we are putting E at position 3? Then the word would be T O I L E -> but then E is at position 5? That's not allowed because we know E is not in position 5. So we must avoid E at 5.

   Actually, if we put E at position 3, then the last two positions must be filled without E? Because E is only once? Or could there be two E's? We don't know. The feedback only told us there is at least one E. But we have to consider the possibility of two E's?

   Therefore, in the word, E is only in 2 or 3? But if we put E in position 3, then we don't put E in 5. So that's safe.

   Now, for I: we cannot put I in position 2. So if we have T _ E _ _, then I must be in position 4 or 5.

   Example: T I E ? ? -> but I cannot be in position 2 -> so we cannot have I in position 2. So we must have a letter that is not I in position 2.

   So: T ? E I ? -> then I is in position 4? 
        T ? E ? I -> then I is in position 5.

   How about: T U E D I -> not a word? 
        T O E I L -> but L is new, and E in 3, I in 4? Then the word is T O E I L? Not a common word.

   Another: T I E L D -> but I in position 2? Not allowed.

   How about: T H E I R -> but R is absent.

   It's hard to find a word with E in position 3 and I in 4 or 5 without using absent letters.

   So let's go back to the first option: E in position 2.

   Candidate: ""tepid"" -> T E P I D

   But let's check the letters: 
        T: we know is correct in position 1 (so we don't need to test it again, but it's fixed so it's okay)
        E: we are testing position 2
        P: new letter
        I: we are putting in position 4 (which is allowed because I is not in position 2, and we don't know about position 4)
        D: new letter

   This word uses two new letters: P and D.

   Alternatively, we could try ""T E C H Y"" -> but C is absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E N T S"" -> N and S absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E A L S"" -> A and S absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E D I S"" -> S absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E N T H"" -> N absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E L L Y"" -> L and Y, but we have two L's? And E in position 2, I is not included? But we must include I because we know I is in the word. So we cannot skip I.

   We must include I because we know it's in the word. So the word must have I.

   Therefore, ""tepid"" is a good candidate because it has I in position 4.

   Another candidate: ""T E X I T"" -> but X is new, but we have T at the end? And we already have T at the beginning? And we don't know if T can be repeated? But the feedback for T in the second guess was correct in position 1, but if there is another T, it might be marked? However, we don't have any indication of a second T. Also, ""text"" is 4 letters, ""texit"" is not a word.

   How about ""T E M P T"" -> but M is absent -> invalid.

   Another: ""T E P I D"" is the best so far.

   But note: we have to avoid M and S, which we are.

   Another possibility: ""T E A C H"" -> A and C absent -> invalid.

   So I think ""tepid"" is a good guess.

   However, we are using E in position 2 and I in position 4. If the word actually has E in position 3 and I in position 5, then we might not get much information? But we are testing two positions at once.

   Alternatively, we could try to put E in position 3 and I in position 5? But we need a word that starts with T, then a new letter (not I) in position 2, then E in position 3, then a new letter in position 4, then I in position 5.

   Example: T ? E ? I

   With ? not in {C,R,A,N,M,S} and not I (for position 2) and not E (for position 4, but we are putting E in 3) and the last letter is I.

   How about: T O K E I? Not a word.
            T U N E I? N absent -> invalid.
            T A K E I? A absent -> invalid.
            T I L E I? I in position 2? Not allowed and also two I's? 
            T H E B I? H, E, B, I -> then the word is T H E B I? Not a word.
            T H E Y I? Not a word.

   It's difficult. So let's stick with ""tepid"".

   But note: we are also testing the letter P and D. If they are absent, we get x, which is also information.

   So I'll go with ""tepid"".

   Therefore, third guess: ""tepid""

   Format: <guess>tepid</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **T(✓)**: The first letter is **T** (fixed).
- **I(-)**: **I** is in the word but not in position 2.
- **M(x)**: **M** is absent (newly excluded).
- **E(-)**: **E** is in the word but not in position 4 (and not in position 5, from the first guess).
- **S(x)**: **S** is absent (newly excluded).

### Key Constraints:
- The word starts with **T**.
- **I** must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **E** must be in position 2 or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid for E).
- Excluded letters: **C, R, A, N, M, S**.
- New guess must include **I** and **E** while testing new common letters.

### Strategy:
- Test **E** in position 2 and **I** in position 4 (to cover common positions).
- Use new high-frequency letters (**P**, **D**) for the remaining positions.
- Avoid excluded letters and positions.

**Guess: ""tepid""**  
- **T** (position 1): Correct (✓), fixed.  
- **E** (position 2): Tests if E is in position 2.  
- **P** (position 3): New letter test.  
- **I** (position 4): Tests I in position 4 (valid per feedback).  
- **D** (position 5): New letter test.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities for **E** and **I** while probing new letters.",Guess 3: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) E(✓) P(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
