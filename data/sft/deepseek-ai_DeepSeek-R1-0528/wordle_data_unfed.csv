We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, it must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3).
Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). However, note that the word has 5 letters.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A.
  - Contains both N and E (but not in the same positions as in ""crane"").
  - We want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We can also note that the positions of N and E in the secret word are not 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

But note: we don't know if N and E are repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But we should be cautious.

We want to maximize the information from the next guess. So we should try to place N and E in new positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, R, A are absent, while N and E are present).

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try to include S, T, L, O, etc.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5.

Let's try to form a word that has:
  - E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)
  - N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

And we want to avoid positions 4 for N and 5 for E.

Example words:

Option 1: Place E in position 1? Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don't know the rest.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have E and N and don't have C, R, A.

For example:
  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that's invalid.

We need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.

Another example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. 
  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). 
  - But we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.

But we can use this.

Another common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.

But note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.

How about ""STONE""? 
  - S, T, O, N, E.
  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was '-', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.

Similarly, E is not in position 5.

So in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that's the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".

We need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's try ""NOISE"": 
  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""NEEDS"": 
  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.

""INLET"": 
  - I, N, L, E, T.
  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). 
  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven't tried I, L, T.

This seems good.

Another option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.

But ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). 
  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.

We haven't tried O, S, T.

But wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That's acceptable.

We can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.

Similarly, avoid R and A.

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

So let's go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.

We can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don't have feedback about two N's. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""INEPT"": 
  - I, N, E, P, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.

But we haven't tried P.

We can also try ""TOKEN"": 
  - T, O, K, E, N. 
  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don't have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.

But in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it's not in position 4). 

But note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven't tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven't tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that's acceptable.

But we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn't have them.

However, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.

But let's think about the letters: 
  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.
  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.

We might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven't tested S.

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.

So let's choose ""ONSET"".

But wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: 
  O N S E T -> positions: 
    1: O
    2: N
    3: S
    4: E
    5: T

So E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).

So we can use ""ONSET"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.

Another word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). 
  In ""STEIN"": 
    S, T, E, I, N -> 
    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). 
  But we don't know if the word has two E's? No, only one E and one N.

But ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we might prefer more common words.

I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""ONSET"".

But let me double-check: 
  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). 
  In ""ONSET"", we have:
    O: new letter
    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)
    S: new letter
    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)
    T: new letter

This will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.

Therefore, we guess ""ONSET"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).
- Avoids C, R, A.

<guess>onset</guess>",onset,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, it must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3).
Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). However, note that the word has 5 letters.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A.
  - Contains both N and E (but not in the same positions as in ""crane"").
  - We want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We can also note that the positions of N and E in the secret word are not 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

But note: we don't know if N and E are repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But we should be cautious.

We want to maximize the information from the next guess. So we should try to place N and E in new positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, R, A are absent, while N and E are present).

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try to include S, T, L, O, etc.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5.

Let's try to form a word that has:
  - E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)
  - N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

And we want to avoid positions 4 for N and 5 for E.

Example words:

Option 1: Place E in position 1? Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don't know the rest.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have E and N and don't have C, R, A.

For example:
  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that's invalid.

We need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.

Another example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. 
  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). 
  - But we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.

But we can use this.

Another common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.

But note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.

How about ""STONE""? 
  - S, T, O, N, E.
  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was '-', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.

Similarly, E is not in position 5.

So in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that's the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".

We need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's try ""NOISE"": 
  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""NEEDS"": 
  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.

""INLET"": 
  - I, N, L, E, T.
  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). 
  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven't tried I, L, T.

This seems good.

Another option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.

But ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). 
  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.

We haven't tried O, S, T.

But wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That's acceptable.

We can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.

Similarly, avoid R and A.

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

So let's go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.

We can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don't have feedback about two N's. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""INEPT"": 
  - I, N, E, P, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.

But we haven't tried P.

We can also try ""TOKEN"": 
  - T, O, K, E, N. 
  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don't have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.

But in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it's not in position 4). 

But note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven't tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven't tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that's acceptable.

But we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn't have them.

However, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.

But let's think about the letters: 
  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.
  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.

We might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven't tested S.

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.

So let's choose ""ONSET"".

But wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: 
  O N S E T -> positions: 
    1: O
    2: N
    3: S
    4: E
    5: T

So E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).

So we can use ""ONSET"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.

Another word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). 
  In ""STEIN"": 
    S, T, E, I, N -> 
    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). 
  But we don't know if the word has two E's? No, only one E and one N.

But ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we might prefer more common words.

I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""ONSET"".

But let me double-check: 
  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). 
  In ""ONSET"", we have:
    O: new letter
    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)
    S: new letter
    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)
    T: new letter

This will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.

Therefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).
- Avoids C, R, A.",Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,unfed,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, it must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3).
Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). However, note that the word has 5 letters.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A.
  - Contains both N and E (but not in the same positions as in ""crane"").
  - We want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We can also note that the positions of N and E in the secret word are not 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

But note: we don't know if N and E are repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But we should be cautious.

We want to maximize the information from the next guess. So we should try to place N and E in new positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, R, A are absent, while N and E are present).

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try to include S, T, L, O, etc.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5.

Let's try to form a word that has:
  - E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)
  - N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

And we want to avoid positions 4 for N and 5 for E.

Example words:

Option 1: Place E in position 1? Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don't know the rest.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have E and N and don't have C, R, A.

For example:
  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that's invalid.

We need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.

Another example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. 
  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). 
  - But we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.

But we can use this.

Another common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.

But note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.

How about ""STONE""? 
  - S, T, O, N, E.
  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was '-', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.

Similarly, E is not in position 5.

So in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that's the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".

We need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's try ""NOISE"": 
  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""NEEDS"": 
  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.

""INLET"": 
  - I, N, L, E, T.
  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). 
  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven't tried I, L, T.

This seems good.

Another option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.

But ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). 
  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.

We haven't tried O, S, T.

But wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That's acceptable.

We can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.

Similarly, avoid R and A.

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

So let's go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.

We can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don't have feedback about two N's. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""INEPT"": 
  - I, N, E, P, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.

But we haven't tried P.

We can also try ""TOKEN"": 
  - T, O, K, E, N. 
  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don't have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.

But in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it's not in position 4). 

But note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven't tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven't tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that's acceptable.

But we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn't have them.

However, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.

But let's think about the letters: 
  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.
  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.

We might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven't tested S.

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.

So let's choose ""ONSET"".

But wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: 
  O N S E T -> positions: 
    1: O
    2: N
    3: S
    4: E
    5: T

So E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).

So we can use ""ONSET"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.

Another word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). 
  In ""STEIN"": 
    S, T, E, I, N -> 
    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). 
  But we don't know if the word has two E's? No, only one E and one N.

But ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we might prefer more common words.

I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""ONSET"".

But let me double-check: 
  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). 
  In ""ONSET"", we have:
    O: new letter
    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)
    S: new letter
    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)
    T: new letter

This will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.

Therefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).
- Avoids C, R, A.

Yes.\n\nBut we might prefer more common words.\n\nI think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). \n  In ""ONSET"", we have:\n    O: new letter\n    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)\n    S: new letter\n    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)\n    T: new letter\n\nThis will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, R, or A.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.\n\nA suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:\n- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present but not in position 4.
    - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
  Meaning:
    - O, S, T are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present and in the correct position (position 2).
    - E is present and in the correct position (position 4).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has N in position 2 and E in position 4.
  - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but now we know it's in position 4).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ N _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

We know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E _ with the available letters.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that can fit.

We can try to use a word that includes some of the common remaining letters: L, I, D, M, P, etc.

Possible words:

- The word must have a letter in position 1, then N in 2, then a letter in 3, E in 4, and a letter in 5.

Examples:

1. ""INNER"": 
   - I, N, N, E, R -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.

2. ""MINCE"": 
   - M, I, N, C, E -> but C is absent, and also note: the form would be M (pos1), I (pos2?) -> but we need N in pos2, so actually it would be M (pos1), N (pos2), then C (pos3) -> but C is absent. Also, the word has E in pos5? No, in ""MINCE"" it's M-I-N-C-E, so E is in pos5? But we know E must be in pos4. So invalid.

We need E in pos4.

3. ""DINED"": 
   - D, I, N, E, D -> but wait, the form: D (pos1), I (pos2) -> but we need N in pos2? So no. We must have N in pos2.

So the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] E [letter5]

So for ""DINED"": it would be D (1), I (2) -> but we need N at 2, so that doesn't match.

We need a word that has the second letter as N and the fourth as E.

Let's list words that fit: _ N _ E _

Common words:

- ""ANKLE"": but A is absent and K is available? But A is absent, so no.

- ""ANGEL"": A is absent.

- ""INDEED"" is 6 letters.

- ""INDEX"": but we have E in the fourth position? I-N-D-E-X -> that's I (1), N (2), D (3), E (4), X (5). This fits the pattern. And the letters: I, D, X. We haven't tried I, D, X. Also, we must check if they are not in the absent list: I, D, X are not in the absent list (absent: C,R,A,O,S,T). So ""INDEX"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""INDEX"", the E is in position 4 (correct) and N in position 2 (correct). The other letters are I, D, X.

We can also consider:

- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> but R is absent.

- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).

- ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> this fits: M (1), I (2) -> wait, no: the word is M-I-N-E-D, so:
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: I -> but we need N at position 2? So that's incorrect.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word must be: [letter] + N + [letter] + E + [letter]

So ""MINED"" is M in 1, I in 2 -> that's not N in 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""ANKLE"" is invalid because of A.

What about ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
  Position 1: U
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: W
  Position 4: E -> correct
  Position 5: D

Letters: U, N, W, E, D. We haven't tried U, W, D. And they are not in the absent list.

But is ""UNWED"" a common word? It means not married, so yes.

Another word: ""INNED"": I, N, N, E, D -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: N -> but we don't know if N can be repeated? The feedback from the first guess had only one N and it was present, but that doesn't rule out two N's. However, in the second guess, we had one N and it was correct. So if the word has two N's, then in the second guess we would have only one N (in position 2) and the other N (if in position 3) would not be indicated? Actually, in Wordle, if there are two of the same letter, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But in ""onset"", we only had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word has two N's, then we would have gotten a hint for the second N? Not necessarily, because we didn't have a second N in the guess. So we don't know.

But ""INNED"" is a word (meaning: having nested). We can consider it.

But let's see: we have to avoid the absent letters. I and D are not absent.

But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's. We know at least one N is present (from first guess) and we now know it's in position 2. But there could be another N.

Similarly, for E: we know one E is in position 4, but there could be another E.

But to keep it simple, we might avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""INKLE"": I, N, K, E, L -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N
  Position 3: K
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: L

Letters: I, N, K, E, L. All are available.

But ""INKLE"" is a word (meaning: a kind of linen tape).

But we have many options.

We can also consider ""DANCE"", but A and C are absent.

Another common word: ""NICHE"" -> but N is in position 1? We need N in position 2. So no.

We need to focus on the pattern.

Let's list more words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).
- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> but S is absent and also the pattern: J (1), U (2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

We must have N at 2 and E at 4.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- ""INDEX"": as above, I, N, D, E, X -> positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5). This is a valid word.

- ""UNDER"": but R is absent.

- ""INNER"": but R is absent and also two N's? And R is absent.

- ""MINCE"": C is absent.

- ""DINGE"": D, I, N, G, E -> D(1), I(2) -> wait, no: D(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is D-I-N-G-E? Then it would be D(1), I(2), N(3) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word is: first letter, then N, then third letter, then E, then fifth letter.

So ""DINGE"" is D-I-N-G-E -> that's positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E -> that doesn't have E in position 4? Position 4 is G, and E is at 5? But we need E at 4. So no.

Another word: ""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> same issue: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5) -> E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So let's think of words ending with E? But the fourth letter is E, so the fifth can be anything.

Words: ... E _ 

But the pattern is: _ N _ E _

So the last letter is after E.

Examples: 
  ""UNCLE"": C is absent and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), C(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

  ""ANKLE"": A absent.

  ""APPLE"": A and P? But A absent, and also pattern: A(1), P(2) -> we need N at 2.

  ""AMPLE"": A absent.

  ""IMPEL"": I, M, P, E, L -> I(1), M(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""INNER"": I, N, N, E, R -> I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), R(5). This fits the pattern? 
    Position 1: I
    Position 2: N (correct)
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: E (correct)
    Position 5: R -> but R is absent. So invalid.

  ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""VINER"": not common? and R absent.

  ""WISER"": but W(1), I(2) -> not N at 2.

  ""UNZIP"": U, N, Z, I, P -> no E at position 4.

We need E at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have E in the fourth position and N in the second.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""ANKLE"" (invalid due to A)
- ""OUNCE"": O is absent and also O(1) -> but O is absent.
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> T is absent (from second guess) and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Wait, ""UNITE"" has E at 5, not 4.

What about ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> T is absent and E at 5.

Another word: ""ANGER"": A absent.

""INGLE"": I, N, G, L, E -> I(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

So the third letter is between N and E.

Examples: 
  ""ANODE"": A absent.
  ""ABOVE"": A absent and O absent? O is absent.
  ""ADOBE"": A and O absent.
  ""ALIKE"": A absent and the pattern: A(1), L(2) -> not N at 2.

We need to use the available letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

- ""INDEX"": I, N, D, E, X -> valid, as discussed.

- ""UNDEE"": not common? and U, N, D, E, E -> two E's? and the pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But we don't know about duplicates. Also, is ""UNDEE"" a word? It might be a surname or rare.

- ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> I(1), N(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: marked with ink). Letters: I, K, D are available.

- ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: not led). Letters: U, L, D available.

- ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). Word (meaning: not fed). Letters: U, F, D available.

- ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

We have several candidates: ""INDEX"", ""INKED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNFED"", etc.

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might give us more information.

We have to guess the entire word, so we might as well try to get as many new letters as possible.

We know the secret word has at least N and E, and we are trying to find the other three.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We can choose ""INDEX"" because it uses I, D, X which are common enough.

But let's see the frequency: I and D are very common, X is less common.

""INKED"" uses I, K, D.

""UNLED"" uses U, L, D.

""UNFED"" uses U, F, D.

We might prefer to use a word that has vowels? We have I and U as vowels.

But we already know E is in the word, and we have one vowel slot (position 1 and 3) to fill.

We can also consider ""MINKE"": M, I, N, K, E -> M(1), I(2) -> wait, no: M(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is M-I-N-K-E? Then it's M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Another word: ""BINGO"" doesn't have E.

We should go with one of the candidates.

Let's choose ""INDEX"" because it's a very common word.

But note: we have to make sure we haven't used any absent letters. I, D, X are not in the absent list.

So we guess ""INDEX"".

But wait, what if the word is ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED""? We are trying to get information.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover more letters. But in this case, we are forced to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common consonants.

But ""INDEX"" is fine.

Another candidate: ""IMPEL"" doesn't fit.

Or ""INFER"": I, N, F, E, R -> but R is absent.

So ""INDEX"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with more common letters.

What about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but the pattern: L(1), I(2) -> we need N at 2, so that's I at 2? No, the word is L-I-N-E-D -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. So we have N at position 3? But we need N at position 2. So invalid.

We must have N at position 2.

So I think ""INDEX"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, we guess ""INDEX"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T are absent; N is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T (cannot be used).
- Present letters: N and E (N is fixed in position 2, E in position 4).
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 5.
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ N _ E _` and uses only available letters.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, D, L, M) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters.

A strong candidate is **""INDEX""**:
- Fits the pattern: `I` (position 1), `N` (position 2, correct), `D` (position 3), `E` (position 4, correct), `X` (position 5).
- Uses new, common letters (I, D, X) to test positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, O, S, T).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>index</guess>",index,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present but not in position 4.
    - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
  Meaning:
    - O, S, T are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present and in the correct position (position 2).
    - E is present and in the correct position (position 4).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has N in position 2 and E in position 4.
  - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but now we know it's in position 4).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ N _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

We know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E _ with the available letters.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that can fit.

We can try to use a word that includes some of the common remaining letters: L, I, D, M, P, etc.

Possible words:

- The word must have a letter in position 1, then N in 2, then a letter in 3, E in 4, and a letter in 5.

Examples:

1. ""INNER"": 
   - I, N, N, E, R -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.

2. ""MINCE"": 
   - M, I, N, C, E -> but C is absent, and also note: the form would be M (pos1), I (pos2?) -> but we need N in pos2, so actually it would be M (pos1), N (pos2), then C (pos3) -> but C is absent. Also, the word has E in pos5? No, in ""MINCE"" it's M-I-N-C-E, so E is in pos5? But we know E must be in pos4. So invalid.

We need E in pos4.

3. ""DINED"": 
   - D, I, N, E, D -> but wait, the form: D (pos1), I (pos2) -> but we need N in pos2? So no. We must have N in pos2.

So the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] E [letter5]

So for ""DINED"": it would be D (1), I (2) -> but we need N at 2, so that doesn't match.

We need a word that has the second letter as N and the fourth as E.

Let's list words that fit: _ N _ E _

Common words:

- ""ANKLE"": but A is absent and K is available? But A is absent, so no.

- ""ANGEL"": A is absent.

- ""INDEED"" is 6 letters.

- ""INDEX"": but we have E in the fourth position? I-N-D-E-X -> that's I (1), N (2), D (3), E (4), X (5). This fits the pattern. And the letters: I, D, X. We haven't tried I, D, X. Also, we must check if they are not in the absent list: I, D, X are not in the absent list (absent: C,R,A,O,S,T). So ""INDEX"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""INDEX"", the E is in position 4 (correct) and N in position 2 (correct). The other letters are I, D, X.

We can also consider:

- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> but R is absent.

- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).

- ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> this fits: M (1), I (2) -> wait, no: the word is M-I-N-E-D, so:
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: I -> but we need N at position 2? So that's incorrect.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word must be: [letter] + N + [letter] + E + [letter]

So ""MINED"" is M in 1, I in 2 -> that's not N in 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""ANKLE"" is invalid because of A.

What about ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
  Position 1: U
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: W
  Position 4: E -> correct
  Position 5: D

Letters: U, N, W, E, D. We haven't tried U, W, D. And they are not in the absent list.

But is ""UNWED"" a common word? It means not married, so yes.

Another word: ""INNED"": I, N, N, E, D -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: N -> but we don't know if N can be repeated? The feedback from the first guess had only one N and it was present, but that doesn't rule out two N's. However, in the second guess, we had one N and it was correct. So if the word has two N's, then in the second guess we would have only one N (in position 2) and the other N (if in position 3) would not be indicated? Actually, in Wordle, if there are two of the same letter, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But in ""onset"", we only had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word has two N's, then we would have gotten a hint for the second N? Not necessarily, because we didn't have a second N in the guess. So we don't know.

But ""INNED"" is a word (meaning: having nested). We can consider it.

But let's see: we have to avoid the absent letters. I and D are not absent.

But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's. We know at least one N is present (from first guess) and we now know it's in position 2. But there could be another N.

Similarly, for E: we know one E is in position 4, but there could be another E.

But to keep it simple, we might avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""INKLE"": I, N, K, E, L -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N
  Position 3: K
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: L

Letters: I, N, K, E, L. All are available.

But ""INKLE"" is a word (meaning: a kind of linen tape).

But we have many options.

We can also consider ""DANCE"", but A and C are absent.

Another common word: ""NICHE"" -> but N is in position 1? We need N in position 2. So no.

We need to focus on the pattern.

Let's list more words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).
- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> but S is absent and also the pattern: J (1), U (2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

We must have N at 2 and E at 4.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- ""INDEX"": as above, I, N, D, E, X -> positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5). This is a valid word.

- ""UNDER"": but R is absent.

- ""INNER"": but R is absent and also two N's? And R is absent.

- ""MINCE"": C is absent.

- ""DINGE"": D, I, N, G, E -> D(1), I(2) -> wait, no: D(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is D-I-N-G-E? Then it would be D(1), I(2), N(3) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word is: first letter, then N, then third letter, then E, then fifth letter.

So ""DINGE"" is D-I-N-G-E -> that's positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E -> that doesn't have E in position 4? Position 4 is G, and E is at 5? But we need E at 4. So no.

Another word: ""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> same issue: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5) -> E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So let's think of words ending with E? But the fourth letter is E, so the fifth can be anything.

Words: ... E _ 

But the pattern is: _ N _ E _

So the last letter is after E.

Examples: 
  ""UNCLE"": C is absent and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), C(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

  ""ANKLE"": A absent.

  ""APPLE"": A and P? But A absent, and also pattern: A(1), P(2) -> we need N at 2.

  ""AMPLE"": A absent.

  ""IMPEL"": I, M, P, E, L -> I(1), M(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""INNER"": I, N, N, E, R -> I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), R(5). This fits the pattern? 
    Position 1: I
    Position 2: N (correct)
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: E (correct)
    Position 5: R -> but R is absent. So invalid.

  ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""VINER"": not common? and R absent.

  ""WISER"": but W(1), I(2) -> not N at 2.

  ""UNZIP"": U, N, Z, I, P -> no E at position 4.

We need E at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have E in the fourth position and N in the second.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""ANKLE"" (invalid due to A)
- ""OUNCE"": O is absent and also O(1) -> but O is absent.
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> T is absent (from second guess) and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Wait, ""UNITE"" has E at 5, not 4.

What about ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> T is absent and E at 5.

Another word: ""ANGER"": A absent.

""INGLE"": I, N, G, L, E -> I(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

So the third letter is between N and E.

Examples: 
  ""ANODE"": A absent.
  ""ABOVE"": A absent and O absent? O is absent.
  ""ADOBE"": A and O absent.
  ""ALIKE"": A absent and the pattern: A(1), L(2) -> not N at 2.

We need to use the available letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

- ""INDEX"": I, N, D, E, X -> valid, as discussed.

- ""UNDEE"": not common? and U, N, D, E, E -> two E's? and the pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But we don't know about duplicates. Also, is ""UNDEE"" a word? It might be a surname or rare.

- ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> I(1), N(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: marked with ink). Letters: I, K, D are available.

- ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: not led). Letters: U, L, D available.

- ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). Word (meaning: not fed). Letters: U, F, D available.

- ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

We have several candidates: ""INDEX"", ""INKED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNFED"", etc.

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might give us more information.

We have to guess the entire word, so we might as well try to get as many new letters as possible.

We know the secret word has at least N and E, and we are trying to find the other three.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We can choose ""INDEX"" because it uses I, D, X which are common enough.

But let's see the frequency: I and D are very common, X is less common.

""INKED"" uses I, K, D.

""UNLED"" uses U, L, D.

""UNFED"" uses U, F, D.

We might prefer to use a word that has vowels? We have I and U as vowels.

But we already know E is in the word, and we have one vowel slot (position 1 and 3) to fill.

We can also consider ""MINKE"": M, I, N, K, E -> M(1), I(2) -> wait, no: M(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is M-I-N-K-E? Then it's M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Another word: ""BINGO"" doesn't have E.

We should go with one of the candidates.

Let's choose ""INDEX"" because it's a very common word.

But note: we have to make sure we haven't used any absent letters. I, D, X are not in the absent list.

So we guess ""INDEX"".

But wait, what if the word is ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED""? We are trying to get information.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover more letters. But in this case, we are forced to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common consonants.

But ""INDEX"" is fine.

Another candidate: ""IMPEL"" doesn't fit.

Or ""INFER"": I, N, F, E, R -> but R is absent.

So ""INDEX"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with more common letters.

What about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but the pattern: L(1), I(2) -> we need N at 2, so that's I at 2? No, the word is L-I-N-E-D -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. So we have N at position 3? But we need N at position 2. So invalid.

We must have N at position 2.

So I think ""INDEX"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, we guess ""INDEX"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T are absent; N is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T (cannot be used).
- Present letters: N and E (N is fixed in position 2, E in position 4).
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 5.
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ N _ E _` and uses only available letters.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, D, L, M) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters.

A strong candidate is **""INDEX""**:
- Fits the pattern: `I` (position 1), `N` (position 2, correct), `D` (position 3), `E` (position 4, correct), `X` (position 5).
- Uses new, common letters (I, D, X) to test positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, O, S, T).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and their positions efficiently.",Guess 3: index -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) D(-) E(✓) X(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,unfed,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, it must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3).
Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). However, note that the word has 5 letters.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A.
  - Contains both N and E (but not in the same positions as in ""crane"").
  - We want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We can also note that the positions of N and E in the secret word are not 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

But note: we don't know if N and E are repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But we should be cautious.

We want to maximize the information from the next guess. So we should try to place N and E in new positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, R, A are absent, while N and E are present).

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try to include S, T, L, O, etc.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5.

Let's try to form a word that has:
  - E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)
  - N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

And we want to avoid positions 4 for N and 5 for E.

Example words:

Option 1: Place E in position 1? Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don't know the rest.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have E and N and don't have C, R, A.

For example:
  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that's invalid.

We need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.

Another example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. 
  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). 
  - But we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.

But we can use this.

Another common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.

But note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.

How about ""STONE""? 
  - S, T, O, N, E.
  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was '-', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.

Similarly, E is not in position 5.

So in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that's the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".

We need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's try ""NOISE"": 
  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""NEEDS"": 
  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.

""INLET"": 
  - I, N, L, E, T.
  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). 
  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven't tried I, L, T.

This seems good.

Another option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.

But ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). 
  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.

We haven't tried O, S, T.

But wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That's acceptable.

We can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.

Similarly, avoid R and A.

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

So let's go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.

We can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don't have feedback about two N's. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""INEPT"": 
  - I, N, E, P, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.

But we haven't tried P.

We can also try ""TOKEN"": 
  - T, O, K, E, N. 
  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don't have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.

But in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it's not in position 4). 

But note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven't tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven't tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that's acceptable.

But we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn't have them.

However, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.

But let's think about the letters: 
  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.
  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.

We might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven't tested S.

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.

So let's choose ""ONSET"".

But wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: 
  O N S E T -> positions: 
    1: O
    2: N
    3: S
    4: E
    5: T

So E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).

So we can use ""ONSET"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.

Another word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). 
  In ""STEIN"": 
    S, T, E, I, N -> 
    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). 
  But we don't know if the word has two E's? No, only one E and one N.

But ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we might prefer more common words.

I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""ONSET"".

But let me double-check: 
  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). 
  In ""ONSET"", we have:
    O: new letter
    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)
    S: new letter
    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)
    T: new letter

This will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.

Therefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).
- Avoids C, R, A.

<guess>onset</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present but not in position 4.
    - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
  Meaning:
    - O, S, T are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present and in the correct position (position 2).
    - E is present and in the correct position (position 4).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has N in position 2 and E in position 4.
  - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but now we know it's in position 4).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ N _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

We know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E _ with the available letters.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that can fit.

We can try to use a word that includes some of the common remaining letters: L, I, D, M, P, etc.

Possible words:

- The word must have a letter in position 1, then N in 2, then a letter in 3, E in 4, and a letter in 5.

Examples:

1. ""INNER"": 
   - I, N, N, E, R -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.

2. ""MINCE"": 
   - M, I, N, C, E -> but C is absent, and also note: the form would be M (pos1), I (pos2?) -> but we need N in pos2, so actually it would be M (pos1), N (pos2), then C (pos3) -> but C is absent. Also, the word has E in pos5? No, in ""MINCE"" it's M-I-N-C-E, so E is in pos5? But we know E must be in pos4. So invalid.

We need E in pos4.

3. ""DINED"": 
   - D, I, N, E, D -> but wait, the form: D (pos1), I (pos2) -> but we need N in pos2? So no. We must have N in pos2.

So the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] E [letter5]

So for ""DINED"": it would be D (1), I (2) -> but we need N at 2, so that doesn't match.

We need a word that has the second letter as N and the fourth as E.

Let's list words that fit: _ N _ E _

Common words:

- ""ANKLE"": but A is absent and K is available? But A is absent, so no.

- ""ANGEL"": A is absent.

- ""INDEED"" is 6 letters.

- ""INDEX"": but we have E in the fourth position? I-N-D-E-X -> that's I (1), N (2), D (3), E (4), X (5). This fits the pattern. And the letters: I, D, X. We haven't tried I, D, X. Also, we must check if they are not in the absent list: I, D, X are not in the absent list (absent: C,R,A,O,S,T). So ""INDEX"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""INDEX"", the E is in position 4 (correct) and N in position 2 (correct). The other letters are I, D, X.

We can also consider:

- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> but R is absent.

- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).

- ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> this fits: M (1), I (2) -> wait, no: the word is M-I-N-E-D, so:
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: I -> but we need N at position 2? So that's incorrect.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word must be: [letter] + N + [letter] + E + [letter]

So ""MINED"" is M in 1, I in 2 -> that's not N in 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""ANKLE"" is invalid because of A.

What about ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
  Position 1: U
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: W
  Position 4: E -> correct
  Position 5: D

Letters: U, N, W, E, D. We haven't tried U, W, D. And they are not in the absent list.

But is ""UNWED"" a common word? It means not married, so yes.

Another word: ""INNED"": I, N, N, E, D -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: N -> but we don't know if N can be repeated? The feedback from the first guess had only one N and it was present, but that doesn't rule out two N's. However, in the second guess, we had one N and it was correct. So if the word has two N's, then in the second guess we would have only one N (in position 2) and the other N (if in position 3) would not be indicated? Actually, in Wordle, if there are two of the same letter, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But in ""onset"", we only had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word has two N's, then we would have gotten a hint for the second N? Not necessarily, because we didn't have a second N in the guess. So we don't know.

But ""INNED"" is a word (meaning: having nested). We can consider it.

But let's see: we have to avoid the absent letters. I and D are not absent.

But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's. We know at least one N is present (from first guess) and we now know it's in position 2. But there could be another N.

Similarly, for E: we know one E is in position 4, but there could be another E.

But to keep it simple, we might avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""INKLE"": I, N, K, E, L -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N
  Position 3: K
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: L

Letters: I, N, K, E, L. All are available.

But ""INKLE"" is a word (meaning: a kind of linen tape).

But we have many options.

We can also consider ""DANCE"", but A and C are absent.

Another common word: ""NICHE"" -> but N is in position 1? We need N in position 2. So no.

We need to focus on the pattern.

Let's list more words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).
- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> but S is absent and also the pattern: J (1), U (2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

We must have N at 2 and E at 4.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- ""INDEX"": as above, I, N, D, E, X -> positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5). This is a valid word.

- ""UNDER"": but R is absent.

- ""INNER"": but R is absent and also two N's? And R is absent.

- ""MINCE"": C is absent.

- ""DINGE"": D, I, N, G, E -> D(1), I(2) -> wait, no: D(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is D-I-N-G-E? Then it would be D(1), I(2), N(3) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word is: first letter, then N, then third letter, then E, then fifth letter.

So ""DINGE"" is D-I-N-G-E -> that's positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E -> that doesn't have E in position 4? Position 4 is G, and E is at 5? But we need E at 4. So no.

Another word: ""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> same issue: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5) -> E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So let's think of words ending with E? But the fourth letter is E, so the fifth can be anything.

Words: ... E _ 

But the pattern is: _ N _ E _

So the last letter is after E.

Examples: 
  ""UNCLE"": C is absent and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), C(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

  ""ANKLE"": A absent.

  ""APPLE"": A and P? But A absent, and also pattern: A(1), P(2) -> we need N at 2.

  ""AMPLE"": A absent.

  ""IMPEL"": I, M, P, E, L -> I(1), M(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""INNER"": I, N, N, E, R -> I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), R(5). This fits the pattern? 
    Position 1: I
    Position 2: N (correct)
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: E (correct)
    Position 5: R -> but R is absent. So invalid.

  ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""VINER"": not common? and R absent.

  ""WISER"": but W(1), I(2) -> not N at 2.

  ""UNZIP"": U, N, Z, I, P -> no E at position 4.

We need E at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have E in the fourth position and N in the second.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""ANKLE"" (invalid due to A)
- ""OUNCE"": O is absent and also O(1) -> but O is absent.
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> T is absent (from second guess) and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Wait, ""UNITE"" has E at 5, not 4.

What about ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> T is absent and E at 5.

Another word: ""ANGER"": A absent.

""INGLE"": I, N, G, L, E -> I(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

So the third letter is between N and E.

Examples: 
  ""ANODE"": A absent.
  ""ABOVE"": A absent and O absent? O is absent.
  ""ADOBE"": A and O absent.
  ""ALIKE"": A absent and the pattern: A(1), L(2) -> not N at 2.

We need to use the available letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

- ""INDEX"": I, N, D, E, X -> valid, as discussed.

- ""UNDEE"": not common? and U, N, D, E, E -> two E's? and the pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But we don't know about duplicates. Also, is ""UNDEE"" a word? It might be a surname or rare.

- ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> I(1), N(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: marked with ink). Letters: I, K, D are available.

- ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: not led). Letters: U, L, D available.

- ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). Word (meaning: not fed). Letters: U, F, D available.

- ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

We have several candidates: ""INDEX"", ""INKED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNFED"", etc.

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might give us more information.

We have to guess the entire word, so we might as well try to get as many new letters as possible.

We know the secret word has at least N and E, and we are trying to find the other three.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We can choose ""INDEX"" because it uses I, D, X which are common enough.

But let's see the frequency: I and D are very common, X is less common.

""INKED"" uses I, K, D.

""UNLED"" uses U, L, D.

""UNFED"" uses U, F, D.

We might prefer to use a word that has vowels? We have I and U as vowels.

But we already know E is in the word, and we have one vowel slot (position 1 and 3) to fill.

We can also consider ""MINKE"": M, I, N, K, E -> M(1), I(2) -> wait, no: M(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is M-I-N-K-E? Then it's M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Another word: ""BINGO"" doesn't have E.

We should go with one of the candidates.

Let's choose ""INDEX"" because it's a very common word.

But note: we have to make sure we haven't used any absent letters. I, D, X are not in the absent list.

So we guess ""INDEX"".

But wait, what if the word is ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED""? We are trying to get information.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover more letters. But in this case, we are forced to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common consonants.

But ""INDEX"" is fine.

Another candidate: ""IMPEL"" doesn't fit.

Or ""INFER"": I, N, F, E, R -> but R is absent.

So ""INDEX"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with more common letters.

What about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but the pattern: L(1), I(2) -> we need N at 2, so that's I at 2? No, the word is L-I-N-E-D -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. So we have N at position 3? But we need N at position 2. So invalid.

We must have N at position 2.

So I think ""INDEX"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, we guess ""INDEX"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T are absent; N is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T (cannot be used).
- Present letters: N and E (N is fixed in position 2, E in position 4).
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 5.
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ N _ E _` and uses only available letters.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, D, L, M) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters.

A strong candidate is **""INDEX""**:
- Fits the pattern: `I` (position 1), `N` (position 2, correct), `D` (position 3), `E` (position 4, correct), `X` (position 5).
- Uses new, common letters (I, D, X) to test positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, O, S, T).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and their positions efficiently.

However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. But we should be cautious.\n\nWe want to maximize the information from the next guess. So we should try to place N and E in new positions and include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have already used: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, R, A are absent, while N and E are present).\n\nWe haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWe should try to include S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWe also need to place N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that has:\n  - E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)\n  - N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)\n\nAnd we want to avoid positions 4 for N and 5 for E.\n\nExample words:\n\nOption 1: Place E in position 1? Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don\'t know the rest.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C, R, A.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have E and N and don\'t have C, R, A.\n\nFor example:\n  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that\'s invalid.\n\nWe need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.\n\nAnother example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. \n  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). \n  - But we don\'t know if L, I, D are in the word.\n\nBut we can use this.\n\nAnother common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.\n\nBut note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.\n\nHow about ""STONE""? \n  - S, T, O, N, E.\n  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was \'-\', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.\n\nSimilarly, E is not in position 5.\n\nSo in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that\'s the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".\n\nWe need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nLet\'s try ""NOISE"": \n  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.\n\n""NEEDS"": \n  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.\n\n""INLET"": \n  - I, N, L, E, T.\n  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). \n  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven\'t tried I, L, T.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. \n  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.\n\nBut ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. \n  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). \n  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, S, T.\n\nBut wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That\'s acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R and A.\n\nAnother word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.\n\nWe can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don\'t have feedback about two N\'s. It might be acceptable, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nSo ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""INEPT"": \n  - I, N, E, P, T. \n  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried P.\n\nWe can also try ""TOKEN"": \n  - T, O, K, E, N. \n  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don\'t have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.\n\nBut in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it\'s not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it\'s not in position 4). \n\nBut note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven\'t tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nHowever, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.\n\nBut let\'s think about the letters: \n  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.\n  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.\n\nWe might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven\'t tested S.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ONSET"".\n\nBut wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: \n  O N S E T -> positions: \n    1: O\n    2: N\n    3: S\n    4: E\n    5: T\n\nSo E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).\n\nSo we can use ""ONSET"".\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). \n  In ""STEIN"": \n    S, T, E, I, N -> \n    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). \n  But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? No, only one E and one N.\n\nBut ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.\n\nBut we might prefer more common words.\n\nI think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). \n  In ""ONSET"", we have:\n    O: new letter\n    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)\n    S: new letter\n    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)\n    T: new letter\n\nThis will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, R, or A.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.\n\nA suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:\n- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n  Meaning:\n    - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.\n    - N is present but not in position 4.\n    - E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\n  Meaning:\n    - O, S, T are absent from the secret word.\n    - N is present and in the correct position (position 2).\n    - E is present and in the correct position (position 4).\n\nSo now we know:\n  - The secret word has N in position 2 and E in position 4.\n  - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S, T.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (but now we know it\'s in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but now we know it\'s in position 4).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ N _ E _\n\nWe need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.\n\nWe know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, O, S, T.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E _ with the available letters.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that can fit.\n\nWe can try to use a word that includes some of the common remaining letters: L, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- The word must have a letter in position 1, then N in 2, then a letter in 3, E in 4, and a letter in 5.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. ""INNER"": \n   - I, N, N, E, R -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.\n\n2. ""MINCE"": \n   - M, I, N, C, E -> but C is absent, and also note: the form would be M (pos1), I (pos2?) -> but we need N in pos2, so actually it would be M (pos1), N (pos2), then C (pos3) -> but C is absent. Also, the word has E in pos5? No, in ""MINCE"" it\'s M-I-N-C-E, so E is in pos5? But we know E must be in pos4. So invalid.\n\nWe need E in pos4.\n\n3. ""DINED"": \n   - D, I, N, E, D -> but wait, the form: D (pos1), I (pos2) -> but we need N in pos2? So no. We must have N in pos2.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nSo for ""DINED"": it would be D (1), I (2) -> but we need N at 2, so that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need a word that has the second letter as N and the fourth as E.\n\nLet\'s list words that fit: _ N _ E _\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""ANKLE"": but A is absent and K is available? But A is absent, so no.\n\n- ""ANGEL"": A is absent.\n\n- ""INDEED"" is 6 letters.\n\n- ""INDEX"": but we have E in the fourth position? I-N-D-E-X -> that\'s I (1), N (2), D (3), E (4), X (5). This fits the pattern. And the letters: I, D, X. We haven\'t tried I, D, X. Also, we must check if they are not in the absent list: I, D, X are not in the absent list (absent: C,R,A,O,S,T). So ""INDEX"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""INDEX"", the E is in position 4 (correct) and N in position 2 (correct). The other letters are I, D, X.\n\nWe can also consider:\n\n- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> but R is absent.\n\n- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).\n\n- ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.\n\n- ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.\n\n- ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.\n\n- ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> this fits: M (1), I (2) -> wait, no: the word is M-I-N-E-D, so:\n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: I -> but we need N at position 2? So that\'s incorrect.\n\nWe must have the second letter as N. So the word must be: [letter] + N + [letter] + E + [letter]\n\nSo ""MINED"" is M in 1, I in 2 -> that\'s not N in 2. So invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""ANKLE"" is invalid because of A.\n\nWhat about ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> \n  Position 1: U\n  Position 2: N -> correct\n  Position 3: W\n  Position 4: E -> correct\n  Position 5: D\n\nLetters: U, N, W, E, D. We haven\'t tried U, W, D. And they are not in the absent list.\n\nBut is ""UNWED"" a common word? It means not married, so yes.\n\nAnother word: ""INNED"": I, N, N, E, D -> \n  Position 1: I\n  Position 2: N -> correct\n  Position 3: N -> but we don\'t know if N can be repeated? The feedback from the first guess had only one N and it was present, but that doesn\'t rule out two N\'s. However, in the second guess, we had one N and it was correct. So if the word has two N\'s, then in the second guess we would have only one N (in position 2) and the other N (if in position 3) would not be indicated? Actually, in Wordle, if there are two of the same letter, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But in ""onset"", we only had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word has two N\'s, then we would have gotten a hint for the second N? Not necessarily, because we didn\'t have a second N in the guess. So we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""INNED"" is a word (meaning: having nested). We can consider it.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid the absent letters. I and D are not absent.\n\nBut we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two N\'s. We know at least one N is present (from first guess) and we now know it\'s in position 2. But there could be another N.\n\nSimilarly, for E: we know one E is in position 4, but there could be another E.\n\nBut to keep it simple, we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""INKLE"": I, N, K, E, L -> \n  Position 1: I\n  Position 2: N\n  Position 3: K\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: L\n\nLetters: I, N, K, E, L. All are available.\n\nBut ""INKLE"" is a word (meaning: a kind of linen tape).\n\nBut we have many options.\n\nWe can also consider ""DANCE"", but A and C are absent.\n\nAnother common word: ""NICHE"" -> but N is in position 1? We need N in position 2. So no.\n\nWe need to focus on the pattern.\n\nLet\'s list more words that fit the pattern and use available letters:\n\n- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).\n- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> but S is absent and also the pattern: J (1), U (2) -> we need N at 2, so no.\n\nWe must have N at 2 and E at 4.\n\nSo the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""INDEX"": as above, I, N, D, E, X -> positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5). This is a valid word.\n\n- ""UNDER"": but R is absent.\n\n- ""INNER"": but R is absent and also two N\'s? And R is absent.\n\n- ""MINCE"": C is absent.\n\n- ""DINGE"": D, I, N, G, E -> D(1), I(2) -> wait, no: D(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is D-I-N-G-E? Then it would be D(1), I(2), N(3) -> but we need N at 2, so no.\n\nWe must have the second letter as N. So the word is: first letter, then N, then third letter, then E, then fifth letter.\n\nSo ""DINGE"" is D-I-N-G-E -> that\'s positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E -> that doesn\'t have E in position 4? Position 4 is G, and E is at 5? But we need E at 4. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> same issue: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5) -> E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So no.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo let\'s think of words ending with E? But the fourth letter is E, so the fifth can be anything.\n\nWords: ... E _ \n\nBut the pattern is: _ N _ E _\n\nSo the last letter is after E.\n\nExamples: \n  ""UNCLE"": C is absent and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), C(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\n  ""ANKLE"": A absent.\n\n  ""APPLE"": A and P? But A absent, and also pattern: A(1), P(2) -> we need N at 2.\n\n  ""AMPLE"": A absent.\n\n  ""IMPEL"": I, M, P, E, L -> I(1), M(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.\n\n  ""INNER"": I, N, N, E, R -> I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), R(5). This fits the pattern? \n    Position 1: I\n    Position 2: N (correct)\n    Position 3: N\n    Position 4: E (correct)\n    Position 5: R -> but R is absent. So invalid.\n\n  ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R absent.\n\n  ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R absent.\n\n  ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R absent.\n\n  ""VINER"": not common? and R absent.\n\n  ""WISER"": but W(1), I(2) -> not N at 2.\n\n  ""UNZIP"": U, N, Z, I, P -> no E at position 4.\n\nWe need E at position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have E in the fourth position and N in the second.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\n- ""ANKLE"" (invalid due to A)\n- ""OUNCE"": O is absent and also O(1) -> but O is absent.\n- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> T is absent (from second guess) and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWait, ""UNITE"" has E at 5, not 4.\n\nWhat about ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> T is absent and E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""ANGER"": A absent.\n\n""INGLE"": I, N, G, L, E -> I(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5, not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]\n\nSo the third letter is between N and E.\n\nExamples: \n  ""ANODE"": A absent.\n  ""ABOVE"": A absent and O absent? O is absent.\n  ""ADOBE"": A and O absent.\n  ""ALIKE"": A absent and the pattern: A(1), L(2) -> not N at 2.\n\nWe need to use the available letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words:\n\n- ""INDEX"": I, N, D, E, X -> valid, as discussed.\n\n- ""UNDEE"": not common? and U, N, D, E, E -> two E\'s? and the pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, is ""UNDEE"" a word? It might be a surname or rare.\n\n- ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> I(1), N(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: marked with ink). Letters: I, K, D are available.\n\n- ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: not led). Letters: U, L, D available.\n\n- ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). Word (meaning: not fed). Letters: U, F, D available.\n\n- ""JUMPS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe have several candidates: ""INDEX"", ""INKED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNFED"", etc.\n\nWe want to choose one that uses common letters and might give us more information.\n\nWe have to guess the entire word, so we might as well try to get as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe know the secret word has at least N and E, and we are trying to find the other three.\n\nWe have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T.\n\nWe can choose ""INDEX"" because it uses I, D, X which are common enough.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: I and D are very common, X is less common.\n\n""INKED"" uses I, K, D.\n\n""UNLED"" uses U, L, D.\n\n""UNFED"" uses U, F, D.\n\nWe might prefer to use a word that has vowels? We have I and U as vowels.\n\nBut we already know E is in the word, and we have one vowel slot (position 1 and 3) to fill.\n\nWe can also consider ""MINKE"": M, I, N, K, E -> M(1), I(2) -> wait, no: M(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is M-I-N-K-E? Then it\'s M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""BINGO"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe should go with one of the candidates.\n\nLet\'s choose ""INDEX"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we haven\'t used any absent letters. I, D, X are not in the absent list.\n\nSo we guess ""INDEX"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED""? We are trying to get information.\n\nSince we have limited tries, we should try to cover more letters. But in this case, we are forced to use the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has more common consonants.\n\nBut ""INDEX"" is fine.\n\nAnother candidate: ""IMPEL"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nOr ""INFER"": I, N, F, E, R -> but R is absent.\n\nSo ""INDEX"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but the pattern: L(1), I(2) -> we need N at 2, so that\'s I at 2? No, the word is L-I-N-E-D -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. So we have N at position 3? But we need N at position 2. So invalid.\n\nWe must have N at position 2.\n\nSo I think ""INDEX"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""INDEX"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.\n- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T are absent; N is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T (cannot be used).\n- Present letters: N and E (N is fixed in position 2, E in position 4).\n- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 5.\n- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ N _ E _` and uses only available letters.\n- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, D, L, M) to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating absent letters.\n\nA strong candidate is **""INDEX""**:\n- Fits the pattern: `I` (position 1), `N` (position 2, correct), `D` (position 3), `E` (position 4, correct), `X` (position 5).\n- Uses new, common letters (I, D, X) to test positions 1, 3, and 5.\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, O, S, T).\n\nThis guess will help identify the missing letters and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>index</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: index -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) D(-) E(✓) X(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""index"":
  I: x (absent)
  N: ✓ (correct position)
  D: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  X: x (absent)

So now we know:
  - The secret word has the pattern: _ N _ E _
  - N is in position 2 and E is in position 4 (as before).
  - D is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we guessed D in position 3 and got '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  - I and X are absent.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the absent letters are: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T, I, D, X.

So absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.

Present letters: N (pos2), E (pos4), and D (somewhere, but not pos3).

We also know that the secret word has at least three distinct letters: N, E, D (and possibly two more).

The word pattern: [1] N [3] E [5]

We know D is in the word but not in position 3. So D must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are taken by N and E, and position 3 is excluded for D).

So D is either in position 1 or 5.

We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses D in position 1 or 5, and the other two positions (if D is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if D is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters (not absent and not already known present in the word except for D which we are placing): 
  B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But note: we know D is present, so we must use D in the word.

We have two cases:

Case 1: D in position 1 -> word: D N _ E _
Case 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D

We need to find common words that fit one of these patterns and use the available letters.

Let's list possible words for each case.

Case 1: D N _ E _
  The third position must be a letter that is available and the fifth position must be available.

  Example words:
    - ""DUNCE"": but C is absent and E is already in position 4? The word is D-U-N-C-E -> but that would be D(1), U(2) -> but we need N at position 2, so no. The pattern requires N at 2, so the word is D(1), N(2), [3], E(4), [5]. So ""DUNCE"" doesn't fit.

    - ""DANCE"": A and C absent.

    - ""DINED"": D(1), I(2) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

    - ""DOWNE"": not a word.

    - ""DUNES"": D(1), U(2) -> no.

  We need a word that starts with ""DN"", then a letter, then ""E"", then a letter.

  This is not a common pattern. Let's think of words:

    ""DNE"" is not a common beginning.

  Possible words: 
    ""DWAINE"": too long.

  I can't think of a common word that starts with ""DN"". So maybe case 1 is unlikely.

Case 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D

  So the pattern: [1] N [3] E D

  Now, we need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.

  Example words:

    - ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N (correct)
        Position 3: F
        Position 4: E (correct)
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, F, D. We haven't tried U and F, and they are not absent.

        But is ""UNFED"" a word? Yes, meaning not fed.

    - ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N
        Position 3: L
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, L, D. Available.

    - ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N
        Position 3: W
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, W, D. Available.

    - ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but I is absent (from guess 3: I(x)).

    - ""ANKED"": A absent.

    - ""BUNKED"": too long.

    - ""MINCED"": M, I, N, C, E, D -> too long and I, C absent.

  So we have candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We also have to consider if there are other words.

  Another word: ""JUKED"": J, U, K, E, D -> but the pattern: J(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  We need the second letter to be N.

  So the word must start with [vowel or consonant] then N, then a letter, then E, then D.

  Other possibilities:

    ""ANEW"" is 4 letters.

    ""OWNED"": O, W, N, E, D -> but O is absent (from guess 2: O(x)).

    ""ENDED"": E, N, D, E, D -> but the pattern: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need E at 4, and here E is at 1 and 4? Also, the pattern requires [1] N [3] E D, so position 1 is E? Then it would be E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But we have two E's and two D's? And we know E is at position 4, but we don't know about duplicates. However, in this case, we have E at position 1 and 4? But we only know about one E (from first guess) and now we have two. Also, the feedback for the first guess had E as present but not in position 5, and in the second guess E was in position 4 and correct. So if there is an extra E at position 1, we would have gotten a hint? In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have an E in position 1 so we wouldn't know. Similarly, in the third guess, we didn't have an E in position 1. So it's possible.

  But let's check the pattern: ""ENDED"" -> 
    Position 1: E -> but we have E in the word? Yes, but we don't know if it's in position 1. However, the pattern we have requires E in position 4, which is satisfied. But the word has E in position 1 and 4? And D in position 3 and 5? 

  But we know from the third guess: we had D in position 3 and got '-' meaning D is present but not in position 3. But if the word has D in position 3 and 5, then in the third guess we put D in position 3 and it should have been marked as correct? But it was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). So that would be inconsistent because if D is in position 3, then when we put D in position 3, it should be marked as correct. Therefore, the secret word does not have D in position 3. So ""ENDED"" would have D in position 3 and 5? Then when we guessed D in position 3, it should have been marked as correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position. So that means D is not in position 3. Therefore, ""ENDED"" is invalid because it has D in position 3.

  Similarly, we cannot have D in position 3 in the secret word.

  So back to our candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We also have ""JUNKED"" but too long.

  Another word: ""MUNGE"" -> M, U, N, G, E -> but the pattern: M(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""FUNKED"": F, U, N, K, E, D -> too long.

  So the main candidates are ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We need to choose one. We can choose the most common one.

  ""UNWED"" is a common word (meaning not married).

  ""UNLED"" (meaning not led) and ""UNFED"" (meaning not fed) are less common.

  But we can use any.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to get more information, but in this case, we are down to the last few letters and we have three possibilities. We have to guess one.

  But note: we have only one more guess? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one and then have two more if needed.

  However, we might be able to guess the word.

  But we don't know which one it is.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have to fit the pattern.

  Since we know the pattern and the letters, we can try to guess one of the candidates.

  Let's choose ""UNWED"" because it's common.

  But wait, we have to consider: in the third guess, we had D in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So D must be in the word but not in position 3. In ""UNWED"", D is in position 5, which is fine. Similarly, in ""UNFED"" and ""UNLED"", D is in position 5.

  So all three candidates have D in position 5.

  Now, the only difference is the first and third letters.

  For ""UNWED"": U in position 1, W in position 3.
  For ""UNFED"": U in position 1, F in position 3.
  For ""UNLED"": U in position 1, L in position 3.

  So they all have U in position 1? 

  But wait, we don't know that. We only assumed D in position 5. The first letter could be something else.

  We have the pattern: [1] N [3] E D

  The first letter can be any available letter, and the third letter any available letter.

  We have candidates with U in position 1? But we don't know if U is in the word.

  We have not tested U, so it could be.

  But we also have other possibilities? For example, the first letter could be B, F, G, etc.

  Let's think of more words:

    ""BANED"": B, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""BONED"": O absent.

    ""FANED"": not common.

    ""GANEF"": G, A, N, E, F -> A absent.

    ""MANED"": M, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""PANED"": P, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""BINED"": B, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""FINED"": F, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""VINED"": V, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""WINED"": W, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

  So after I and A are absent, we don't have many options.

  What about with U?

    ""UNBED"": not common? 
    ""UNCED"": not a word.
    ""UNDID"": D in position 5? U, N, D, I, D -> but I absent and also pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), I(4), D(5) -> but we need E in position 4? So no.

  So the only common words we have are the ones with U: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  There is also ""UNPEG"": but no E at 4.

  ""UNSET"": but S and T absent.

  So we are left with ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We can also consider ""UNKED"" (archaic for unknown) but not common.

  Or ""JUNED"" not a word.

  So the three candidates are the main ones.

  Now, we have to choose one. We can pick ""UNWED"" as it is the most common.

  But note: we have not tested U, W, F, L. We don't know which one is present.

  We can try to guess a word that uses as many of these as possible? But we are constrained by the pattern.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that has U in position 1 and then a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we don't have such a word.

  We have to guess one of the three.

  Let's choose ""UNWED"".

  But wait, we have another option: we can guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests multiple letters. However, we are forced to have the pattern and we know D must be in position 5? Actually, we don't know for sure that D is in position 5. We only deduced that because D must be in 1 or 5, and we couldn't find a word with D in 1. But maybe there is a word with D in 1?

  Let me try again to find a word with D in position 1 and the pattern D N _ E _

  Words:
    ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.
    ""DINES"" -> D(1), I(2) -> no, and I absent.
    ""DANES"" -> A absent.
    ""DONEE"" -> O absent and not common.
    ""DUPED"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.

  I think it's safe to assume D is in position 5.

  So we guess ""UNWED"".

  But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with D in position 1 and the pattern. I can't find a common one.

  Therefore, we go with ""UNWED"".Based on the feedback:

- **Guess 3: ""index""** → I and X are absent; D is present but not in position 3; N and E are correct in positions 2 and 4.

### Key Insights:
- Secret word pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- D is present but **not in position 3**, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

### Analysis:
- Since D cannot be in position 3, and positions 2 and 4 are fixed (N and E), D must be in **position 1 or 5**.
- After evaluating common words:
  - No valid words with D in position 1 fit the pattern and avoid absent letters (e.g., ""dunes"" fails due to incorrect second letter).
  - For D in position 5, valid words include:
    - **""UNFED""** (U in position 1, F in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNLED""** (U in position 1, L in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNWED""** (U in position 1, W in position 3, D in position 5).

### Strategy:
- Guess **""UNWED""** (a common word) to test:
  - U in position 1.
  - W in position 3.
  - D in position 5.

This guess will confirm or rule out these letters and their positions.

<guess>unwed</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T absent; N correct in position 2; E correct in position 4.
- **Guess 3: ""index""** → I and X absent; D present but not in position 3; N and E correct in positions 2 and 4.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- **D** is present but **not in position 3**, so it must be in **position 1 or 5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X (cannot be used).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

### Deduction:
- After evaluating possible words fitting `_ N _ E _` with D in position 1 or 5:
  - No valid words with D in position 1 (e.g., ""dunes"" fails due to incorrect second letter).
  - For D in position 5, valid candidates are:
    - **""UNFED""** (U in position 1, F in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNLED""** (U in position 1, L in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNWED""** (U in position 1, W in position 3, D in position 5).
- Among these, **""UNWED""** (meaning ""not married"") is the most common word.

### Next Guess: ""UNWED""
- Tests U in position 1, W in position 3, and D in position 5.
- Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>unwed</guess>",unwed,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""index"":
  I: x (absent)
  N: ✓ (correct position)
  D: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  X: x (absent)

So now we know:
  - The secret word has the pattern: _ N _ E _
  - N is in position 2 and E is in position 4 (as before).
  - D is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we guessed D in position 3 and got '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  - I and X are absent.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the absent letters are: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T, I, D, X.

So absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.

Present letters: N (pos2), E (pos4), and D (somewhere, but not pos3).

We also know that the secret word has at least three distinct letters: N, E, D (and possibly two more).

The word pattern: [1] N [3] E [5]

We know D is in the word but not in position 3. So D must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are taken by N and E, and position 3 is excluded for D).

So D is either in position 1 or 5.

We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses D in position 1 or 5, and the other two positions (if D is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if D is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters (not absent and not already known present in the word except for D which we are placing): 
  B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But note: we know D is present, so we must use D in the word.

We have two cases:

Case 1: D in position 1 -> word: D N _ E _
Case 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D

We need to find common words that fit one of these patterns and use the available letters.

Let's list possible words for each case.

Case 1: D N _ E _
  The third position must be a letter that is available and the fifth position must be available.

  Example words:
    - ""DUNCE"": but C is absent and E is already in position 4? The word is D-U-N-C-E -> but that would be D(1), U(2) -> but we need N at position 2, so no. The pattern requires N at 2, so the word is D(1), N(2), [3], E(4), [5]. So ""DUNCE"" doesn't fit.

    - ""DANCE"": A and C absent.

    - ""DINED"": D(1), I(2) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

    - ""DOWNE"": not a word.

    - ""DUNES"": D(1), U(2) -> no.

  We need a word that starts with ""DN"", then a letter, then ""E"", then a letter.

  This is not a common pattern. Let's think of words:

    ""DNE"" is not a common beginning.

  Possible words: 
    ""DWAINE"": too long.

  I can't think of a common word that starts with ""DN"". So maybe case 1 is unlikely.

Case 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D

  So the pattern: [1] N [3] E D

  Now, we need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.

  Example words:

    - ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N (correct)
        Position 3: F
        Position 4: E (correct)
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, F, D. We haven't tried U and F, and they are not absent.

        But is ""UNFED"" a word? Yes, meaning not fed.

    - ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N
        Position 3: L
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, L, D. Available.

    - ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N
        Position 3: W
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, W, D. Available.

    - ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but I is absent (from guess 3: I(x)).

    - ""ANKED"": A absent.

    - ""BUNKED"": too long.

    - ""MINCED"": M, I, N, C, E, D -> too long and I, C absent.

  So we have candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We also have to consider if there are other words.

  Another word: ""JUKED"": J, U, K, E, D -> but the pattern: J(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  We need the second letter to be N.

  So the word must start with [vowel or consonant] then N, then a letter, then E, then D.

  Other possibilities:

    ""ANEW"" is 4 letters.

    ""OWNED"": O, W, N, E, D -> but O is absent (from guess 2: O(x)).

    ""ENDED"": E, N, D, E, D -> but the pattern: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need E at 4, and here E is at 1 and 4? Also, the pattern requires [1] N [3] E D, so position 1 is E? Then it would be E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But we have two E's and two D's? And we know E is at position 4, but we don't know about duplicates. However, in this case, we have E at position 1 and 4? But we only know about one E (from first guess) and now we have two. Also, the feedback for the first guess had E as present but not in position 5, and in the second guess E was in position 4 and correct. So if there is an extra E at position 1, we would have gotten a hint? In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have an E in position 1 so we wouldn't know. Similarly, in the third guess, we didn't have an E in position 1. So it's possible.

  But let's check the pattern: ""ENDED"" -> 
    Position 1: E -> but we have E in the word? Yes, but we don't know if it's in position 1. However, the pattern we have requires E in position 4, which is satisfied. But the word has E in position 1 and 4? And D in position 3 and 5? 

  But we know from the third guess: we had D in position 3 and got '-' meaning D is present but not in position 3. But if the word has D in position 3 and 5, then in the third guess we put D in position 3 and it should have been marked as correct? But it was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). So that would be inconsistent because if D is in position 3, then when we put D in position 3, it should be marked as correct. Therefore, the secret word does not have D in position 3. So ""ENDED"" would have D in position 3 and 5? Then when we guessed D in position 3, it should have been marked as correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position. So that means D is not in position 3. Therefore, ""ENDED"" is invalid because it has D in position 3.

  Similarly, we cannot have D in position 3 in the secret word.

  So back to our candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We also have ""JUNKED"" but too long.

  Another word: ""MUNGE"" -> M, U, N, G, E -> but the pattern: M(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""FUNKED"": F, U, N, K, E, D -> too long.

  So the main candidates are ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We need to choose one. We can choose the most common one.

  ""UNWED"" is a common word (meaning not married).

  ""UNLED"" (meaning not led) and ""UNFED"" (meaning not fed) are less common.

  But we can use any.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to get more information, but in this case, we are down to the last few letters and we have three possibilities. We have to guess one.

  But note: we have only one more guess? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one and then have two more if needed.

  However, we might be able to guess the word.

  But we don't know which one it is.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have to fit the pattern.

  Since we know the pattern and the letters, we can try to guess one of the candidates.

  Let's choose ""UNWED"" because it's common.

  But wait, we have to consider: in the third guess, we had D in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So D must be in the word but not in position 3. In ""UNWED"", D is in position 5, which is fine. Similarly, in ""UNFED"" and ""UNLED"", D is in position 5.

  So all three candidates have D in position 5.

  Now, the only difference is the first and third letters.

  For ""UNWED"": U in position 1, W in position 3.
  For ""UNFED"": U in position 1, F in position 3.
  For ""UNLED"": U in position 1, L in position 3.

  So they all have U in position 1? 

  But wait, we don't know that. We only assumed D in position 5. The first letter could be something else.

  We have the pattern: [1] N [3] E D

  The first letter can be any available letter, and the third letter any available letter.

  We have candidates with U in position 1? But we don't know if U is in the word.

  We have not tested U, so it could be.

  But we also have other possibilities? For example, the first letter could be B, F, G, etc.

  Let's think of more words:

    ""BANED"": B, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""BONED"": O absent.

    ""FANED"": not common.

    ""GANEF"": G, A, N, E, F -> A absent.

    ""MANED"": M, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""PANED"": P, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""BINED"": B, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""FINED"": F, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""VINED"": V, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""WINED"": W, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

  So after I and A are absent, we don't have many options.

  What about with U?

    ""UNBED"": not common? 
    ""UNCED"": not a word.
    ""UNDID"": D in position 5? U, N, D, I, D -> but I absent and also pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), I(4), D(5) -> but we need E in position 4? So no.

  So the only common words we have are the ones with U: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  There is also ""UNPEG"": but no E at 4.

  ""UNSET"": but S and T absent.

  So we are left with ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We can also consider ""UNKED"" (archaic for unknown) but not common.

  Or ""JUNED"" not a word.

  So the three candidates are the main ones.

  Now, we have to choose one. We can pick ""UNWED"" as it is the most common.

  But note: we have not tested U, W, F, L. We don't know which one is present.

  We can try to guess a word that uses as many of these as possible? But we are constrained by the pattern.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that has U in position 1 and then a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we don't have such a word.

  We have to guess one of the three.

  Let's choose ""UNWED"".

  But wait, we have another option: we can guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests multiple letters. However, we are forced to have the pattern and we know D must be in position 5? Actually, we don't know for sure that D is in position 5. We only deduced that because D must be in 1 or 5, and we couldn't find a word with D in 1. But maybe there is a word with D in 1?

  Let me try again to find a word with D in position 1 and the pattern D N _ E _

  Words:
    ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.
    ""DINES"" -> D(1), I(2) -> no, and I absent.
    ""DANES"" -> A absent.
    ""DONEE"" -> O absent and not common.
    ""DUPED"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.

  I think it's safe to assume D is in position 5.

  So we guess ""UNWED"".

  But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with D in position 1 and the pattern. I can't find a common one.

  Therefore, we go with ""UNWED"".Based on the feedback:

- **Guess 3: ""index""** → I and X are absent; D is present but not in position 3; N and E are correct in positions 2 and 4.

### Key Insights:
- Secret word pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- D is present but **not in position 3**, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

### Analysis:
- Since D cannot be in position 3, and positions 2 and 4 are fixed (N and E), D must be in **position 1 or 5**.
- After evaluating common words:
  - No valid words with D in position 1 fit the pattern and avoid absent letters (e.g., ""dunes"" fails due to incorrect second letter).
  - For D in position 5, valid words include:
    - **""UNFED""** (U in position 1, F in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNLED""** (U in position 1, L in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNWED""** (U in position 1, W in position 3, D in position 5).

### Strategy:
- Guess **""UNWED""** (a common word) to test:
  - U in position 1.
  - W in position 3.
  - D in position 5.

This guess will confirm or rule out these letters and their positions.

<guess>unwed</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T absent; N correct in position 2; E correct in position 4.
- **Guess 3: ""index""** → I and X absent; D present but not in position 3; N and E correct in positions 2 and 4.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- **D** is present but **not in position 3**, so it must be in **position 1 or 5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X (cannot be used).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

### Deduction:
- After evaluating possible words fitting `_ N _ E _` with D in position 1 or 5:
  - No valid words with D in position 1 (e.g., ""dunes"" fails due to incorrect second letter).
  - For D in position 5, valid candidates are:
    - **""UNFED""** (U in position 1, F in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNLED""** (U in position 1, L in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNWED""** (U in position 1, W in position 3, D in position 5).
- Among these, **""UNWED""** (meaning ""not married"") is the most common word.

### Next Guess: ""UNWED""
- Tests U in position 1, W in position 3, and D in position 5.
- Avoids all absent letters.",Guess 4: unwed -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) W(x) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,unfed,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the secret word)
  R: x (not in the secret word)
  A: x (not in the secret word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Since N is in the word but not in the 4th position, it must be in one of the first three positions (positions 1, 2, or 3).
Similarly, E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4). However, note that the word has 5 letters.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A.
  - Contains both N and E (but not in the same positions as in ""crane"").
  - We want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We can also note that the positions of N and E in the secret word are not 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

But note: we don't know if N and E are repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But we should be cautious.

We want to maximize the information from the next guess. So we should try to place N and E in new positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, R, A are absent, while N and E are present).

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try to include S, T, L, O, etc.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5.

Let's try to form a word that has:
  - E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)
  - N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4)

And we want to avoid positions 4 for N and 5 for E.

Example words:

Option 1: Place E in position 1? Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don't know the rest.

But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that have E and N and don't have C, R, A.

For example:
  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that's invalid.

We need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.

Another example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. 
  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). 
  - But we don't know if L, I, D are in the word.

But we can use this.

Another common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.

But note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

We can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.

How about ""STONE""? 
  - S, T, O, N, E.
  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was '-', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.

Similarly, E is not in position 5.

So in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that's the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".

We need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's try ""NOISE"": 
  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""NEEDS"": 
  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.

""INLET"": 
  - I, N, L, E, T.
  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). 
  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven't tried I, L, T.

This seems good.

Another option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.

But ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. 
  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). 
  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.

We haven't tried O, S, T.

But wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That's acceptable.

We can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.

Similarly, avoid R and A.

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

So let's go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.

But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.

We can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don't have feedback about two N's. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""INEPT"": 
  - I, N, E, P, T. 
  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.

But we haven't tried P.

We can also try ""TOKEN"": 
  - T, O, K, E, N. 
  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don't have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.

But in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it's not in position 4). 

But note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven't tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven't tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that's acceptable.

But we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn't have them.

However, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.

But let's think about the letters: 
  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.
  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.

We might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven't tested S.

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.

So let's choose ""ONSET"".

But wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: 
  O N S E T -> positions: 
    1: O
    2: N
    3: S
    4: E
    5: T

So E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).

So we can use ""ONSET"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.

Another word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). 
  In ""STEIN"": 
    S, T, E, I, N -> 
    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). 
  But we don't know if the word has two E's? No, only one E and one N.

But ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we might prefer more common words.

I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""ONSET"".

But let me double-check: 
  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). 
  In ""ONSET"", we have:
    O: new letter
    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)
    S: new letter
    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)
    T: new letter

This will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.

Therefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).
- Avoids C, R, A.

<guess>onset</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present but not in position 4.
    - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
  Meaning:
    - O, S, T are absent from the secret word.
    - N is present and in the correct position (position 2).
    - E is present and in the correct position (position 4).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has N in position 2 and E in position 4.
  - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (but now we know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but now we know it's in position 4).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ N _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

We know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E _ with the available letters.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of common letters that can fit.

We can try to use a word that includes some of the common remaining letters: L, I, D, M, P, etc.

Possible words:

- The word must have a letter in position 1, then N in 2, then a letter in 3, E in 4, and a letter in 5.

Examples:

1. ""INNER"": 
   - I, N, N, E, R -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.

2. ""MINCE"": 
   - M, I, N, C, E -> but C is absent, and also note: the form would be M (pos1), I (pos2?) -> but we need N in pos2, so actually it would be M (pos1), N (pos2), then C (pos3) -> but C is absent. Also, the word has E in pos5? No, in ""MINCE"" it's M-I-N-C-E, so E is in pos5? But we know E must be in pos4. So invalid.

We need E in pos4.

3. ""DINED"": 
   - D, I, N, E, D -> but wait, the form: D (pos1), I (pos2) -> but we need N in pos2? So no. We must have N in pos2.

So the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] E [letter5]

So for ""DINED"": it would be D (1), I (2) -> but we need N at 2, so that doesn't match.

We need a word that has the second letter as N and the fourth as E.

Let's list words that fit: _ N _ E _

Common words:

- ""ANKLE"": but A is absent and K is available? But A is absent, so no.

- ""ANGEL"": A is absent.

- ""INDEED"" is 6 letters.

- ""INDEX"": but we have E in the fourth position? I-N-D-E-X -> that's I (1), N (2), D (3), E (4), X (5). This fits the pattern. And the letters: I, D, X. We haven't tried I, D, X. Also, we must check if they are not in the absent list: I, D, X are not in the absent list (absent: C,R,A,O,S,T). So ""INDEX"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""INDEX"", the E is in position 4 (correct) and N in position 2 (correct). The other letters are I, D, X.

We can also consider:

- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> but R is absent.

- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).

- ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.

- ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> this fits: M (1), I (2) -> wait, no: the word is M-I-N-E-D, so:
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: I -> but we need N at position 2? So that's incorrect.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word must be: [letter] + N + [letter] + E + [letter]

So ""MINED"" is M in 1, I in 2 -> that's not N in 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""ANKLE"" is invalid because of A.

What about ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
  Position 1: U
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: W
  Position 4: E -> correct
  Position 5: D

Letters: U, N, W, E, D. We haven't tried U, W, D. And they are not in the absent list.

But is ""UNWED"" a common word? It means not married, so yes.

Another word: ""INNED"": I, N, N, E, D -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N -> correct
  Position 3: N -> but we don't know if N can be repeated? The feedback from the first guess had only one N and it was present, but that doesn't rule out two N's. However, in the second guess, we had one N and it was correct. So if the word has two N's, then in the second guess we would have only one N (in position 2) and the other N (if in position 3) would not be indicated? Actually, in Wordle, if there are two of the same letter, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But in ""onset"", we only had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word has two N's, then we would have gotten a hint for the second N? Not necessarily, because we didn't have a second N in the guess. So we don't know.

But ""INNED"" is a word (meaning: having nested). We can consider it.

But let's see: we have to avoid the absent letters. I and D are not absent.

But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's. We know at least one N is present (from first guess) and we now know it's in position 2. But there could be another N.

Similarly, for E: we know one E is in position 4, but there could be another E.

But to keep it simple, we might avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""INKLE"": I, N, K, E, L -> 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N
  Position 3: K
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: L

Letters: I, N, K, E, L. All are available.

But ""INKLE"" is a word (meaning: a kind of linen tape).

But we have many options.

We can also consider ""DANCE"", but A and C are absent.

Another common word: ""NICHE"" -> but N is in position 1? We need N in position 2. So no.

We need to focus on the pattern.

Let's list more words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).
- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> but S is absent and also the pattern: J (1), U (2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

We must have N at 2 and E at 4.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- ""INDEX"": as above, I, N, D, E, X -> positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5). This is a valid word.

- ""UNDER"": but R is absent.

- ""INNER"": but R is absent and also two N's? And R is absent.

- ""MINCE"": C is absent.

- ""DINGE"": D, I, N, G, E -> D(1), I(2) -> wait, no: D(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is D-I-N-G-E? Then it would be D(1), I(2), N(3) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

We must have the second letter as N. So the word is: first letter, then N, then third letter, then E, then fifth letter.

So ""DINGE"" is D-I-N-G-E -> that's positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E -> that doesn't have E in position 4? Position 4 is G, and E is at 5? But we need E at 4. So no.

Another word: ""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> same issue: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5) -> E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So let's think of words ending with E? But the fourth letter is E, so the fifth can be anything.

Words: ... E _ 

But the pattern is: _ N _ E _

So the last letter is after E.

Examples: 
  ""UNCLE"": C is absent and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), C(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

  ""ANKLE"": A absent.

  ""APPLE"": A and P? But A absent, and also pattern: A(1), P(2) -> we need N at 2.

  ""AMPLE"": A absent.

  ""IMPEL"": I, M, P, E, L -> I(1), M(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""INNER"": I, N, N, E, R -> I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), R(5). This fits the pattern? 
    Position 1: I
    Position 2: N (correct)
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: E (correct)
    Position 5: R -> but R is absent. So invalid.

  ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R absent.

  ""VINER"": not common? and R absent.

  ""WISER"": but W(1), I(2) -> not N at 2.

  ""UNZIP"": U, N, Z, I, P -> no E at position 4.

We need E at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have E in the fourth position and N in the second.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""ANKLE"" (invalid due to A)
- ""OUNCE"": O is absent and also O(1) -> but O is absent.
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> T is absent (from second guess) and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Wait, ""UNITE"" has E at 5, not 4.

What about ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> T is absent and E at 5.

Another word: ""ANGER"": A absent.

""INGLE"": I, N, G, L, E -> I(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]

So the third letter is between N and E.

Examples: 
  ""ANODE"": A absent.
  ""ABOVE"": A absent and O absent? O is absent.
  ""ADOBE"": A and O absent.
  ""ALIKE"": A absent and the pattern: A(1), L(2) -> not N at 2.

We need to use the available letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

- ""INDEX"": I, N, D, E, X -> valid, as discussed.

- ""UNDEE"": not common? and U, N, D, E, E -> two E's? and the pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But we don't know about duplicates. Also, is ""UNDEE"" a word? It might be a surname or rare.

- ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> I(1), N(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: marked with ink). Letters: I, K, D are available.

- ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: not led). Letters: U, L, D available.

- ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). Word (meaning: not fed). Letters: U, F, D available.

- ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

We have several candidates: ""INDEX"", ""INKED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNFED"", etc.

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might give us more information.

We have to guess the entire word, so we might as well try to get as many new letters as possible.

We know the secret word has at least N and E, and we are trying to find the other three.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T.

We can choose ""INDEX"" because it uses I, D, X which are common enough.

But let's see the frequency: I and D are very common, X is less common.

""INKED"" uses I, K, D.

""UNLED"" uses U, L, D.

""UNFED"" uses U, F, D.

We might prefer to use a word that has vowels? We have I and U as vowels.

But we already know E is in the word, and we have one vowel slot (position 1 and 3) to fill.

We can also consider ""MINKE"": M, I, N, K, E -> M(1), I(2) -> wait, no: M(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is M-I-N-K-E? Then it's M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

Another word: ""BINGO"" doesn't have E.

We should go with one of the candidates.

Let's choose ""INDEX"" because it's a very common word.

But note: we have to make sure we haven't used any absent letters. I, D, X are not in the absent list.

So we guess ""INDEX"".

But wait, what if the word is ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED""? We are trying to get information.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover more letters. But in this case, we are forced to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common consonants.

But ""INDEX"" is fine.

Another candidate: ""IMPEL"" doesn't fit.

Or ""INFER"": I, N, F, E, R -> but R is absent.

So ""INDEX"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with more common letters.

What about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but the pattern: L(1), I(2) -> we need N at 2, so that's I at 2? No, the word is L-I-N-E-D -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. So we have N at position 3? But we need N at position 2. So invalid.

We must have N at position 2.

So I think ""INDEX"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, we guess ""INDEX"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T are absent; N is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T (cannot be used).
- Present letters: N and E (N is fixed in position 2, E in position 4).
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 5.
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ N _ E _` and uses only available letters.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, D, L, M) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating absent letters.

A strong candidate is **""INDEX""**:
- Fits the pattern: `I` (position 1), `N` (position 2, correct), `D` (position 3), `E` (position 4, correct), `X` (position 5).
- Uses new, common letters (I, D, X) to test positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, O, S, T).

This guess will help identify the missing letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>index</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: index -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) D(-) E(✓) X(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""index"":
  I: x (absent)
  N: ✓ (correct position)
  D: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  X: x (absent)

So now we know:
  - The secret word has the pattern: _ N _ E _
  - N is in position 2 and E is in position 4 (as before).
  - D is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we guessed D in position 3 and got '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  - I and X are absent.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the absent letters are: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T, I, D, X.

So absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.

Present letters: N (pos2), E (pos4), and D (somewhere, but not pos3).

We also know that the secret word has at least three distinct letters: N, E, D (and possibly two more).

The word pattern: [1] N [3] E [5]

We know D is in the word but not in position 3. So D must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are taken by N and E, and position 3 is excluded for D).

So D is either in position 1 or 5.

We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses D in position 1 or 5, and the other two positions (if D is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if D is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters (not absent and not already known present in the word except for D which we are placing): 
  B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But note: we know D is present, so we must use D in the word.

We have two cases:

Case 1: D in position 1 -> word: D N _ E _
Case 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D

We need to find common words that fit one of these patterns and use the available letters.

Let's list possible words for each case.

Case 1: D N _ E _
  The third position must be a letter that is available and the fifth position must be available.

  Example words:
    - ""DUNCE"": but C is absent and E is already in position 4? The word is D-U-N-C-E -> but that would be D(1), U(2) -> but we need N at position 2, so no. The pattern requires N at 2, so the word is D(1), N(2), [3], E(4), [5]. So ""DUNCE"" doesn't fit.

    - ""DANCE"": A and C absent.

    - ""DINED"": D(1), I(2) -> but we need N at 2, so no.

    - ""DOWNE"": not a word.

    - ""DUNES"": D(1), U(2) -> no.

  We need a word that starts with ""DN"", then a letter, then ""E"", then a letter.

  This is not a common pattern. Let's think of words:

    ""DNE"" is not a common beginning.

  Possible words: 
    ""DWAINE"": too long.

  I can't think of a common word that starts with ""DN"". So maybe case 1 is unlikely.

Case 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D

  So the pattern: [1] N [3] E D

  Now, we need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.

  Example words:

    - ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N (correct)
        Position 3: F
        Position 4: E (correct)
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, F, D. We haven't tried U and F, and they are not absent.

        But is ""UNFED"" a word? Yes, meaning not fed.

    - ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N
        Position 3: L
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, L, D. Available.

    - ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> 
        Position 1: U
        Position 2: N
        Position 3: W
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: D
        Letters: U, W, D. Available.

    - ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but I is absent (from guess 3: I(x)).

    - ""ANKED"": A absent.

    - ""BUNKED"": too long.

    - ""MINCED"": M, I, N, C, E, D -> too long and I, C absent.

  So we have candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We also have to consider if there are other words.

  Another word: ""JUKED"": J, U, K, E, D -> but the pattern: J(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  We need the second letter to be N.

  So the word must start with [vowel or consonant] then N, then a letter, then E, then D.

  Other possibilities:

    ""ANEW"" is 4 letters.

    ""OWNED"": O, W, N, E, D -> but O is absent (from guess 2: O(x)).

    ""ENDED"": E, N, D, E, D -> but the pattern: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need E at 4, and here E is at 1 and 4? Also, the pattern requires [1] N [3] E D, so position 1 is E? Then it would be E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But we have two E's and two D's? And we know E is at position 4, but we don't know about duplicates. However, in this case, we have E at position 1 and 4? But we only know about one E (from first guess) and now we have two. Also, the feedback for the first guess had E as present but not in position 5, and in the second guess E was in position 4 and correct. So if there is an extra E at position 1, we would have gotten a hint? In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have an E in position 1 so we wouldn't know. Similarly, in the third guess, we didn't have an E in position 1. So it's possible.

  But let's check the pattern: ""ENDED"" -> 
    Position 1: E -> but we have E in the word? Yes, but we don't know if it's in position 1. However, the pattern we have requires E in position 4, which is satisfied. But the word has E in position 1 and 4? And D in position 3 and 5? 

  But we know from the third guess: we had D in position 3 and got '-' meaning D is present but not in position 3. But if the word has D in position 3 and 5, then in the third guess we put D in position 3 and it should have been marked as correct? But it was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). So that would be inconsistent because if D is in position 3, then when we put D in position 3, it should be marked as correct. Therefore, the secret word does not have D in position 3. So ""ENDED"" would have D in position 3 and 5? Then when we guessed D in position 3, it should have been marked as correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position. So that means D is not in position 3. Therefore, ""ENDED"" is invalid because it has D in position 3.

  Similarly, we cannot have D in position 3 in the secret word.

  So back to our candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We also have ""JUNKED"" but too long.

  Another word: ""MUNGE"" -> M, U, N, G, E -> but the pattern: M(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.

  ""FUNKED"": F, U, N, K, E, D -> too long.

  So the main candidates are ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We need to choose one. We can choose the most common one.

  ""UNWED"" is a common word (meaning not married).

  ""UNLED"" (meaning not led) and ""UNFED"" (meaning not fed) are less common.

  But we can use any.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to get more information, but in this case, we are down to the last few letters and we have three possibilities. We have to guess one.

  But note: we have only one more guess? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one and then have two more if needed.

  However, we might be able to guess the word.

  But we don't know which one it is.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have to fit the pattern.

  Since we know the pattern and the letters, we can try to guess one of the candidates.

  Let's choose ""UNWED"" because it's common.

  But wait, we have to consider: in the third guess, we had D in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So D must be in the word but not in position 3. In ""UNWED"", D is in position 5, which is fine. Similarly, in ""UNFED"" and ""UNLED"", D is in position 5.

  So all three candidates have D in position 5.

  Now, the only difference is the first and third letters.

  For ""UNWED"": U in position 1, W in position 3.
  For ""UNFED"": U in position 1, F in position 3.
  For ""UNLED"": U in position 1, L in position 3.

  So they all have U in position 1? 

  But wait, we don't know that. We only assumed D in position 5. The first letter could be something else.

  We have the pattern: [1] N [3] E D

  The first letter can be any available letter, and the third letter any available letter.

  We have candidates with U in position 1? But we don't know if U is in the word.

  We have not tested U, so it could be.

  But we also have other possibilities? For example, the first letter could be B, F, G, etc.

  Let's think of more words:

    ""BANED"": B, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""BONED"": O absent.

    ""FANED"": not common.

    ""GANEF"": G, A, N, E, F -> A absent.

    ""MANED"": M, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""PANED"": P, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> A absent.

    ""BINED"": B, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""FINED"": F, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""VINED"": V, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

    ""WINED"": W, I, N, E, D -> I absent.

  So after I and A are absent, we don't have many options.

  What about with U?

    ""UNBED"": not common? 
    ""UNCED"": not a word.
    ""UNDID"": D in position 5? U, N, D, I, D -> but I absent and also pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), I(4), D(5) -> but we need E in position 4? So no.

  So the only common words we have are the ones with U: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  There is also ""UNPEG"": but no E at 4.

  ""UNSET"": but S and T absent.

  So we are left with ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".

  We can also consider ""UNKED"" (archaic for unknown) but not common.

  Or ""JUNED"" not a word.

  So the three candidates are the main ones.

  Now, we have to choose one. We can pick ""UNWED"" as it is the most common.

  But note: we have not tested U, W, F, L. We don't know which one is present.

  We can try to guess a word that uses as many of these as possible? But we are constrained by the pattern.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that has U in position 1 and then a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we don't have such a word.

  We have to guess one of the three.

  Let's choose ""UNWED"".

  But wait, we have another option: we can guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests multiple letters. However, we are forced to have the pattern and we know D must be in position 5? Actually, we don't know for sure that D is in position 5. We only deduced that because D must be in 1 or 5, and we couldn't find a word with D in 1. But maybe there is a word with D in 1?

  Let me try again to find a word with D in position 1 and the pattern D N _ E _

  Words:
    ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.
    ""DINES"" -> D(1), I(2) -> no, and I absent.
    ""DANES"" -> A absent.
    ""DONEE"" -> O absent and not common.
    ""DUPED"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.

  I think it's safe to assume D is in position 5.

  So we guess ""UNWED"".

  But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with D in position 1 and the pattern. I can't find a common one.

  Therefore, we go with ""UNWED"".Based on the feedback:

- **Guess 3: ""index""** → I and X are absent; D is present but not in position 3; N and E are correct in positions 2 and 4.

### Key Insights:
- Secret word pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- D is present but **not in position 3**, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

### Analysis:
- Since D cannot be in position 3, and positions 2 and 4 are fixed (N and E), D must be in **position 1 or 5**.
- After evaluating common words:
  - No valid words with D in position 1 fit the pattern and avoid absent letters (e.g., ""dunes"" fails due to incorrect second letter).
  - For D in position 5, valid words include:
    - **""UNFED""** (U in position 1, F in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNLED""** (U in position 1, L in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNWED""** (U in position 1, W in position 3, D in position 5).

### Strategy:
- Guess **""UNWED""** (a common word) to test:
  - U in position 1.
  - W in position 3.
  - D in position 5.

This guess will confirm or rule out these letters and their positions.

<guess>unwed</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T absent; N correct in position 2; E correct in position 4.
- **Guess 3: ""index""** → I and X absent; D present but not in position 3; N and E correct in positions 2 and 4.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).
- **D** is present but **not in position 3**, so it must be in **position 1 or 5** (since positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X (cannot be used).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

### Deduction:
- After evaluating possible words fitting `_ N _ E _` with D in position 1 or 5:
  - No valid words with D in position 1 (e.g., ""dunes"" fails due to incorrect second letter).
  - For D in position 5, valid candidates are:
    - **""UNFED""** (U in position 1, F in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNLED""** (U in position 1, L in position 3, D in position 5).
    - **""UNWED""** (U in position 1, W in position 3, D in position 5).
- Among these, **""UNWED""** (meaning ""not married"") is the most common word.

### Next Guess: ""UNWED""
- Tests U in position 1, W in position 3, and D in position 5.
- Avoids all absent letters.

However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since ""crane"" had one N and one E, and the feedback for each was separate, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.

Then we can have words like ""e...n"" but we don\'t know the rest.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C, R, A.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have E and N and don\'t have C, R, A.\n\nFor example:\n  ""SENTE"" - but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""sente"" is a word (a monetary unit) but it has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, N is in position 3 and E in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So that\'s invalid.\n\nWe need E not in position 5 and N not in position 4.\n\nAnother example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. \n  - N is in position 3 (which is allowed, since not 4) and E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5). \n  - But we don\'t know if L, I, D are in the word.\n\nBut we can use this.\n\nAnother common word: ""MINED"" -> M, I, N, E, D. Similarly.\n\nBut note: we want to test new letters. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has E and N and also includes S, T, L, etc.\n\nHow about ""STONE""? \n  - S, T, O, N, E.\n  - N is in position 4 -> but wait, in our feedback, N was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said that in the 4th position it was wrong, but it might be in the 4th position in the secret word? No, wait: the feedback for the 4th letter (which was N) was \'-\', meaning that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess.\n\nSimilarly, E is not in position 5.\n\nSo in ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> that\'s the position we must avoid for N. So we cannot use ""STONE"".\n\nWe need a word where N is in position 1, 2, or 3 and E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nLet\'s try ""NOISE"": \n  - N in position 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E in position 5? -> but E cannot be in position 5. So invalid.\n\n""NEEDS"": \n  - N in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed) and then E again? But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So we avoid.\n\n""INLET"": \n  - I, N, L, E, T.\n  - N is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed). \n  - Letters: I, N, L, E, T. We haven\'t tried I, L, T.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""UNSET"" -> U, N, S, E, T. \n  - N in position 2, E in position 4 -> allowed.\n\nBut ""UNSET"" is not a very common word? We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T. \n  - N in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). \n  - But note: we have O, N, S, E, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, S, T.\n\nBut wait: in ""ONSET"", N is in position 2 and E in position 4. That\'s acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""SINCE"", but we know C is not in the word (from first guess feedback: C was absent). So we cannot use C.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R and A.\n\nAnother word: ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ONSET"". It uses common letters and places N and E in new positions.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use both N and E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should use them to get more information about their positions.\n\nWe can also consider ""LINEN"", but that has two N\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, E is in position 4 (allowed) and the first N is in position 2 (allowed) and the last N is in position 5? But we don\'t have feedback about two N\'s. It might be acceptable, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nSo ""ONSET"" seems a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""INEPT"": \n  - I, N, E, P, T. \n  - N in position 2, E in position 3 -> both allowed.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried P.\n\nWe can also try ""TOKEN"": \n  - T, O, K, E, N. \n  - E in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5? But we don\'t have a restriction on N for position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that in position 4 (in ""crane"") it was wrong, but it could be in position 5. However, we have no restriction on position 5 for N. Only that it cannot be in position 4. So N in position 5 is allowed. Similarly, E in position 4 is allowed.\n\nBut in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 5 (which is allowed because we only know it\'s not in position 4). However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5? Yes, because in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and we got \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 5. So in ""TOKEN"", E is in position 4 (which is okay) and N is in position 5 (which is okay, because we only know it\'s not in position 4). \n\nBut note: we are trying to find the positions. We want to test N in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5). In ""TOKEN"", N is in position 5 (which we haven\'t tested) and E is in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested for E, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we have to avoid C, R, A. ""TOKEN"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nHowever, we have two options: ""ONSET"" and ""TOKEN"". Both are valid.\n\nBut let\'s think about the letters: \n  In ""ONSET"": O, N, S, E, T -> we test O, S, T (which are common) and we already know N and E are present.\n  In ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N -> we test T, O, K, and we know N and E.\n\nWe might prefer ""ONSET"" because it has S which is a very common letter, and we haven\'t tested S.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was absent). So we cannot use A.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ONSET"".\n\nBut wait: in ""ONSET"", the E is in position 5? No: \n  O N S E T -> positions: \n    1: O\n    2: N\n    3: S\n    4: E\n    5: T\n\nSo E is in position 4 (which is allowed) and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).\n\nSo we can use ""ONSET"".\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SENTE"" but that has E at the end? And we know E cannot be at the end. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""NEIST"" (which is not common) or ""STEIN"" (which is a word, meaning a beer mug). \n  In ""STEIN"": \n    S, T, E, I, N -> \n    E in position 3 (allowed) and N in position 5 (allowed). \n  But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? No, only one E and one N.\n\nBut ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? Yes.\n\nBut we might prefer more common words.\n\nI think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  We know the secret word has N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5). \n  In ""ONSET"", we have:\n    O: new letter\n    N: in position 2 (which is a new position for N, so we can get feedback on that)\n    S: new letter\n    E: in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess it was in position 5)\n    T: new letter\n\nThis will give us information about O, S, T and also about the positions of N and E.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present), but N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, R, or A.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.\n\nA suitable guess is **""ONSET""**:\n- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, S, T (all common and untested).\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n  Meaning:\n    - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.\n    - N is present but not in position 4.\n    - E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\n  Meaning:\n    - O, S, T are absent from the secret word.\n    - N is present and in the correct position (position 2).\n    - E is present and in the correct position (position 4).\n\nSo now we know:\n  - The secret word has N in position 2 and E in position 4.\n  - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S, T.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (but now we know it\'s in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but now we know it\'s in position 4).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ N _ E _\n\nWe need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.\n\nWe know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, O, S, T.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E _ with the available letters.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that can fit.\n\nWe can try to use a word that includes some of the common remaining letters: L, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- The word must have a letter in position 1, then N in 2, then a letter in 3, E in 4, and a letter in 5.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. ""INNER"": \n   - I, N, N, E, R -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.\n\n2. ""MINCE"": \n   - M, I, N, C, E -> but C is absent, and also note: the form would be M (pos1), I (pos2?) -> but we need N in pos2, so actually it would be M (pos1), N (pos2), then C (pos3) -> but C is absent. Also, the word has E in pos5? No, in ""MINCE"" it\'s M-I-N-C-E, so E is in pos5? But we know E must be in pos4. So invalid.\n\nWe need E in pos4.\n\n3. ""DINED"": \n   - D, I, N, E, D -> but wait, the form: D (pos1), I (pos2) -> but we need N in pos2? So no. We must have N in pos2.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nSo for ""DINED"": it would be D (1), I (2) -> but we need N at 2, so that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need a word that has the second letter as N and the fourth as E.\n\nLet\'s list words that fit: _ N _ E _\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""ANKLE"": but A is absent and K is available? But A is absent, so no.\n\n- ""ANGEL"": A is absent.\n\n- ""INDEED"" is 6 letters.\n\n- ""INDEX"": but we have E in the fourth position? I-N-D-E-X -> that\'s I (1), N (2), D (3), E (4), X (5). This fits the pattern. And the letters: I, D, X. We haven\'t tried I, D, X. Also, we must check if they are not in the absent list: I, D, X are not in the absent list (absent: C,R,A,O,S,T). So ""INDEX"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""INDEX"", the E is in position 4 (correct) and N in position 2 (correct). The other letters are I, D, X.\n\nWe can also consider:\n\n- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> but R is absent.\n\n- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).\n\n- ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.\n\n- ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.\n\n- ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R is absent.\n\n- ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> this fits: M (1), I (2) -> wait, no: the word is M-I-N-E-D, so:\n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: I -> but we need N at position 2? So that\'s incorrect.\n\nWe must have the second letter as N. So the word must be: [letter] + N + [letter] + E + [letter]\n\nSo ""MINED"" is M in 1, I in 2 -> that\'s not N in 2. So invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""ANKLE"" is invalid because of A.\n\nWhat about ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> \n  Position 1: U\n  Position 2: N -> correct\n  Position 3: W\n  Position 4: E -> correct\n  Position 5: D\n\nLetters: U, N, W, E, D. We haven\'t tried U, W, D. And they are not in the absent list.\n\nBut is ""UNWED"" a common word? It means not married, so yes.\n\nAnother word: ""INNED"": I, N, N, E, D -> \n  Position 1: I\n  Position 2: N -> correct\n  Position 3: N -> but we don\'t know if N can be repeated? The feedback from the first guess had only one N and it was present, but that doesn\'t rule out two N\'s. However, in the second guess, we had one N and it was correct. So if the word has two N\'s, then in the second guess we would have only one N (in position 2) and the other N (if in position 3) would not be indicated? Actually, in Wordle, if there are two of the same letter, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But in ""onset"", we only had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word has two N\'s, then we would have gotten a hint for the second N? Not necessarily, because we didn\'t have a second N in the guess. So we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""INNED"" is a word (meaning: having nested). We can consider it.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid the absent letters. I and D are not absent.\n\nBut we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two N\'s. We know at least one N is present (from first guess) and we now know it\'s in position 2. But there could be another N.\n\nSimilarly, for E: we know one E is in position 4, but there could be another E.\n\nBut to keep it simple, we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""INKLE"": I, N, K, E, L -> \n  Position 1: I\n  Position 2: N\n  Position 3: K\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: L\n\nLetters: I, N, K, E, L. All are available.\n\nBut ""INKLE"" is a word (meaning: a kind of linen tape).\n\nBut we have many options.\n\nWe can also consider ""DANCE"", but A and C are absent.\n\nAnother common word: ""NICHE"" -> but N is in position 1? We need N in position 2. So no.\n\nWe need to focus on the pattern.\n\nLet\'s list more words that fit the pattern and use available letters:\n\n- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but T is absent (from second guess: T(x)).\n- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> but S is absent and also the pattern: J (1), U (2) -> we need N at 2, so no.\n\nWe must have N at 2 and E at 4.\n\nSo the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""INDEX"": as above, I, N, D, E, X -> positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5). This is a valid word.\n\n- ""UNDER"": but R is absent.\n\n- ""INNER"": but R is absent and also two N\'s? And R is absent.\n\n- ""MINCE"": C is absent.\n\n- ""DINGE"": D, I, N, G, E -> D(1), I(2) -> wait, no: D(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is D-I-N-G-E? Then it would be D(1), I(2), N(3) -> but we need N at 2, so no.\n\nWe must have the second letter as N. So the word is: first letter, then N, then third letter, then E, then fifth letter.\n\nSo ""DINGE"" is D-I-N-G-E -> that\'s positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E -> that doesn\'t have E in position 4? Position 4 is G, and E is at 5? But we need E at 4. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> same issue: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5) -> E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So no.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo let\'s think of words ending with E? But the fourth letter is E, so the fifth can be anything.\n\nWords: ... E _ \n\nBut the pattern is: _ N _ E _\n\nSo the last letter is after E.\n\nExamples: \n  ""UNCLE"": C is absent and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), C(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\n  ""ANKLE"": A absent.\n\n  ""APPLE"": A and P? But A absent, and also pattern: A(1), P(2) -> we need N at 2.\n\n  ""AMPLE"": A absent.\n\n  ""IMPEL"": I, M, P, E, L -> I(1), M(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.\n\n  ""INNER"": I, N, N, E, R -> I(1), N(2), N(3), E(4), R(5). This fits the pattern? \n    Position 1: I\n    Position 2: N (correct)\n    Position 3: N\n    Position 4: E (correct)\n    Position 5: R -> but R is absent. So invalid.\n\n  ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R -> R absent.\n\n  ""LINER"": L, I, N, E, R -> R absent.\n\n  ""MINER"": M, I, N, E, R -> R absent.\n\n  ""VINER"": not common? and R absent.\n\n  ""WISER"": but W(1), I(2) -> not N at 2.\n\n  ""UNZIP"": U, N, Z, I, P -> no E at position 4.\n\nWe need E at position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have E in the fourth position and N in the second.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\n- ""ANKLE"" (invalid due to A)\n- ""OUNCE"": O is absent and also O(1) -> but O is absent.\n- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> T is absent (from second guess) and also the pattern: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWait, ""UNITE"" has E at 5, not 4.\n\nWhat about ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> T is absent and E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""ANGER"": A absent.\n\n""INGLE"": I, N, G, L, E -> I(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5, not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo the word must be: [1] N [3] E [5]\n\nSo the third letter is between N and E.\n\nExamples: \n  ""ANODE"": A absent.\n  ""ABOVE"": A absent and O absent? O is absent.\n  ""ADOBE"": A and O absent.\n  ""ALIKE"": A absent and the pattern: A(1), L(2) -> not N at 2.\n\nWe need to use the available letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words:\n\n- ""INDEX"": I, N, D, E, X -> valid, as discussed.\n\n- ""UNDEE"": not common? and U, N, D, E, E -> two E\'s? and the pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), E(5). But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, is ""UNDEE"" a word? It might be a surname or rare.\n\n- ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> I(1), N(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: marked with ink). Letters: I, K, D are available.\n\n- ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is a word (meaning: not led). Letters: U, L, D available.\n\n- ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). Word (meaning: not fed). Letters: U, F, D available.\n\n- ""JUMPS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe have several candidates: ""INDEX"", ""INKED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNFED"", etc.\n\nWe want to choose one that uses common letters and might give us more information.\n\nWe have to guess the entire word, so we might as well try to get as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe know the secret word has at least N and E, and we are trying to find the other three.\n\nWe have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T.\n\nWe can choose ""INDEX"" because it uses I, D, X which are common enough.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: I and D are very common, X is less common.\n\n""INKED"" uses I, K, D.\n\n""UNLED"" uses U, L, D.\n\n""UNFED"" uses U, F, D.\n\nWe might prefer to use a word that has vowels? We have I and U as vowels.\n\nBut we already know E is in the word, and we have one vowel slot (position 1 and 3) to fill.\n\nWe can also consider ""MINKE"": M, I, N, K, E -> M(1), I(2) -> wait, no: M(1), I(2) but we need N at 2. So the word is M-I-N-K-E? Then it\'s M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""BINGO"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe should go with one of the candidates.\n\nLet\'s choose ""INDEX"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we haven\'t used any absent letters. I, D, X are not in the absent list.\n\nSo we guess ""INDEX"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED""? We are trying to get information.\n\nSince we have limited tries, we should try to cover more letters. But in this case, we are forced to use the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has more common consonants.\n\nBut ""INDEX"" is fine.\n\nAnother candidate: ""IMPEL"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nOr ""INFER"": I, N, F, E, R -> but R is absent.\n\nSo ""INDEX"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but the pattern: L(1), I(2) -> we need N at 2, so that\'s I at 2? No, the word is L-I-N-E-D -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. So we have N at position 3? But we need N at position 2. So invalid.\n\nWe must have N at position 2.\n\nSo I think ""INDEX"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""INDEX"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5.\n- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T are absent; N is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ N _ E _` (N in position 2, E in position 4).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T (cannot be used).\n- Present letters: N and E (N is fixed in position 2, E in position 4).\n- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 3, and 5.\n- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ N _ E _` and uses only available letters.\n- Prioritize common letters (e.g., I, D, L, M) to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating absent letters.\n\nA strong candidate is **""INDEX""**:\n- Fits the pattern: `I` (position 1), `N` (position 2, correct), `D` (position 3), `E` (position 4, correct), `X` (position 5).\n- Uses new, common letters (I, D, X) to test positions 1, 3, and 5.\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, O, S, T).\n\nThis guess will help identify the missing letters and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>index</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(✓) S(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: index -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) D(-) E(✓) X(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""index"":\n  I: x (absent)\n  N: ✓ (correct position)\n  D: - (present but wrong position)\n  E: ✓ (correct position)\n  X: x (absent)\n\nSo now we know:\n  - The secret word has the pattern: _ N _ E _\n  - N is in position 2 and E is in position 4 (as before).\n  - D is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we guessed D in position 3 and got \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there).\n  - I and X are absent.\n\nAdditionally, from previous guesses, we know the absent letters are: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T, I, D, X.\n\nSo absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X.\n\nPresent letters: N (pos2), E (pos4), and D (somewhere, but not pos3).\n\nWe also know that the secret word has at least three distinct letters: N, E, D (and possibly two more).\n\nThe word pattern: [1] N [3] E [5]\n\nWe know D is in the word but not in position 3. So D must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are taken by N and E, and position 3 is excluded for D).\n\nSo D is either in position 1 or 5.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses D in position 1 or 5, and the other two positions (if D is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if D is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\nAvailable letters (not absent and not already known present in the word except for D which we are placing): \n  B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we know D is present, so we must use D in the word.\n\nWe have two cases:\n\nCase 1: D in position 1 -> word: D N _ E _\nCase 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D\n\nWe need to find common words that fit one of these patterns and use the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nCase 1: D N _ E _\n  The third position must be a letter that is available and the fifth position must be available.\n\n  Example words:\n    - ""DUNCE"": but C is absent and E is already in position 4? The word is D-U-N-C-E -> but that would be D(1), U(2) -> but we need N at position 2, so no. The pattern requires N at 2, so the word is D(1), N(2), [3], E(4), [5]. So ""DUNCE"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n    - ""DANCE"": A and C absent.\n\n    - ""DINED"": D(1), I(2) -> but we need N at 2, so no.\n\n    - ""DOWNE"": not a word.\n\n    - ""DUNES"": D(1), U(2) -> no.\n\n  We need a word that starts with ""DN"", then a letter, then ""E"", then a letter.\n\n  This is not a common pattern. Let\'s think of words:\n\n    ""DNE"" is not a common beginning.\n\n  Possible words: \n    ""DWAINE"": too long.\n\n  I can\'t think of a common word that starts with ""DN"". So maybe case 1 is unlikely.\n\nCase 2: D in position 5 -> word: _ N _ E D\n\n  So the pattern: [1] N [3] E D\n\n  Now, we need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.\n\n  Example words:\n\n    - ""UNFED"": U, N, F, E, D -> \n        Position 1: U\n        Position 2: N (correct)\n        Position 3: F\n        Position 4: E (correct)\n        Position 5: D\n        Letters: U, F, D. We haven\'t tried U and F, and they are not absent.\n\n        But is ""UNFED"" a word? Yes, meaning not fed.\n\n    - ""UNLED"": U, N, L, E, D -> \n        Position 1: U\n        Position 2: N\n        Position 3: L\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: D\n        Letters: U, L, D. Available.\n\n    - ""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> \n        Position 1: U\n        Position 2: N\n        Position 3: W\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: D\n        Letters: U, W, D. Available.\n\n    - ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but I is absent (from guess 3: I(x)).\n\n    - ""ANKED"": A absent.\n\n    - ""BUNKED"": too long.\n\n    - ""MINCED"": M, I, N, C, E, D -> too long and I, C absent.\n\n  So we have candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".\n\n  We also have to consider if there are other words.\n\n  Another word: ""JUKED"": J, U, K, E, D -> but the pattern: J(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.\n\n  We need the second letter to be N.\n\n  So the word must start with [vowel or consonant] then N, then a letter, then E, then D.\n\n  Other possibilities:\n\n    ""ANEW"" is 4 letters.\n\n    ""OWNED"": O, W, N, E, D -> but O is absent (from guess 2: O(x)).\n\n    ""ENDED"": E, N, D, E, D -> but the pattern: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need E at 4, and here E is at 1 and 4? Also, the pattern requires [1] N [3] E D, so position 1 is E? Then it would be E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But we have two E\'s and two D\'s? And we know E is at position 4, but we don\'t know about duplicates. However, in this case, we have E at position 1 and 4? But we only know about one E (from first guess) and now we have two. Also, the feedback for the first guess had E as present but not in position 5, and in the second guess E was in position 4 and correct. So if there is an extra E at position 1, we would have gotten a hint? In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, but we didn\'t have an E in position 1 so we wouldn\'t know. Similarly, in the third guess, we didn\'t have an E in position 1. So it\'s possible.\n\n  But let\'s check the pattern: ""ENDED"" -> \n    Position 1: E -> but we have E in the word? Yes, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 1. However, the pattern we have requires E in position 4, which is satisfied. But the word has E in position 1 and 4? And D in position 3 and 5? \n\n  But we know from the third guess: we had D in position 3 and got \'-\' meaning D is present but not in position 3. But if the word has D in position 3 and 5, then in the third guess we put D in position 3 and it should have been marked as correct? But it was marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position). So that would be inconsistent because if D is in position 3, then when we put D in position 3, it should be marked as correct. Therefore, the secret word does not have D in position 3. So ""ENDED"" would have D in position 3 and 5? Then when we guessed D in position 3, it should have been marked as correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position. So that means D is not in position 3. Therefore, ""ENDED"" is invalid because it has D in position 3.\n\n  Similarly, we cannot have D in position 3 in the secret word.\n\n  So back to our candidates: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".\n\n  We also have ""JUNKED"" but too long.\n\n  Another word: ""MUNGE"" -> M, U, N, G, E -> but the pattern: M(1), U(2) -> we need N at 2, so no.\n\n  ""FUNKED"": F, U, N, K, E, D -> too long.\n\n  So the main candidates are ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".\n\n  We need to choose one. We can choose the most common one.\n\n  ""UNWED"" is a common word (meaning not married).\n\n  ""UNLED"" (meaning not led) and ""UNFED"" (meaning not fed) are less common.\n\n  But we can use any.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried to get more information, but in this case, we are down to the last few letters and we have three possibilities. We have to guess one.\n\n  But note: we have only one more guess? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one and then have two more if needed.\n\n  However, we might be able to guess the word.\n\n  But we don\'t know which one it is.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have to fit the pattern.\n\n  Since we know the pattern and the letters, we can try to guess one of the candidates.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""UNWED"" because it\'s common.\n\n  But wait, we have to consider: in the third guess, we had D in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So D must be in the word but not in position 3. In ""UNWED"", D is in position 5, which is fine. Similarly, in ""UNFED"" and ""UNLED"", D is in position 5.\n\n  So all three candidates have D in position 5.\n\n  Now, the only difference is the first and third letters.\n\n  For ""UNWED"": U in position 1, W in position 3.\n  For ""UNFED"": U in position 1, F in position 3.\n  For ""UNLED"": U in position 1, L in position 3.\n\n  So they all have U in position 1? \n\n  But wait, we don\'t know that. We only assumed D in position 5. The first letter could be something else.\n\n  We have the pattern: [1] N [3] E D\n\n  The first letter can be any available letter, and the third letter any available letter.\n\n  We have candidates with U in position 1? But we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\n  We have not tested U, so it could be.\n\n  But we also have other possibilities? For example, the first letter could be B, F, G, etc.\n\n  Let\'s think of more words:\n\n    ""BANED"": B, A, N, E, D -> A absent.\n\n    ""BONED"": O absent.\n\n    ""FANED"": not common.\n\n    ""GANEF"": G, A, N, E, F -> A absent.\n\n    ""MANED"": M, A, N, E, D -> A absent.\n\n    ""PANED"": P, A, N, E, D -> A absent.\n\n    ""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> A absent.\n\n    ""BINED"": B, I, N, E, D -> I absent.\n\n    ""FINED"": F, I, N, E, D -> I absent.\n\n    ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> I absent.\n\n    ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> I absent.\n\n    ""VINED"": V, I, N, E, D -> I absent.\n\n    ""WINED"": W, I, N, E, D -> I absent.\n\n  So after I and A are absent, we don\'t have many options.\n\n  What about with U?\n\n    ""UNBED"": not common? \n    ""UNCED"": not a word.\n    ""UNDID"": D in position 5? U, N, D, I, D -> but I absent and also pattern: U(1), N(2), D(3), I(4), D(5) -> but we need E in position 4? So no.\n\n  So the only common words we have are the ones with U: ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".\n\n  There is also ""UNPEG"": but no E at 4.\n\n  ""UNSET"": but S and T absent.\n\n  So we are left with ""UNFED"", ""UNLED"", ""UNWED"".\n\n  We can also consider ""UNKED"" (archaic for unknown) but not common.\n\n  Or ""JUNED"" not a word.\n\n  So the three candidates are the main ones.\n\n  Now, we have to choose one. We can pick ""UNWED"" as it is the most common.\n\n  But note: we have not tested U, W, F, L. We don\'t know which one is present.\n\n  We can try to guess a word that uses as many of these as possible? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\n  Alternatively, we can guess a word that has U in position 1 and then a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we don\'t have such a word.\n\n  We have to guess one of the three.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""UNWED"".\n\n  But wait, we have another option: we can guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests multiple letters. However, we are forced to have the pattern and we know D must be in position 5? Actually, we don\'t know for sure that D is in position 5. We only deduced that because D must be in 1 or 5, and we couldn\'t find a word with D in 1. But maybe there is a word with D in 1?\n\n  Let me try again to find a word with D in position 1 and the pattern D N _ E _\n\n  Words:\n    ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.\n    ""DINES"" -> D(1), I(2) -> no, and I absent.\n    ""DANES"" -> A absent.\n    ""DONEE"" -> O absent and not common.\n    ""DUPED"" -> D(1), U(2) -> no.\n\n  I think it\'s safe to assume D is in position 5.\n\n  So we guess ""UNWED"".\n\n  But to be thorough, let\'s see if there is a word with D in position 1 and the pattern.

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""unwed"":
  U: ✓ (correct position)
  N: ✓ (correct position)
  W: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  D: ✓ (correct position)

So the secret word is: U N _ E D

Therefore, the word is ""U N _ E D"", and we know the fifth letter is D, first is U, second is N, fourth is E, fifth is D.

The third letter is missing.

We also know from previous feedback that W is absent.

From previous guesses, absent letters include: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X, W.

We must find a letter for the third position that is not in the absent list.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z.

The word is ""UN_ED"", so it must be a 5-letter English word.

Common words with this pattern:

- ""UNLED"": L is available? Yes, L has not been tested. So possible.
- ""UNFED"": F is available.
- ""UNJED"": not common.
- ""UNKED"": not common.
- ""UNMEWED"": too long.
- ""UNPEG"": but no E.
- ""UNRED"": but R is absent.

Let's list valid words:

- ""UNBED"": not common? But let's check: ""unbed"" means to remove from a bed? Not common.
- ""UNFED"": meaning not fed. This is a valid word.
- ""UNLED"": meaning not led. Valid.
- ""UNMED"": M is available? Not a common word? But ""unmed"" might be used (unmedicated), but is it recognized?
- ""UNPED"": not common.
- ""UNWED"": we guessed it already? But we guessed ""unwed"", which had W absent. But we know the word is not ""unwed"" because the feedback for W was absent. So it's not ""unwed"".

Therefore, we must avoid W.

Other options:

- ""UNKED"": K is available? But ""unked"" is archaic for unknown? Not common.
- ""UNSEE"": not the pattern.

Perhaps ""UNLED"" and ""UNFED"" are the main candidates.

But there is also ""UNZED"": Z is available? ""Unzed"" is British slang for the letter Z, but not commonly used.

Another word: ""UNBID"": but B, I: I is absent.

""UNKID"": not common.

So the two most likely words are ""UNFED"" and ""UNLED"".

We have two possibilities? Or is there another?

What about ""UNGET"": but G, E? The word would be U, N, G, E, T? But T is absent.

""UNMET"": T is absent.

Therefore, only ""UNFED"" and ""UNLED"" are sensible from the available letters.

We also know the word must be in the dictionary. Since we don't know the exact word, we can guess one of them.

We have to make a choice. Since we are on the fifth guess (next guess), we can pick one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that contains both L and F? But we cannot, because the pattern fixes all positions except one: only the third letter is missing.

So we must guess a word with one letter in position 3.

We can guess ""UNFED"" or ""UNLED"".

Let's choose ""UNFED"" as we haven't tried F yet? But L also hasn't been tried.

We can flip a coin. But let's say we choose ""UNFED"".

But note: we have only one missing letter. We don't need to guess a whole new word? But the rules say we must guess a valid 5-letter word.

So we guess ""UNFED"".

If we guess ""UNFED"", then:
  If the word is ""UNFED"", we get it.
  If not, then it must be ""UNLED"", and we have one more guess.

Since we have two guesses left? We started with 6, and we are about to make the fifth.

We have made 4 guesses, so 2 left.

So it's safe.

Alternatively, we can guess the letter directly by forming ""UNLED"" or ""UNFED"".

But we have to output a word.

So I'll choose ""UNFED"".

But let me double-check the feedback.

We guessed ""unwed"" and got:
  U(✓), N(✓), W(x), E(✓), D(✓)

So the secret word is ""U N ? E D"" and ? is not W.

Therefore, we need a letter that is not in the absent list: absent letters are C,R,A,O,S,T,I,X,W.

So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,Y,Z.

Now, if we guess ""UNFED"", it's U(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), D(5). This is a valid word.

Similarly, ""UNLED"": U(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), D(5).

But which one to pick? Since neither F nor L has been tested, both are possible.

We can pick ""UNFED"".

So we guess ""UNFED"".Based on the feedback from ""unwed"":
- The secret word is confirmed as **U N _ E D**.
- **W is absent**, ruling out ""UNWED"".
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X, W.
- **Available letters** for position 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z.

### Remaining Candidates:
The only common words fitting **U N _ E D** are:
- **""UNFED""** (F in position 3).
- **""UNLED""** (L in position 3).

### Next Guess:
- Choose **""UNFED""** to test F in position 3.
- If correct, solved. If not, the word must be ""UNLED"" on the next guess.

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A absent; N and E present (but not in positions 4 or 5).
2. **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O, S, T absent; N confirmed in position 2; E confirmed in position 4.
3. **Guess 3: ""index""** → I, X absent; D present (but not in position 3); N and E correct in positions 2 and 4.
4. **Guess 4: ""unwed""** → U correct in position 1; N correct in position 2; W absent; E correct in position 4; D correct in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **U N _ E D** (positions: 1=U, 2=N, 3=?, 4=E, 5=D).
- **W is absent** (ruling out ""UNWED"").
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, S, T, I, X, W (cannot be used).
- Position 3 is the only unknown and must be filled with an available letter not in the absent list:  
  **B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z**.

### Deduction:
- The secret word must be a valid 5-letter English word following the pattern **U N _ E D**.
- Common words fitting this pattern include:
  - **""UNFED""** (F in position 3).
  - **""UNLED""** (L in position 3).
- Since both are equally viable, prioritize testing **F** (a letter not yet guessed) to maximize new information.

### Next Guess: ""UNFED""
- Tests F in position 3.
- If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, the word must be ""UNLED"" (to guess next).
