We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include a mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""SOARE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has two vowels and three common consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It covers the vowels A and E, which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good starter (meaning: the accumulated earnings on an investment) but it has a double use of 'R' and we want to cover more distinct letters.

 However, note that the rules require a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll start with ""CRANE"".
</think>
I am starting my first guess. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gain. The best starters typically include a mix of common vowels and consonants to help identify letters and their positions.

For my first guess, I will choose **""CRANE""**. This word is effective because:
- It contains two vowels (A and E), which are frequent in English words.
- It uses three common consonants (C, R, N) that appear often in 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five different characters at once.

After this guess, the feedback will reveal which letters are present and/or correctly placed, guiding my next move.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all (x).
 - A is not in the word at all (x).
 - N is not in the word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present somewhere, but not in position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - R, A, N are absent from the word entirely.
 - E is present but not in the 5th position (since the guess had E in position 5).

 The word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N. It does contain E, but E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we can think of the pattern: C _ _ _ _

 We must avoid the letters R, A, N. Also, E cannot be in the last position.

 We need to make a new guess that meets:
 - First letter C (since it's fixed).
 - Contains E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
 - Does not contain R, A, N.
 - The word must be a valid English word.

 Additionally, to maximize information, we can try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

 Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R, A, N are out. So remaining letters from common ones might be: 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already known but we have to place it).

 However note: E is already confirmed present, but we have not used O, U, I, etc.

 We can try to include a new vowel and some consonants that are common.

 Considering the pattern: C _ _ _ _

 We have to include E somewhere not at the end? Actually, the feedback only says E is not in position 5, so it could be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, wait: the word is C _ _ _ _ and the E we know is present but not in the position we placed it (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2-4? Actually, no: the feedback for E is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Since we placed it in position 5, that means it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in one of positions 1-4? But position 1 is C? So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, the word has the form: C [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] and the E is in one of the middle three positions.

 Since we have limited tries, let's try to fix the E in a different position and use common letters we haven't tried.

 Avoided letters: R, A, N.

 Commonly used letters: We can try S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some examples:
 - ""CHASE"" -> but contains A -> avoid.
 - ""CRATE"" -> contains R -> avoid.
 - ""CLOSE"" -> but O and S are new? and it ends with E? But we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at the end.
 - Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Options:
 - Position 2: CE... words: e.g., ""CEDAR"" -> contains A -> bad.
   - ""CELEB"" -> not 5 letters? Also contains L and B, but is it valid? Not common. Let's look for standard words.
 - Position 3: C _ E ... words: e.g., ""CHEST"", but E is in position 3? So word: C H E S T -> has H, E, S, T. And ends with T? Let's check: we need E not at the end? Here E is at position 3? Then we can use ""CHEST"". But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is not at the end? So it's okay to have E in position 3? Also, the first letter is C, so matching condition? However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? Actually: C H E S T -> position 2 is H, position 3 is E? Then position 4 is S, position 5 is T? That's fine? The E is in position 3? So not at the end? So acceptable? And it avoids R, A, N? Letters: C, H, E, S, T -> H, S, T are new.

 - Another option: Position 4: C _ _ E ... words: e.g., ""COMET"" -> O, M, E, T? And E is at position 4? Then the last letter is T? That avoids A, R, N? And E at position 4 is acceptable? So ""COMET"" would be: C O M E T.

 But note: we don't know which of these is better? Also, we are allowed to reuse E? But E is known to be in the word? So we can include it? Actually, we must include E? Because it's present? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word? So we must include E? So every guess must include E? Actually, not necessarily? Because we might guess E again? But we already know E is present? So we don't have to? However, to narrow down we might want to? But alternatively, we could ignore E for one guess? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E must be in positions 2-4? So perhaps we should include E in our next guess? That way we can get its position.

 Since we have to test E's position? Therefore, including E in the second guess is beneficial.

 Let me compare two words: ""CHEST"" and ""COMET"". 
 CHEST: C H E S T -> letters: E is in position 3? So if we get feedback on E, we know if it's correct at position 3? Or if it's in the word but not there? Then it must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have only one E? Actually, the word might have multiple E's? But so far we don't know? The feedback was for one E? And we have only one E? But in the secret word, there could be more? But we don't know? The feedback only told us about the E we guessed: that it's present but not in position 5? It doesn't tell us if there are more? Since we only guessed one E? So it might be that the word has one E? Or more? But we don't know? 

 However, note: the feedback symbol: a '-' means the letter is present but in the wrong position? And for multiple same letters? It gets complicated? But the rules didn't specify? But in standard Wordle, if there is a duplicate? Actually, let's assume the standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times? Then the feedback will account for it? But in our case, we don't have duplicates in the first guess? So let's proceed.

 We can try both? But I need to choose one.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that doesn't put E in the same position? Or vary for maximum new letter coverage? 

 But note: we must keep the first letter C? So our second guess must start with C? Because we know C is correct at position 1? So we should keep it? Therefore, we don't change that?

 So yes: the second guess must be a word starting with C? And containing E somewhere? And avoiding R, A, N? So only positions 2 to 5 can be filled with letters that are not R, A, N? And we have to include E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And the last letter cannot be E? Because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: what if the word has E at position 5 and also at another? But note: we were told that the E we placed in position 5 got a ""-"", meaning one E exists? But if the word had E at position 5 and also at another? Then the E we placed in position 5? Well, usually the rules: if there is one E and we placed it in position 5? But the E might be at position, say, 2? Then we get a '-' for E at position 5? But if there were two E's? Then we might get a '-' for that E? And a correct for the other? Etc? 

 However, to avoid complications? And since we don't know? We'll assume we have at least one E? And its position is in 2,3,4? So position 5 must be a non-E? And indeed? The feedback says the letter at position 5? The E? Is not correct? Meaning that there might be another E elsewhere? But we'll find out? 

 So back to constructing the second guess:

 Let me also note: we have not tested many consonants? So we can try a word that introduces new common consonants? Like T, L, M, S, etc? 

 The word ""CHEST"": 
   C H E S T
   Letters: C, H, E, S, T? 
   New letters: H, S, T? 
   We already know C is correct at position 1? And E is present? So we can test whether E is at position 3? And test H at position 2? S at position 4? T at position 5?

 The word ""COMET"": 
   C O M E T
   Letters: C, O, M, E, T? 
   New letters: O, M, T? 

 Which is better? 

 Additionally, we must avoid R, A, N? Both words avoid them? So both valid.

 But note that T might be a common ending? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? while ""COMET"" also ends with T? But also, ""CHEST"" has S? which is a common letter? 

 Actually, let me think of other words? 
 - C with E in position 2: ""CEILS"" -> but CE is at 1 and 2? But then? Also, not common? 
   Or ""CEDIS""? Contains D? But not common? 
   Also, ""CELEB"" is not valid? 

 So alternative? 
   Let me think of C with E at position 2: 
      ""CELLO"" -> starts C E L L O? But has L and O? But note: avoiding R, A, N? Okay? But ""CELLO"" means we put E at position 2? and we guess L in positions 3 and 4? And O at 5? Might not be ideal? But let's see? 
   Actually, ""CELTS"" -> C E L T S? Also a word? 

 But I am considering that the feedback for the first guess already told us E is not at position 5? But we don't know about other positions? By putting E at position 2? We test if E is at position 2? Similarly, by putting it at position 3? we test that? 

 Since we have to find the E's position? And we have no preference? So we might choose a word that uses new letters? 

 However, note that we have limited tries? And we want to maximize the information? So using a word that contains several new letters? and possibly in common positions? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""CHEST"" because it uses H, S, T? which are very common? 

 Also, we can try ""CLOSE""? But ""CLOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is wrong? Because E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? So ""CLOSE"" would be invalid? because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: in ""CLOSE""? the E is at position 5? and we know E cannot be at position 5? So why waste a guess? We can avoid that? 

 Actually, we should avoid putting E at position 5? because we know it's not correct? Similarly, we should not put E at the end? 

 Therefore, ""CHEST"" is good? E is in position 3? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""CLEAR""? But CLEAR contains A? which we know is absent? So invalid? 

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? 

 Or another word: ""CUBES""? But E is in position 4? And U, B, S? Also avoids R, A, N? 

 But ""CUBES"": ends with S? But E is in position 4? 

 Both are valid? 

 It's arbitrary? So I'll go with ""CHEST""? 

 But note: let me check that the word ""CHEST"" exists? It's valid.

 Therefore, I guess: chest

 But wait: what if we want to test E in a different position? We don't want to fix in one spot? We are trying to determine the position? So if we put E in position 2? Then we get information? 

 Actually, we have no constraint? So we can pick any? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses E in a position that we haven't tried? And that covers more vowels? 

 Since E is the only vowel we have? And the word must have other vowels? Or not? But we don't know? 

 But we don't know? We have not tested O, U, I? Etc? 

 Therefore, using a word that uses O? might be helpful? For example, ""COMET"" has the vowel O? and E? 

 Whereas ""CHEST"" has no other vowel? Only E? 

 Therefore, ""COMET"" gives information about O? Which is a common vowel? And M? So that might be more informative? 

 But note: the unknown letters? Using O? might be better? 

 That is a valid point? 

 Also, ""COMET"" avoids the same letters? 

 So let me reconsider:

 Guess with ""COMET"": 
   Pattern: C O M E T
   E is in position 4? So we test E at position 4? 
   And we test O at position 2? M at position 3? T at position 5?

 So if E is not at position 4? then we know it must be in position either 2 or 3? Because the word has E somewhere? And we already know it cannot be in position 5? Then next guess? But we avoid having tested more letters? 

 Alternatively, if we use ""CHEST"", we test E at position 3? So if it hits? then we know? 

 But testing O? which is a vowel? might reveal if the word has O? 

 Since we haven't tested any vowel except E? And E we know? Then O? is common? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""COMET"" to test O? 

 Let me also note: the word might have vowels? So testing O? is valuable? 

 Alternative? ""COPED""? but has D? and E? Also, avoids R,A,N? 

 But I think ""COMET"" is a common word? 

 Therefore, I choose ""COMET"".

 But wait: what about the letter M? Is it common? Not as common as S? But I think for now? 

 Also, note: T at the end? We have not tested T? 

 So ""COMET"" and ""CHEST"" both test T?

 However, ""CHEST"" tests S? which is more common than M? 

 But ""COMET"" tests O? which is a vowel? 

 So if I must choose? I'm leaning toward ""COMET"" to include a vowel? 

 Alternatively, another word: ""COVES""? Ends with S? E at position 4? But O? And V? 

 Anyway? 

 After reconsidering? I think using a word that introduces a vowel? so ""COMET"" is chosen? 

 So second guess: comet.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** is correct and in position 1 → the word starts with ""C"".
- **E(-)** is in the word but not at position 5 → E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **R(x)**, **A(x)**, **N(x)** are absent → the word contains none of R, A, N.

My strategy for the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" (fixed position).
- Must include ""E"" in position 2, 3, or 4 to test its location.
- Avoid R, A, N, and focus on new common consonants (e.g., T, M, S) and vowels (e.g., O, U) for better coverage.
- Prioritize words that test ""E"" in an untested position while introducing new vowels for maximal information.

Selected ""COMET"" because:
- Starts with ""C"" → tests fixed position.
- Places ""E"" in position 4 → checks if E fits there.
- Introduces ""O"" (vowel) and ""M"", ""T"" (common consonants) → expands coverage.
- Avoids R, A, N → complies with feedback.
- Valid 5-letter English word.

Actually, wait: the word is C _ _ _ _ and the E we know is present but not in the position we placed it (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2-4? Actually, no: the feedback for E is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Since we placed it in position 5, that means it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in one of positions 1-4? But position 1 is C? So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, the word has the form: C [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] and the E is in one of the middle three positions.

 Since we have limited tries, let's try to fix the E in a different position and use common letters we haven't tried.

 Avoided letters: R, A, N.

 Commonly used letters: We can try S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some examples:
 - ""CHASE"" -> but contains A -> avoid.
 - ""CRATE"" -> contains R -> avoid.
 - ""CLOSE"" -> but O and S are new? and it ends with E? But we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at the end.
 - Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Options:
 - Position 2: CE... words: e.g., ""CEDAR"" -> contains A -> bad.
   - ""CELEB"" -> not 5 letters? Also contains L and B, but is it valid? Not common. Let's look for standard words.
 - Position 3: C _ E ... words: e.g., ""CHEST"", but E is in position 3? So word: C H E S T -> has H, E, S, T. And ends with T? Let's check: we need E not at the end? Here E is at position 3? Then we can use ""CHEST"". But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is not at the end? So it's okay to have E in position 3? Also, the first letter is C, so matching condition? However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? Actually: C H E S T -> position 2 is H, position 3 is E? Then position 4 is S, position 5 is T? That's fine? The E is in position 3? So not at the end? So acceptable? And it avoids R, A, N? Letters: C, H, E, S, T -> H, S, T are new.

 - Another option: Position 4: C _ _ E ... words: e.g., ""COMET"" -> O, M, E, T? And E is at position 4? Then the last letter is T? That avoids A, R, N? And E at position 4 is acceptable? So ""COMET"" would be: C O M E T.

 But note: we don't know which of these is better? Also, we are allowed to reuse E? But E is known to be in the word? So we can include it? Actually, we must include E? Because it's present? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word? So we must include E? So every guess must include E? Actually, not necessarily? Because we might guess E again? But we already know E is present? So we don't have to? However, to narrow down we might want to? But alternatively, we could ignore E for one guess? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E must be in positions 2-4? So perhaps we should include E in our next guess? That way we can get its position.

 Since we have to test E's position? Therefore, including E in the second guess is beneficial.

 Let me compare two words: ""CHEST"" and ""COMET"". 
 CHEST: C H E S T -> letters: E is in position 3? So if we get feedback on E, we know if it's correct at position 3? Or if it's in the word but not there? Then it must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have only one E? Actually, the word might have multiple E's? But so far we don't know? The feedback was for one E? And we have only one E? But in the secret word, there could be more? But we don't know? The feedback only told us about the E we guessed: that it's present but not in position 5? It doesn't tell us if there are more? Since we only guessed one E? So it might be that the word has one E? Or more? But we don't know? 

 However, note: the feedback symbol: a '-' means the letter is present but in the wrong position? And for multiple same letters? It gets complicated? But the rules didn't specify? But in standard Wordle, if there is a duplicate? Actually, let's assume the standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times? Then the feedback will account for it? But in our case, we don't have duplicates in the first guess? So let's proceed.

 We can try both? But I need to choose one.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that doesn't put E in the same position? Or vary for maximum new letter coverage? 

 But note: we must keep the first letter C? So our second guess must start with C? Because we know C is correct at position 1? So we should keep it? Therefore, we don't change that?

 So yes: the second guess must be a word starting with C? And containing E somewhere? And avoiding R, A, N? So only positions 2 to 5 can be filled with letters that are not R, A, N? And we have to include E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And the last letter cannot be E? Because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: what if the word has E at position 5 and also at another? But note: we were told that the E we placed in position 5 got a ""-"", meaning one E exists? But if the word had E at position 5 and also at another? Then the E we placed in position 5? Well, usually the rules: if there is one E and we placed it in position 5? But the E might be at position, say, 2? Then we get a '-' for E at position 5? But if there were two E's? Then we might get a '-' for that E? And a correct for the other? Etc? 

 However, to avoid complications? And since we don't know? We'll assume we have at least one E? And its position is in 2,3,4? So position 5 must be a non-E? And indeed? The feedback says the letter at position 5? The E? Is not correct? Meaning that there might be another E elsewhere? But we'll find out? 

 So back to constructing the second guess:

 Let me also note: we have not tested many consonants? So we can try a word that introduces new common consonants? Like T, L, M, S, etc? 

 The word ""CHEST"": 
   C H E S T
   Letters: C, H, E, S, T? 
   New letters: H, S, T? 
   We already know C is correct at position 1? And E is present? So we can test whether E is at position 3? And test H at position 2? S at position 4? T at position 5?

 The word ""COMET"": 
   C O M E T
   Letters: C, O, M, E, T? 
   New letters: O, M, T? 

 Which is better? 

 Additionally, we must avoid R, A, N? Both words avoid them? So both valid.

 But note that T might be a common ending? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? while ""COMET"" also ends with T? But also, ""CHEST"" has S? which is a common letter? 

 Actually, let me think of other words? 
 - C with E in position 2: ""CEILS"" -> but CE is at 1 and 2? But then? Also, not common? 
   Or ""CEDIS""? Contains D? But not common? 
   Also, ""CELEB"" is not valid? 

 So alternative? 
   Let me think of C with E at position 2: 
      ""CELLO"" -> starts C E L L O? But has L and O? But note: avoiding R, A, N? Okay? But ""CELLO"" means we put E at position 2? and we guess L in positions 3 and 4? And O at 5? Might not be ideal? But let's see? 
   Actually, ""CELTS"" -> C E L T S? Also a word? 

 But I am considering that the feedback for the first guess already told us E is not at position 5? But we don't know about other positions? By putting E at position 2? We test if E is at position 2? Similarly, by putting it at position 3? we test that? 

 Since we have to find the E's position? And we have no preference? So we might choose a word that uses new letters? 

 However, note that we have limited tries? And we want to maximize the information? So using a word that contains several new letters? and possibly in common positions? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""CHEST"" because it uses H, S, T? which are very common? 

 Also, we can try ""CLOSE""? But ""CLOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is wrong? Because E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? So ""CLOSE"" would be invalid? because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: in ""CLOSE""? the E is at position 5? and we know E cannot be at position 5? So why waste a guess? We can avoid that? 

 Actually, we should avoid putting E at position 5? because we know it's not correct? Similarly, we should not put E at the end? 

 Therefore, ""CHEST"" is good? E is in position 3? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""CLEAR""? But CLEAR contains A? which we know is absent? So invalid? 

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? 

 Or another word: ""CUBES""? But E is in position 4? And U, B, S? Also avoids R, A, N? 

 But ""CUBES"": ends with S? But E is in position 4? 

 Both are valid? 

 It's arbitrary? So I'll go with ""CHEST""? 

 But note: let me check that the word ""CHEST"" exists? It's valid.

 Therefore, I guess: chest

 But wait: what if we want to test E in a different position? We don't want to fix in one spot? We are trying to determine the position? So if we put E in position 2? Then we get information? 

 Actually, we have no constraint? So we can pick any? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses E in a position that we haven't tried? And that covers more vowels? 

 Since E is the only vowel we have? And the word must have other vowels? Or not? But we don't know? 

 But we don't know? We have not tested O, U, I? Etc? 

 Therefore, using a word that uses O? might be helpful? For example, ""COMET"" has the vowel O? and E? 

 Whereas ""CHEST"" has no other vowel? Only E? 

 Therefore, ""COMET"" gives information about O? Which is a common vowel? And M? So that might be more informative? 

 But note: the unknown letters? Using O? might be better? 

 That is a valid point? 

 Also, ""COMET"" avoids the same letters? 

 So let me reconsider:

 Guess with ""COMET"": 
   Pattern: C O M E T
   E is in position 4? So we test E at position 4? 
   And we test O at position 2? M at position 3? T at position 5?

 So if E is not at position 4? then we know it must be in position either 2 or 3? Because the word has E somewhere? And we already know it cannot be in position 5? Then next guess? But we avoid having tested more letters? 

 Alternatively, if we use ""CHEST"", we test E at position 3? So if it hits? then we know? 

 But testing O? which is a vowel? might reveal if the word has O? 

 Since we haven't tested any vowel except E? And E we know? Then O? is common? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""COMET"" to test O? 

 Let me also note: the word might have vowels? So testing O? is valuable? 

 Alternative? ""COPED""? but has D? and E? Also, avoids R,A,N? 

 But I think ""COMET"" is a common word? 

 Therefore, I choose ""COMET"".

 But wait: what about the letter M? Is it common? Not as common as S? But I think for now? 

 Also, note: T at the end? We have not tested T? 

 So ""COMET"" and ""CHEST"" both test T?

 However, ""CHEST"" tests S? which is more common than M? 

 But ""COMET"" tests O? which is a vowel? 

 So if I must choose? I'm leaning toward ""COMET"" to include a vowel? 

 Alternatively, another word: ""COVES""? Ends with S? E at position 4? But O? And V? 

 Anyway? 

 After reconsidering? I think using a word that introduces a vowel? so ""COMET"" is chosen? 

 So second guess: comet.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** is correct and in position 1 → the word starts with ""C"".
- **E(-)** is in the word but not at position 5 → E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **R(x)**, **A(x)**, **N(x)** are absent → the word contains none of R, A, N.

My strategy for the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" (fixed position).
- Must include ""E"" in position 2, 3, or 4 to test its location.
- Avoid R, A, N, and focus on new common consonants (e.g., T, M, S) and vowels (e.g., O, U) for better coverage.
- Prioritize words that test ""E"" in an untested position while introducing new vowels for maximal information.

Selected ""COMET"" because:
- Starts with ""C"" → tests fixed position.
- Places ""E"" in position 4 → checks if E fits there.
- Introduces ""O"" (vowel) and ""M"", ""T"" (common consonants) → expands coverage.
- Avoids R, A, N → complies with feedback.
- Valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include a mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""SOARE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has two vowels and three common consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It covers the vowels A and E, which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good starter (meaning: the accumulated earnings on an investment) but it has a double use of 'R' and we want to cover more distinct letters.

 However, note that the rules require a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll start with ""CRANE"".I am starting my first guess. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gain. The best starters typically include a mix of common vowels and consonants to help identify letters and their positions.

For my first guess, I will choose **""CRANE""**. This word is effective because:
- It contains two vowels (A and E), which are frequent in English words.
- It uses three common consonants (C, R, N) that appear often in 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five different characters at once.

After this guess, the feedback will reveal which letters are present and/or correctly placed, guiding my next move.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all (x).
 - A is not in the word at all (x).
 - N is not in the word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present somewhere, but not in position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - R, A, N are absent from the word entirely.
 - E is present but not in the 5th position (since the guess had E in position 5).

 The word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N. It does contain E, but E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we can think of the pattern: C _ _ _ _

 We must avoid the letters R, A, N. Also, E cannot be in the last position.

 We need to make a new guess that meets:
 - First letter C (since it's fixed).
 - Contains E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
 - Does not contain R, A, N.
 - The word must be a valid English word.

 Additionally, to maximize information, we can try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

 Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R, A, N are out. So remaining letters from common ones might be: 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already known but we have to place it).

 However note: E is already confirmed present, but we have not used O, U, I, etc.

 We can try to include a new vowel and some consonants that are common.

 Considering the pattern: C _ _ _ _

 We have to include E somewhere not at the end? Actually, the feedback only says E is not in position 5, so it could be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, wait: the word is C _ _ _ _ and the E we know is present but not in the position we placed it (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2-4? Actually, no: the feedback for E is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Since we placed it in position 5, that means it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in one of positions 1-4? But position 1 is C? So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, the word has the form: C [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] and the E is in one of the middle three positions.

 Since we have limited tries, let's try to fix the E in a different position and use common letters we haven't tried.

 Avoided letters: R, A, N.

 Commonly used letters: We can try S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some examples:
 - ""CHASE"" -> but contains A -> avoid.
 - ""CRATE"" -> contains R -> avoid.
 - ""CLOSE"" -> but O and S are new? and it ends with E? But we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at the end.
 - Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Options:
 - Position 2: CE... words: e.g., ""CEDAR"" -> contains A -> bad.
   - ""CELEB"" -> not 5 letters? Also contains L and B, but is it valid? Not common. Let's look for standard words.
 - Position 3: C _ E ... words: e.g., ""CHEST"", but E is in position 3? So word: C H E S T -> has H, E, S, T. And ends with T? Let's check: we need E not at the end? Here E is at position 3? Then we can use ""CHEST"". But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is not at the end? So it's okay to have E in position 3? Also, the first letter is C, so matching condition? However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? Actually: C H E S T -> position 2 is H, position 3 is E? Then position 4 is S, position 5 is T? That's fine? The E is in position 3? So not at the end? So acceptable? And it avoids R, A, N? Letters: C, H, E, S, T -> H, S, T are new.

 - Another option: Position 4: C _ _ E ... words: e.g., ""COMET"" -> O, M, E, T? And E is at position 4? Then the last letter is T? That avoids A, R, N? And E at position 4 is acceptable? So ""COMET"" would be: C O M E T.

 But note: we don't know which of these is better? Also, we are allowed to reuse E? But E is known to be in the word? So we can include it? Actually, we must include E? Because it's present? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word? So we must include E? So every guess must include E? Actually, not necessarily? Because we might guess E again? But we already know E is present? So we don't have to? However, to narrow down we might want to? But alternatively, we could ignore E for one guess? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E must be in positions 2-4? So perhaps we should include E in our next guess? That way we can get its position.

 Since we have to test E's position? Therefore, including E in the second guess is beneficial.

 Let me compare two words: ""CHEST"" and ""COMET"". 
 CHEST: C H E S T -> letters: E is in position 3? So if we get feedback on E, we know if it's correct at position 3? Or if it's in the word but not there? Then it must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have only one E? Actually, the word might have multiple E's? But so far we don't know? The feedback was for one E? And we have only one E? But in the secret word, there could be more? But we don't know? The feedback only told us about the E we guessed: that it's present but not in position 5? It doesn't tell us if there are more? Since we only guessed one E? So it might be that the word has one E? Or more? But we don't know? 

 However, note: the feedback symbol: a '-' means the letter is present but in the wrong position? And for multiple same letters? It gets complicated? But the rules didn't specify? But in standard Wordle, if there is a duplicate? Actually, let's assume the standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times? Then the feedback will account for it? But in our case, we don't have duplicates in the first guess? So let's proceed.

 We can try both? But I need to choose one.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that doesn't put E in the same position? Or vary for maximum new letter coverage? 

 But note: we must keep the first letter C? So our second guess must start with C? Because we know C is correct at position 1? So we should keep it? Therefore, we don't change that?

 So yes: the second guess must be a word starting with C? And containing E somewhere? And avoiding R, A, N? So only positions 2 to 5 can be filled with letters that are not R, A, N? And we have to include E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And the last letter cannot be E? Because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: what if the word has E at position 5 and also at another? But note: we were told that the E we placed in position 5 got a ""-"", meaning one E exists? But if the word had E at position 5 and also at another? Then the E we placed in position 5? Well, usually the rules: if there is one E and we placed it in position 5? But the E might be at position, say, 2? Then we get a '-' for E at position 5? But if there were two E's? Then we might get a '-' for that E? And a correct for the other? Etc? 

 However, to avoid complications? And since we don't know? We'll assume we have at least one E? And its position is in 2,3,4? So position 5 must be a non-E? And indeed? The feedback says the letter at position 5? The E? Is not correct? Meaning that there might be another E elsewhere? But we'll find out? 

 So back to constructing the second guess:

 Let me also note: we have not tested many consonants? So we can try a word that introduces new common consonants? Like T, L, M, S, etc? 

 The word ""CHEST"": 
   C H E S T
   Letters: C, H, E, S, T? 
   New letters: H, S, T? 
   We already know C is correct at position 1? And E is present? So we can test whether E is at position 3? And test H at position 2? S at position 4? T at position 5?

 The word ""COMET"": 
   C O M E T
   Letters: C, O, M, E, T? 
   New letters: O, M, T? 

 Which is better? 

 Additionally, we must avoid R, A, N? Both words avoid them? So both valid.

 But note that T might be a common ending? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? while ""COMET"" also ends with T? But also, ""CHEST"" has S? which is a common letter? 

 Actually, let me think of other words? 
 - C with E in position 2: ""CEILS"" -> but CE is at 1 and 2? But then? Also, not common? 
   Or ""CEDIS""? Contains D? But not common? 
   Also, ""CELEB"" is not valid? 

 So alternative? 
   Let me think of C with E at position 2: 
      ""CELLO"" -> starts C E L L O? But has L and O? But note: avoiding R, A, N? Okay? But ""CELLO"" means we put E at position 2? and we guess L in positions 3 and 4? And O at 5? Might not be ideal? But let's see? 
   Actually, ""CELTS"" -> C E L T S? Also a word? 

 But I am considering that the feedback for the first guess already told us E is not at position 5? But we don't know about other positions? By putting E at position 2? We test if E is at position 2? Similarly, by putting it at position 3? we test that? 

 Since we have to find the E's position? And we have no preference? So we might choose a word that uses new letters? 

 However, note that we have limited tries? And we want to maximize the information? So using a word that contains several new letters? and possibly in common positions? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""CHEST"" because it uses H, S, T? which are very common? 

 Also, we can try ""CLOSE""? But ""CLOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is wrong? Because E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? So ""CLOSE"" would be invalid? because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: in ""CLOSE""? the E is at position 5? and we know E cannot be at position 5? So why waste a guess? We can avoid that? 

 Actually, we should avoid putting E at position 5? because we know it's not correct? Similarly, we should not put E at the end? 

 Therefore, ""CHEST"" is good? E is in position 3? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""CLEAR""? But CLEAR contains A? which we know is absent? So invalid? 

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? 

 Or another word: ""CUBES""? But E is in position 4? And U, B, S? Also avoids R, A, N? 

 But ""CUBES"": ends with S? But E is in position 4? 

 Both are valid? 

 It's arbitrary? So I'll go with ""CHEST""? 

 But note: let me check that the word ""CHEST"" exists? It's valid.

 Therefore, I guess: chest

 But wait: what if we want to test E in a different position? We don't want to fix in one spot? We are trying to determine the position? So if we put E in position 2? Then we get information? 

 Actually, we have no constraint? So we can pick any? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses E in a position that we haven't tried? And that covers more vowels? 

 Since E is the only vowel we have? And the word must have other vowels? Or not? But we don't know? 

 But we don't know? We have not tested O, U, I? Etc? 

 Therefore, using a word that uses O? might be helpful? For example, ""COMET"" has the vowel O? and E? 

 Whereas ""CHEST"" has no other vowel? Only E? 

 Therefore, ""COMET"" gives information about O? Which is a common vowel? And M? So that might be more informative? 

 But note: the unknown letters? Using O? might be better? 

 That is a valid point? 

 Also, ""COMET"" avoids the same letters? 

 So let me reconsider:

 Guess with ""COMET"": 
   Pattern: C O M E T
   E is in position 4? So we test E at position 4? 
   And we test O at position 2? M at position 3? T at position 5?

 So if E is not at position 4? then we know it must be in position either 2 or 3? Because the word has E somewhere? And we already know it cannot be in position 5? Then next guess? But we avoid having tested more letters? 

 Alternatively, if we use ""CHEST"", we test E at position 3? So if it hits? then we know? 

 But testing O? which is a vowel? might reveal if the word has O? 

 Since we haven't tested any vowel except E? And E we know? Then O? is common? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""COMET"" to test O? 

 Let me also note: the word might have vowels? So testing O? is valuable? 

 Alternative? ""COPED""? but has D? and E? Also, avoids R,A,N? 

 But I think ""COMET"" is a common word? 

 Therefore, I choose ""COMET"".

 But wait: what about the letter M? Is it common? Not as common as S? But I think for now? 

 Also, note: T at the end? We have not tested T? 

 So ""COMET"" and ""CHEST"" both test T?

 However, ""CHEST"" tests S? which is more common than M? 

 But ""COMET"" tests O? which is a vowel? 

 So if I must choose? I'm leaning toward ""COMET"" to include a vowel? 

 Alternatively, another word: ""COVES""? Ends with S? E at position 4? But O? And V? 

 Anyway? 

 After reconsidering? I think using a word that introduces a vowel? so ""COMET"" is chosen? 

 So second guess: comet.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** is correct and in position 1 → the word starts with ""C"".
- **E(-)** is in the word but not at position 5 → E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **R(x)**, **A(x)**, **N(x)** are absent → the word contains none of R, A, N.

My strategy for the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" (fixed position).
- Must include ""E"" in position 2, 3, or 4 to test its location.
- Avoid R, A, N, and focus on new common consonants (e.g., T, M, S) and vowels (e.g., O, U) for better coverage.
- Prioritize words that test ""E"" in an untested position while introducing new vowels for maximal information.

Selected ""COMET"" because:
- Starts with ""C"" → tests fixed position.
- Places ""E"" in position 4 → checks if E fits there.
- Introduces ""O"" (vowel) and ""M"", ""T"" (common consonants) → expands coverage.
- Avoids R, A, N → complies with feedback.
- Valid 5-letter English word.

It does contain E, but E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters, we can think of the pattern: C _ _ _ _\n\n We must avoid the letters R, A, N. Also, E cannot be in the last position.\n\n We need to make a new guess that meets:\n - First letter C (since it\'s fixed).\n - Contains E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n - Does not contain R, A, N.\n - The word must be a valid English word.\n\n Additionally, to maximize information, we can try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R, A, N are out. So remaining letters from common ones might be: \n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n Vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already known but we have to place it).\n\n However note: E is already confirmed present, but we have not used O, U, I, etc.\n\n We can try to include a new vowel and some consonants that are common.\n\n Considering the pattern: C _ _ _ _\n\n We have to include E somewhere not at the end? Actually, the feedback only says E is not in position 5, so it could be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, wait: the word is C _ _ _ _ and the E we know is present but not in the position we placed it (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2-4? Actually, no: the feedback for E is ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. Since we placed it in position 5, that means it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in one of positions 1-4? But position 1 is C? So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Therefore, the word has the form: C [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] and the E is in one of the middle three positions.\n\n Since we have limited tries, let\'s try to fix the E in a different position and use common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Avoided letters: R, A, N.\n\n Commonly used letters: We can try S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that start with C, have an E, and avoid R, A, N.\n\n Some examples:\n - ""CHASE"" -> but contains A -> avoid.\n - ""CRATE"" -> contains R -> avoid.\n - ""CLOSE"" -> but O and S are new? and it ends with E? But we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at the end.\n - Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Options:\n - Position 2: CE... words: e.g., ""CEDAR"" -> contains A -> bad.\n   - ""CELEB"" -> not 5 letters? Also contains L and B, but is it valid? Not common. Let\'s look for standard words.\n - Position 3: C _ E ... words: e.g., ""CHEST"", but E is in position 3? So word: C H E S T -> has H, E, S, T. And ends with T? Let\'s check: we need E not at the end? Here E is at position 3? Then we can use ""CHEST"". But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is not at the end? So it\'s okay to have E in position 3? Also, the first letter is C, so matching condition? However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? Actually: C H E S T -> position 2 is H, position 3 is E? Then position 4 is S, position 5 is T? That\'s fine? The E is in position 3? So not at the end? So acceptable? And it avoids R, A, N? Letters: C, H, E, S, T -> H, S, T are new.\n\n - Another option: Position 4: C _ _ E ... words: e.g., ""COMET"" -> O, M, E, T? And E is at position 4? Then the last letter is T? That avoids A, R, N? And E at position 4 is acceptable? So ""COMET"" would be: C O M E T.\n\n But note: we don\'t know which of these is better? Also, we are allowed to reuse E? But E is known to be in the word? So we can include it? Actually, we must include E? Because it\'s present? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word? So we must include E? So every guess must include E? Actually, not necessarily? Because we might guess E again? But we already know E is present? So we don\'t have to? However, to narrow down we might want to? But alternatively, we could ignore E for one guess? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E must be in positions 2-4? So perhaps we should include E in our next guess? That way we can get its position.\n\n Since we have to test E\'s position? Therefore, including E in the second guess is beneficial.\n\n Let me compare two words: ""CHEST"" and ""COMET"". \n CHEST: C H E S T -> letters: E is in position 3? So if we get feedback on E, we know if it\'s correct at position 3? Or if it\'s in the word but not there? Then it must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have only one E? Actually, the word might have multiple E\'s? But so far we don\'t know? The feedback was for one E? And we have only one E? But in the secret word, there could be more? But we don\'t know? The feedback only told us about the E we guessed: that it\'s present but not in position 5? It doesn\'t tell us if there are more? Since we only guessed one E? So it might be that the word has one E? Or more? But we don\'t know? \n\n However, note: the feedback symbol: a \'-\' means the letter is present but in the wrong position? And for multiple same letters? It gets complicated? But the rules didn\'t specify? But in standard Wordle, if there is a duplicate? Actually, let\'s assume the standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times? Then the feedback will account for it? But in our case, we don\'t have duplicates in the first guess? So let\'s proceed.\n\n We can try both? But I need to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we might try a word that doesn\'t put E in the same position? Or vary for maximum new letter coverage? \n\n But note: we must keep the first letter C? So our second guess must start with C? Because we know C is correct at position 1? So we should keep it? Therefore, we don\'t change that?\n\n So yes: the second guess must be a word starting with C? And containing E somewhere? And avoiding R, A, N? So only positions 2 to 5 can be filled with letters that are not R, A, N? And we have to include E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And the last letter cannot be E? Because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: what if the word has E at position 5 and also at another? But note: we were told that the E we placed in position 5 got a ""-"", meaning one E exists? But if the word had E at position 5 and also at another? Then the E we placed in position 5? Well, usually the rules: if there is one E and we placed it in position 5? But the E might be at position, say, 2? Then we get a \'-\' for E at position 5? But if there were two E\'s? Then we might get a \'-\' for that E? And a correct for the other? Etc? \n\n However, to avoid complications? And since we don\'t know? We\'ll assume we have at least one E? And its position is in 2,3,4? So position 5 must be a non-E? And indeed? The feedback says the letter at position 5? The E? Is not correct? Meaning that there might be another E elsewhere? But we\'ll find out? \n\n So back to constructing the second guess:\n\n Let me also note: we have not tested many consonants? So we can try a word that introduces new common consonants? Like T, L, M, S, etc? \n\n The word ""CHEST"": \n   C H E S T\n   Letters: C, H, E, S, T? \n   New letters: H, S, T? \n   We already know C is correct at position 1? And E is present? So we can test whether E is at position 3? And test H at position 2? S at position 4? T at position 5?\n\n The word ""COMET"": \n   C O M E T\n   Letters: C, O, M, E, T? \n   New letters: O, M, T? \n\n Which is better? \n\n Additionally, we must avoid R, A, N? Both words avoid them? So both valid.\n\n But note that T might be a common ending? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? while ""COMET"" also ends with T? But also, ""CHEST"" has S? which is a common letter? \n\n Actually, let me think of other words? \n - C with E in position 2: ""CEILS"" -> but CE is at 1 and 2? But then? Also, not common? \n   Or ""CEDIS""? Contains D? But not common? \n   Also, ""CELEB"" is not valid? \n\n So alternative? \n   Let me think of C with E at position 2: \n      ""CELLO"" -> starts C E L L O? But has L and O? But note: avoiding R, A, N? Okay? But ""CELLO"" means we put E at position 2? and we guess L in positions 3 and 4? And O at 5? Might not be ideal? But let\'s see? \n   Actually, ""CELTS"" -> C E L T S? Also a word? \n\n But I am considering that the feedback for the first guess already told us E is not at position 5? But we don\'t know about other positions? By putting E at position 2? We test if E is at position 2? Similarly, by putting it at position 3? we test that? \n\n Since we have to find the E\'s position? And we have no preference? So we might choose a word that uses new letters? \n\n However, note that we have limited tries? And we want to maximize the information? So using a word that contains several new letters? and possibly in common positions? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""CHEST"" because it uses H, S, T? which are very common? \n\n Also, we can try ""CLOSE""? But ""CLOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is wrong? Because E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? So ""CLOSE"" would be invalid? because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: in ""CLOSE""? the E is at position 5? and we know E cannot be at position 5? So why waste a guess? We can avoid that? \n\n Actually, we should avoid putting E at position 5? because we know it\'s not correct? Similarly, we should not put E at the end? \n\n Therefore, ""CHEST"" is good? E is in position 3? \n\n Alternatively, we could try ""CLEAR""? But CLEAR contains A? which we know is absent? So invalid? \n\n So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? \n\n Or another word: ""CUBES""? But E is in position 4? And U, B, S? Also avoids R, A, N? \n\n But ""CUBES"": ends with S? But E is in position 4? \n\n Both are valid? \n\n It\'s arbitrary? So I\'ll go with ""CHEST""? \n\n But note: let me check that the word ""CHEST"" exists? It\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, I guess: chest\n\n But wait: what if we want to test E in a different position? We don\'t want to fix in one spot? We are trying to determine the position? So if we put E in position 2? Then we get information? \n\n Actually, we have no constraint? So we can pick any? \n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses E in a position that we haven\'t tried? And that covers more vowels? \n\n Since E is the only vowel we have? And the word must have other vowels? Or not? But we don\'t know? \n\n But we don\'t know? We have not tested O, U, I? Etc? \n\n Therefore, using a word that uses O? might be helpful? For example, ""COMET"" has the vowel O? and E? \n\n Whereas ""CHEST"" has no other vowel? Only E? \n\n Therefore, ""COMET"" gives information about O? Which is a common vowel? And M? So that might be more informative? \n\n But note: the unknown letters? Using O? might be better? \n\n That is a valid point? \n\n Also, ""COMET"" avoids the same letters? \n\n So let me reconsider:\n\n Guess with ""COMET"": \n   Pattern: C O M E T\n   E is in position 4? So we test E at position 4? \n   And we test O at position 2? M at position 3? T at position 5?\n\n So if E is not at position 4? then we know it must be in position either 2 or 3? Because the word has E somewhere? And we already know it cannot be in position 5? Then next guess? But we avoid having tested more letters? \n\n Alternatively, if we use ""CHEST"", we test E at position 3? So if it hits? then we know? \n\n But testing O? which is a vowel? might reveal if the word has O? \n\n Since we haven\'t tested any vowel except E? And E we know? Then O? is common? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""COMET"" to test O? \n\n Let me also note: the word might have vowels? So testing O? is valuable? \n\n Alternative? ""COPED""? but has D? and E? Also, avoids R,A,N? \n\n But I think ""COMET"" is a common word? \n\n Therefore, I choose ""COMET"".\n\n But wait: what about the letter M? Is it common? Not as common as S? But I think for now? \n\n Also, note: T at the end? We have not tested T? \n\n So ""COMET"" and ""CHEST"" both test T?\n\n However, ""CHEST"" tests S? which is more common than M? \n\n But ""COMET"" tests O? which is a vowel? \n\n So if I must choose? I\'m leaning toward ""COMET"" to include a vowel? \n\n Alternatively, another word: ""COVES""? Ends with S? E at position 4? But O? And V? \n\n Anyway? \n\n After reconsidering? I think using a word that introduces a vowel? so ""COMET"" is chosen? \n\n So second guess: comet.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C(✓)** is correct and in position 1 → the word starts with ""C"".\n- **E(-)** is in the word but not at position 5 → E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- **R(x)**, **A(x)**, **N(x)** are absent → the word contains none of R, A, N.\n\nMy strategy for the second guess:\n- Must start with ""C"" (fixed position).\n- Must include ""E"" in position 2, 3, or 4 to test its location.\n- Avoid R, A, N, and focus on new common consonants (e.g., T, M, S) and vowels (e.g., O, U) for better coverage.\n- Prioritize words that test ""E"" in an untested position while introducing new vowels for maximal information.\n\nSelected ""COMET"" because:\n- Starts with ""C"" → tests fixed position.\n- Places ""E"" in position 4 → checks if E fits there.\n- Introduces ""O"" (vowel) and ""M"", ""T"" (common consonants) → expands coverage.\n- Avoids R, A, N → complies with feedback.\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>comet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R, A, N are absent.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""comet"" → C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)
- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).
- O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
- M is absent (so the word does not contain M).
- E is present but not in position 4 (because we placed it in position 4 and got a '-').
- T is correct and in position 5.

So now we know:
- The word is: C _ _ _ T
- The first letter is C, the last letter is T.
- The word contains E, but not in position 4 or 5 (since we tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""comet"", both got '-'). Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, O, M.

We also know that the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the middle three letters, with E in either position 2 or 3.

We have the pattern: C [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] T

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, N, O, M.
- One of letter1 or letter2 must be E (since E must be in position 2 or 3).

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. So we should try to use new letters to maximize information.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We must include E in position 2 or 3? Actually, we don't have to in the guess? But we know E is in the word? So we can include it to test its position? But we have two positions left for E: 2 and 3? So we can try to put E in one of them? Or we can try a word that doesn't have E? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is present? So we should use it? And we have two positions to test? So we can choose one? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? So we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2? Then if it's correct? we get a ✓? If not? then E must be in position 3? So we can get the position of E in this guess? 

So let's try to put E in position 2? Then the word would be: C E _ _ T

What words fit? And avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

Examples: 
- ""CELT"" is 4 letters? Not 5.
- ""CENTS"" → but N is absent? We cannot use N? Because N is absent? So no.
- ""CELTS"" → but S is at the end? But we have T at the end? So the word would be C E L T S? But then the last letter is S? but we know the last letter is T? So that doesn't fit? Because we have T at position 5? So the word must end with T? So the pattern is C E _ _ T? 

So we need a 5-letter word: C E ? ? T? 

Valid words: 
- ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? But that has E at position 3? Not 2? 
  Actually, ""CLEFT"" is C L E F T → positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:F, 5:T? So that doesn't put E at position 2? 

We need E at position 2: so the word is C E ? ? T? 

Examples: 
- ""CEILT"" → not a word.
- ""CENT"" → too short.
- ""CESTI"" → not common? 
- ""CEZVE"" → not common? 

Actually, common words: 
- ""CHEWY"" → but doesn't end with T? 
- We need to end with T? 

So what about: 
- ""CHEAT"" → but A is absent? and we cannot use A? 
- ""CHEST"" → but we have S and T? But ""CHEST"" is C H E S T? Then the last letter is T? So that fits? But we have E at position 3? Not 2? 

Wait, we need E at position 2? 

Let me think: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: ?
  Position 5: T

Words: 
- ""CABET"" → not a word? 
- ""CUBIT"" → but U? and B? and I? and T? But E? We don't have E? 
- ""CEBID"" → not common? 
- ""CEDED"" → has D? but E at position 2? and then D? and E? but we have to avoid? Also, the last letter is D? not T? 

Actually, I cannot think of a common English word that is C E ? ? T? 

Therefore, maybe E is not in position 2? Then it must be in position 3? 

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3? 

Pattern: C _ E _ T? 

Examples: 
- ""CHEST"" → C H E S T? This is a common word? 
  But we have already used H? and S? in the context? But we haven't tested H and S? So we can use? 
  However, note: in the second guess we used ""comet"" and we know O and M are absent? But H and S are new? 

But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? and ends with T? So it fits the pattern? 

But we don't know if E is at position 3? So we can test it? 

Also, we can test H at position 2? and S at position 4? 

But what if E is actually at position 2? Then we would get a different feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 3? and also tests other common letters? 

But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

So ""CHEST"" is: C H E S T? 
  - H is new? 
  - S is new? 
  - E at position 3? 
  - T at position 5? (which we know is correct? so we are testing the middle? 

But we already know T is at position 5? so we don't need to test T? 

But we are using T? because it's fixed? 

So let's consider: if we guess ""CHEST"", what feedback can we get? 

Possible outcomes for E: 
  - If E is at position 3? then we get E(✓)? 
  - If E is at position 2? then we get E(-) for position 3? and then we know E is at position 2? 

But we don't have a word with E at position 2? So if we get E(-) for position 3? then we know E must be at position 2? and then we can try to find a word for that? 

But we couldn't find a common word with E at position 2? So that might be a problem? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is present? So we should include it? 

But if we don't include E? then we might get information about other letters? and then we can deduce E's position? 

For example, we can try a word that has new letters? and doesn't have E? Then if we get no E? we know that E is not in the positions we didn't test? But we have only two positions: 2 and 3? 

But if we don't include E? and the word has E? then we might get a '-' for E? but we don't know where? because we didn't put E? 

Actually, we cannot get a '-' for E if we don't guess E? 

So if we guess a word without E? and the word has E? then we won't get any indication? because we didn't guess E? 

So that would be bad? Because we wouldn't know about the presence? But we already know E is present? So we don't need to? 

But we need to find its position? 

So if we don't guess E? we don't get information about its position? 

Therefore, we must include E in the guess? to test position 2 or 3? 

So we have to choose between testing position 2 or 3? 

But we couldn't find a common word with E at position 2? So we must test position 3? 

Therefore, I'll choose a word with E at position 3? 

Pattern: C _ E _ T? 

We need to fill positions 2 and 4? 

Available letters: avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y? 

We can try: 
  - ""CHEST"": C H E S T? 
  - ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? 
  - ""CREST"": but R is absent? 
  - ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with T? 
  - ""CLEPT"": C L E P T? 
  - ""CHERT"": but R? 
  - ""CUEST"": not common? 

So valid options: 
  - ""CHEST"" (H at 2, S at 4)
  - ""CLEFT"" (L at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CLEPT"" (L at 2, P at 4)

Which one to choose? We want to maximize new letter coverage? 

We haven't used: 
  From common: S, H, L, F, P, D, G, etc. 

""CHEST"" uses H and S? 
""CLEFT"" uses L and F? 
""CLEPT"" uses L and P? 

S is a very common letter? So ""CHEST"" might be better? 

Also, H is common? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? So we can choose ""CHEST""? 

But wait: what if the word is ""CHEST""? Then we get it? 

But let's see: if we guess ""CHEST"", and the word is not ""CHEST"", what feedback? 

For example, if E is at position 2? then we would get: 
  C(✓) H(-) because H is not in the word? or if H is in the word but not at position 2? But we don't know? 
  Actually, we don't know if H is in the word? 

But we are testing H at position 2? and S at position 4? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common? 

But I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice? 

But note: we already know T is at position 5? so we don't need to test T? But we are using it? because it's fixed? 

So I'll go with ""CHEST"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""CLEFT""? Then we would miss? 

But we are trying to get information? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use T? because T is already known? But we have to use T? because the word ends with T? 

No, we don't have to? We can choose a word that doesn't have T? but then we wouldn't be testing the known T? 

But we know T is at position 5? so if we don't put T at position 5? then we might get a '-' for T? if it's present elsewhere? but we know it's at position 5? so we should put T at position 5? to confirm? 

Actually, we already confirmed T at position 5? in the second guess? So we don't need to? But it's fixed? 

So we can use the pattern? 

Therefore, I choose ""CHEST"" as the third guess. 

But let me check: 
  Guess: C H E S T

If the word is ""CHEST"", we win? 
If not, we get feedback on H, E, S? 

But note: we know E is present? and we are testing it at position 3? 

So if we get E(✓)? then we know E is at position 3? and then we only need to find the letters at 2 and 4? 

If we get E(-)? then E is not at position 3? so it must be at position 2? 

But then we have to find a word with E at position 2? and we had trouble? 

But if E is at position 2? then the word is C E ? ? T? 

And we need a valid word? 

Let me think again: 
  C E ? ? T? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? 
  - ""CESTI"" → not common? 
  - ""CEZVE"" → not common? 
  - ""CETYL"" → C E T Y L? but that's 5 letters? C E T Y L? but then the last letter is L? not T? 

Actually, I found: 
  - ""CERTY"" is not valid? 
  - ""CESTI"" is not in common use? 
  - ""CELEB"" is not 5? 
  - ""CETUS"" → but ends with S? 

Wait, what about ""CLEPT""? But that has E at position 3? 

I think there are no common words with E at position 2 and ending with T? 

Therefore, it is more likely that E is at position 3? 

So we can assume that? 

But we must test? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 2? but not ending with T? But we know the word ends with T? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must test position 3? 

So I'll go with ""CHEST"". 

But let me see if there is a word with E at position 2? 

After research? I recall: 
  - ""DEITY"" → but doesn't start with C? 
  - ""LEGIT"" → not starting with C? 

For C: 
  - ""CETUS"" → C E T U S? but then the last letter is S? not T? 
  - ""CESTA"" → but A is absent? 
  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? 

So I think it's safe to assume E is at position 3? 

Therefore, we guess ""CHEST"". 

But note: we have not tested H and S? So if the word is not ""CHEST"", we get information about H and S? 

So let's do that. 

Third guess: chest

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - R(x), A(x), N(x): Absent from the word.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""comet""**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - O(x), M(x): Absent from the word.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 4.  
  - T(✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 5: **T**  
   The word pattern is: `C _ _ _ T`.  
2. **Confirmed Present Letter**:  
   - **E** is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). It must be in position 2 or 3.  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - R, A, N, O, M (cannot appear in the word).  
4. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 need to be solved.  
   - Position 2 and 3: One of these must be **E**.  
   - Position 4: A new consonant (not R, A, N, O, M).  
5. **Untested Letters**:  
   - Focus on common consonants (e.g., S, L, D, P, B) and vowels (e.g., I, U) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test E in Position 3**: Since E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 2 is hard to test (few valid words like `C E _ _ T` exist), prioritize placing E in position 3 to verify its location.  
- **Cover New Letters**: Use untested common letters (e.g., S, H, L) to gather more data.  
- **Valid Word Choice**: ""CHEST"" fits:  
  - `C H E S T` tests E in position 3.  
  - Introduces new consonants: **H** (position 2) and **S** (position 4).  
  - Avoids absent letters (R, A, N, O, M).  

If E is correct in position 3, we lock it. If not, E must be in position 2 (though rare, this would require re-evaluation). Feedback on H and S will also reveal their presence/absence.

<guess>chest</guess>",chest,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R, A, N are absent.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""comet"" → C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)
- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).
- O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
- M is absent (so the word does not contain M).
- E is present but not in position 4 (because we placed it in position 4 and got a '-').
- T is correct and in position 5.

So now we know:
- The word is: C _ _ _ T
- The first letter is C, the last letter is T.
- The word contains E, but not in position 4 or 5 (since we tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""comet"", both got '-'). Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, O, M.

We also know that the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the middle three letters, with E in either position 2 or 3.

We have the pattern: C [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] T

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, N, O, M.
- One of letter1 or letter2 must be E (since E must be in position 2 or 3).

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. So we should try to use new letters to maximize information.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We must include E in position 2 or 3? Actually, we don't have to in the guess? But we know E is in the word? So we can include it to test its position? But we have two positions left for E: 2 and 3? So we can try to put E in one of them? Or we can try a word that doesn't have E? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is present? So we should use it? And we have two positions to test? So we can choose one? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? So we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2? Then if it's correct? we get a ✓? If not? then E must be in position 3? So we can get the position of E in this guess? 

So let's try to put E in position 2? Then the word would be: C E _ _ T

What words fit? And avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

Examples: 
- ""CELT"" is 4 letters? Not 5.
- ""CENTS"" → but N is absent? We cannot use N? Because N is absent? So no.
- ""CELTS"" → but S is at the end? But we have T at the end? So the word would be C E L T S? But then the last letter is S? but we know the last letter is T? So that doesn't fit? Because we have T at position 5? So the word must end with T? So the pattern is C E _ _ T? 

So we need a 5-letter word: C E ? ? T? 

Valid words: 
- ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? But that has E at position 3? Not 2? 
  Actually, ""CLEFT"" is C L E F T → positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:F, 5:T? So that doesn't put E at position 2? 

We need E at position 2: so the word is C E ? ? T? 

Examples: 
- ""CEILT"" → not a word.
- ""CENT"" → too short.
- ""CESTI"" → not common? 
- ""CEZVE"" → not common? 

Actually, common words: 
- ""CHEWY"" → but doesn't end with T? 
- We need to end with T? 

So what about: 
- ""CHEAT"" → but A is absent? and we cannot use A? 
- ""CHEST"" → but we have S and T? But ""CHEST"" is C H E S T? Then the last letter is T? So that fits? But we have E at position 3? Not 2? 

Wait, we need E at position 2? 

Let me think: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: ?
  Position 5: T

Words: 
- ""CABET"" → not a word? 
- ""CUBIT"" → but U? and B? and I? and T? But E? We don't have E? 
- ""CEBID"" → not common? 
- ""CEDED"" → has D? but E at position 2? and then D? and E? but we have to avoid? Also, the last letter is D? not T? 

Actually, I cannot think of a common English word that is C E ? ? T? 

Therefore, maybe E is not in position 2? Then it must be in position 3? 

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3? 

Pattern: C _ E _ T? 

Examples: 
- ""CHEST"" → C H E S T? This is a common word? 
  But we have already used H? and S? in the context? But we haven't tested H and S? So we can use? 
  However, note: in the second guess we used ""comet"" and we know O and M are absent? But H and S are new? 

But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? and ends with T? So it fits the pattern? 

But we don't know if E is at position 3? So we can test it? 

Also, we can test H at position 2? and S at position 4? 

But what if E is actually at position 2? Then we would get a different feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 3? and also tests other common letters? 

But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

So ""CHEST"" is: C H E S T? 
  - H is new? 
  - S is new? 
  - E at position 3? 
  - T at position 5? (which we know is correct? so we are testing the middle? 

But we already know T is at position 5? so we don't need to test T? 

But we are using T? because it's fixed? 

So let's consider: if we guess ""CHEST"", what feedback can we get? 

Possible outcomes for E: 
  - If E is at position 3? then we get E(✓)? 
  - If E is at position 2? then we get E(-) for position 3? and then we know E is at position 2? 

But we don't have a word with E at position 2? So if we get E(-) for position 3? then we know E must be at position 2? and then we can try to find a word for that? 

But we couldn't find a common word with E at position 2? So that might be a problem? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is present? So we should include it? 

But if we don't include E? then we might get information about other letters? and then we can deduce E's position? 

For example, we can try a word that has new letters? and doesn't have E? Then if we get no E? we know that E is not in the positions we didn't test? But we have only two positions: 2 and 3? 

But if we don't include E? and the word has E? then we might get a '-' for E? but we don't know where? because we didn't put E? 

Actually, we cannot get a '-' for E if we don't guess E? 

So if we guess a word without E? and the word has E? then we won't get any indication? because we didn't guess E? 

So that would be bad? Because we wouldn't know about the presence? But we already know E is present? So we don't need to? 

But we need to find its position? 

So if we don't guess E? we don't get information about its position? 

Therefore, we must include E in the guess? to test position 2 or 3? 

So we have to choose between testing position 2 or 3? 

But we couldn't find a common word with E at position 2? So we must test position 3? 

Therefore, I'll choose a word with E at position 3? 

Pattern: C _ E _ T? 

We need to fill positions 2 and 4? 

Available letters: avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y? 

We can try: 
  - ""CHEST"": C H E S T? 
  - ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? 
  - ""CREST"": but R is absent? 
  - ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with T? 
  - ""CLEPT"": C L E P T? 
  - ""CHERT"": but R? 
  - ""CUEST"": not common? 

So valid options: 
  - ""CHEST"" (H at 2, S at 4)
  - ""CLEFT"" (L at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CLEPT"" (L at 2, P at 4)

Which one to choose? We want to maximize new letter coverage? 

We haven't used: 
  From common: S, H, L, F, P, D, G, etc. 

""CHEST"" uses H and S? 
""CLEFT"" uses L and F? 
""CLEPT"" uses L and P? 

S is a very common letter? So ""CHEST"" might be better? 

Also, H is common? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? So we can choose ""CHEST""? 

But wait: what if the word is ""CHEST""? Then we get it? 

But let's see: if we guess ""CHEST"", and the word is not ""CHEST"", what feedback? 

For example, if E is at position 2? then we would get: 
  C(✓) H(-) because H is not in the word? or if H is in the word but not at position 2? But we don't know? 
  Actually, we don't know if H is in the word? 

But we are testing H at position 2? and S at position 4? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common? 

But I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice? 

But note: we already know T is at position 5? so we don't need to test T? But we are using it? because it's fixed? 

So I'll go with ""CHEST"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""CLEFT""? Then we would miss? 

But we are trying to get information? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use T? because T is already known? But we have to use T? because the word ends with T? 

No, we don't have to? We can choose a word that doesn't have T? but then we wouldn't be testing the known T? 

But we know T is at position 5? so if we don't put T at position 5? then we might get a '-' for T? if it's present elsewhere? but we know it's at position 5? so we should put T at position 5? to confirm? 

Actually, we already confirmed T at position 5? in the second guess? So we don't need to? But it's fixed? 

So we can use the pattern? 

Therefore, I choose ""CHEST"" as the third guess. 

But let me check: 
  Guess: C H E S T

If the word is ""CHEST"", we win? 
If not, we get feedback on H, E, S? 

But note: we know E is present? and we are testing it at position 3? 

So if we get E(✓)? then we know E is at position 3? and then we only need to find the letters at 2 and 4? 

If we get E(-)? then E is not at position 3? so it must be at position 2? 

But then we have to find a word with E at position 2? and we had trouble? 

But if E is at position 2? then the word is C E ? ? T? 

And we need a valid word? 

Let me think again: 
  C E ? ? T? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? 
  - ""CESTI"" → not common? 
  - ""CEZVE"" → not common? 
  - ""CETYL"" → C E T Y L? but that's 5 letters? C E T Y L? but then the last letter is L? not T? 

Actually, I found: 
  - ""CERTY"" is not valid? 
  - ""CESTI"" is not in common use? 
  - ""CELEB"" is not 5? 
  - ""CETUS"" → but ends with S? 

Wait, what about ""CLEPT""? But that has E at position 3? 

I think there are no common words with E at position 2 and ending with T? 

Therefore, it is more likely that E is at position 3? 

So we can assume that? 

But we must test? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 2? but not ending with T? But we know the word ends with T? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must test position 3? 

So I'll go with ""CHEST"". 

But let me see if there is a word with E at position 2? 

After research? I recall: 
  - ""DEITY"" → but doesn't start with C? 
  - ""LEGIT"" → not starting with C? 

For C: 
  - ""CETUS"" → C E T U S? but then the last letter is S? not T? 
  - ""CESTA"" → but A is absent? 
  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? 

So I think it's safe to assume E is at position 3? 

Therefore, we guess ""CHEST"". 

But note: we have not tested H and S? So if the word is not ""CHEST"", we get information about H and S? 

So let's do that.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include a mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""SOARE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has two vowels and three common consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It covers the vowels A and E, which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good starter (meaning: the accumulated earnings on an investment) but it has a double use of 'R' and we want to cover more distinct letters.

 However, note that the rules require a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll start with ""CRANE"".I am starting my first guess. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gain. The best starters typically include a mix of common vowels and consonants to help identify letters and their positions.

For my first guess, I will choose **""CRANE""**. This word is effective because:
- It contains two vowels (A and E), which are frequent in English words.
- It uses three common consonants (C, R, N) that appear often in 5-letter words.
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five different characters at once.

After this guess, the feedback will reveal which letters are present and/or correctly placed, guiding my next move.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all (x).
 - A is not in the word at all (x).
 - N is not in the word at all (x).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present somewhere, but not in position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - R, A, N are absent from the word entirely.
 - E is present but not in the 5th position (since the guess had E in position 5).

 The word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N. It does contain E, but E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we can think of the pattern: C _ _ _ _

 We must avoid the letters R, A, N. Also, E cannot be in the last position.

 We need to make a new guess that meets:
 - First letter C (since it's fixed).
 - Contains E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
 - Does not contain R, A, N.
 - The word must be a valid English word.

 Additionally, to maximize information, we can try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

 Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R, A, N are out. So remaining letters from common ones might be: 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already known but we have to place it).

 However note: E is already confirmed present, but we have not used O, U, I, etc.

 We can try to include a new vowel and some consonants that are common.

 Considering the pattern: C _ _ _ _

 We have to include E somewhere not at the end? Actually, the feedback only says E is not in position 5, so it could be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, wait: the word is C _ _ _ _ and the E we know is present but not in the position we placed it (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2-4? Actually, no: the feedback for E is ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Since we placed it in position 5, that means it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in one of positions 1-4? But position 1 is C? So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, the word has the form: C [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] and the E is in one of the middle three positions.

 Since we have limited tries, let's try to fix the E in a different position and use common letters we haven't tried.

 Avoided letters: R, A, N.

 Commonly used letters: We can try S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some examples:
 - ""CHASE"" -> but contains A -> avoid.
 - ""CRATE"" -> contains R -> avoid.
 - ""CLOSE"" -> but O and S are new? and it ends with E? But we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at the end.
 - Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Options:
 - Position 2: CE... words: e.g., ""CEDAR"" -> contains A -> bad.
   - ""CELEB"" -> not 5 letters? Also contains L and B, but is it valid? Not common. Let's look for standard words.
 - Position 3: C _ E ... words: e.g., ""CHEST"", but E is in position 3? So word: C H E S T -> has H, E, S, T. And ends with T? Let's check: we need E not at the end? Here E is at position 3? Then we can use ""CHEST"". But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is not at the end? So it's okay to have E in position 3? Also, the first letter is C, so matching condition? However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? Actually: C H E S T -> position 2 is H, position 3 is E? Then position 4 is S, position 5 is T? That's fine? The E is in position 3? So not at the end? So acceptable? And it avoids R, A, N? Letters: C, H, E, S, T -> H, S, T are new.

 - Another option: Position 4: C _ _ E ... words: e.g., ""COMET"" -> O, M, E, T? And E is at position 4? Then the last letter is T? That avoids A, R, N? And E at position 4 is acceptable? So ""COMET"" would be: C O M E T.

 But note: we don't know which of these is better? Also, we are allowed to reuse E? But E is known to be in the word? So we can include it? Actually, we must include E? Because it's present? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word? So we must include E? So every guess must include E? Actually, not necessarily? Because we might guess E again? But we already know E is present? So we don't have to? However, to narrow down we might want to? But alternatively, we could ignore E for one guess? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E must be in positions 2-4? So perhaps we should include E in our next guess? That way we can get its position.

 Since we have to test E's position? Therefore, including E in the second guess is beneficial.

 Let me compare two words: ""CHEST"" and ""COMET"". 
 CHEST: C H E S T -> letters: E is in position 3? So if we get feedback on E, we know if it's correct at position 3? Or if it's in the word but not there? Then it must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have only one E? Actually, the word might have multiple E's? But so far we don't know? The feedback was for one E? And we have only one E? But in the secret word, there could be more? But we don't know? The feedback only told us about the E we guessed: that it's present but not in position 5? It doesn't tell us if there are more? Since we only guessed one E? So it might be that the word has one E? Or more? But we don't know? 

 However, note: the feedback symbol: a '-' means the letter is present but in the wrong position? And for multiple same letters? It gets complicated? But the rules didn't specify? But in standard Wordle, if there is a duplicate? Actually, let's assume the standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times? Then the feedback will account for it? But in our case, we don't have duplicates in the first guess? So let's proceed.

 We can try both? But I need to choose one.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that doesn't put E in the same position? Or vary for maximum new letter coverage? 

 But note: we must keep the first letter C? So our second guess must start with C? Because we know C is correct at position 1? So we should keep it? Therefore, we don't change that?

 So yes: the second guess must be a word starting with C? And containing E somewhere? And avoiding R, A, N? So only positions 2 to 5 can be filled with letters that are not R, A, N? And we have to include E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And the last letter cannot be E? Because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: what if the word has E at position 5 and also at another? But note: we were told that the E we placed in position 5 got a ""-"", meaning one E exists? But if the word had E at position 5 and also at another? Then the E we placed in position 5? Well, usually the rules: if there is one E and we placed it in position 5? But the E might be at position, say, 2? Then we get a '-' for E at position 5? But if there were two E's? Then we might get a '-' for that E? And a correct for the other? Etc? 

 However, to avoid complications? And since we don't know? We'll assume we have at least one E? And its position is in 2,3,4? So position 5 must be a non-E? And indeed? The feedback says the letter at position 5? The E? Is not correct? Meaning that there might be another E elsewhere? But we'll find out? 

 So back to constructing the second guess:

 Let me also note: we have not tested many consonants? So we can try a word that introduces new common consonants? Like T, L, M, S, etc? 

 The word ""CHEST"": 
   C H E S T
   Letters: C, H, E, S, T? 
   New letters: H, S, T? 
   We already know C is correct at position 1? And E is present? So we can test whether E is at position 3? And test H at position 2? S at position 4? T at position 5?

 The word ""COMET"": 
   C O M E T
   Letters: C, O, M, E, T? 
   New letters: O, M, T? 

 Which is better? 

 Additionally, we must avoid R, A, N? Both words avoid them? So both valid.

 But note that T might be a common ending? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? while ""COMET"" also ends with T? But also, ""CHEST"" has S? which is a common letter? 

 Actually, let me think of other words? 
 - C with E in position 2: ""CEILS"" -> but CE is at 1 and 2? But then? Also, not common? 
   Or ""CEDIS""? Contains D? But not common? 
   Also, ""CELEB"" is not valid? 

 So alternative? 
   Let me think of C with E at position 2: 
      ""CELLO"" -> starts C E L L O? But has L and O? But note: avoiding R, A, N? Okay? But ""CELLO"" means we put E at position 2? and we guess L in positions 3 and 4? And O at 5? Might not be ideal? But let's see? 
   Actually, ""CELTS"" -> C E L T S? Also a word? 

 But I am considering that the feedback for the first guess already told us E is not at position 5? But we don't know about other positions? By putting E at position 2? We test if E is at position 2? Similarly, by putting it at position 3? we test that? 

 Since we have to find the E's position? And we have no preference? So we might choose a word that uses new letters? 

 However, note that we have limited tries? And we want to maximize the information? So using a word that contains several new letters? and possibly in common positions? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""CHEST"" because it uses H, S, T? which are very common? 

 Also, we can try ""CLOSE""? But ""CLOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is wrong? Because E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? So ""CLOSE"" would be invalid? because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: in ""CLOSE""? the E is at position 5? and we know E cannot be at position 5? So why waste a guess? We can avoid that? 

 Actually, we should avoid putting E at position 5? because we know it's not correct? Similarly, we should not put E at the end? 

 Therefore, ""CHEST"" is good? E is in position 3? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""CLEAR""? But CLEAR contains A? which we know is absent? So invalid? 

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? 

 Or another word: ""CUBES""? But E is in position 4? And U, B, S? Also avoids R, A, N? 

 But ""CUBES"": ends with S? But E is in position 4? 

 Both are valid? 

 It's arbitrary? So I'll go with ""CHEST""? 

 But note: let me check that the word ""CHEST"" exists? It's valid.

 Therefore, I guess: chest

 But wait: what if we want to test E in a different position? We don't want to fix in one spot? We are trying to determine the position? So if we put E in position 2? Then we get information? 

 Actually, we have no constraint? So we can pick any? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses E in a position that we haven't tried? And that covers more vowels? 

 Since E is the only vowel we have? And the word must have other vowels? Or not? But we don't know? 

 But we don't know? We have not tested O, U, I? Etc? 

 Therefore, using a word that uses O? might be helpful? For example, ""COMET"" has the vowel O? and E? 

 Whereas ""CHEST"" has no other vowel? Only E? 

 Therefore, ""COMET"" gives information about O? Which is a common vowel? And M? So that might be more informative? 

 But note: the unknown letters? Using O? might be better? 

 That is a valid point? 

 Also, ""COMET"" avoids the same letters? 

 So let me reconsider:

 Guess with ""COMET"": 
   Pattern: C O M E T
   E is in position 4? So we test E at position 4? 
   And we test O at position 2? M at position 3? T at position 5?

 So if E is not at position 4? then we know it must be in position either 2 or 3? Because the word has E somewhere? And we already know it cannot be in position 5? Then next guess? But we avoid having tested more letters? 

 Alternatively, if we use ""CHEST"", we test E at position 3? So if it hits? then we know? 

 But testing O? which is a vowel? might reveal if the word has O? 

 Since we haven't tested any vowel except E? And E we know? Then O? is common? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""COMET"" to test O? 

 Let me also note: the word might have vowels? So testing O? is valuable? 

 Alternative? ""COPED""? but has D? and E? Also, avoids R,A,N? 

 But I think ""COMET"" is a common word? 

 Therefore, I choose ""COMET"".

 But wait: what about the letter M? Is it common? Not as common as S? But I think for now? 

 Also, note: T at the end? We have not tested T? 

 So ""COMET"" and ""CHEST"" both test T?

 However, ""CHEST"" tests S? which is more common than M? 

 But ""COMET"" tests O? which is a vowel? 

 So if I must choose? I'm leaning toward ""COMET"" to include a vowel? 

 Alternatively, another word: ""COVES""? Ends with S? E at position 4? But O? And V? 

 Anyway? 

 After reconsidering? I think using a word that introduces a vowel? so ""COMET"" is chosen? 

 So second guess: comet.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C(✓)** is correct and in position 1 → the word starts with ""C"".
- **E(-)** is in the word but not at position 5 → E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **R(x)**, **A(x)**, **N(x)** are absent → the word contains none of R, A, N.

My strategy for the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" (fixed position).
- Must include ""E"" in position 2, 3, or 4 to test its location.
- Avoid R, A, N, and focus on new common consonants (e.g., T, M, S) and vowels (e.g., O, U) for better coverage.
- Prioritize words that test ""E"" in an untested position while introducing new vowels for maximal information.

Selected ""COMET"" because:
- Starts with ""C"" → tests fixed position.
- Places ""E"" in position 4 → checks if E fits there.
- Introduces ""O"" (vowel) and ""M"", ""T"" (common consonants) → expands coverage.
- Avoids R, A, N → complies with feedback.
- Valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>comet</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- C is correct and in position 1.
- R, A, N are absent.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""comet"" → C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)
- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).
- O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
- M is absent (so the word does not contain M).
- E is present but not in position 4 (because we placed it in position 4 and got a '-').
- T is correct and in position 5.

So now we know:
- The word is: C _ _ _ T
- The first letter is C, the last letter is T.
- The word contains E, but not in position 4 or 5 (since we tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""comet"", both got '-'). Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, O, M.

We also know that the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the middle three letters, with E in either position 2 or 3.

We have the pattern: C [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] T

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, N, O, M.
- One of letter1 or letter2 must be E (since E must be in position 2 or 3).

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. So we should try to use new letters to maximize information.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We must include E in position 2 or 3? Actually, we don't have to in the guess? But we know E is in the word? So we can include it to test its position? But we have two positions left for E: 2 and 3? So we can try to put E in one of them? Or we can try a word that doesn't have E? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is present? So we should use it? And we have two positions to test? So we can choose one? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? So we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2? Then if it's correct? we get a ✓? If not? then E must be in position 3? So we can get the position of E in this guess? 

So let's try to put E in position 2? Then the word would be: C E _ _ T

What words fit? And avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

Examples: 
- ""CELT"" is 4 letters? Not 5.
- ""CENTS"" → but N is absent? We cannot use N? Because N is absent? So no.
- ""CELTS"" → but S is at the end? But we have T at the end? So the word would be C E L T S? But then the last letter is S? but we know the last letter is T? So that doesn't fit? Because we have T at position 5? So the word must end with T? So the pattern is C E _ _ T? 

So we need a 5-letter word: C E ? ? T? 

Valid words: 
- ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? But that has E at position 3? Not 2? 
  Actually, ""CLEFT"" is C L E F T → positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:F, 5:T? So that doesn't put E at position 2? 

We need E at position 2: so the word is C E ? ? T? 

Examples: 
- ""CEILT"" → not a word.
- ""CENT"" → too short.
- ""CESTI"" → not common? 
- ""CEZVE"" → not common? 

Actually, common words: 
- ""CHEWY"" → but doesn't end with T? 
- We need to end with T? 

So what about: 
- ""CHEAT"" → but A is absent? and we cannot use A? 
- ""CHEST"" → but we have S and T? But ""CHEST"" is C H E S T? Then the last letter is T? So that fits? But we have E at position 3? Not 2? 

Wait, we need E at position 2? 

Let me think: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: ?
  Position 5: T

Words: 
- ""CABET"" → not a word? 
- ""CUBIT"" → but U? and B? and I? and T? But E? We don't have E? 
- ""CEBID"" → not common? 
- ""CEDED"" → has D? but E at position 2? and then D? and E? but we have to avoid? Also, the last letter is D? not T? 

Actually, I cannot think of a common English word that is C E ? ? T? 

Therefore, maybe E is not in position 2? Then it must be in position 3? 

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3? 

Pattern: C _ E _ T? 

Examples: 
- ""CHEST"" → C H E S T? This is a common word? 
  But we have already used H? and S? in the context? But we haven't tested H and S? So we can use? 
  However, note: in the second guess we used ""comet"" and we know O and M are absent? But H and S are new? 

But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? and ends with T? So it fits the pattern? 

But we don't know if E is at position 3? So we can test it? 

Also, we can test H at position 2? and S at position 4? 

But what if E is actually at position 2? Then we would get a different feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 3? and also tests other common letters? 

But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

So ""CHEST"" is: C H E S T? 
  - H is new? 
  - S is new? 
  - E at position 3? 
  - T at position 5? (which we know is correct? so we are testing the middle? 

But we already know T is at position 5? so we don't need to test T? 

But we are using T? because it's fixed? 

So let's consider: if we guess ""CHEST"", what feedback can we get? 

Possible outcomes for E: 
  - If E is at position 3? then we get E(✓)? 
  - If E is at position 2? then we get E(-) for position 3? and then we know E is at position 2? 

But we don't have a word with E at position 2? So if we get E(-) for position 3? then we know E must be at position 2? and then we can try to find a word for that? 

But we couldn't find a common word with E at position 2? So that might be a problem? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is present? So we should include it? 

But if we don't include E? then we might get information about other letters? and then we can deduce E's position? 

For example, we can try a word that has new letters? and doesn't have E? Then if we get no E? we know that E is not in the positions we didn't test? But we have only two positions: 2 and 3? 

But if we don't include E? and the word has E? then we might get a '-' for E? but we don't know where? because we didn't put E? 

Actually, we cannot get a '-' for E if we don't guess E? 

So if we guess a word without E? and the word has E? then we won't get any indication? because we didn't guess E? 

So that would be bad? Because we wouldn't know about the presence? But we already know E is present? So we don't need to? 

But we need to find its position? 

So if we don't guess E? we don't get information about its position? 

Therefore, we must include E in the guess? to test position 2 or 3? 

So we have to choose between testing position 2 or 3? 

But we couldn't find a common word with E at position 2? So we must test position 3? 

Therefore, I'll choose a word with E at position 3? 

Pattern: C _ E _ T? 

We need to fill positions 2 and 4? 

Available letters: avoid R, A, N, O, M? 

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y? 

We can try: 
  - ""CHEST"": C H E S T? 
  - ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? 
  - ""CREST"": but R is absent? 
  - ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with T? 
  - ""CLEPT"": C L E P T? 
  - ""CHERT"": but R? 
  - ""CUEST"": not common? 

So valid options: 
  - ""CHEST"" (H at 2, S at 4)
  - ""CLEFT"" (L at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CLEPT"" (L at 2, P at 4)

Which one to choose? We want to maximize new letter coverage? 

We haven't used: 
  From common: S, H, L, F, P, D, G, etc. 

""CHEST"" uses H and S? 
""CLEFT"" uses L and F? 
""CLEPT"" uses L and P? 

S is a very common letter? So ""CHEST"" might be better? 

Also, H is common? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? So we can choose ""CHEST""? 

But wait: what if the word is ""CHEST""? Then we get it? 

But let's see: if we guess ""CHEST"", and the word is not ""CHEST"", what feedback? 

For example, if E is at position 2? then we would get: 
  C(✓) H(-) because H is not in the word? or if H is in the word but not at position 2? But we don't know? 
  Actually, we don't know if H is in the word? 

But we are testing H at position 2? and S at position 4? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common? 

But I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice? 

But note: we already know T is at position 5? so we don't need to test T? But we are using it? because it's fixed? 

So I'll go with ""CHEST"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""CLEFT""? Then we would miss? 

But we are trying to get information? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use T? because T is already known? But we have to use T? because the word ends with T? 

No, we don't have to? We can choose a word that doesn't have T? but then we wouldn't be testing the known T? 

But we know T is at position 5? so if we don't put T at position 5? then we might get a '-' for T? if it's present elsewhere? but we know it's at position 5? so we should put T at position 5? to confirm? 

Actually, we already confirmed T at position 5? in the second guess? So we don't need to? But it's fixed? 

So we can use the pattern? 

Therefore, I choose ""CHEST"" as the third guess. 

But let me check: 
  Guess: C H E S T

If the word is ""CHEST"", we win? 
If not, we get feedback on H, E, S? 

But note: we know E is present? and we are testing it at position 3? 

So if we get E(✓)? then we know E is at position 3? and then we only need to find the letters at 2 and 4? 

If we get E(-)? then E is not at position 3? so it must be at position 2? 

But then we have to find a word with E at position 2? and we had trouble? 

But if E is at position 2? then the word is C E ? ? T? 

And we need a valid word? 

Let me think again: 
  C E ? ? T? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? 
  - ""CESTI"" → not common? 
  - ""CEZVE"" → not common? 
  - ""CETYL"" → C E T Y L? but that's 5 letters? C E T Y L? but then the last letter is L? not T? 

Actually, I found: 
  - ""CERTY"" is not valid? 
  - ""CESTI"" is not in common use? 
  - ""CELEB"" is not 5? 
  - ""CETUS"" → but ends with S? 

Wait, what about ""CLEPT""? But that has E at position 3? 

I think there are no common words with E at position 2 and ending with T? 

Therefore, it is more likely that E is at position 3? 

So we can assume that? 

But we must test? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 2? but not ending with T? But we know the word ends with T? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must test position 3? 

So I'll go with ""CHEST"". 

But let me see if there is a word with E at position 2? 

After research? I recall: 
  - ""DEITY"" → but doesn't start with C? 
  - ""LEGIT"" → not starting with C? 

For C: 
  - ""CETUS"" → C E T U S? but then the last letter is S? not T? 
  - ""CESTA"" → but A is absent? 
  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? 

So I think it's safe to assume E is at position 3? 

Therefore, we guess ""CHEST"". 

But note: we have not tested H and S? So if the word is not ""CHEST"", we get information about H and S? 

So let's do that. 

Third guess: chest### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - R(x), A(x), N(x): Absent from the word.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""comet""**  
  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - O(x), M(x): Absent from the word.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 4.  
  - T(✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 5: **T**  
   The word pattern is: `C _ _ _ T`.  
2. **Confirmed Present Letter**:  
   - **E** is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). It must be in position 2 or 3.  
3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - R, A, N, O, M (cannot appear in the word).  
4. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 need to be solved.  
   - Position 2 and 3: One of these must be **E**.  
   - Position 4: A new consonant (not R, A, N, O, M).  
5. **Untested Letters**:  
   - Focus on common consonants (e.g., S, L, D, P, B) and vowels (e.g., I, U) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test E in Position 3**: Since E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 2 is hard to test (few valid words like `C E _ _ T` exist), prioritize placing E in position 3 to verify its location.  
- **Cover New Letters**: Use untested common letters (e.g., S, H, L) to gather more data.  
- **Valid Word Choice**: ""CHEST"" fits:  
  - `C H E S T` tests E in position 3.  
  - Introduces new consonants: **H** (position 2) and **S** (position 4).  
  - Avoids absent letters (R, A, N, O, M).  

If E is correct in position 3, we lock it. If not, E must be in position 2 (though rare, this would require re-evaluation). Feedback on H and S will also reveal their presence/absence.

Examples: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""SOARE"", ""ROATE"", etc.\n\n Let me choose a word that has two vowels and three common consonants.

It does contain E, but E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters, we can think of the pattern: C _ _ _ _\n\n We must avoid the letters R, A, N. Also, E cannot be in the last position.\n\n We need to make a new guess that meets:\n - First letter C (since it\'s fixed).\n - Contains E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n - Does not contain R, A, N.\n - The word must be a valid English word.\n\n Additionally, to maximize information, we can try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R, A, N are out. So remaining letters from common ones might be: \n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n Vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already known but we have to place it).\n\n However note: E is already confirmed present, but we have not used O, U, I, etc.\n\n We can try to include a new vowel and some consonants that are common.\n\n Considering the pattern: C _ _ _ _\n\n We have to include E somewhere not at the end? Actually, the feedback only says E is not in position 5, so it could be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, wait: the word is C _ _ _ _ and the E we know is present but not in the position we placed it (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2-4? Actually, no: the feedback for E is ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position. Since we placed it in position 5, that means it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in one of positions 1-4? But position 1 is C? So E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Therefore, the word has the form: C [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] [not R,A,N] and the E is in one of the middle three positions.\n\n Since we have limited tries, let\'s try to fix the E in a different position and use common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Avoided letters: R, A, N.\n\n Commonly used letters: We can try S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that start with C, have an E, and avoid R, A, N.\n\n Some examples:\n - ""CHASE"" -> but contains A -> avoid.\n - ""CRATE"" -> contains R -> avoid.\n - ""CLOSE"" -> but O and S are new? and it ends with E? But we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at the end.\n - Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Options:\n - Position 2: CE... words: e.g., ""CEDAR"" -> contains A -> bad.\n   - ""CELEB"" -> not 5 letters? Also contains L and B, but is it valid? Not common. Let\'s look for standard words.\n - Position 3: C _ E ... words: e.g., ""CHEST"", but E is in position 3? So word: C H E S T -> has H, E, S, T. And ends with T? Let\'s check: we need E not at the end? Here E is at position 3? Then we can use ""CHEST"". But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is not at the end? So it\'s okay to have E in position 3? Also, the first letter is C, so matching condition? However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n But wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? Actually: C H E S T -> position 2 is H, position 3 is E? Then position 4 is S, position 5 is T? That\'s fine? The E is in position 3? So not at the end? So acceptable? And it avoids R, A, N? Letters: C, H, E, S, T -> H, S, T are new.\n\n - Another option: Position 4: C _ _ E ... words: e.g., ""COMET"" -> O, M, E, T? And E is at position 4? Then the last letter is T? That avoids A, R, N? And E at position 4 is acceptable? So ""COMET"" would be: C O M E T.\n\n But note: we don\'t know which of these is better? Also, we are allowed to reuse E? But E is known to be in the word? So we can include it? Actually, we must include E? Because it\'s present? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word? So we must include E? So every guess must include E? Actually, not necessarily? Because we might guess E again? But we already know E is present? So we don\'t have to? However, to narrow down we might want to? But alternatively, we could ignore E for one guess? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E must be in positions 2-4? So perhaps we should include E in our next guess? That way we can get its position.\n\n Since we have to test E\'s position? Therefore, including E in the second guess is beneficial.\n\n Let me compare two words: ""CHEST"" and ""COMET"". \n CHEST: C H E S T -> letters: E is in position 3? So if we get feedback on E, we know if it\'s correct at position 3? Or if it\'s in the word but not there? Then it must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have only one E? Actually, the word might have multiple E\'s? But so far we don\'t know? The feedback was for one E? And we have only one E? But in the secret word, there could be more? But we don\'t know? The feedback only told us about the E we guessed: that it\'s present but not in position 5? It doesn\'t tell us if there are more? Since we only guessed one E? So it might be that the word has one E? Or more? But we don\'t know? \n\n However, note: the feedback symbol: a \'-\' means the letter is present but in the wrong position? And for multiple same letters? It gets complicated? But the rules didn\'t specify? But in standard Wordle, if there is a duplicate? Actually, let\'s assume the standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times? Then the feedback will account for it? But in our case, we don\'t have duplicates in the first guess? So let\'s proceed.\n\n We can try both? But I need to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we might try a word that doesn\'t put E in the same position? Or vary for maximum new letter coverage? \n\n But note: we must keep the first letter C? So our second guess must start with C? Because we know C is correct at position 1? So we should keep it? Therefore, we don\'t change that?\n\n So yes: the second guess must be a word starting with C? And containing E somewhere? And avoiding R, A, N? So only positions 2 to 5 can be filled with letters that are not R, A, N? And we have to include E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And the last letter cannot be E? Because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: what if the word has E at position 5 and also at another? But note: we were told that the E we placed in position 5 got a ""-"", meaning one E exists? But if the word had E at position 5 and also at another? Then the E we placed in position 5? Well, usually the rules: if there is one E and we placed it in position 5? But the E might be at position, say, 2? Then we get a \'-\' for E at position 5? But if there were two E\'s? Then we might get a \'-\' for that E? And a correct for the other? Etc? \n\n However, to avoid complications? And since we don\'t know? We\'ll assume we have at least one E? And its position is in 2,3,4? So position 5 must be a non-E? And indeed? The feedback says the letter at position 5? The E? Is not correct? Meaning that there might be another E elsewhere? But we\'ll find out? \n\n So back to constructing the second guess:\n\n Let me also note: we have not tested many consonants? So we can try a word that introduces new common consonants? Like T, L, M, S, etc? \n\n The word ""CHEST"": \n   C H E S T\n   Letters: C, H, E, S, T? \n   New letters: H, S, T? \n   We already know C is correct at position 1? And E is present? So we can test whether E is at position 3? And test H at position 2? S at position 4? T at position 5?\n\n The word ""COMET"": \n   C O M E T\n   Letters: C, O, M, E, T? \n   New letters: O, M, T? \n\n Which is better? \n\n Additionally, we must avoid R, A, N? Both words avoid them? So both valid.\n\n But note that T might be a common ending? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? while ""COMET"" also ends with T? But also, ""CHEST"" has S? which is a common letter? \n\n Actually, let me think of other words? \n - C with E in position 2: ""CEILS"" -> but CE is at 1 and 2? But then? Also, not common? \n   Or ""CEDIS""? Contains D? But not common? \n   Also, ""CELEB"" is not valid? \n\n So alternative? \n   Let me think of C with E at position 2: \n      ""CELLO"" -> starts C E L L O? But has L and O? But note: avoiding R, A, N? Okay? But ""CELLO"" means we put E at position 2? and we guess L in positions 3 and 4? And O at 5? Might not be ideal? But let\'s see? \n   Actually, ""CELTS"" -> C E L T S? Also a word? \n\n But I am considering that the feedback for the first guess already told us E is not at position 5? But we don\'t know about other positions? By putting E at position 2? We test if E is at position 2? Similarly, by putting it at position 3? we test that? \n\n Since we have to find the E\'s position? And we have no preference? So we might choose a word that uses new letters? \n\n However, note that we have limited tries? And we want to maximize the information? So using a word that contains several new letters? and possibly in common positions? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""CHEST"" because it uses H, S, T? which are very common? \n\n Also, we can try ""CLOSE""? But ""CLOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is wrong? Because E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? So ""CLOSE"" would be invalid? because we know E is not at position 5? But wait: in ""CLOSE""? the E is at position 5? and we know E cannot be at position 5? So why waste a guess? We can avoid that? \n\n Actually, we should avoid putting E at position 5? because we know it\'s not correct? Similarly, we should not put E at the end? \n\n Therefore, ""CHEST"" is good? E is in position 3? \n\n Alternatively, we could try ""CLEAR""? But CLEAR contains A? which we know is absent? So invalid? \n\n So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? \n\n Or another word: ""CUBES""? But E is in position 4? And U, B, S? Also avoids R, A, N? \n\n But ""CUBES"": ends with S? But E is in position 4? \n\n Both are valid? \n\n It\'s arbitrary? So I\'ll go with ""CHEST""? \n\n But note: let me check that the word ""CHEST"" exists? It\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, I guess: chest\n\n But wait: what if we want to test E in a different position? We don\'t want to fix in one spot? We are trying to determine the position? So if we put E in position 2? Then we get information? \n\n Actually, we have no constraint? So we can pick any? \n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses E in a position that we haven\'t tried? And that covers more vowels? \n\n Since E is the only vowel we have? And the word must have other vowels? Or not? But we don\'t know? \n\n But we don\'t know? We have not tested O, U, I? Etc? \n\n Therefore, using a word that uses O? might be helpful? For example, ""COMET"" has the vowel O? and E? \n\n Whereas ""CHEST"" has no other vowel? Only E? \n\n Therefore, ""COMET"" gives information about O? Which is a common vowel? And M? So that might be more informative? \n\n But note: the unknown letters? Using O? might be better? \n\n That is a valid point? \n\n Also, ""COMET"" avoids the same letters? \n\n So let me reconsider:\n\n Guess with ""COMET"": \n   Pattern: C O M E T\n   E is in position 4? So we test E at position 4? \n   And we test O at position 2? M at position 3? T at position 5?\n\n So if E is not at position 4? then we know it must be in position either 2 or 3? Because the word has E somewhere? And we already know it cannot be in position 5? Then next guess? But we avoid having tested more letters? \n\n Alternatively, if we use ""CHEST"", we test E at position 3? So if it hits? then we know? \n\n But testing O? which is a vowel? might reveal if the word has O? \n\n Since we haven\'t tested any vowel except E? And E we know? Then O? is common? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""COMET"" to test O? \n\n Let me also note: the word might have vowels? So testing O? is valuable? \n\n Alternative? ""COPED""? but has D? and E? Also, avoids R,A,N? \n\n But I think ""COMET"" is a common word? \n\n Therefore, I choose ""COMET"".\n\n But wait: what about the letter M? Is it common? Not as common as S? But I think for now? \n\n Also, note: T at the end? We have not tested T? \n\n So ""COMET"" and ""CHEST"" both test T?\n\n However, ""CHEST"" tests S? which is more common than M? \n\n But ""COMET"" tests O? which is a vowel? \n\n So if I must choose? I\'m leaning toward ""COMET"" to include a vowel? \n\n Alternatively, another word: ""COVES""? Ends with S? E at position 4? But O? And V? \n\n Anyway? \n\n After reconsidering? I think using a word that introduces a vowel? so ""COMET"" is chosen? \n\n So second guess: comet.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C(✓)** is correct and in position 1 → the word starts with ""C"".\n- **E(-)** is in the word but not at position 5 → E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- **R(x)**, **A(x)**, **N(x)** are absent → the word contains none of R, A, N.\n\nMy strategy for the second guess:\n- Must start with ""C"" (fixed position).\n- Must include ""E"" in position 2, 3, or 4 to test its location.\n- Avoid R, A, N, and focus on new common consonants (e.g., T, M, S) and vowels (e.g., O, U) for better coverage.\n- Prioritize words that test ""E"" in an untested position while introducing new vowels for maximal information.\n\nSelected ""COMET"" because:\n- Starts with ""C"" → tests fixed position.\n- Places ""E"" in position 4 → checks if E fits there.\n- Introduces ""O"" (vowel) and ""M"", ""T"" (common consonants) → expands coverage.\n- Avoids R, A, N → complies with feedback.\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>comet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n- C is correct and in position 1.\n- R, A, N are absent.\n- E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""comet"" → C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(-) T(✓)\n- C is correct and in position 1 (as before).\n- O is absent (so the word does not contain O).\n- M is absent (so the word does not contain M).\n- E is present but not in position 4 (because we placed it in position 4 and got a \'-\').\n- T is correct and in position 5.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word is: C _ _ _ T\n- The first letter is C, the last letter is T.\n- The word contains E, but not in position 4 or 5 (since we tried position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""comet"", both got \'-\'). Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.\n- The word does not contain: R, A, N, O, M.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a 5-letter English word.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the middle three letters, with E in either position 2 or 3.\n\nWe have the pattern: C [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] T\n\nConstraints:\n- letter1, letter2, letter3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, N, O, M.\n- One of letter1 or letter2 must be E (since E must be in position 2 or 3).\n\nAlso, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. So we should try to use new letters to maximize information.\n\nAvailable common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe must include E in position 2 or 3? Actually, we don\'t have to in the guess? But we know E is in the word? So we can include it to test its position? But we have two positions left for E: 2 and 3? So we can try to put E in one of them? Or we can try a word that doesn\'t have E? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is present? So we should use it? And we have two positions to test? So we can choose one? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 tries left? So we need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2? Then if it\'s correct? we get a ✓? If not? then E must be in position 3? So we can get the position of E in this guess? \n\nSo let\'s try to put E in position 2? Then the word would be: C E _ _ T\n\nWhat words fit? And avoid R, A, N, O, M? \n\nExamples: \n- ""CELT"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n- ""CENTS"" → but N is absent? We cannot use N? Because N is absent? So no.\n- ""CELTS"" → but S is at the end? But we have T at the end? So the word would be C E L T S? But then the last letter is S? but we know the last letter is T? So that doesn\'t fit? Because we have T at position 5? So the word must end with T? So the pattern is C E _ _ T? \n\nSo we need a 5-letter word: C E ? ? T? \n\nValid words: \n- ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? But that has E at position 3? Not 2? \n  Actually, ""CLEFT"" is C L E F T → positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:F, 5:T? So that doesn\'t put E at position 2? \n\nWe need E at position 2: so the word is C E ? ? T? \n\nExamples: \n- ""CEILT"" → not a word.\n- ""CENT"" → too short.\n- ""CESTI"" → not common? \n- ""CEZVE"" → not common? \n\nActually, common words: \n- ""CHEWY"" → but doesn\'t end with T? \n- We need to end with T? \n\nSo what about: \n- ""CHEAT"" → but A is absent? and we cannot use A? \n- ""CHEST"" → but we have S and T? But ""CHEST"" is C H E S T? Then the last letter is T? So that fits? But we have E at position 3? Not 2? \n\nWait, we need E at position 2? \n\nLet me think: \n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 3: ?\n  Position 4: ?\n  Position 5: T\n\nWords: \n- ""CABET"" → not a word? \n- ""CUBIT"" → but U? and B? and I? and T? But E? We don\'t have E? \n- ""CEBID"" → not common? \n- ""CEDED"" → has D? but E at position 2? and then D? and E? but we have to avoid? Also, the last letter is D? not T? \n\nActually, I cannot think of a common English word that is C E ? ? T? \n\nTherefore, maybe E is not in position 2? Then it must be in position 3? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3? \n\nPattern: C _ E _ T? \n\nExamples: \n- ""CHEST"" → C H E S T? This is a common word? \n  But we have already used H? and S? in the context? But we haven\'t tested H and S? So we can use? \n  However, note: in the second guess we used ""comet"" and we know O and M are absent? But H and S are new? \n\nBut wait: ""CHEST"" has E at position 3? and ends with T? So it fits the pattern? \n\nBut we don\'t know if E is at position 3? So we can test it? \n\nAlso, we can test H at position 2? and S at position 4? \n\nBut what if E is actually at position 2? Then we would get a different feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 3? and also tests other common letters? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, A, N, O, M? \n\nSo ""CHEST"" is: C H E S T? \n  - H is new? \n  - S is new? \n  - E at position 3? \n  - T at position 5? (which we know is correct? so we are testing the middle? \n\nBut we already know T is at position 5? so we don\'t need to test T? \n\nBut we are using T? because it\'s fixed? \n\nSo let\'s consider: if we guess ""CHEST"", what feedback can we get? \n\nPossible outcomes for E: \n  - If E is at position 3? then we get E(✓)? \n  - If E is at position 2? then we get E(-) for position 3? and then we know E is at position 2? \n\nBut we don\'t have a word with E at position 2? So if we get E(-) for position 3? then we know E must be at position 2? and then we can try to find a word for that? \n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word with E at position 2? So that might be a problem? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have E? But we know E is present? So we should include it? \n\nBut if we don\'t include E? then we might get information about other letters? and then we can deduce E\'s position? \n\nFor example, we can try a word that has new letters? and doesn\'t have E? Then if we get no E? we know that E is not in the positions we didn\'t test? But we have only two positions: 2 and 3? \n\nBut if we don\'t include E? and the word has E? then we might get a \'-\' for E? but we don\'t know where? because we didn\'t put E? \n\nActually, we cannot get a \'-\' for E if we don\'t guess E? \n\nSo if we guess a word without E? and the word has E? then we won\'t get any indication? because we didn\'t guess E? \n\nSo that would be bad? Because we wouldn\'t know about the presence? But we already know E is present? So we don\'t need to? \n\nBut we need to find its position? \n\nSo if we don\'t guess E? we don\'t get information about its position? \n\nTherefore, we must include E in the guess? to test position 2 or 3? \n\nSo we have to choose between testing position 2 or 3? \n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word with E at position 2? So we must test position 3? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose a word with E at position 3? \n\nPattern: C _ E _ T? \n\nWe need to fill positions 2 and 4? \n\nAvailable letters: avoid R, A, N, O, M? \n\nCommon letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y? \n\nWe can try: \n  - ""CHEST"": C H E S T? \n  - ""CLEFT"": C L E F T? \n  - ""CREST"": but R is absent? \n  - ""CHEWY"": doesn\'t end with T? \n  - ""CLEPT"": C L E P T? \n  - ""CHERT"": but R? \n  - ""CUEST"": not common? \n\nSo valid options: \n  - ""CHEST"" (H at 2, S at 4)\n  - ""CLEFT"" (L at 2, F at 4)\n  - ""CLEPT"" (L at 2, P at 4)\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to maximize new letter coverage? \n\nWe haven\'t used: \n  From common: S, H, L, F, P, D, G, etc. \n\n""CHEST"" uses H and S? \n""CLEFT"" uses L and F? \n""CLEPT"" uses L and P? \n\nS is a very common letter? So ""CHEST"" might be better? \n\nAlso, H is common? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 tries left? So we can choose ""CHEST""? \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""CHEST""? Then we get it? \n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""CHEST"", and the word is not ""CHEST"", what feedback? \n\nFor example, if E is at position 2? then we would get: \n  C(✓) H(-) because H is not in the word? or if H is in the word but not at position 2? But we don\'t know? \n  Actually, we don\'t know if H is in the word? \n\nBut we are testing H at position 2? and S at position 4? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common? \n\nBut I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice? \n\nBut note: we already know T is at position 5? so we don\'t need to test T? But we are using it? because it\'s fixed? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHEST"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""CLEFT""? Then we would miss? \n\nBut we are trying to get information? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use T? because T is already known? But we have to use T? because the word ends with T? \n\nNo, we don\'t have to? We can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? but then we wouldn\'t be testing the known T? \n\nBut we know T is at position 5? so if we don\'t put T at position 5? then we might get a \'-\' for T? if it\'s present elsewhere? but we know it\'s at position 5? so we should put T at position 5? to confirm? \n\nActually, we already confirmed T at position 5? in the second guess? So we don\'t need to? But it\'s fixed? \n\nSo we can use the pattern? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""CHEST"" as the third guess. \n\nBut let me check: \n  Guess: C H E S T\n\nIf the word is ""CHEST"", we win? \nIf not, we get feedback on H, E, S? \n\nBut note: we know E is present? and we are testing it at position 3? \n\nSo if we get E(✓)? then we know E is at position 3? and then we only need to find the letters at 2 and 4? \n\nIf we get E(-)? then E is not at position 3? so it must be at position 2? \n\nBut then we have to find a word with E at position 2? and we had trouble? \n\nBut if E is at position 2? then the word is C E ? ? T? \n\nAnd we need a valid word? \n\nLet me think again: \n  C E ? ? T? \n\nPossible words: \n  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? \n  - ""CESTI"" → not common? \n  - ""CEZVE"" → not common? \n  - ""CETYL"" → C E T Y L? but that\'s 5 letters? C E T Y L? but then the last letter is L? not T? \n\nActually, I found: \n  - ""CERTY"" is not valid? \n  - ""CESTI"" is not in common use? \n  - ""CELEB"" is not 5? \n  - ""CETUS"" → but ends with S? \n\nWait, what about ""CLEPT""? But that has E at position 3? \n\nI think there are no common words with E at position 2 and ending with T? \n\nTherefore, it is more likely that E is at position 3? \n\nSo we can assume that? \n\nBut we must test? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 2? but not ending with T? But we know the word ends with T? So we cannot? \n\nTherefore, we must test position 3? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHEST"". \n\nBut let me see if there is a word with E at position 2? \n\nAfter research? I recall: \n  - ""DEITY"" → but doesn\'t start with C? \n  - ""LEGIT"" → not starting with C? \n\nFor C: \n  - ""CETUS"" → C E T U S? but then the last letter is S? not T? \n  - ""CESTA"" → but A is absent? \n  - ""CERTY"" → not a word? \n\nSo I think it\'s safe to assume E is at position 3? \n\nTherefore, we guess ""CHEST"". \n\nBut note: we have not tested H and S? So if the word is not ""CHEST"", we get information about H and S? \n\nSo let\'s do that. \n\nThird guess: chest### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - R(x), A(x), N(x): Absent from the word.  \n  - E(-): Present but not in position 5.  \n- **Guess 2: ""comet""**  \n  - C(✓): Correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  \n  - O(x), M(x): Absent from the word.  \n  - E(-): Present but not in position 4.  \n  - T(✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed Positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **C**  \n   - Position 5: **T**  \n   The word pattern is: `C _ _ _ T`.  \n2. **Confirmed Present Letter**:  \n   - **E** is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). It must be in position 2 or 3.  \n3. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - R, A, N, O, M (cannot appear in the word).  \n4. **Remaining Unknowns**:  \n   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 need to be solved.  \n   - Position 2 and 3: One of these must be **E**.  \n   - Position 4: A new consonant (not R, A, N, O, M).  \n5. **Untested Letters**:  \n   - Focus on common consonants (e.g., S, L, D, P, B) and vowels (e.g., I, U) to maximize information.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Test E in Position 3**: Since E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 2 is hard to test (few valid words like `C E _ _ T` exist), prioritize placing E in position 3 to verify its location.  \n- **Cover New Letters**: Use untested common letters (e.g., S, H, L) to gather more data.  \n- **Valid Word Choice**: ""CHEST"" fits:  \n  - `C H E S T` tests E in position 3.  \n  - Introduces new consonants: **H** (position 2) and **S** (position 4).  \n  - Avoids absent letters (R, A, N, O, M).  \n\nIf E is correct in position 3, we lock it. If not, E must be in position 2 (though rare, this would require re-evaluation).

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
  C(✓) → Correct at position 1
  R(x) → Absent
  A(x) → Absent
  N(x) → Absent
  E(-) → Present but wrong position (not 5)

Guess 2: ""comet""
  C✓ → Correct at position 1
  O(x) → Absent
  M(x) → Absent
  E(-) → Present but not at position 4
  T✓ → Correct at position 5

Guess 3: ""chest""
  C✓ → Correct at position 1
  H(x) → Absent
  E✓ → Correct at position 3
  S(x) → Absent
  T✓ → Correct at position 5

Therefore, we know:

- The word is: C _ E _ T  (since position1=C, position3=E, position5=T)
- Absent letters: R, A, N, O, M, H, S
- E is now confirmed at position 3.

Now, we need to determine the missing letters: position 2 and position 4.

The word pattern: C [unknown2] E [unknown4] T

Unknown2 and unknown4 must be letters not in the absent list: R, A, N, O, M, H, S.

Also, from guess1, we know E is in the word (and we now know it's at position 3), but initially it was marked as '-' when at position 5. This doesn't add new info now.

We need to choose a guess that helps fill positions 2 and 4. Let's think of possible valid English words that fit C?E?T, avoiding the absent letters.

Possible words:
- We need to fill position2 and position4 with letters not in R,A,N,O,M,H,S.

Available letters: All letters not used and not absent. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,O,M,T,H,S → so avoided: R,A,N,O,M,H,S.

Therefore, we can use: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common possibilities:
- ""CLEET"" → but 'L' is available? And 'E'? But we have E at position3? And position2 would be 'L', position4 would be 'E'? But ""CLEET"" has double E? But allowed? Check word: cleet is a word? (variant of cleat? or not common? usually ""cleat"" is common, but cleat is C L E A T → contains A? absent. So not.)

Alternative: 
- ""CUBIT"" → C U B I T → positions: 2=U, 4=I? But ends with T? And no E at position3? But we have fixed E at position3? So not.

We have pattern: C ? E ? T.

Possible options:
- Letter at position2: say X
- Letter at position4: say Y
- Word: C X E Y T

We need X and Y from available letters.

Common words:
- ""CIDER"" → but ends with R? and R is absent.
- ""CIVET"" → C I V E T → position2=I, position4=V? Then word: C I V E T → but we have E at position3? So positions: 1=C, 2=I, 3=V? Wait, no: ""civet"" is spelled C-I-V-E-T → so position3=V, not E? So not.

Wait no: the word has pattern: position1=C, position2=?, position3=E, position4=?, position5=T.

Therefore, we must keep position3 as E.

So we need words that are exactly: [C] [X] [E] [Y] [T]

Examples:
- ""CADET"" → but A is absent? no.
- ""CLEFT"" → C L E F T → position2=L, position4=F. This is a word. And L and F are not absent? So okay.
- ""CREPT"" → R is absent? no.
- ""CUBET"" → not a word? 
- ""CUZES"" → not ends with T.
- ""CHEWY"" → not ends with T.

Other possibilities:
- ""CHERT"" → has R and H? absent.
- ""CLIPT"" → not common? 
- ""CEPTS"" → not a word? 
- ""CLEPT"" → C L E P T → this is a word (archaic for stolen). So positions: 2=L, 4=P.

So two strong candidates: 
  1. ""CLEFT"" → L and F
  2. ""CLEPT"" → L and P

We need to choose one? But we have incomplete information? So let's design a guess that tests these.

But note: we can only guess valid words. So we must choose a word that fits the pattern? We don't have to stick to the fixed pattern? But the pattern has three fixed letters: C, E, T? So we must include them? 

But if we guess a word that doesn't put E in position3? It's okay? Because we know E is at position3? So we should keep it there? 

Therefore, the guess must be a word that starts with C, ends with T, and has E at position3? So yes: pattern C?E?T.

So we can guess words in the form C?E?T.

We have two words: ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"". But how to choose? 

We haven't tested L, F, P, etc? 

We can use one of them? Or try a word that introduces new letters? 

Alternatively, to maximize information we might test a letter that appears in position2? 

But both words have L in position2? So if we choose ""CLEFT"", we test F at position4? If we choose ""CLEPT"", we test P at position4? 

But if we want to test L? Putting L at position2? 

But note that if we guess ""CLEFT"", it has L? If L is absent? then we get L(x)? Then we know that the word is not ""CLEFT"" or ""CLEPT""? But then what? 

Because if L is absent, then position2 must be something else? 

So we might need to test L? 

Similarly, if we guess a word that doesn't assume L? 

For example, let me try to think of words with different position2? 

Other possibilities:
  - ""CLEFT"", ""CLEPT"", 
  - ""COVET"" → O is absent? 
  - ""CABET"" → A absent?
  - ""CETYL"" → not common? 
  - ""CYEST"" → no?
  - ""B"" at position2: ""CBET"" → not word. 
  - ""D"": ""CEDED"" → E at position3, D at position2 and 4? But ""CEDED"" is C E D E D? No: positions must be [2] and [4]: if ""CEDET"" → no? 
  - ""F"": ""CFET"" → no
  - ""G"": ""CGEET"" → no? 
  - ""I"": ""CIETT"" → no? or ""CIVET"" but then position isn't E at position3? 
  We need E at position3? 

Wait: another word: ""CUTEY"" → not ends with T? 

Actually, common words fitting the pattern? 
  - ""CLEFT"" (split or crack)
  - ""CLEPT"" (archaic)
  - ""CREST"" → has R? absent.
  - ""BLERT"" → not starting with C? 
  - ""CROPT"" → R absent? 

Therefore, the most common word is ""CLEFT"". 

We can try that.

Alternatively, let me check if there's a word with different position2: 
  - ""CUEED""? No? 
  - ""CYBER"" → doesn't end with T? 

Another: ""CUBIT"" → no E at position3? 

Perhaps not? 

Therefore, we choose ""CLEFT"" for the next guess.

But note: we have 4,5,6? tries left? 

If we guess ""CLEFT"", and it is correct? Then we are done? 

If not, we get feedback that helps with position2 and position4? 

For example, if L is absent? Then we know position2 cannot be L? Then we try ""CLEPT""? But if L is absent, then both ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"" are invalid? 

So we need words with position2 not L? 

But we haven't found many? 

Perhaps with D? ""CEDED"" → but E at position2? and our pattern has E at position3? 

But wait: we know E is at position3? So position2 cannot be E? 

Therefore, position2 cannot be E? 

So the word must be C E E _ T? But we don't have E? 

Wait: ""CLEET"" is not common? 

But let me think: if position2 is E? but we know E is only at position3? Or not? The word could have multiple E's? 

For example, the feedback so far: 
- In guess1, E was guessed at position5: E(-) → one E exists? But if the word has E at position3 and position2? Then multiple? 

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"" with E at position5? We got '-' meaning there is an E? But if there were two E's? we might get more '-'? Or just one? 

Actually, the rules don't specify? But typically in such games, for duplicates? The feedback marks one per occurrence? 

For instance, if the word has two E's? and we guess one E in the correct position? and one E in the wrong position? Then we get one ✓ and one '-'? 

But in this case? 

We haven't tested position2? 

So it's possible? 

But we know E is at position3? So if we have E at position2? Then the word has two E's? 

Then ""crane"" with E at position5? We got '-'? which means one E? So if the word had a second E? It might not be reported? 

But typically? The feedback only reports for the letters matched? For example? If the word has one E? and we guess E at a wrong position? we get a '-'? If the word has two E's? and we guess E at a wrong position? we would get a '-'? and if we guess an E at a correct position? we get a ✓? 

But we haven't guessed position2? 

Therefore? Position2 might be E? 

So the word could be C E E ? T? 

For example: ""CBEET"" → no? ""CLEET"" → not common? But I found that ""cleet"" is a word (a type of cleat or brace). So let's consider? 

Therefore? possibilities:
  - ""CLEFT"": C L E F T
  - ""CLEPT"": C L E P T
  - ""CLEET"": C L E E T? → but then position2=L? position4=E? 
     - But this has E at position3 and position4? So two E's? 
     - Then for the first guess ""crane"": E at position5? The feedback shows one '-'? If there are two E's? then both not at position5? So we should get two '-'? But we got one '-'? So maybe the word has only one E? 

Therefore? The feedback from guess1 gives one '-' for E? which means at least one E? but if there were two E's? we don't know? 

But? from guess3: when we guessed ""chest"" with E at position3? we got ✓? So that covers one E? 

And we got one '-' from guess1? So that might account for a second E? Or it might be for the one E? 

Since the rules don't specify? We have to assume? that the feedback marks one '-' per occurrence? But when E is correct? we get a ✓? 

But for guess3: we had E✓? So that counts as one occurrence? 

Then? for guess1: we had one occurrence? But it's the same E? So no duplicate? 

Moreover? if the word had two E's? and one is at position3? then the other could be elsewhere? and we should get feedback even if we don't guess it? But that's not how it works? The feedback only talks about the letters we guess? 

For example: if we had guessed ""crane"" and the word had E at position3? and also at position2? Then when we place E at position5? we get a '-'? for E? because there is a wrong-position E? (either at position2 or 3? But we didn't guess position2 or 3? So we still get one '-'. 

Similarly? we have one E? So the feedback '-' covers one E? 

Therefore? we know there is exactly one E? so the word cannot have two E's? 

So ""CLEET"" would have two E's? Thus invalid? 

Therefore? position2 cannot be E? 

Therefore? valid words are with E only at position3? 

So pattern C X E Y T? with X and Y not E? and avoiding absent letters: R, A, N, O, M, H, S? 

Now? which words? 
- ""CLEFT"" → L? F
- ""CLEPT"" → L? P
- ""BLERT"" → not C? 
- ""CUBIT"" → no E? 
- ""CEDED"" → multiple E? not? 
- ""CUTEY"" → not end with T? 
- ""CIZEL"" → no? 

So ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"" are candidates? 

But to choose? We need to test the letter L? If L is present? then we can narrow? 

So we guess ""CLEFT"": 
- If correct? done? 
- If L is absent? then we get H in guess3 was absent? and L in ""CLEFT"" would be absent? and then position2 must be another letter? 
- Similarly? F would be absent? 

Then we are left with ""CLEPT""? But if L is absent? then both ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"" are invalid? 

So what other words? 

Perhaps ""DIRTY"" → not start with C? 

Another word: ""CWTCH"" → not English? 

Wait? ""COYED"" → O absent? 

So maybe only two possibilities? 

Therefore? I choose ""CLEFT"" as it is more common? 

Alternatively? to avoid L? We can try ""C??E?T"" with X not L? 

For example? 
- ""CABET"" → no? 
- ""CIVET"" → no? 

""CYBER"" → no? 

Perhaps ""CUTEY"" → but doesn't end with T? 

I think we have to go with L? 

So? let's guess ""CLEFT"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(✓): Confirmed at position 1.  
  - R(x), A(x), N(x): Absent.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""comet""**  
  - C(✓): Confirmed at position 1.  
  - O(x), M(x): Absent.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 4 (ruling out position 4).  
  - T(✓): Confirmed at position 5.  
- **Guess 3: ""chest""**  
  - C(✓): Position 1 confirmed.  
  - H(x): Absent.  
  - E(✓): Confirmed at position 3.  
  - S(x): Absent.  
  - T(✓): Position 5 confirmed.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Pattern**: The word is `C _ E _ T`.  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 3: **E**  
   - Position 5: **T**  
2. **Letters to Solve**:  
   - **Position 2** and **Position 4** are unknown.  
3. **Absent Letters**: R, A, N, O, M, H, S (cannot be used).  
4. **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
5. **Possible Words** (using common English words):  
   - `CLEFT` (L in position 2, F in position 4).  
   - `CLEPT` (L in position 2, P in position 4).  
   - `CUBIT` (invalid: no E at position 3).  
   - `CIDET` (invalid: not a word).  
6. **Strategy**:  
   - Prioritize testing new letters (e.g., L, F, P) to gain more information.  
   - Guess **""CLEFT""**—a valid 5-letter word—to test:  
     - L in position 2 (if L is present/absent).  
     - F in position 4 (if F is present/absent).  
   - If ""CLEFT"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal properties of L and F, narrowing options (e.g., shift to ""CLEPT"" if L is present but F absent).

<guess>cleft</guess>",cleft,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
  C(✓) → Correct at position 1
  R(x) → Absent
  A(x) → Absent

Guess 3: ""chest""
  C✓ → Correct at position 1
  H(x) → Absent

  S(x) → Absent

Therefore, we know:

- The word is: C _ E _ T  (since position1=C, position3=E, position5=T)
- Absent letters: R, A, N, O, M, H, S
- E is now confirmed at position 3.

Now, we need to determine the missing letters: position 2 and position 4.

The word pattern: C [unknown2] E [unknown4] T

Unknown2 and unknown4 must be letters not in the absent list: R, A, N, O, M, H, S.

Also, from guess1, we know E is in the word (and we now know it's at position 3), but initially it was marked as '-' when at position 5. This doesn't add new info now.

We need to choose a guess that helps fill positions 2 and 4. Let's think of possible valid English words that fit C?E?T, avoiding the absent letters.

Possible words:
- We need to fill position2 and position4 with letters not in R,A,N,O,M,H,S.

Available letters: All letters not used and not absent. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,O,M,T,H,S → so avoided: R,A,N,O,M,H,S.

Therefore, we can use: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common possibilities:
- ""CLEET"" → but 'L' is available? And 'E'? But we have E at position3? And position2 would be 'L', position4 would be 'E'? But ""CLEET"" has double E? But allowed? Check word: cleet is a word? (variant of cleat? or not common? usually ""cleat"" is common, but cleat is C L E A T → contains A? absent. So not.)

Alternative: 
- ""CUBIT"" → C U B I T → positions: 2=U, 4=I? But ends with T? And no E at position3? But we have fixed E at position3? So not.

We have pattern: C ? E ? T.

Possible options:
- Letter at position2: say X
- Letter at position4: say Y
- Word: C X E Y T

We need X and Y from available letters.

Common words:
- ""CIDER"" → but ends with R? and R is absent.
- ""CIVET"" → C I V E T → position2=I, position4=V? Then word: C I V E T → but we have E at position3? So positions: 1=C, 2=I, 3=V? Wait, no: ""civet"" is spelled C-I-V-E-T → so position3=V, not E? So not.

Wait no: the word has pattern: position1=C, position2=?, position3=E, position4=?, position5=T.

Therefore, we must keep position3 as E.

So we need words that are exactly: [C] [X] [E] [Y] [T]

Examples:
- ""CADET"" → but A is absent? no.
- ""CLEFT"" → C L E F T → position2=L, position4=F. This is a word. And L and F are not absent? So okay.
- ""CREPT"" → R is absent? no.
- ""CUBET"" → not a word? 
- ""CUZES"" → not ends with T.
- ""CHEWY"" → not ends with T.

Other possibilities:
- ""CHERT"" → has R and H? absent.
- ""CLIPT"" → not common? 
- ""CEPTS"" → not a word? 
- ""CLEPT"" → C L E P T → this is a word (archaic for stolen). So positions: 2=L, 4=P.

So two strong candidates: 
  1. ""CLEFT"" → L and F
  2. ""CLEPT"" → L and P

We need to choose one? But we have incomplete information? So let's design a guess that tests these.

But note: we can only guess valid words. So we must choose a word that fits the pattern? We don't have to stick to the fixed pattern? But the pattern has three fixed letters: C, E, T? So we must include them? 

But if we guess a word that doesn't put E in position3? It's okay? Because we know E is at position3? So we should keep it there? 

Therefore, the guess must be a word that starts with C, ends with T, and has E at position3? So yes: pattern C?E?T.

So we can guess words in the form C?E?T.

We have two words: ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"". But how to choose? 

We haven't tested L, F, P, etc? 

We can use one of them? Or try a word that introduces new letters? 

Alternatively, to maximize information we might test a letter that appears in position2? 

But both words have L in position2? So if we choose ""CLEFT"", we test F at position4? If we choose ""CLEPT"", we test P at position4? 

But if we want to test L? Putting L at position2? 

But note that if we guess ""CLEFT"", it has L? If L is absent? then we get L(x)? Then we know that the word is not ""CLEFT"" or ""CLEPT""? But then what? 

Because if L is absent, then position2 must be something else? 

So we might need to test L? 

Similarly, if we guess a word that doesn't assume L? 

For example, let me try to think of words with different position2? 

Other possibilities:
  - ""CLEFT"", ""CLEPT"", 
  - ""COVET"" → O is absent? 
  - ""CABET"" → A absent?
  - ""CETYL"" → not common? 
  - ""CYEST"" → no?
  - ""B"" at position2: ""CBET"" → not word. 
  - ""D"": ""CEDED"" → E at position3, D at position2 and 4? But ""CEDED"" is C E D E D? No: positions must be [2] and [4]: if ""CEDET"" → no? 
  - ""F"": ""CFET"" → no
  - ""G"": ""CGEET"" → no? 
  - ""I"": ""CIETT"" → no? or ""CIVET"" but then position isn't E at position3? 
  We need E at position3? 

Wait: another word: ""CUTEY"" → not ends with T? 

Actually, common words fitting the pattern? 
  - ""CLEFT"" (split or crack)
  - ""CLEPT"" (archaic)
  - ""CREST"" → has R? absent.
  - ""BLERT"" → not starting with C? 
  - ""CROPT"" → R absent? 

Therefore, the most common word is ""CLEFT"". 

We can try that.

Alternatively, let me check if there's a word with different position2: 
  - ""CUEED""? No? 
  - ""CYBER"" → doesn't end with T? 

Another: ""CUBIT"" → no E at position3? 

Perhaps not? 

Therefore, we choose ""CLEFT"" for the next guess.

But note: we have 4,5,6? tries left? 

If we guess ""CLEFT"", and it is correct? Then we are done? 

If not, we get feedback that helps with position2 and position4? 

For example, if L is absent? Then we know position2 cannot be L? Then we try ""CLEPT""? But if L is absent, then both ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"" are invalid? 

So we need words with position2 not L? 

But we haven't found many? 

Perhaps with D? ""CEDED"" → but E at position2? and our pattern has E at position3? 

But wait: we know E is at position3? So position2 cannot be E? 

Therefore, position2 cannot be E? 

So the word must be C E E _ T? But we don't have E? 

Wait: ""CLEET"" is not common? 

But let me think: if position2 is E? but we know E is only at position3? Or not? The word could have multiple E's? 

For example, the feedback so far: 
- In guess1, E was guessed at position5: E(-) → one E exists? But if the word has E at position3 and position2? Then multiple? 

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"" with E at position5? We got '-' meaning there is an E? But if there were two E's? we might get more '-'? Or just one? 

Actually, the rules don't specify? But typically in such games, for duplicates? The feedback marks one per occurrence? 

For instance, if the word has two E's? and we guess one E in the correct position? and one E in the wrong position? Then we get one ✓ and one '-'? 

But in this case? 

We haven't tested position2? 

So it's possible? 

But we know E is at position3? So if we have E at position2? Then the word has two E's? 

Then ""crane"" with E at position5? We got '-'? which means one E? So if the word had a second E? It might not be reported? 

But typically? The feedback only reports for the letters matched? For example? If the word has one E? and we guess E at a wrong position? we get a '-'? If the word has two E's? and we guess E at a wrong position? we would get a '-'? and if we guess an E at a correct position? we get a ✓? 

But we haven't guessed position2? 

Therefore? Position2 might be E? 

So the word could be C E E ? T? 

For example: ""CBEET"" → no? ""CLEET"" → not common? But I found that ""cleet"" is a word (a type of cleat or brace). So let's consider? 

Therefore? possibilities:
  - ""CLEFT"": C L E F T
  - ""CLEPT"": C L E P T
  - ""CLEET"": C L E E T? → but then position2=L? position4=E? 
     - But this has E at position3 and position4? So two E's? 
     - Then for the first guess ""crane"": E at position5? The feedback shows one '-'? If there are two E's? then both not at position5? So we should get two '-'? But we got one '-'? So maybe the word has only one E? 

Therefore? The feedback from guess1 gives one '-' for E? which means at least one E? but if there were two E's? we don't know? 

But? from guess3: when we guessed ""chest"" with E at position3? we got ✓? So that covers one E? 

And we got one '-' from guess1? So that might account for a second E? Or it might be for the one E? 

Since the rules don't specify? We have to assume? that the feedback marks one '-' per occurrence? But when E is correct? we get a ✓? 

But for guess3: we had E✓? So that counts as one occurrence? 

Then? for guess1: we had one occurrence? But it's the same E? So no duplicate? 

Moreover? if the word had two E's? and one is at position3? then the other could be elsewhere? and we should get feedback even if we don't guess it? But that's not how it works? The feedback only talks about the letters we guess? 

For example: if we had guessed ""crane"" and the word had E at position3? and also at position2? Then when we place E at position5? we get a '-'? for E? because there is a wrong-position E? (either at position2 or 3? But we didn't guess position2 or 3? So we still get one '-'. 

Similarly? we have one E? So the feedback '-' covers one E? 

Therefore? we know there is exactly one E? so the word cannot have two E's? 

So ""CLEET"" would have two E's? Thus invalid? 

Therefore? position2 cannot be E? 

Therefore? valid words are with E only at position3? 

So pattern C X E Y T? with X and Y not E? and avoiding absent letters: R, A, N, O, M, H, S? 

Now? which words? 
- ""CLEFT"" → L? F
- ""CLEPT"" → L? P
- ""BLERT"" → not C? 
- ""CUBIT"" → no E? 
- ""CEDED"" → multiple E? not? 
- ""CUTEY"" → not end with T? 
- ""CIZEL"" → no? 

So ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"" are candidates? 

But to choose? We need to test the letter L? If L is present? then we can narrow? 

So we guess ""CLEFT"": 
- If correct? done? 
- If L is absent? then we get H in guess3 was absent? and L in ""CLEFT"" would be absent? and then position2 must be another letter? 
- Similarly? F would be absent? 

Then we are left with ""CLEPT""? But if L is absent? then both ""CLEFT"" and ""CLEPT"" are invalid? 

So what other words? 

Perhaps ""DIRTY"" → not start with C? 

Another word: ""CWTCH"" → not English? 

Wait? ""COYED"" → O absent? 

So maybe only two possibilities? 

Therefore? I choose ""CLEFT"" as it is more common? 

Alternatively? to avoid L? We can try ""C??E?T"" with X not L? 

For example? 
- ""CABET"" → no? 
- ""CIVET"" → no? 

""CYBER"" → no? 

Perhaps ""CUTEY"" → but doesn't end with T? 

I think we have to go with L? 

So? let's guess ""CLEFT"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C(✓): Confirmed at position 1.  
  - R(x), A(x), N(x): Absent.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""comet""**  
  - C(✓): Confirmed at position 1.  
  - O(x), M(x): Absent.  
  - E(-): Present but not in position 4 (ruling out position 4).  
  - T(✓): Confirmed at position 5.  
- **Guess 3: ""chest""**  
  - C(✓): Position 1 confirmed.  
  - H(x): Absent.  
  - E(✓): Confirmed at position 3.  
  - S(x): Absent.  
  - T(✓): Position 5 confirmed.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Pattern**: The word is `C _ E _ T`.  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 3: **E**  
   - Position 5: **T**  
2. **Letters to Solve**:  
   - **Position 2** and **Position 4** are unknown.  
3. **Absent Letters**: R, A, N, O, M, H, S (cannot be used).  
4. **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
5. **Possible Words** (using common English words):  
   - `CLEFT` (L in position 2, F in position 4).  
   - `CLEPT` (L in position 2, P in position 4).  
   - `CUBIT` (invalid: no E at position 3).  
   - `CIDET` (invalid: not a word).  
6. **Strategy**:  
   - Prioritize testing new letters (e.g., L, F, P) to gain more information.  
   - Guess **""CLEFT""**—a valid 5-letter word—to test:  
     - L in position 2 (if L is present/absent).  
     - F in position 4 (if F is present/absent).  
   - If ""CLEFT"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal properties of L and F, narrowing options (e.g., shift to ""CLEPT"" if L is present but F absent).",Guess 4: cleft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) E(✓) F(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
