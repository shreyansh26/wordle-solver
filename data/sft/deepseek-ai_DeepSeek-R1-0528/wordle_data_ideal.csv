We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' which are common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word, but not in the first position? Wait, no: the positions matter. 
   Specifically: 
     The third letter of ""crane"" is A, and we got (-) meaning A is in the word but not at that position?
   However, note the example: 
     In the example, guess ""STORM"" had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not at the first position? 
     Actually, in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", so S is at the fourth position? 
   How feedback works: 
     The feedback symbol corresponds to the guess letter at that position.

   So for ""crane"":
     Position 1: C -> x (not in word)
     Position 2: R -> x (not in word)
     Position 3: A -> - (A is in the word but not at position 3)
     Position 4: N -> x (not in word)
     Position 5: E -> - (E is in the word but not at position 5)

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letters A and E, but they are not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
   And the word does not contain C, R, or N.

 Since we have two letters we know: A and E, and they are misplaced.

 Now we need to make a second guess.

 Important: We must guess a 5-letter English word that contains A and E, and does not contain C, R, N.

 Also, note: A is not at position 3? Actually, from our guess, the A was at position 3 and it was wrong. 
   So A must be in the word, but not at position 3. Similarly, E must be in the word but not at position 5.

 What are possible positions for A? It can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But note: the word has 5 letters.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 We also want to try to get more information about other letters.

 Strategy: 
   We can try a new word that places A and E in different positions.

 Possibilities for A: positions 1, 2, 4? (since we know it's not at 3, and we don't know about others)
 Possibilities for E: positions 1,2,3,4? (since we know it's not at 5)

 However, note: if we put A at a position we've already tried? We don't know if it's correct until we get feedback.

 We should also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. 
   We've used C,R,A,N,E. 
   We know C,R,N are out.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. But we haven't tried many vowels: we have A and E, but what about I, O, U?

 But we know A and E are in the word. The word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, because it could have more? 
   But we have two vowels already: A and E.

 We should try a word that has A and E, and also includes other common letters that we haven't ruled out.

 Let me think of words that have A and E.

 Example: ""ALIVE"", but let's check the positions and the letters.
   A at position 1, E at position 4? But our feedback says E is not at position 5? We have no prohibition on E at position 4? 
   Also, we have to avoid C,R,N.

 Word ""ALIVE"": 
   A at position 1? We don't know if A is at position 1 or not? It might be.
   But note: the word must not have C,R,N.

   Let me check: A, L, I, V, E -> does not have C,R,N.

   Now, what about positions: 
     In our previous guess, A was at position 3 and got misplaced. So if we put A at position 1 in this guess, and if the secret word's A is at position 1, we'll get a checkmark. Otherwise, if it's not, we'll get a minus for A again.

   Similarly, E is at position 5 in the secret word? Note: our first word had E at position 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the secret word but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Then we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually we can, but it's ruled out? 

   Actually, the feedback told us that E is not at position 5? So it must be somewhere else? 

   Therefore, E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

   So in ""ALIVE"":
     Position 1: A -> we don't know
     Position 2: L
     Position 3: I
     Position 4: V
     Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that would be bad? 

   If we guess a word with E at position 5 again? It will be marked as either:
     Correct? But we know it's not at position 5? Or wait, could the feedback be inconsistent? 
     Actually, no: the feedback says E is not at position 5? That doesn't mean it's in the word? So if we put E at position 5 again, we expect an 'x'? 
     But note: the feedback symbol for E in the first guess was '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that position? 
     So if we put E at position 5 again, it will again be '-' because it's in the word? Or wait, might we get '-' again? 

   Actually, no: the '-' says the letter is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has E at position 5? Then we would get a check? But we didn't? So E is not at position 5? Then if we put E at position 5 again, we should get a '-' again? Because the letter E is still in the word? So it would be an error to put it at 5? 

   We don't want to waste a slot? We want to try E at a different position.

   So ""ALIVE"" has E at the end? That's position 5? So we shouldn't do that? 

   What about ""LATER""? But R is excluded? Because from our first guess, R was at position 2? and we got an 'x' meaning R is not in the word? So we cannot use R? 

   What about ""SALET""? It's a word? Meaning a type of helmet? But note: we have S,A,L,E,T? 
   Positions: 
     Position 1: S
     Position 2: A -> but we can try A at position 2? 
     Position 3: L
     Position 4: E
     Position 5: T

   Now, check against our constraints:
     A: not at position 3? But we are putting it at position 2? That's allowed? 
        We know A is in the word? but not at position 3? We are trying position 2? 
     E: not at position 5? And we are putting it at position 4? That's a different position? good? 

   Also, letters: no C,R,N? SALET: letters are S,A,L,E,T -> none of C,R,N? So valid? 

   But note: we are not forced to use all known letters? We should use A and E? Because they are in the word.

   Also, we can try to cover new letters: S, L, T? 

   So I think ""SALET"" is a good choice? 

   However, let me think: what if the word is something else? 

   Another idea: ""STEAL""? 
     Positions: 
        1: S
        2: T
        3: E -> wait, E at position 3? 
        4: A -> because we know A is not at position 3? 
        5: L

     But note: we have no constraint on E? Why not? Only that it is in the word and not at position 5? So position 3 might be possible? 
     Also, the word would have E at position 3? and A at position 4? 

     And we are using S,T,E,A,L? So new letters T,L? 

     That also avoids C,R,N? 

   So both ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"" are options.

   But note: we can't put A at position 3? So in ""STEAL"", we put A at position 4? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   Let me see: we want to test E at another position? Position 3 is new? 

   Similarly, we want to test A at another position? Position 4? 

   Also, we get to try S, T, L? 

   How about frequency? 

   Another word: ""PLATE""? But P is less common? 

   Or ""STALE""? 
     S, T, A, L, E? 
     Positions: 
        S at 1
        T at 2
        A at 3 -> Wait, but wait: we know A is not at position 3? because we got A at position 3 in the first guess and it was misplaced? 
            Does that mean A cannot be at position 3? 
            Actually, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So A is at position 1,2,4, or 5? 
            But we put A at position 3 again? Then we would expect a minus again? 
            Why waste? We can try a position that hasn't been tried? 

        And E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we don't want E at 5.

   So ""STALE"" would have E at 5? That's bad? 

   Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems better: 
        S at 1
        T at 2
        E at 3 -> testing E at 3? 
        A at 4 -> testing A at 4? 
        L at 5

   This way we are testing A and E at positions not previously tested? 

   But note: the previous feedback told us that A is not at position 3? But that was the only slot we tested for A? 
   Similarly for E: only at position 5? 

   So:

   Option 1: SALET -> S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5? 
   Option 2: STEAL -> S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

   Both avoid E at 5? 

   But ""SALET"" is more likely? Actually, I don't know? 

   There is also ""LEAST"": 
        L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3? We have to avoid that? Because we already know A is not at 3? 
        But wait: ""LEAST"" has A at 3? That's the same mistake? 

   So avoid any word that puts A at 3? 

   Therefore, the two options above are good? 

   I'll go with ""STEAL"", because:

   Why? It puts E at position 3? and A at position 4? Both different from previous? 
   So we cover:

     If at position 3, E is correct? Then we know? 
     If A is at position 4? Then we know? 

   Also, we add S, T, L? 

   Alternatively, ""STALE"" doesn't work because of E at 5? 

   Another option: ""ADIEU""? But that has D,I,U? And we don't know if they are common? And also we are not testing positions that avoid? 
        A at 1? and E at 4? 
        But we are using D,I,U? 
        Also, note: we don't know if the word has I? 

   But I think ""STEAL"" is better.

   So second guess: STEAL

   Let me confirm: STEAL is a valid word? 
        steal: to take something without permission? 

   Yes.

   Therefore, I will guess STEAL.

   We'll see the feedback to get more information.

 Important: We must output the guess in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked ""-"").
- The secret word contains A and E, with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.
- New guess should include A and E in positions other than 3 and 5, avoid C/R/N, and introduce common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L).

Selecting ""STEAL"" for the second guess:
- S (new letter) at position 1
- T (new letter) at position 2
- E (known letter, previously misplaced) tested at position 3
- A (known letter, previously misplaced) tested at position 4
- L (new letter) at position 5
- Avoids C/R/N and positions known to be incorrect for A (3) and E (5).

 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word, but not in the first position? Wait, no: the positions matter.

     The third letter of ""crane"" is A, and we got (-) meaning A is in the word but not at that position?

     Position 5: E -> - (E is in the word but not at position 5)

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letters A and E, but they are not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
   And the word does not contain C, R, or N.

 Since we have two letters we know: A and E, and they are misplaced.

 Now we need to make a second guess.

 Important: We must guess a 5-letter English word that contains A and E, and does not contain C, R, N.

 Also, note: A is not at position 3? Actually, from our guess, the A was at position 3 and it was wrong. 
   So A must be in the word, but not at position 3. Similarly, E must be in the word but not at position 5.

 What are possible positions for A? It can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But note: the word has 5 letters.

 However, note: if we put A at a position we've already tried? We don't know if it's correct until we get feedback.

 We should also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. 
   We've used C,R,A,N,E. 
   We know C,R,N are out.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. But we haven't tried many vowels: we have A and E, but what about I, O, U?

   But note: the word must not have C,R,N.

   Let me check: A, L, I, V, E -> does not have C,R,N.

   Now, what about positions: 
     In our previous guess, A was at position 3 and got misplaced. So if we put A at position 1 in this guess, and if the secret word's A is at position 1, we'll get a checkmark. Otherwise, if it's not, we'll get a minus for A again.

   Similarly, E is at position 5 in the secret word? Note: our first word had E at position 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the secret word but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Then we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually we can, but it's ruled out? 

   Actually, the feedback told us that E is not at position 5? So it must be somewhere else? 

   Therefore, E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

   So in ""ALIVE"":
     Position 1: A -> we don't know
     Position 2: L
     Position 3: I
     Position 4: V
     Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that would be bad? 

   If we guess a word with E at position 5 again? It will be marked as either:

   What about ""SALET""? It's a word? Meaning a type of helmet? But note: we have S,A,L,E,T? 
   Positions: 
     Position 1: S
     Position 2: A -> but we can try A at position 2? 
     Position 3: L
     Position 4: E

   Now, check against our constraints:

        We know A is in the word? but not at position 3? We are trying position 2?

   Also, letters: no C,R,N? SALET: letters are S,A,L,E,T -> none of C,R,N? So valid? 

   But note: we are not forced to use all known letters? We should use A and E? Because they are in the word.

        4: A -> because we know A is not at position 3? 
        5: L

     But note: we have no constraint on E? Why not? Only that it is in the word and not at position 5? So position 3 might be possible? 
     Also, the word would have E at position 3? and A at position 4? 

     And we are using S,T,E,A,L? So new letters T,L? 

     That also avoids C,R,N? 

   So both ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"" are options.

   But note: we can't put A at position 3? So in ""STEAL"", we put A at position 4? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   Let me see: we want to test E at another position? Position 3 is new? 

   Similarly, we want to test A at another position? Position 4? 

   Also, we get to try S, T, L? 

   How about frequency? 

   Another word: ""PLATE""? But P is less common? 

   Or ""STALE""? 
     S, T, A, L, E? 
     Positions: 
        S at 1
        T at 2
        A at 3 -> Wait, but wait: we know A is not at position 3? because we got A at position 3 in the first guess and it was misplaced? 
            Does that mean A cannot be at position 3? 
            Actually, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So A is at position 1,2,4, or 5? 
            But we put A at position 3 again? Then we would expect a minus again? 
            Why waste? We can try a position that hasn't been tried? 

        And E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we don't want E at 5.

   So ""STALE"" would have E at 5? That's bad? 

   Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems better: 
        S at 1
        T at 2
        E at 3 -> testing E at 3? 
        A at 4 -> testing A at 4? 
        L at 5

   This way we are testing A and E at positions not previously tested? 

   But note: the previous feedback told us that A is not at position 3? But that was the only slot we tested for A? 
   Similarly for E: only at position 5? 

   So:

   Option 1: SALET -> S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5? 
   Option 2: STEAL -> S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

   Both avoid E at 5? 

   But ""SALET"" is more likely? Actually, I don't know? 

   There is also ""LEAST"": 
        L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3? We have to avoid that? Because we already know A is not at 3? 
        But wait: ""LEAST"" has A at 3? That's the same mistake? 

   So avoid any word that puts A at 3? 

   Therefore, the two options above are good? 

   I'll go with ""STEAL"", because:

   Why? It puts E at position 3? and A at position 4? Both different from previous? 
   So we cover:

     If at position 3, E is correct? Then we know? 
     If A is at position 4? Then we know? 

   Also, we add S, T, L? 

   Alternatively, ""STALE"" doesn't work because of E at 5? 

   Another option: ""ADIEU""? But that has D,I,U? And we don't know if they are common? And also we are not testing positions that avoid? 
        A at 1? and E at 4? 
        But we are using D,I,U? 
        Also, note: we don't know if the word has I? 

   But I think ""STEAL"" is better.

   So second guess: STEAL

   Let me confirm: STEAL is a valid word? 
        steal: to take something without permission? 

   Yes.

   Therefore, I will guess STEAL.

   We'll see the feedback to get more information.

 Important: We must output the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked ""-"").
- The secret word contains A and E, with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.
- New guess should include A and E in positions other than 3 and 5, avoid C/R/N, and introduce common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L).

Selecting ""STEAL"" for the second guess:
- S (new letter) at position 1
- T (new letter) at position 2
- E (known letter, previously misplaced) tested at position 3
- A (known letter, previously misplaced) tested at position 4
- L (new letter) at position 5

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ideal,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' which are common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word, but not in the first position? Wait, no: the positions matter. 
   Specifically: 
     The third letter of ""crane"" is A, and we got (-) meaning A is in the word but not at that position?
   However, note the example: 
     In the example, guess ""STORM"" had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not at the first position? 
     Actually, in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", so S is at the fourth position? 
   How feedback works: 
     The feedback symbol corresponds to the guess letter at that position.

   So for ""crane"":
     Position 1: C -> x (not in word)
     Position 2: R -> x (not in word)
     Position 3: A -> - (A is in the word but not at position 3)
     Position 4: N -> x (not in word)
     Position 5: E -> - (E is in the word but not at position 5)

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word contains the letters A and E, but they are not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
   And the word does not contain C, R, or N.

 Since we have two letters we know: A and E, and they are misplaced.

 Now we need to make a second guess.

 Important: We must guess a 5-letter English word that contains A and E, and does not contain C, R, N.

 Also, note: A is not at position 3? Actually, from our guess, the A was at position 3 and it was wrong. 
   So A must be in the word, but not at position 3. Similarly, E must be in the word but not at position 5.

 What are possible positions for A? It can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But note: the word has 5 letters.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 We also want to try to get more information about other letters.

 Strategy: 
   We can try a new word that places A and E in different positions.

 Possibilities for A: positions 1, 2, 4? (since we know it's not at 3, and we don't know about others)
 Possibilities for E: positions 1,2,3,4? (since we know it's not at 5)

 However, note: if we put A at a position we've already tried? We don't know if it's correct until we get feedback.

 We should also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. 
   We've used C,R,A,N,E. 
   We know C,R,N are out.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. But we haven't tried many vowels: we have A and E, but what about I, O, U?

 But we know A and E are in the word. The word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, because it could have more? 
   But we have two vowels already: A and E.

 We should try a word that has A and E, and also includes other common letters that we haven't ruled out.

 Let me think of words that have A and E.

 Example: ""ALIVE"", but let's check the positions and the letters.
   A at position 1, E at position 4? But our feedback says E is not at position 5? We have no prohibition on E at position 4? 
   Also, we have to avoid C,R,N.

 Word ""ALIVE"": 
   A at position 1? We don't know if A is at position 1 or not? It might be.
   But note: the word must not have C,R,N.

   Let me check: A, L, I, V, E -> does not have C,R,N.

   Now, what about positions: 
     In our previous guess, A was at position 3 and got misplaced. So if we put A at position 1 in this guess, and if the secret word's A is at position 1, we'll get a checkmark. Otherwise, if it's not, we'll get a minus for A again.

   Similarly, E is at position 5 in the secret word? Note: our first word had E at position 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the secret word but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Then we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually we can, but it's ruled out? 

   Actually, the feedback told us that E is not at position 5? So it must be somewhere else? 

   Therefore, E must be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

   So in ""ALIVE"":
     Position 1: A -> we don't know
     Position 2: L
     Position 3: I
     Position 4: V
     Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that would be bad? 

   If we guess a word with E at position 5 again? It will be marked as either:
     Correct? But we know it's not at position 5? Or wait, could the feedback be inconsistent? 
     Actually, no: the feedback says E is not at position 5? That doesn't mean it's in the word? So if we put E at position 5 again, we expect an 'x'? 
     But note: the feedback symbol for E in the first guess was '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that position? 
     So if we put E at position 5 again, it will again be '-' because it's in the word? Or wait, might we get '-' again? 

   Actually, no: the '-' says the letter is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has E at position 5? Then we would get a check? But we didn't? So E is not at position 5? Then if we put E at position 5 again, we should get a '-' again? Because the letter E is still in the word? So it would be an error to put it at 5? 

   We don't want to waste a slot? We want to try E at a different position.

   So ""ALIVE"" has E at the end? That's position 5? So we shouldn't do that? 

   What about ""LATER""? But R is excluded? Because from our first guess, R was at position 2? and we got an 'x' meaning R is not in the word? So we cannot use R? 

   What about ""SALET""? It's a word? Meaning a type of helmet? But note: we have S,A,L,E,T? 
   Positions: 
     Position 1: S
     Position 2: A -> but we can try A at position 2? 
     Position 3: L
     Position 4: E
     Position 5: T

   Now, check against our constraints:
     A: not at position 3? But we are putting it at position 2? That's allowed? 
        We know A is in the word? but not at position 3? We are trying position 2? 
     E: not at position 5? And we are putting it at position 4? That's a different position? good? 

   Also, letters: no C,R,N? SALET: letters are S,A,L,E,T -> none of C,R,N? So valid? 

   But note: we are not forced to use all known letters? We should use A and E? Because they are in the word.

   Also, we can try to cover new letters: S, L, T? 

   So I think ""SALET"" is a good choice? 

   However, let me think: what if the word is something else? 

   Another idea: ""STEAL""? 
     Positions: 
        1: S
        2: T
        3: E -> wait, E at position 3? 
        4: A -> because we know A is not at position 3? 
        5: L

     But note: we have no constraint on E? Why not? Only that it is in the word and not at position 5? So position 3 might be possible? 
     Also, the word would have E at position 3? and A at position 4? 

     And we are using S,T,E,A,L? So new letters T,L? 

     That also avoids C,R,N? 

   So both ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"" are options.

   But note: we can't put A at position 3? So in ""STEAL"", we put A at position 4? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   Let me see: we want to test E at another position? Position 3 is new? 

   Similarly, we want to test A at another position? Position 4? 

   Also, we get to try S, T, L? 

   How about frequency? 

   Another word: ""PLATE""? But P is less common? 

   Or ""STALE""? 
     S, T, A, L, E? 
     Positions: 
        S at 1
        T at 2
        A at 3 -> Wait, but wait: we know A is not at position 3? because we got A at position 3 in the first guess and it was misplaced? 
            Does that mean A cannot be at position 3? 
            Actually, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So A is at position 1,2,4, or 5? 
            But we put A at position 3 again? Then we would expect a minus again? 
            Why waste? We can try a position that hasn't been tried? 

        And E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we don't want E at 5.

   So ""STALE"" would have E at 5? That's bad? 

   Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems better: 
        S at 1
        T at 2
        E at 3 -> testing E at 3? 
        A at 4 -> testing A at 4? 
        L at 5

   This way we are testing A and E at positions not previously tested? 

   But note: the previous feedback told us that A is not at position 3? But that was the only slot we tested for A? 
   Similarly for E: only at position 5? 

   So:

   Option 1: SALET -> S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5? 
   Option 2: STEAL -> S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

   Both avoid E at 5? 

   But ""SALET"" is more likely? Actually, I don't know? 

   There is also ""LEAST"": 
        L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3? We have to avoid that? Because we already know A is not at 3? 
        But wait: ""LEAST"" has A at 3? That's the same mistake? 

   So avoid any word that puts A at 3? 

   Therefore, the two options above are good? 

   I'll go with ""STEAL"", because:

   Why? It puts E at position 3? and A at position 4? Both different from previous? 
   So we cover:

     If at position 3, E is correct? Then we know? 
     If A is at position 4? Then we know? 

   Also, we add S, T, L? 

   Alternatively, ""STALE"" doesn't work because of E at 5? 

   Another option: ""ADIEU""? But that has D,I,U? And we don't know if they are common? And also we are not testing positions that avoid? 
        A at 1? and E at 4? 
        But we are using D,I,U? 
        Also, note: we don't know if the word has I? 

   But I think ""STEAL"" is better.

   So second guess: STEAL

   Let me confirm: STEAL is a valid word? 
        steal: to take something without permission? 

   Yes.

   Therefore, I will guess STEAL.

   We'll see the feedback to get more information.

 Important: We must output the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

But note: we have S,A,L,E,T? \n   Positions: \n     Position 1: S\n     Position 2: A -> but we can try A at position 2? \n     Position 3: L\n     Position 4: E\n     Position 5: T\n\n   Now, check against our constraints:\n     A: not at position 3? But we are putting it at position 2? That\'s allowed? \n        We know A is in the word? but not at position 3? We are trying position 2? \n     E: not at position 5? And we are putting it at position 4? That\'s a different position? good? \n\n   Also, letters: no C,R,N? SALET: letters are S,A,L,E,T -> none of C,R,N? So valid? \n\n   But note: we are not forced to use all known letters? We should use A and E? Because they are in the word.\n\n   Also, we can try to cover new letters: S, L, T? \n\n   So I think ""SALET"" is a good choice? \n\n   However, let me think: what if the word is something else? \n\n   Another idea: ""STEAL""? \n     Positions: \n        1: S\n        2: T\n        3: E -> wait, E at position 3? \n        4: A -> because we know A is not at position 3? \n        5: L\n\n     But note: we have no constraint on E? Why not? Only that it is in the word and not at position 5? So position 3 might be possible? \n     Also, the word would have E at position 3? and A at position 4? \n\n     And we are using S,T,E,A,L? So new letters T,L? \n\n     That also avoids C,R,N? \n\n   So both ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"" are options.\n\n   But note: we can\'t put A at position 3? So in ""STEAL"", we put A at position 4? \n\n   Also, E at position 3? \n\n   Let me see: we want to test E at another position? Position 3 is new? \n\n   Similarly, we want to test A at another position? Position 4? \n\n   Also, we get to try S, T, L? \n\n   How about frequency? \n\n   Another word: ""PLATE""? But P is less common? \n\n   Or ""STALE""? \n     S, T, A, L, E? \n     Positions: \n        S at 1\n        T at 2\n        A at 3 -> Wait, but wait: we know A is not at position 3? because we got A at position 3 in the first guess and it was misplaced? \n            Does that mean A cannot be at position 3? \n            Actually, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So A is at position 1,2,4, or 5? \n            But we put A at position 3 again? Then we would expect a minus again? \n            Why waste? We can try a position that hasn\'t been tried? \n\n        And E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we don\'t want E at 5.\n\n   So ""STALE"" would have E at 5? That\'s bad? \n\n   Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems better: \n        S at 1\n        T at 2\n        E at 3 -> testing E at 3? \n        A at 4 -> testing A at 4? \n        L at 5\n\n   This way we are testing A and E at positions not previously tested? \n\n   But note: the previous feedback told us that A is not at position 3? But that was the only slot we tested for A? \n   Similarly for E: only at position 5? \n\n   So:\n\n   Option 1: SALET -> S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5? \n   Option 2: STEAL -> S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.\n\n   Both avoid E at 5? \n\n   But ""SALET"" is more likely? Actually, I don\'t know? \n\n   There is also ""LEAST"": \n        L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3? We have to avoid that? Because we already know A is not at 3? \n        But wait: ""LEAST"" has A at 3? That\'s the same mistake? \n\n   So avoid any word that puts A at 3? \n\n   Therefore, the two options above are good? \n\n   I\'ll go with ""STEAL"", because:\n\n   Why? It puts E at position 3? and A at position 4? Both different from previous? \n   So we cover:\n\n     If at position 3, E is correct? Then we know? \n     If A is at position 4? Then we know? \n\n   Also, we add S, T, L? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STALE"" doesn\'t work because of E at 5? \n\n   Another option: ""ADIEU""? But that has D,I,U? And we don\'t know if they are common? And also we are not testing positions that avoid? \n        A at 1? and E at 4? \n        But we are using D,I,U? \n        Also, note: we don\'t know if the word has I? \n\n   But I think ""STEAL"" is better.\n\n   So second guess: STEAL\n\n   Let me confirm: STEAL is a valid word? \n        steal: to take something without permission? \n\n   Yes.\n\n   Therefore, I will guess STEAL.\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback to get more information.\n\n Important: We must output the guess in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked ""-"").\n- The secret word contains A and E, with A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.\n- New guess should include A and E in positions other than 3 and 5, avoid C/R/N, and introduce common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L).\n\nSelecting ""STEAL"" for the second guess:\n- S (new letter) at position 1\n- T (new letter) at position 2\n- E (known letter, previously misplaced) tested at position 3\n- A (known letter, previously misplaced) tested at position 4\n- L (new letter) at position 5\n- Avoids C/R/N and positions known to be incorrect for A (3) and E (5).\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

So we know:
  The secret word contains A and E, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
  The word does not contain C, R, or N.

Guess 2: ""steal"" ->
  S: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (correct, so E is at position 3)
  A: ✓ (correct, so A is at position 4)
  L: ✓ (correct, so L is at position 5)

Therefore, we now know:
  The secret word has:
    Position 3: E
    Position 4: A
    Position 5: L

And we also know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, T.

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

We know the word is: _ _ E A L

We also know that A is at position 4 (so it cannot be at any other position) and E at position 3 (so it cannot be elsewhere). Also, we know that the word does not contain C, R, N, S, T.

We have two positions to fill: positions 1 and 2.

We must choose two letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, S, T} and form a valid English word.

We also know from the first guess that A was not at position 3 (which we now know is E) and E was not at position 5 (which we now know is L). That is consistent.

Now, what letters can we use? We have used: A, E, L (which are in the word) and we have excluded: C, R, N, S, T.

We can use any other letters of the alphabet.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1][letter2]EAL

Common words ending with EAL: 
  IDEAL, but we have I and D? 
  Other possibilities: REAL (but R is excluded), SEAL (S is excluded), TEAL (T is excluded), VEAL, WEAL, etc.

But we cannot use R, S, T.

So let's list possible words:

- VEAL: V at 1, E at 2? But wait, the word is [1][2]EAL, so VEAL would be V at 1, E at 2? But then the word would be V E A L? But we have positions: 
  Position 1: V
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: E? But we have E at position 3? That would be V E E A L? That's not VEAL. 

We must have the last three letters as E, A, L? So the word must be ? ? E A L.

So the word is of the form: ??EAL

Now, VEAL is V-E-A-L, which would be positions: 
  1: V
  2: E
  3: A? But we have position 3 as E? So that doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be E? So the word must have the third letter as E? 

Therefore, the word is: [letter1][letter2] E A L

So the first two letters are the first two, then E at third, A at fourth, L at fifth.

Examples of such words:

- IDEAL: I at 1, D at 2, then E, A, L -> so I D E A L -> that matches the pattern: positions 1:I, 2:D, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L.

- Other words: 
  - ORDEAL? But that's 6 letters? Not 5.
  - CORRAL? Not 5 and doesn't end with EAL? 
  - We need 5-letter words.

Let me think of 5-letter words ending with EAL? 

Actually, the word is fixed at positions 3,4,5: E, A, L.

So we need two letters at the beginning.

Possible words:

- IDEAL: I, D
- VEAL: but that would be V, E, A, L? But then the third letter is A? Not E? So that doesn't work? 
  VEAL is V-E-A-L -> positions: 1:V, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L? But we have position 3 as E? So no.

- WEAL: W, E, A, L -> same issue: 1:W, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L? But we need position 3 to be E? So no.

- DEAL: D, E, A, L -> 4 letters? We need 5.

We need 5-letter words with the pattern __EAL.

So:

- IDEAL: I, D, E, A, L -> that works? 
  But note: we have two letters at the beginning: I and D.

- Other words: 
  - SQUEAL? 6 letters.
  - APPEAL? 6 letters.

- What about ""HELLO""? Doesn't end with EAL.

Actually, let me search my vocabulary: 

Common 5-letter words with the pattern ??EAL:

- IDEAL (as above)
- CORAL? But that ends with ORAL? Not EAL.

- REALM? But that ends with ALM? Not EAL.

- Maybe ""TELL"" is 4 letters.

It seems IDEAL is the most common.

But are there others?

- FEAST? Doesn't end with EAL.

- MEALY? Ends with ALY.

I think IDEAL is a strong candidate.

But let's check the letters we have excluded: we cannot use C, R, N, S, T.

In IDEAL, we use I and D? Neither of these are excluded? 

So IDEAL: 
  Position 1: I -> not excluded? 
  Position 2: D -> not excluded? 
  Position 3: E -> known correct? 
  Position 4: A -> known correct? 
  Position 5: L -> known correct? 

So we can guess IDEAL.

But note: we have two positions to fill? We don't know the first two? So we are guessing the entire word? 

But we know the last three are fixed? So the word must be ??EAL? and IDEAL is one possibility.

But are there others? 

Another word: ""KNEAD""? But that ends with EAD? Not EAL.

""BLEAK""? Ends with EAK.

""STEAL"" we already guessed? But that had S and T? which are excluded? and we know the secret word has E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? But STEAL has E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? But we also had S and T? which are not in the word? So the secret word is not STEAL? 

But we are looking for a word that has the last three as E, A, L? and the first two are not excluded.

Another word: ""DEALT""? But that ends with EALT? 5 letters: D-E-A-L-T? 
  Positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T? 
  But we need position 3 to be E? and position 4 to be A? and 5 to be L? 
  In DEALT: 
      position 3: A? not E? 
  So that doesn't match.

""HEALD""? Not a common word? 

""WEALD"": W-E-A-L-D? 
  Positions: 1:W, 2:E, 3:A, 4:L, 5:D? 
  But we need position 3 to be E? and 4 to be A? So that doesn't match.

So the only common word I can think of is IDEAL.

But let me double-check: 

  I D E A L -> 
    position 1: I
    position 2: D
    position 3: E -> matches
    position 4: A -> matches
    position 5: L -> matches

And we haven't used any excluded letters? 

Excluded: C, R, N, S, T? I and D are not in that set.

So we can guess IDEAL.

But note: we have only 6 tries? This is our third guess? 

Alternatively, we could try to guess a word that tests more letters? But we already know three letters? and we have two positions? 

But if we guess IDEAL, and if it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback on I and D? 

But what if the word is not IDEAL? Are there other possibilities? 

Another word: ""OVATE""? Doesn't end with EAL.

""BEADY""? Not EAL.

I think IDEAL is the only common word? 

But let me think: is there a word like ""ZEAL""? But ZEAL is Z-E-A-L? 4 letters? 

""ZEALS""? 5 letters? But that ends with EALS? which would be: 
  Z at 1, E at 2, A at 3, L at 4, S at 5? 
  But we need position 3 to be E? and 4 to be A? and 5 to be L? 
  In ZEALS: 
      position 3: A? 
      position 4: L? 
      position 5: S? 
  So that doesn't match.

""REALS""? But R and S are excluded? and also the pattern doesn't match? 

Therefore, I think IDEAL is the only common word that fits the pattern and the constraints.

So we'll guess IDEAL.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

IDEAL is a valid word.

So our third guess: IDEAL

But wait: what if the word is something else? For example, ""DEALE""? But that's not common? and doesn't end with EAL? 

Another possibility: ""MEALY""? But that ends with ALY? 

I think we are safe.

So we output: <guess>ideal</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, N are **not** in the word.  
  - A and E **are** in the word, but not at positions 3 or 5, respectively.

- **Guess 2: STEAL**  
  Feedback: S(x), T(x), E(✓), A(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and T are **not** in the word.  
  - E is **correct and in position 3**.  
  - A is **correct and in position 4**.  
  - L is **correct and in position 5**.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ E A L` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as E, A, L).  
- Excluded letters: **C, R, N, S, T** (from feedback).  
- The first two letters must be filled with letters not in the excluded set, forming a valid English word.  
- The only common 5-letter word fitting `_ _ E A L` and the constraints is **IDEAL** (I and D are not excluded).  

### Next Guess: IDEAL  
- Tests the pattern `I D E A L`:  
  - If correct, the word is solved.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on positions 1 and 2 will provide more information for subsequent guesses.
