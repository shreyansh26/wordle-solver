We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' which are common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(-)
 This means:
 - 'C' is not in the secret word.
 - 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.

 Important: Since all four letters R, A, N, E are present somewhere in the word (but not in the positions we guessed), and 'C' is absent.

 The secret word has 5 letters. We know 4 of them: R, A, N, E. The fifth letter is unknown and must not be 'C'.

 We must form a new word that includes R, A, N, E and one other letter (not C). Also, we cannot use the positions from the first guess.

 In the first guess, the positions were:
   C at position 1 -> absent
   R at position 2 -> present but wrong position
   A at position 3 -> present but wrong position
   N at position 4 -> present but wrong position
   E at position 5 -> present but wrong position

 Therefore, in the new word:
   R cannot be in position 2
   A cannot be in position 3
   N cannot be in position 4
   E cannot be in position 5

 We also know that the letters R, A, N, E must appear exactly once (unless the word has duplicates, but we don't know that yet). For now, let's assume no duplicates since the feedback didn't show any duplicate markers.

 We need to choose a word that has:
   - R, A, N, E and one other letter (say X, which is not C and not any of these four)

 Constraints for positions:
   Position 1: cannot be R? Actually, we don't know what can be in position 1 except that it's not C. It could be any of the letters we know or the new one.
   But note: feedback for R says it's not in position 2, but may be elsewhere.

 Let me list the forbidden positions per letter:
   R: position 2
   A: position 3
   N: position 4
   E: position 5

 So:
   R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
   A can be in positions 1,2,4,5.
   N can be in positions 1,2,3,5.
   E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

 We have one missing letter. We don't know what it is. So our next guess should try to place R, A, N, E in different positions and also introduce one new letter to figure out the fifth.

 Since the secret word contains R, A, N, E, we can try to rearrange them in a valid English word with one additional letter? Actually, we must include a fifth letter because we only have four known letters. So we have to guess a word with five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but without feedback we don't know if duplicates exist. However, since the feedback for each letter was separate and didn't have multiple markings, it's safe to assume that each letter appears once. Therefore, the secret word has exactly one occurrence of R, A, N, E and one other letter.

 So the word must be composed of R, A, N, E and one new letter (let's call it Y). We must not use C.

 We need to form a word that meets the positional constraints.

 Possible strategy: try a word that has the known letters in positions that are allowed and a new letter in the first position? Or wherever.

 We can consider common letters that might be the fifth. For example, consonants like T, D, S, L, etc.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, N, E and one more letter.

 Example words: 
   If we add T: ""TRAIN"" -> has T,R,A,I,N -> but we don't have I? We have E so that doesn't work.
   ""EARNT"" - not a valid word? (in American English, ""earnt"" is not standard; we use ""earned"")
   ""RENAL"" - has R,E,N,A,L -> but L is new. This word is valid and means relating to the kidneys.

 Let's check:
   R at position 1: allowed? since position 2 is forbidden, yes.
   E at position 2: forbidden? no, because E is forbidden only at position 5? Actually, feedback said E was in the word but not at position 5. Position 2 is allowed for E? We have to see if it's allowed by the constraints.

 Constraints for E: cannot be at position 5 -> so positions 1,2,3,4 are okay. So E at 2 is okay.

 Similarly for others.

 Let's try ""renal"":
   R at pos 1: allowed? R cannot be at 2 -> okay because 1 is allowed.
   E at pos 2: allowed? yes, E can be at 2.
   N at pos 3: allowed? N cannot be at 4, but position 3 is allowed? Yes, because N's forbidden position is 4 -> so 3 is okay.
   A at pos 4: allowed? A forbidden at 3, but 4 is allowed? Yes.
   L at pos 5: new letter.

 But wait, the secret word must contain R, A, N, E and one new letter. We haven't used L? So L would be the fifth letter.

 However, we must be cautious: the secret word could have duplicate letters? But let's assume no because feedback didn't show duplicates.

 Alternatively, we might use a word that puts the letters in different positions.

 Another idea: We know that the secret word has R, A, N, E and one other letter. We can try to use the same set and rearrange? But we have to include one new letter? Actually, we have to include four known and one unknown.

 Alternatively, we can try to use the known letters and one new letter to form a word.

 But note: We don't have to necessarily put all known letters in the second guess? Actually, we should because we have only 6 tries and we know 4 letters.

 So putting together: we need a word that has R, A, N, E and one other letter (which we'll pick as a common letter).

 Possible words:
   ""LARGE"" -> L (new), A, R, G (new), E -> but then we have two new letters? Wait, no: we are missing N? So must include N and all four.

 What about ""RENAL"" as I thought? It has R,E,N,A,L -> so includes all four known and adds L.

 Is ""RENAL"" a common word? It might be. Another word: ""ANVIL"" -> but missing R and E? Not good.

 Another: ""EARTH"" -> has E,A,R,T,H -> missing N? Not good.

 What about ""URINE""? But U is new, and we have R,I,N,E -> missing A? So no.

 How about ""INERT""? I,N,E,R,T -> missing A? Not good.

 ""RHYME"" -> R,H,Y,M,E -> missing A and N? No.

 We need words that have R, A, N, E and one more.

 Let me list some:
   ""RENAL"": as above -> letters: R,E,N,A,L
   ""ARNEL"" - not a word? 
   ""LEARN"": L,E,A,R,N -> This has all four: R,A,N,E and L? Wait: 
        LEARN: 
          L (new), E, A, R, N
        So it includes E, A, R, N (which are our known letters) and L as new.

 Now, check positions in LEARN:
   Position 1: L -> any? no constraint
   Position 2: E -> allowed? since E can't be at 5, and 2 is allowed? Yes.
   Position 3: A -> forbidden at 3? Wait, feedback said A was in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3? That's a problem.

 In LEARN, A is at position 3 -> which is forbidden. So invalid.

 Next: ""REALM"": R,E,A,L,M -> this has R,E,A but not N. Missing N? So no.

 ""RENAL"": 
   Position 1: R -> allowed? R cannot be at 2 -> position 1 is okay.
   Position 2: E -> allowed? E cannot be at 5 -> okay.
   Position 3: N -> allowed? N cannot be at 4 -> position 3 is okay? Yes.
   Position 4: A -> allowed? A cannot be at 3 -> position 4 is okay? Yes.
   Position 5: L -> new.

 So ""RENAL"" fits the constraints?

 But also consider: we don't know what position the fifth letter (which is missing) is in. But we are introducing L.

 Alternatively, is there a word that moves the letters more? 

 Another word: ""REIGN"" -> R,E,I,G,N -> missing A? Not good.

 ""NAIVE"" -> N,A,I,V,E -> missing R? Not good.

 ""RANGE"": R,A,N,G,E -> this has R, A, N, E and G? Yes.
   Now, positions in ""RANGE"":
      Position 1: R -> allowed? Yes (not at 2)
      Position 2: A -> allowed? A cannot be at 3 -> position 2 is allowed? Yes.
      Position 3: N -> allowed? N cannot be at 4 -> position 3 is allowed? Yes.
      Position 4: G -> new.
      Position 5: E -> forbidden? E cannot be at position 5 -> but we are placing E at position 5? That's forbidden by feedback.

 So E cannot be at 5 -> so ""RANGE"" is invalid because E is at 5.

 Let me try ""ANGER"": 
   A at 1: allowed? A forbidden at 3? position 1 is okay.
   N at 2: allowed? N forbidden at 4? position 2 is okay.
   G at 3: new.
   E at 4: allowed? E forbidden at 5? position 4 is okay.
   R at 5: allowed? R forbidden at position 2? position 5 is okay? Yes.

 So ""ANGER"" would be:
   A at 1: allowed? yes.
   N at 2: allowed? yes.
   G at 3: no constraint.
   E at 4: allowed? yes.
   R at 5: allowed? yes.

 And it uses A, N, G, E, R -> including the known R, A, N, E and G new.

 But is ""ANGER"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""NAKER"" is not a common word? I think ""ANGER"" is better.

 Another word: ""RENAL"" (if we want to include L) or ""ANGER"".

 Let me compare:

 With ""RENAL"":
   Positions: 
      R:1 -> allowed
      E:2 -> allowed
      N:3 -> allowed (N can be at 3? yes, forbidden at 4)
      A:4 -> allowed (forbidden at 3, but 4 is okay)
      L:5 -> we have no constraint on L.

 With ""ANGER"":
      A:1 -> allowed (forbidden at 3 -> okay)
      N:2 -> allowed (forbidden at 4 -> okay)
      G:3 -> any
      E:4 -> allowed (forbidden at 5 -> okay)
      R:5 -> allowed (forbidden at 2 -> okay)

 Both seem to fit.

 But note: we have a fifth letter replacement for the missing C. The secret word must have one letter that we haven't guessed? Actually, we know that C is absent and we have 4 known letters. The fifth letter is unknown.

 For maximum information, we might choose a word that contains common letters. Let's choose between L and G? G is more common? Or T?

 Alternatively, we can try to use T because it's common. Do we have a word with T?

 For example: ""LATER"" -> but missing N? No.

 ""TENOR"": T,E,N,O,R -> missing A? No.

 ""TRAIN"": T,R,A,I,N -> missing E? No.

 ""IRATE"": I,R,A,T,E -> missing N? No.

 ""WRANE"": not a word.

 It's hard to find one with T. Alternatively, S? 

 ""SNARE"": 
   S at 1 (new), N, A, R, E.
   Positions: 
      S:1 -> okay
      N:2 -> forbidden? N cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is allowed? Yes.
      A:3 -> forbidden? A cannot be at 3 -> so A at position 3 is not allowed! Invalid.

 ""INTER"": missing A.

 ""RATES"": R,A,T,E,S -> missing N.

 So, we might stick with ""ANGER"" or ""RENAL"". Alternatively, ""LEARN"" but we saw that A is at position 3 which is forbidden.

 Another word: ""NEARL"" - not a word.
               ""VEENA"" -> not common and E repeated? 

 How about ""DRAIN"": missing E.

 Let me look for words that have R, A, N, E and S? 
   ""SNARE"" - invalid because A must not be at 3? And in SNARE A is at 3? Yes, so invalid.

 ""RENAS"" - not a word? 

 Another possibility: ""REALM"" but missing N.

 Considering the constraints, I'll go with ""ANGER"". It is a common word and places E at 4 (allowed) and R at 5 (allowed).

 But wait: feedback from the first guess said that R is in the word but not at position 2. In ANGER, R is at position 5? That's acceptable.

 Similarly, we are introducing G. If the secret word doesn't have G, we'll get x for G.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RENAL"". But let me pick ""ANGER"". It starts with A which is a common letter? Also, note that in the first guess A was at position 3 and feedback said it was present but wrong position. So we are now putting A at position 1.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ANGER"".

 Let me re-express: the secret word has R (not at pos2), A (not at pos3), N (not at pos4), E (not at pos5). Also, we are placing G at pos3.

 Now, if we guess ""ANGER"", the feedback might tell us:

   If A is at the correct position? It might be.

   Also, what if R is at position 5? Then R would be marked correct? We'll see.

 Conclusion: Guess ""ANGER""

<guess>anger</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- ""C"" is absent from the secret word  
- ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are present but in incorrect positions  
- Specifically: R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at position 4, E cannot be at position 5  

For the next guess:  
- Must include all known letters (R, A, N, E) plus one new letter  
- The new letter should be a common English consonant (not C)  
- Positions must comply with feedback constraints:  
  - R: allowed at positions 1,3,4,5  
  - A: allowed at positions 1,2,4,5  
  - N: allowed at positions 1,2,3,5  
  - E: allowed at positions 1,2,3,4  

The word ""ANGER"" fits perfectly:  
- A (position 1): allowed (previously incorrect at position 3)  
- N (position 2): allowed (previously incorrect at position 4)  
- G (new letter at position 3)  
- E (position 4): allowed (previously incorrect at position 5)  
- R (position 5): allowed (previously incorrect at position 2)  

This guess tests all known letters in new positions while introducing the common letter ""G"" for additional information.

 This means:
 - 'C' is not in the secret word.
 - 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.

 The secret word has 5 letters. We know 4 of them: R, A, N, E. The fifth letter is unknown and must not be 'C'.

 Therefore, in the new word:

 So:

 Now, check positions in LEARN:
   Position 1: L -> any? no constraint
   Position 2: E -> allowed? since E can't be at 5, and 2 is allowed? Yes.
   Position 3: A -> forbidden at 3? Wait, feedback said A was in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3? That's a problem.

 In LEARN, A is at position 3 -> which is forbidden. So invalid.

 Next: ""REALM"": R,E,A,L,M -> this has R,E,A but not N. Missing N? So no.

 ""RENAL"": 
   Position 1: R -> allowed? R cannot be at 2 -> position 1 is okay.
   Position 2: E -> allowed? E cannot be at 5 -> okay.
   Position 3: N -> allowed? N cannot be at 4 -> position 3 is okay? Yes.
   Position 4: A -> allowed? A cannot be at 3 -> position 4 is okay? Yes.
   Position 5: L -> new.

 So ""RENAL"" fits the constraints?

 But also consider: we don't know what position the fifth letter (which is missing) is in. But we are introducing L.

 Alternatively, is there a word that moves the letters more? 

 Another word: ""REIGN"" -> R,E,I,G,N -> missing A? Not good.

 ""NAIVE"" -> N,A,I,V,E -> missing R? Not good.

 ""RANGE"": R,A,N,G,E -> this has R, A, N, E and G? Yes.
   Now, positions in ""RANGE"":
      Position 1: R -> allowed? Yes (not at 2)
      Position 2: A -> allowed? A cannot be at 3 -> position 2 is allowed? Yes.
      Position 3: N -> allowed? N cannot be at 4 -> position 3 is allowed? Yes.
      Position 4: G -> new.
      Position 5: E -> forbidden? E cannot be at position 5 -> but we are placing E at position 5? That's forbidden by feedback.

 So E cannot be at 5 -> so ""RANGE"" is invalid because E is at 5.

 Let me try ""ANGER"": 
   A at 1: allowed? A forbidden at 3? position 1 is okay.
   N at 2: allowed? N forbidden at 4? position 2 is okay.
   G at 3: new.
   E at 4: allowed? E forbidden at 5? position 4 is okay.
   R at 5: allowed? R forbidden at position 2? position 5 is okay? Yes.

 So ""ANGER"" would be:
   A at 1: allowed? yes.
   N at 2: allowed? yes.
   G at 3: no constraint.
   E at 4: allowed? yes.
   R at 5: allowed? yes.

 And it uses A, N, G, E, R -> including the known R, A, N, E and G new.

 But is ""ANGER"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""NAKER"" is not a common word? I think ""ANGER"" is better.

 Another word: ""RENAL"" (if we want to include L) or ""ANGER"".

 Let me compare:

 With ""RENAL"":
   Positions: 
      R:1 -> allowed
      E:2 -> allowed
      N:3 -> allowed (N can be at 3? yes, forbidden at 4)
      A:4 -> allowed (forbidden at 3, but 4 is okay)
      L:5 -> we have no constraint on L.

 With ""ANGER"":
      A:1 -> allowed (forbidden at 3 -> okay)
      N:2 -> allowed (forbidden at 4 -> okay)
      G:3 -> any
      E:4 -> allowed (forbidden at 5 -> okay)
      R:5 -> allowed (forbidden at 2 -> okay)

 Both seem to fit.

 But note: we have a fifth letter replacement for the missing C. The secret word must have one letter that we haven't guessed? Actually, we know that C is absent and we have 4 known letters. The fifth letter is unknown.

 For maximum information, we might choose a word that contains common letters. Let's choose between L and G? G is more common? Or T?

 Alternatively, we can try to use T because it's common. Do we have a word with T?

 For example: ""LATER"" -> but missing N? No.

 ""TENOR"": T,E,N,O,R -> missing A? No.

 ""TRAIN"": T,R,A,I,N -> missing E? No.

 ""IRATE"": I,R,A,T,E -> missing N? No.

 ""WRANE"": not a word.

 It's hard to find one with T. Alternatively, S? 

 ""SNARE"": 
   S at 1 (new), N, A, R, E.
   Positions: 
      S:1 -> okay
      N:2 -> forbidden? N cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is allowed? Yes.
      A:3 -> forbidden? A cannot be at 3 -> so A at position 3 is not allowed! Invalid.

 ""INTER"": missing A.

 ""RATES"": R,A,T,E,S -> missing N.

 So, we might stick with ""ANGER"" or ""RENAL"". Alternatively, ""LEARN"" but we saw that A is at position 3 which is forbidden.

 Another word: ""NEARL"" - not a word.
               ""VEENA"" -> not common and E repeated? 

 How about ""DRAIN"": missing E.

 Let me look for words that have R, A, N, E and S? 
   ""SNARE"" - invalid because A must not be at 3? And in SNARE A is at 3? Yes, so invalid.

 ""RENAS"" - not a word? 

 Another possibility: ""REALM"" but missing N.

 Considering the constraints, I'll go with ""ANGER"". It is a common word and places E at 4 (allowed) and R at 5 (allowed).

 But wait: feedback from the first guess said that R is in the word but not at position 2. In ANGER, R is at position 5? That's acceptable.

 Similarly, we are introducing G. If the secret word doesn't have G, we'll get x for G.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RENAL"". But let me pick ""ANGER"". It starts with A which is a common letter? Also, note that in the first guess A was at position 3 and feedback said it was present but wrong position. So we are now putting A at position 1.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ANGER"".

 Let me re-express: the secret word has R (not at pos2), A (not at pos3), N (not at pos4), E (not at pos5). Also, we are placing G at pos3.

 Now, if we guess ""ANGER"", the feedback might tell us:

   If A is at the correct position? It might be.

   Also, what if R is at position 5? Then R would be marked correct? We'll see.

 Conclusion: Guess ""ANGER""

<guess>anger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- ""C"" is absent from the secret word  
- ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are present but in incorrect positions  
- Specifically: R cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at position 4, E cannot be at position 5  

For the next guess:  
- Must include all known letters (R, A, N, E) plus one new letter  
- The new letter should be a common English consonant (not C)  
- Positions must comply with feedback constraints:  
  - R: allowed at positions 1,3,4,5  
  - A: allowed at positions 1,2,4,5  
  - N: allowed at positions 1,2,3,5  
  - E: allowed at positions 1,2,3,4  

The word ""ANGER"" fits perfectly:  
- A (position 1): allowed (previously incorrect at position 3)  
- N (position 2): allowed (previously incorrect at position 4)  
- G (new letter at position 3)  
- E (position 4): allowed (previously incorrect at position 5)  
- R (position 5): allowed (previously incorrect at position 2)  

This guess tests all known letters in new positions while introducing the common letter ""G"" for additional information.",Guess 2: anger -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(✓) G(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
