 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, N are absent, we can eliminate these letters from consideration.
 E is present but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it was the last letter and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not at the end).

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We know the secret word contains an 'E' but not at the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N.
   - Contains the letter E, but not at the 5th position.

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

 We should try to include E in one of the first four positions and use other common letters that are not in the excluded list (C,R,A,N).

 Some good starting letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 We can try words like:
   - ""SPIEL"" -> but we don't know if P, I, L are in the word? However, we haven't tried them.
   - ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L. But note: E is in the 4th position? We need to avoid the 5th for E.

 However, note that the feedback for E was a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position. So we can put E in positions 1-4.

 Let's try to form a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some options:
   - ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have S, T, L. But note: we have two E's and we only know one E is present. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.
   - ""BELIE"" -> has two E's again.

 We want to use distinct letters if possible to get more information.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   - S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th. But we don't know if the word has E in the 4th? We are just trying to cover new letters.

 However, note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N. So we have many letters left.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said it's not in the 5th position. So we must avoid the 5th position for E.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that end with E.

 Let's try ""TABLE"": 
   - T, A, B, L, E -> but A is excluded! We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and marked absent.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So ""TABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 How about ""TOILE""? That's not a common word? Let me think of common words.

 Consider ""POISE"": 
   - P, O, I, S, E -> E is at the end? No, we cannot put E at the end.

 We need to put E in positions 1-4.

 How about ""PILED"": 
   - P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th position. This is acceptable. Also, we are testing P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present).

 But note: we don't know if the word has D. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": 
   - S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th.

 But both ""PILED"" and ""SPIED"" are valid words.

 Another option: ""OWLED"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E.

 We must include E and avoid the 5th position.

 Let me list some words that have E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th and avoid A,C,R,N.

 Position 1: E? 
   - ""E"" at the beginning: e.g., ""ELVIS"", ""EXIST"", ""ENSUE"", but we must avoid A,C,R,N.

   ""ELVIS"": E, L, V, I, S -> no A,C,R,N. But V and S are new.

 Position 2: E?
   - e.g., ""LEMON"", but has O and M? But we don't know about O and M. However, we must avoid A,C,R,N -> ""LEMON"" is okay? But ""LEMON"" has M and O.

 Position 3: E?
   - e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> but E is in the 4th? Actually, H,O,T,E,L -> E is in the 4th? Then the 5th is L. But we cannot use E at the 5th? Here E is at 4th so it's okay. However, we have to avoid A,C,R,N -> ""HOTEL"" is okay.

 But note: we are on the second guess and we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position that is not 5 and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we know E is in the word, but we don't know the position.

 We can try to use E in the second position? 

 Consider ""DEALT"" -> but A is excluded. So no.

 Consider ""BESET"" -> has two E's? And S and T. But we don't mind duplicates? Actually, we want to avoid duplicates to get more information? But if the word has two E's, we'll find out.

 However, let's try to use distinct letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   - S, P, I, E, L -> distinct letters, E in the 4th position.

 But is ""SPIEL"" a valid word? Yes, it means a period of play in sports or a gambling venture.

 Another candidate: ""POISE"" is not allowed because E is at the end. But if we move E to the front? ""EPOXY"" -> but that has X and Y? And E at the front. But we don't know about X and Y.

 Alternatively, ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.

 After some thought, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have not tried T, O, L, D, etc. But we are including S, P, I, L and E (which we know is present).

 But wait, we are also testing L. And we are putting E in the 4th position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 2nd position? For example, ""LEECH"" -> but that has two E's and we don't know about H.

 How about ""BELOW"": 
   - B, E, L, O, W -> E in the 2nd position. This avoids the 5th. And we are testing B, L, O, W.

 This seems good too.

 Let me compare:
   - ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> E in 4th.
   - ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> E in 2nd.

 Both are valid and cover new letters.

 We might also consider ""TEPID"": 
   - T, E, P, I, D -> E in 2nd, and tests T, P, I, D.

 But we are trying to cover more vowels? We already know E is present, so we don't need to test more vowels? We haven't tested I and O? Actually, we haven't tested any vowels except E and A (which is absent). So we should test I and O? 

 The word must have vowels. Since A is absent, the vowels left are E (we know is present), and then I, O, U. We haven't tested I and O.

 So both ""SPIEL"" and ""BELOW"" test I and O respectively? ""SPIEL"" has I, ""BELOW"" has O.

 I think both are good. Let's choose one.

 I'll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in the 2nd position (which is a new position) and we test B, L, O, W.

 But note: we are not testing S and T? We might want to test S and T because they are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"": 
   - S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""STILE"": 
   - S, T, I, L, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""STEEL"" -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""SETUP"": 
   - S, E, T, U, P -> E in the 2nd position. This is acceptable. And we test S, T, U, P.

 This is a good candidate: ""SETUP"".

 But is ""SETUP"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

 We are testing S, E, T, U, P. We know E is present, so we are testing S, T, U, P.

 Alternatively, ""SPITE"": 
   - S, P, I, T, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""SPIEL"" again? It has E in the 4th and tests S, P, I, L.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good choice because it tests S and T which are very common, and U and P.

 But note: we are avoiding the 5th position for E, and in ""SETUP"", E is in the 2nd position.

 So I'll go with ""SETUP"".

 However, let me confirm: 
   - First guess: crane -> C,R,A,N,E (with E marked as present but wrong position, and the others absent).
   - We are avoiding C,R,A,N and avoiding putting E in the 5th.

 ""SETUP"": 
   - S (new), E (we know is present, but in position 2), T (new), U (new), P (new).

 This covers 4 new common consonants and one known vowel.

 Therefore, I choose ""SETUP"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has E in the 2nd position? Then we get a match. But we don't know. We are trying to find the position.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position that we haven't tried? In the first guess, E was in the 5th. Now we try in the 2nd.

 So, let's go with ""SETUP"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must **include E** (since it's confirmed present) but **avoid the 5th position**.
- It must **exclude C, R, A, N** (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, prioritize **new common letters** (e.g., S, T, P, L, O) and **distinct letters**.
- ""SETUP"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in the 2nd position (avoiding the 5th).

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, N are absent, we can eliminate these letters from consideration.
 E is present but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it was the last letter and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not at the end).

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We know the secret word contains an 'E' but not at the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N.
   - Contains the letter E, but not at the 5th position.

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

 We should try to include E in one of the first four positions and use other common letters that are not in the excluded list (C,R,A,N).

 Some good starting letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 We can try words like:
   - ""SPIEL"" -> but we don't know if P, I, L are in the word? However, we haven't tried them.
   - ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L. But note: E is in the 4th position? We need to avoid the 5th for E.

 However, note that the feedback for E was a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position. So we can put E in positions 1-4.

 Let's try to form a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some options:
   - ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have S, T, L. But note: we have two E's and we only know one E is present. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.
   - ""BELIE"" -> has two E's again.

 We want to use distinct letters if possible to get more information.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   - S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th. But we don't know if the word has E in the 4th? We are just trying to cover new letters.

 However, note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N. So we have many letters left.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said it's not in the 5th position. So we must avoid the 5th position for E.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that end with E.

 Let's try ""TABLE"": 
   - T, A, B, L, E -> but A is excluded! We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and marked absent.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So ""TABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 How about ""TOILE""? That's not a common word? Let me think of common words.

 Consider ""POISE"": 
   - P, O, I, S, E -> E is at the end? No, we cannot put E at the end.

 We need to put E in positions 1-4.

 How about ""PILED"": 
   - P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th position. This is acceptable. Also, we are testing P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present).

 But note: we don't know if the word has D. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": 
   - S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th.

 But both ""PILED"" and ""SPIED"" are valid words.

 Another option: ""OWLED"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E.

 We must include E and avoid the 5th position.

 Let me list some words that have E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th and avoid A,C,R,N.

 Position 1: E? 
   - ""E"" at the beginning: e.g., ""ELVIS"", ""EXIST"", ""ENSUE"", but we must avoid A,C,R,N.

   ""ELVIS"": E, L, V, I, S -> no A,C,R,N. But V and S are new.

 Position 2: E?
   - e.g., ""LEMON"", but has O and M? But we don't know about O and M. However, we must avoid A,C,R,N -> ""LEMON"" is okay? But ""LEMON"" has M and O.

 Position 3: E?
   - e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> but E is in the 4th? Actually, H,O,T,E,L -> E is in the 4th? Then the 5th is L. But we cannot use E at the 5th? Here E is at 4th so it's okay. However, we have to avoid A,C,R,N -> ""HOTEL"" is okay.

 But note: we are on the second guess and we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position that is not 5 and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we know E is in the word, but we don't know the position.

 We can try to use E in the second position? 

 Consider ""DEALT"" -> but A is excluded. So no.

 Consider ""BESET"" -> has two E's? And S and T. But we don't mind duplicates? Actually, we want to avoid duplicates to get more information? But if the word has two E's, we'll find out.

 However, let's try to use distinct letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   - S, P, I, E, L -> distinct letters, E in the 4th position.

 But is ""SPIEL"" a valid word? Yes, it means a period of play in sports or a gambling venture.

 Another candidate: ""POISE"" is not allowed because E is at the end. But if we move E to the front? ""EPOXY"" -> but that has X and Y? And E at the front. But we don't know about X and Y.

 Alternatively, ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.

 After some thought, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have not tried T, O, L, D, etc. But we are including S, P, I, L and E (which we know is present).

 But wait, we are also testing L. And we are putting E in the 4th position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 2nd position? For example, ""LEECH"" -> but that has two E's and we don't know about H.

 How about ""BELOW"": 
   - B, E, L, O, W -> E in the 2nd position. This avoids the 5th. And we are testing B, L, O, W.

 This seems good too.

 Let me compare:
   - ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> E in 4th.
   - ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> E in 2nd.

 Both are valid and cover new letters.

 We might also consider ""TEPID"": 
   - T, E, P, I, D -> E in 2nd, and tests T, P, I, D.

 But we are trying to cover more vowels? We already know E is present, so we don't need to test more vowels? We haven't tested I and O? Actually, we haven't tested any vowels except E and A (which is absent). So we should test I and O? 

 The word must have vowels. Since A is absent, the vowels left are E (we know is present), and then I, O, U. We haven't tested I and O.

 So both ""SPIEL"" and ""BELOW"" test I and O respectively? ""SPIEL"" has I, ""BELOW"" has O.

 I think both are good. Let's choose one.

 I'll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in the 2nd position (which is a new position) and we test B, L, O, W.

 But note: we are not testing S and T? We might want to test S and T because they are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"": 
   - S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""STILE"": 
   - S, T, I, L, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""STEEL"" -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""SETUP"": 
   - S, E, T, U, P -> E in the 2nd position. This is acceptable. And we test S, T, U, P.

 This is a good candidate: ""SETUP"".

 But is ""SETUP"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

 We are testing S, E, T, U, P. We know E is present, so we are testing S, T, U, P.

 Alternatively, ""SPITE"": 
   - S, P, I, T, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""SPIEL"" again? It has E in the 4th and tests S, P, I, L.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good choice because it tests S and T which are very common, and U and P.

 But note: we are avoiding the 5th position for E, and in ""SETUP"", E is in the 2nd position.

 So I'll go with ""SETUP"".

 However, let me confirm: 
   - First guess: crane -> C,R,A,N,E (with E marked as present but wrong position, and the others absent).
   - We are avoiding C,R,A,N and avoiding putting E in the 5th.

 ""SETUP"": 
   - S (new), E (we know is present, but in position 2), T (new), U (new), P (new).

 This covers 4 new common consonants and one known vowel.

 Therefore, I choose ""SETUP"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has E in the 2nd position? Then we get a match. But we don't know. We are trying to find the position.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position that we haven't tried? In the first guess, E was in the 5th. Now we try in the 2nd.

 So, let's go with ""SETUP"".

<guess>setup</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must **include E** (since it's confirmed present) but **avoid the 5th position**.
- It must **exclude C, R, A, N** (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, prioritize **new common letters** (e.g., S, T, P, L, O) and **distinct letters**.
- ""SETUP"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in the 2nd position (avoiding the 5th).
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, U, P.
  - All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
  - Valid 5-letter word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  - E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""setup"" -> S(x), E(✓), T(✓), U(x), P(x)
Meaning:
  - S, U, P are absent.
  - E is present and in the correct position (position 2, since ""setup"" is S-E-T-U-P, so E is the second letter).
  - T is present and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""setup"", T is the third letter).

So, from the second guess:
  - The secret word has E as the second letter and T as the third letter.
  - Therefore, the word has the form: _ E T _ _

Also, we know that the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, P. So the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.

We know E and T are in the word and in the correct positions (E at position 2, T at position 3).

We have 6 tries and this is the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has the form: _ E T _ _
  - Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, U, P (since they are absent)
  - Must include the letter E (we already have it in position 2) and T (in position 3), and the other letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

We also know from the first guess that E is present but not at the end, which is consistent because now we have it at position 2.

Now, what letters are left? We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

The first position: must be a letter not in the absent list. Similarly for the fourth and fifth.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

We can think of common words that fit the pattern _ E T _ _.

Examples:
  - BETH? -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.
  - Let's think: 
      - First position: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
      - Fourth and fifth: same set.

Common words:
  - ""BETTY"" -> but has T at the end? Pattern: B E T T Y -> but we have T at position 3 and then another T at position 4? And Y at 5. But we don't know if T can be repeated? The feedback for T in the second guess was only for the third position. So it's possible to have another T? However, we don't have information about duplicate letters. But note: in the first guess, we had only one E and it was present, and in the second guess we have E and T. We haven't seen any duplicate letters yet.

But let's check: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we try. So we cannot rule out duplicates.

However, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

But ""BETTY"" has two T's. If we avoid duplicates, we can try words with distinct letters.

Another common word: ""DEITY"" -> D E I T Y -> but we have T at position 4? No, in ""DEITY"": D (1), E (2), I (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need T at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need T at position 3, so the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]

So:
  - ""METRO"" -> but M E T R O -> but R is absent (from first guess). So no.
  - ""FETCH"" -> F E T C H -> but C is absent. No.
  - ""LETUP"" -> L E T U P -> but U and P are absent. No.

We must avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

  - ""BETEL"": B E T E L -> but has two E's? And L at the end. But E is at position 2 and 4? We know E is at position 2, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, the absent letters: B is not absent? We haven't tried B. And E is present, T is present. L is new. But ""BETEL"" is a word? Yes, a type of leaf. But note: the pattern is B E T E L -> so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L. But we have E at position 4? That's allowed because we only know E is at position 2, but it could be elsewhere too? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said E is present but not at position 5, but it could be at other positions. However, in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so that doesn't prevent E from being at position 4. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? We might get confused if we use two E's.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E in the other positions to avoid confusion.

But we know E is at least at position 2. There might be more E's? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word that doesn't have E in the other positions, so that if we get a feedback for E in another position, we know it's a duplicate.

But for now, we are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more letters.

Another word: ""METER"" -> M E T E R -> but R is absent. No.

""JETTY"" -> J E T T Y -> has two T's. And J and Y are new. But we don't know about duplicates.

""FETID"" -> F E T I D -> F, I, D are new. And no duplicates. This seems good.

""FETID"" is a word meaning smelly. Pattern: F (1), E (2), T (3), I (4), D (5). 

This fits: _ E T _ _ with F, I, D.

And we are testing F, I, D.

Another possibility: ""BETID"" -> not a word.

""KETCH"" -> K E T C H -> but C is absent. No.

""LETCH"" -> L E T C H -> C absent. No.

""WETLY"" -> W E T L Y -> W, L, Y are new. And no duplicates? ""WETLY"" has no duplicates.

But is ""WETLY"" common? It's an adverb meaning in a wet manner.

""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are both options.

Another one: ""HETHS"" -> but H E T H S -> has two H's and S is absent. No.

""VETCH"" -> V E T C H -> C absent. No.

""METAL"" -> M E T A L -> but A is absent. No.

""METED"" -> M E T E D -> has two E's. But we are testing M and D. However, duplicate E.

""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> has two E's and T is at the end? Pattern: B E G E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:E, 5:T. But we need T at position 3, not 5. So no.

So among the options without duplicates and without absent letters: ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"".

We can also consider ""DEBIT"" -> but D E B I T -> T is at the end? We need T at position 3. So no.

""DELFT"" -> D E L F T -> T at the end? No.

We need T at position 3.

Another word: ""MOTET"" -> M O T E T -> but T at position 3 and 5? And E at 4. But pattern: M O T E T -> so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have O and E? But E is at position 4? And we know E is at position 2? Wait, no, in this word E is at position 4. But we already have E at position 2? This word doesn't have E at position 2? It has E at position 4. But our pattern requires E at position 2? No, the pattern is fixed: the second letter must be E and the third must be T. So in ""MOTET"": 
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 2: O? -> but we need E at position 2. So it doesn't fit.

So we must have E at position 2 and T at position 3.

So the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]

So ""FETID"": F E T I D -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:I, 5:D -> fits.

""WETLY"": W E T L Y -> 1:W, 2:E, 3:T, 4:L, 5:Y -> fits.

""HELLO"" -> H E L L O -> but then position 3 is L, not T. Doesn't fit.

""JETTY"": J E T T Y -> 1:J, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> fits, but has two T's.

We might also consider ""BETON"" -> but N is absent.

""LETHE"" -> L E T H E -> has two E's and H. But E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 5 in a different word? No, the feedback for the first guess was that E is present but not in the 5th position of that word. But in the secret word, E might be at position 5? Actually, no: because in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so the secret word has E at position 2. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. So any word with E at position 5 would be invalid? But we are not putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We are building the word with E at position 2.

In ""LETHE"": L E T H E -> position 5 is E, which is not allowed because the first guess told us E is not at position 5. But wait, the first guess feedback was for the word ""crane"", which had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. So the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E at position 5. So ""LETHE"" would be invalid because it has E at position 5? But we are not guessing ""LETHE"", we are considering it as a candidate for the secret word? Actually, we are making a guess, so we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there. But in our guess, we are putting E at position 2, so we don't put it at 5. But for the secret word, we know position 5 is not E.

So in our guess, we can have E only at position 2? Actually, we can have E at other positions? But we know the secret word has E at position 2, so if we put E at another position, it might be a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in our guess, we are allowed to put E at other positions to test? However, we already know E is at position 2, so if we put E at position 4, and if it's not in the word, we get an absent mark? But we know E is in the word, so if we put it at position 4 and it's not there, then we know there is no duplicate? But it might be there and we get a '-' or a '✓'? 

But to avoid confusion, we might avoid putting E in other positions in this guess? Because we are focusing on the other letters.

So for the third guess, we can choose a word that has E only at position 2 and no other E's, so that we can test the other letters without duplication.

Therefore, ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are good because they have E only at position 2.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, D, F, W, Y, etc.

""FETID"" tests F, I, D.
""WETLY"" tests W, L, Y.

Both are valid. We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think of which letters are more common.

In English 5-letter words, L, I, D are more common than W, Y? 

But we have to consider the positions.

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth.

Common letters in the first position: many, but we can look for words that are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has vowels in the fourth or fifth? We know the secret word has E at 2 and T at 3, so the remaining positions might have vowels? We haven't tested O, I, etc.

In ""FETID"", we have I at position 4, which is a vowel. In ""WETLY"", we have L and Y (Y can be a vowel).

But both are acceptable.

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests F, I, D, which are common.

But let me see if there is a word that tests O? We haven't tested O.

For example, ""METHOD"" -> but that's 6 letters.

""METRO"" is invalid because of R.

""BETON"" is invalid because of N.

""VETO"" is 4 letters.

How about ""DETOX""? D E T O X -> but that's 5 letters: D(1), E(2), T(3), O(4), X(5). And we haven't tried D, O, X. So ""DETOX"" is a word.

But we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,U,P. D, O, X are not in that list.

So ""DETOX"" is a valid guess.

Now, comparing ""FETID"", ""WETLY"", and ""DETOX"":

  - ""FETID"": tests F, I, D
  - ""WETLY"": tests W, L, Y
  - ""DETOX"": tests D, O, X

We haven't tested O, so ""DETOX"" might be good to test O.

Also, X is less common, but we are testing it.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, so we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Since we know the pattern is _ E T _ _, and we have three positions to test, we want to cover letters that are likely to be in the word.

Common letters in the fourth and fifth positions: vowels like O, I, or consonants like L, D, etc.

I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice because it tests O, which is a common vowel, and D and X.

But X is not very common, but it's okay.

Another word: ""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> but T is at position 5? We need T at position 3. So no.

""DEVOT"" -> not a word.

So I think ""DETOX"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm: ""DETOX"" is a 5-letter word meaning to remove toxins.

So I'll go with ""DETOX"".

But wait, in ""DETOX"", the letter O is at position 4 and X at position 5.

We are testing D at position 1, O at 4, X at 5.

We know E and T are fixed.

So the guess is ""DETOX"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like L or I.

But ""DETOX"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""DELTA"" -> but A is absent.

""FECAL"" -> but A is absent and C is absent? F E C A L -> C and A absent. No.

So I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice.

But let's see: we have not tested L, I, etc. But we can do that in the next guess if needed.

We can also consider ""BETHS"" -> but H and S? S is absent. No.

So I choose ""DETOX"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - Letters `C`, `R`, `A`, `N` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `E` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked `-`).  

- **Guess 2: ""setup"" → Feedback: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)**  
  - `S`, `U`, `P` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **correct and in position 2** (marked `✓`).  
  - `T` is **correct and in position 3** (marked `✓`).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ E T _ _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
   - Position 2 = `E` (fixed).  
   - Position 3 = `T` (fixed).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `N`, `S`, `U`, `P` cannot appear anywhere.  
3. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `O`, `W`, `Y`).  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - Avoid `E` in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).  
   - Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow possibilities.  
- **Chosen word**: **""DETOX""**  
  - Fits the `_ E T _ _` structure: `D` (pos 1), `E` (pos 2), `T` (pos 3), `O` (pos 4), `X` (pos 5).  
  - Tests new common letters:  
    - `D` (position 1)  
    - `O` (position 4, tests a common vowel)  
    - `X` (position 5, less common but valuable for elimination)  
  - Avoids all absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Valid English word (meaning: to remove toxins).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If `D` is correct (pos 1), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `O` is correct (pos 4), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `X` is correct (pos 5), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  

This guess efficiently tests key letters while respecting the fixed positions and absent letters.  

<guess>detox</guess>",detox,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  - E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""setup"" -> S(x), E(✓), T(✓), U(x), P(x)
Meaning:
  - S, U, P are absent.
  - E is present and in the correct position (position 2, since ""setup"" is S-E-T-U-P, so E is the second letter).
  - T is present and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""setup"", T is the third letter).

So, from the second guess:
  - The secret word has E as the second letter and T as the third letter.
  - Therefore, the word has the form: _ E T _ _

Also, we know that the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, P. So the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.

We know E and T are in the word and in the correct positions (E at position 2, T at position 3).

We have 6 tries and this is the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has the form: _ E T _ _
  - Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, U, P (since they are absent)
  - Must include the letter E (we already have it in position 2) and T (in position 3), and the other letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

We also know from the first guess that E is present but not at the end, which is consistent because now we have it at position 2.

Now, what letters are left? We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

The first position: must be a letter not in the absent list. Similarly for the fourth and fifth.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

We can think of common words that fit the pattern _ E T _ _.

Examples:
  - BETH? -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.
  - Let's think: 
      - First position: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
      - Fourth and fifth: same set.

Common words:
  - ""BETTY"" -> but has T at the end? Pattern: B E T T Y -> but we have T at position 3 and then another T at position 4? And Y at 5. But we don't know if T can be repeated? The feedback for T in the second guess was only for the third position. So it's possible to have another T? However, we don't have information about duplicate letters. But note: in the first guess, we had only one E and it was present, and in the second guess we have E and T. We haven't seen any duplicate letters yet.

But let's check: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we try. So we cannot rule out duplicates.

However, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

But ""BETTY"" has two T's. If we avoid duplicates, we can try words with distinct letters.

Another common word: ""DEITY"" -> D E I T Y -> but we have T at position 4? No, in ""DEITY"": D (1), E (2), I (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need T at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need T at position 3, so the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]

So:
  - ""METRO"" -> but M E T R O -> but R is absent (from first guess). So no.
  - ""FETCH"" -> F E T C H -> but C is absent. No.
  - ""LETUP"" -> L E T U P -> but U and P are absent. No.

We must avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

  - ""BETEL"": B E T E L -> but has two E's? And L at the end. But E is at position 2 and 4? We know E is at position 2, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, the absent letters: B is not absent? We haven't tried B. And E is present, T is present. L is new. But ""BETEL"" is a word? Yes, a type of leaf. But note: the pattern is B E T E L -> so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L. But we have E at position 4? That's allowed because we only know E is at position 2, but it could be elsewhere too? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said E is present but not at position 5, but it could be at other positions. However, in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so that doesn't prevent E from being at position 4. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? We might get confused if we use two E's.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E in the other positions to avoid confusion.

But we know E is at least at position 2. There might be more E's? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word that doesn't have E in the other positions, so that if we get a feedback for E in another position, we know it's a duplicate.

But for now, we are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more letters.

Another word: ""METER"" -> M E T E R -> but R is absent. No.

""JETTY"" -> J E T T Y -> has two T's. And J and Y are new. But we don't know about duplicates.

""FETID"" -> F E T I D -> F, I, D are new. And no duplicates. This seems good.

""FETID"" is a word meaning smelly. Pattern: F (1), E (2), T (3), I (4), D (5). 

This fits: _ E T _ _ with F, I, D.

And we are testing F, I, D.

Another possibility: ""BETID"" -> not a word.

""KETCH"" -> K E T C H -> but C is absent. No.

""LETCH"" -> L E T C H -> C absent. No.

""WETLY"" -> W E T L Y -> W, L, Y are new. And no duplicates? ""WETLY"" has no duplicates.

But is ""WETLY"" common? It's an adverb meaning in a wet manner.

""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are both options.

Another one: ""HETHS"" -> but H E T H S -> has two H's and S is absent. No.

""VETCH"" -> V E T C H -> C absent. No.

""METAL"" -> M E T A L -> but A is absent. No.

""METED"" -> M E T E D -> has two E's. But we are testing M and D. However, duplicate E.

""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> has two E's and T is at the end? Pattern: B E G E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:E, 5:T. But we need T at position 3, not 5. So no.

So among the options without duplicates and without absent letters: ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"".

We can also consider ""DEBIT"" -> but D E B I T -> T is at the end? We need T at position 3. So no.

""DELFT"" -> D E L F T -> T at the end? No.

We need T at position 3.

Another word: ""MOTET"" -> M O T E T -> but T at position 3 and 5? And E at 4. But pattern: M O T E T -> so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have O and E? But E is at position 4? And we know E is at position 2? Wait, no, in this word E is at position 4. But we already have E at position 2? This word doesn't have E at position 2? It has E at position 4. But our pattern requires E at position 2? No, the pattern is fixed: the second letter must be E and the third must be T. So in ""MOTET"": 
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 2: O? -> but we need E at position 2. So it doesn't fit.

So we must have E at position 2 and T at position 3.

So the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]

So ""FETID"": F E T I D -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:I, 5:D -> fits.

""WETLY"": W E T L Y -> 1:W, 2:E, 3:T, 4:L, 5:Y -> fits.

""HELLO"" -> H E L L O -> but then position 3 is L, not T. Doesn't fit.

""JETTY"": J E T T Y -> 1:J, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> fits, but has two T's.

We might also consider ""BETON"" -> but N is absent.

""LETHE"" -> L E T H E -> has two E's and H. But E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 5 in a different word? No, the feedback for the first guess was that E is present but not in the 5th position of that word. But in the secret word, E might be at position 5? Actually, no: because in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so the secret word has E at position 2. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. So any word with E at position 5 would be invalid? But we are not putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We are building the word with E at position 2.

In ""LETHE"": L E T H E -> position 5 is E, which is not allowed because the first guess told us E is not at position 5. But wait, the first guess feedback was for the word ""crane"", which had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. So the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E at position 5. So ""LETHE"" would be invalid because it has E at position 5? But we are not guessing ""LETHE"", we are considering it as a candidate for the secret word? Actually, we are making a guess, so we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there. But in our guess, we are putting E at position 2, so we don't put it at 5. But for the secret word, we know position 5 is not E.

So in our guess, we can have E only at position 2? Actually, we can have E at other positions? But we know the secret word has E at position 2, so if we put E at another position, it might be a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in our guess, we are allowed to put E at other positions to test? However, we already know E is at position 2, so if we put E at position 4, and if it's not in the word, we get an absent mark? But we know E is in the word, so if we put it at position 4 and it's not there, then we know there is no duplicate? But it might be there and we get a '-' or a '✓'? 

But to avoid confusion, we might avoid putting E in other positions in this guess? Because we are focusing on the other letters.

So for the third guess, we can choose a word that has E only at position 2 and no other E's, so that we can test the other letters without duplication.

Therefore, ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are good because they have E only at position 2.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, D, F, W, Y, etc.

""FETID"" tests F, I, D.
""WETLY"" tests W, L, Y.

Both are valid. We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think of which letters are more common.

In English 5-letter words, L, I, D are more common than W, Y? 

But we have to consider the positions.

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth.

Common letters in the first position: many, but we can look for words that are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has vowels in the fourth or fifth? We know the secret word has E at 2 and T at 3, so the remaining positions might have vowels? We haven't tested O, I, etc.

In ""FETID"", we have I at position 4, which is a vowel. In ""WETLY"", we have L and Y (Y can be a vowel).

But both are acceptable.

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests F, I, D, which are common.

But let me see if there is a word that tests O? We haven't tested O.

For example, ""METHOD"" -> but that's 6 letters.

""METRO"" is invalid because of R.

""BETON"" is invalid because of N.

""VETO"" is 4 letters.

How about ""DETOX""? D E T O X -> but that's 5 letters: D(1), E(2), T(3), O(4), X(5). And we haven't tried D, O, X. So ""DETOX"" is a word.

But we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,U,P. D, O, X are not in that list.

So ""DETOX"" is a valid guess.

Now, comparing ""FETID"", ""WETLY"", and ""DETOX"":

  - ""FETID"": tests F, I, D
  - ""WETLY"": tests W, L, Y
  - ""DETOX"": tests D, O, X

We haven't tested O, so ""DETOX"" might be good to test O.

Also, X is less common, but we are testing it.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, so we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Since we know the pattern is _ E T _ _, and we have three positions to test, we want to cover letters that are likely to be in the word.

Common letters in the fourth and fifth positions: vowels like O, I, or consonants like L, D, etc.

I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice because it tests O, which is a common vowel, and D and X.

But X is not very common, but it's okay.

Another word: ""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> but T is at position 5? We need T at position 3. So no.

""DEVOT"" -> not a word.

So I think ""DETOX"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm: ""DETOX"" is a 5-letter word meaning to remove toxins.

So I'll go with ""DETOX"".

But wait, in ""DETOX"", the letter O is at position 4 and X at position 5.

We are testing D at position 1, O at 4, X at 5.

We know E and T are fixed.

So the guess is ""DETOX"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like L or I.

But ""DETOX"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""DELTA"" -> but A is absent.

""FECAL"" -> but A is absent and C is absent? F E C A L -> C and A absent. No.

So I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice.

But let's see: we have not tested L, I, etc. But we can do that in the next guess if needed.

We can also consider ""BETHS"" -> but H and S? S is absent. No.

So I choose ""DETOX"".

<guess>detox</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - Letters `C`, `R`, `A`, `N` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `E` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked `-`).  

- **Guess 2: ""setup"" → Feedback: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)**  
  - `S`, `U`, `P` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **correct and in position 2** (marked `✓`).  
  - `T` is **correct and in position 3** (marked `✓`).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ E T _ _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
   - Position 2 = `E` (fixed).  
   - Position 3 = `T` (fixed).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `N`, `S`, `U`, `P` cannot appear anywhere.  
3. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `O`, `W`, `Y`).  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - Avoid `E` in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).  
   - Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow possibilities.  
- **Chosen word**: **""DETOX""**  
  - Fits the `_ E T _ _` structure: `D` (pos 1), `E` (pos 2), `T` (pos 3), `O` (pos 4), `X` (pos 5).  
  - Tests new common letters:  
    - `D` (position 1)  
    - `O` (position 4, tests a common vowel)  
    - `X` (position 5, less common but valuable for elimination)  
  - Avoids all absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Valid English word (meaning: to remove toxins).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If `D` is correct (pos 1), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `O` is correct (pos 4), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `X` is correct (pos 5), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, N are absent, we can eliminate these letters from consideration.
 E is present but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it was the last letter and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not at the end).

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We know the secret word contains an 'E' but not at the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N.
   - Contains the letter E, but not at the 5th position.

 Additionally, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

 We should try to include E in one of the first four positions and use other common letters that are not in the excluded list (C,R,A,N).

 Some good starting letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 We can try words like:
   - ""SPIEL"" -> but we don't know if P, I, L are in the word? However, we haven't tried them.
   - ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L. But note: E is in the 4th position? We need to avoid the 5th for E.

 However, note that the feedback for E was a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position. So we can put E in positions 1-4.

 Let's try to form a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some options:
   - ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have S, T, L. But note: we have two E's and we only know one E is present. It might be acceptable, but let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.
   - ""BELIE"" -> has two E's again.

 We want to use distinct letters if possible to get more information.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   - S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th. But we don't know if the word has E in the 4th? We are just trying to cover new letters.

 However, note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N. So we have many letters left.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said it's not in the 5th position. So we must avoid the 5th position for E.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that end with E.

 Let's try ""TABLE"": 
   - T, A, B, L, E -> but A is excluded! We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and marked absent.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So ""TABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 How about ""TOILE""? That's not a common word? Let me think of common words.

 Consider ""POISE"": 
   - P, O, I, S, E -> E is at the end? No, we cannot put E at the end.

 We need to put E in positions 1-4.

 How about ""PILED"": 
   - P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th position. This is acceptable. Also, we are testing P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present).

 But note: we don't know if the word has D. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, ""SPIED"": 
   - S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th.

 But both ""PILED"" and ""SPIED"" are valid words.

 Another option: ""OWLED"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E.

 We must include E and avoid the 5th position.

 Let me list some words that have E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th and avoid A,C,R,N.

 Position 1: E? 
   - ""E"" at the beginning: e.g., ""ELVIS"", ""EXIST"", ""ENSUE"", but we must avoid A,C,R,N.

   ""ELVIS"": E, L, V, I, S -> no A,C,R,N. But V and S are new.

 Position 2: E?
   - e.g., ""LEMON"", but has O and M? But we don't know about O and M. However, we must avoid A,C,R,N -> ""LEMON"" is okay? But ""LEMON"" has M and O.

 Position 3: E?
   - e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> but E is in the 4th? Actually, H,O,T,E,L -> E is in the 4th? Then the 5th is L. But we cannot use E at the 5th? Here E is at 4th so it's okay. However, we have to avoid A,C,R,N -> ""HOTEL"" is okay.

 But note: we are on the second guess and we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position that is not 5 and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we know E is in the word, but we don't know the position.

 We can try to use E in the second position? 

 Consider ""DEALT"" -> but A is excluded. So no.

 Consider ""BESET"" -> has two E's? And S and T. But we don't mind duplicates? Actually, we want to avoid duplicates to get more information? But if the word has two E's, we'll find out.

 However, let's try to use distinct letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   - S, P, I, E, L -> distinct letters, E in the 4th position.

 But is ""SPIEL"" a valid word? Yes, it means a period of play in sports or a gambling venture.

 Another candidate: ""POISE"" is not allowed because E is at the end. But if we move E to the front? ""EPOXY"" -> but that has X and Y? And E at the front. But we don't know about X and Y.

 Alternatively, ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.

 After some thought, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have not tried T, O, L, D, etc. But we are including S, P, I, L and E (which we know is present).

 But wait, we are also testing L. And we are putting E in the 4th position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 2nd position? For example, ""LEECH"" -> but that has two E's and we don't know about H.

 How about ""BELOW"": 
   - B, E, L, O, W -> E in the 2nd position. This avoids the 5th. And we are testing B, L, O, W.

 This seems good too.

 Let me compare:
   - ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> E in 4th.
   - ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> E in 2nd.

 Both are valid and cover new letters.

 We might also consider ""TEPID"": 
   - T, E, P, I, D -> E in 2nd, and tests T, P, I, D.

 But we are trying to cover more vowels? We already know E is present, so we don't need to test more vowels? We haven't tested I and O? Actually, we haven't tested any vowels except E and A (which is absent). So we should test I and O? 

 The word must have vowels. Since A is absent, the vowels left are E (we know is present), and then I, O, U. We haven't tested I and O.

 So both ""SPIEL"" and ""BELOW"" test I and O respectively? ""SPIEL"" has I, ""BELOW"" has O.

 I think both are good. Let's choose one.

 I'll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in the 2nd position (which is a new position) and we test B, L, O, W.

 But note: we are not testing S and T? We might want to test S and T because they are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"": 
   - S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""STILE"": 
   - S, T, I, L, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""STEEL"" -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""SETUP"": 
   - S, E, T, U, P -> E in the 2nd position. This is acceptable. And we test S, T, U, P.

 This is a good candidate: ""SETUP"".

 But is ""SETUP"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

 We are testing S, E, T, U, P. We know E is present, so we are testing S, T, U, P.

 Alternatively, ""SPITE"": 
   - S, P, I, T, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.

 How about ""SPIEL"" again? It has E in the 4th and tests S, P, I, L.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good choice because it tests S and T which are very common, and U and P.

 But note: we are avoiding the 5th position for E, and in ""SETUP"", E is in the 2nd position.

 So I'll go with ""SETUP"".

 However, let me confirm: 
   - First guess: crane -> C,R,A,N,E (with E marked as present but wrong position, and the others absent).
   - We are avoiding C,R,A,N and avoiding putting E in the 5th.

 ""SETUP"": 
   - S (new), E (we know is present, but in position 2), T (new), U (new), P (new).

 This covers 4 new common consonants and one known vowel.

 Therefore, I choose ""SETUP"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has E in the 2nd position? Then we get a match. But we don't know. We are trying to find the position.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position that we haven't tried? In the first guess, E was in the 5th. Now we try in the 2nd.

 So, let's go with ""SETUP"".

<guess>setup</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must **include E** (since it's confirmed present) but **avoid the 5th position**.
- It must **exclude C, R, A, N** (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, prioritize **new common letters** (e.g., S, T, P, L, O) and **distinct letters**.
- ""SETUP"" is chosen because:
  - Contains E in the 2nd position (avoiding the 5th).
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, U, P.
  - All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
  - Valid 5-letter word.

<guess>setup</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: setup -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  - E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""setup"" -> S(x), E(✓), T(✓), U(x), P(x)
Meaning:
  - S, U, P are absent.
  - E is present and in the correct position (position 2, since ""setup"" is S-E-T-U-P, so E is the second letter).
  - T is present and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""setup"", T is the third letter).

So, from the second guess:
  - The secret word has E as the second letter and T as the third letter.
  - Therefore, the word has the form: _ E T _ _

Also, we know that the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, P. So the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.

We know E and T are in the word and in the correct positions (E at position 2, T at position 3).

We have 6 tries and this is the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has the form: _ E T _ _
  - Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, U, P (since they are absent)
  - Must include the letter E (we already have it in position 2) and T (in position 3), and the other letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

We also know from the first guess that E is present but not at the end, which is consistent because now we have it at position 2.

Now, what letters are left? We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

The first position: must be a letter not in the absent list. Similarly for the fourth and fifth.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

We can think of common words that fit the pattern _ E T _ _.

Examples:
  - BETH? -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5.
  - Let's think: 
      - First position: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
      - Fourth and fifth: same set.

Common words:
  - ""BETTY"" -> but has T at the end? Pattern: B E T T Y -> but we have T at position 3 and then another T at position 4? And Y at 5. But we don't know if T can be repeated? The feedback for T in the second guess was only for the third position. So it's possible to have another T? However, we don't have information about duplicate letters. But note: in the first guess, we had only one E and it was present, and in the second guess we have E and T. We haven't seen any duplicate letters yet.

But let's check: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we try. So we cannot rule out duplicates.

However, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

But ""BETTY"" has two T's. If we avoid duplicates, we can try words with distinct letters.

Another common word: ""DEITY"" -> D E I T Y -> but we have T at position 4? No, in ""DEITY"": D (1), E (2), I (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need T at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need T at position 3, so the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]

So:
  - ""METRO"" -> but M E T R O -> but R is absent (from first guess). So no.
  - ""FETCH"" -> F E T C H -> but C is absent. No.
  - ""LETUP"" -> L E T U P -> but U and P are absent. No.

We must avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

  - ""BETEL"": B E T E L -> but has two E's? And L at the end. But E is at position 2 and 4? We know E is at position 2, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, the absent letters: B is not absent? We haven't tried B. And E is present, T is present. L is new. But ""BETEL"" is a word? Yes, a type of leaf. But note: the pattern is B E T E L -> so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L. But we have E at position 4? That's allowed because we only know E is at position 2, but it could be elsewhere too? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said E is present but not at position 5, but it could be at other positions. However, in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so that doesn't prevent E from being at position 4. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? We might get confused if we use two E's.

Alternatively, we can try a word without E in the other positions to avoid confusion.

But we know E is at least at position 2. There might be more E's? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word that doesn't have E in the other positions, so that if we get a feedback for E in another position, we know it's a duplicate.

But for now, we are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more letters.

Another word: ""METER"" -> M E T E R -> but R is absent. No.

""JETTY"" -> J E T T Y -> has two T's. And J and Y are new. But we don't know about duplicates.

""FETID"" -> F E T I D -> F, I, D are new. And no duplicates. This seems good.

""FETID"" is a word meaning smelly. Pattern: F (1), E (2), T (3), I (4), D (5). 

This fits: _ E T _ _ with F, I, D.

And we are testing F, I, D.

Another possibility: ""BETID"" -> not a word.

""KETCH"" -> K E T C H -> but C is absent. No.

""LETCH"" -> L E T C H -> C absent. No.

""WETLY"" -> W E T L Y -> W, L, Y are new. And no duplicates? ""WETLY"" has no duplicates.

But is ""WETLY"" common? It's an adverb meaning in a wet manner.

""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are both options.

Another one: ""HETHS"" -> but H E T H S -> has two H's and S is absent. No.

""VETCH"" -> V E T C H -> C absent. No.

""METAL"" -> M E T A L -> but A is absent. No.

""METED"" -> M E T E D -> has two E's. But we are testing M and D. However, duplicate E.

""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> has two E's and T is at the end? Pattern: B E G E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:E, 5:T. But we need T at position 3, not 5. So no.

So among the options without duplicates and without absent letters: ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"".

We can also consider ""DEBIT"" -> but D E B I T -> T is at the end? We need T at position 3. So no.

""DELFT"" -> D E L F T -> T at the end? No.

We need T at position 3.

Another word: ""MOTET"" -> M O T E T -> but T at position 3 and 5? And E at 4. But pattern: M O T E T -> so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have O and E? But E is at position 4? And we know E is at position 2? Wait, no, in this word E is at position 4. But we already have E at position 2? This word doesn't have E at position 2? It has E at position 4. But our pattern requires E at position 2? No, the pattern is fixed: the second letter must be E and the third must be T. So in ""MOTET"": 
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 2: O? -> but we need E at position 2. So it doesn't fit.

So we must have E at position 2 and T at position 3.

So the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]

So ""FETID"": F E T I D -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:I, 5:D -> fits.

""WETLY"": W E T L Y -> 1:W, 2:E, 3:T, 4:L, 5:Y -> fits.

""HELLO"" -> H E L L O -> but then position 3 is L, not T. Doesn't fit.

""JETTY"": J E T T Y -> 1:J, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> fits, but has two T's.

We might also consider ""BETON"" -> but N is absent.

""LETHE"" -> L E T H E -> has two E's and H. But E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 5 in a different word? No, the feedback for the first guess was that E is present but not in the 5th position of that word. But in the secret word, E might be at position 5? Actually, no: because in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so the secret word has E at position 2. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. So any word with E at position 5 would be invalid? But we are not putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We are building the word with E at position 2.

In ""LETHE"": L E T H E -> position 5 is E, which is not allowed because the first guess told us E is not at position 5. But wait, the first guess feedback was for the word ""crane"", which had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. So the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E at position 5. So ""LETHE"" would be invalid because it has E at position 5? But we are not guessing ""LETHE"", we are considering it as a candidate for the secret word? Actually, we are making a guess, so we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there. But in our guess, we are putting E at position 2, so we don't put it at 5. But for the secret word, we know position 5 is not E.

So in our guess, we can have E only at position 2? Actually, we can have E at other positions? But we know the secret word has E at position 2, so if we put E at another position, it might be a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in our guess, we are allowed to put E at other positions to test? However, we already know E is at position 2, so if we put E at position 4, and if it's not in the word, we get an absent mark? But we know E is in the word, so if we put it at position 4 and it's not there, then we know there is no duplicate? But it might be there and we get a '-' or a '✓'? 

But to avoid confusion, we might avoid putting E in other positions in this guess? Because we are focusing on the other letters.

So for the third guess, we can choose a word that has E only at position 2 and no other E's, so that we can test the other letters without duplication.

Therefore, ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are good because they have E only at position 2.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, D, F, W, Y, etc.

""FETID"" tests F, I, D.
""WETLY"" tests W, L, Y.

Both are valid. We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think of which letters are more common.

In English 5-letter words, L, I, D are more common than W, Y? 

But we have to consider the positions.

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth.

Common letters in the first position: many, but we can look for words that are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has vowels in the fourth or fifth? We know the secret word has E at 2 and T at 3, so the remaining positions might have vowels? We haven't tested O, I, etc.

In ""FETID"", we have I at position 4, which is a vowel. In ""WETLY"", we have L and Y (Y can be a vowel).

But both are acceptable.

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests F, I, D, which are common.

But let me see if there is a word that tests O? We haven't tested O.

For example, ""METHOD"" -> but that's 6 letters.

""METRO"" is invalid because of R.

""BETON"" is invalid because of N.

""VETO"" is 4 letters.

How about ""DETOX""? D E T O X -> but that's 5 letters: D(1), E(2), T(3), O(4), X(5). And we haven't tried D, O, X. So ""DETOX"" is a word.

But we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,U,P. D, O, X are not in that list.

So ""DETOX"" is a valid guess.

Now, comparing ""FETID"", ""WETLY"", and ""DETOX"":

  - ""FETID"": tests F, I, D
  - ""WETLY"": tests W, L, Y
  - ""DETOX"": tests D, O, X

We haven't tested O, so ""DETOX"" might be good to test O.

Also, X is less common, but we are testing it.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, so we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Since we know the pattern is _ E T _ _, and we have three positions to test, we want to cover letters that are likely to be in the word.

Common letters in the fourth and fifth positions: vowels like O, I, or consonants like L, D, etc.

I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice because it tests O, which is a common vowel, and D and X.

But X is not very common, but it's okay.

Another word: ""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> but T is at position 5? We need T at position 3. So no.

""DEVOT"" -> not a word.

So I think ""DETOX"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm: ""DETOX"" is a 5-letter word meaning to remove toxins.

So I'll go with ""DETOX"".

But wait, in ""DETOX"", the letter O is at position 4 and X at position 5.

We are testing D at position 1, O at 4, X at 5.

We know E and T are fixed.

So the guess is ""DETOX"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like L or I.

But ""DETOX"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""DELTA"" -> but A is absent.

""FECAL"" -> but A is absent and C is absent? F E C A L -> C and A absent. No.

So I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice.

But let's see: we have not tested L, I, etc. But we can do that in the next guess if needed.

We can also consider ""BETHS"" -> but H and S? S is absent. No.

So I choose ""DETOX"".

<guess>detox</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - Letters `C`, `R`, `A`, `N` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `E` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked `-`).  

- **Guess 2: ""setup"" → Feedback: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)**  
  - `S`, `U`, `P` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **correct and in position 2** (marked `✓`).  
  - `T` is **correct and in position 3** (marked `✓`).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ E T _ _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
   - Position 2 = `E` (fixed).  
   - Position 3 = `T` (fixed).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `N`, `S`, `U`, `P` cannot appear anywhere.  
3. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `O`, `W`, `Y`).  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - Avoid `E` in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).  
   - Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow possibilities.  
- **Chosen word**: **""DETOX""**  
  - Fits the `_ E T _ _` structure: `D` (pos 1), `E` (pos 2), `T` (pos 3), `O` (pos 4), `X` (pos 5).  
  - Tests new common letters:  
    - `D` (position 1)  
    - `O` (position 4, tests a common vowel)  
    - `X` (position 5, less common but valuable for elimination)  
  - Avoids all absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Valid English word (meaning: to remove toxins).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If `D` is correct (pos 1), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `O` is correct (pos 4), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `X` is correct (pos 5), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  

This guess efficiently tests key letters while respecting the fixed positions and absent letters.

Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n   - Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n   - Contains the letter E, but not at the 5th position.\n\n Additionally, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\n We should try to include E in one of the first four positions and use other common letters that are not in the excluded list (C,R,A,N).\n\n Some good starting letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n We can try words like:\n   - ""SPIEL"" -> but we don\'t know if P, I, L are in the word? However, we haven\'t tried them.\n   - ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L. But note: E is in the 4th position?

So we can put E in positions 1-4.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and uses other common letters.\n\n Some options:\n   - ""STEEL"" -> but has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we have S, T, L. But note: we have two E\'s and we only know one E is present. It might be acceptable, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n   - ""BELIE"" -> has two E\'s again.\n\n We want to use distinct letters if possible to get more information.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   - S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th. But we don\'t know if the word has E in the 4th? We are just trying to cover new letters.\n\n However, note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N. So we have many letters left.\n\n Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said it\'s not in the 5th position. So we must avoid the 5th position for E.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words that end with E.\n\n Let\'s try ""TABLE"": \n   - T, A, B, L, E -> but A is excluded! We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and marked absent.\n\n We must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n So ""TABLE"" is invalid because of A.\n\n How about ""TOILE""? That\'s not a common word? Let me think of common words.\n\n Consider ""POISE"": \n   - P, O, I, S, E -> E is at the end? No, we cannot put E at the end.\n\n We need to put E in positions 1-4.\n\n How about ""PILED"": \n   - P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th position. This is acceptable. Also, we are testing P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present).\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has D. We are trying to test new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIED"": \n   - S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th.\n\n But both ""PILED"" and ""SPIED"" are valid words.\n\n Another option: ""OWLED"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E.\n\n We must include E and avoid the 5th position.\n\n Let me list some words that have E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th and avoid A,C,R,N.\n\n Position 1: E? \n   - ""E"" at the beginning: e.g., ""ELVIS"", ""EXIST"", ""ENSUE"", but we must avoid A,C,R,N.\n\n   ""ELVIS"": E, L, V, I, S -> no A,C,R,N. But V and S are new.\n\n Position 2: E?\n   - e.g., ""LEMON"", but has O and M? But we don\'t know about O and M. However, we must avoid A,C,R,N -> ""LEMON"" is okay? But ""LEMON"" has M and O.\n\n Position 3: E?\n   - e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> but E is in the 4th? Actually, H,O,T,E,L -> E is in the 4th? Then the 5th is L. But we cannot use E at the 5th? Here E is at 4th so it\'s okay. However, we have to avoid A,C,R,N -> ""HOTEL"" is okay.\n\n But note: we are on the second guess and we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has E in a position that is not 5 and uses common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know the position.\n\n We can try to use E in the second position? \n\n Consider ""DEALT"" -> but A is excluded. So no.\n\n Consider ""BESET"" -> has two E\'s? And S and T. But we don\'t mind duplicates? Actually, we want to avoid duplicates to get more information? But if the word has two E\'s, we\'ll find out.\n\n However, let\'s try to use distinct letters.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: \n   - S, P, I, E, L -> distinct letters, E in the 4th position.\n\n But is ""SPIEL"" a valid word? Yes, it means a period of play in sports or a gambling venture.\n\n Another candidate: ""POISE"" is not allowed because E is at the end. But if we move E to the front? ""EPOXY"" -> but that has X and Y? And E at the front. But we don\'t know about X and Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""MEDIA"" -> but A is excluded.\n\n After some thought, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that we have not tried T, O, L, D, etc. But we are including S, P, I, L and E (which we know is present).\n\n But wait, we are also testing L. And we are putting E in the 4th position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 2nd position? For example, ""LEECH"" -> but that has two E\'s and we don\'t know about H.\n\n How about ""BELOW"": \n   - B, E, L, O, W -> E in the 2nd position. This avoids the 5th. And we are testing B, L, O, W.\n\n This seems good too.\n\n Let me compare:\n   - ""SPIEL"": tests S, P, I, E, L -> E in 4th.\n   - ""BELOW"": tests B, E, L, O, W -> E in 2nd.\n\n Both are valid and cover new letters.\n\n We might also consider ""TEPID"": \n   - T, E, P, I, D -> E in 2nd, and tests T, P, I, D.\n\n But we are trying to cover more vowels? We already know E is present, so we don\'t need to test more vowels? We haven\'t tested I and O? Actually, we haven\'t tested any vowels except E and A (which is absent). So we should test I and O? \n\n The word must have vowels. Since A is absent, the vowels left are E (we know is present), and then I, O, U. We haven\'t tested I and O.\n\n So both ""SPIEL"" and ""BELOW"" test I and O respectively? ""SPIEL"" has I, ""BELOW"" has O.\n\n I think both are good. Let\'s choose one.\n\n I\'ll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in the 2nd position (which is a new position) and we test B, L, O, W.\n\n But note: we are not testing S and T? We might want to test S and T because they are very common.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"": \n   - S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end.\n\n How about ""STILE"": \n   - S, T, I, L, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""STEEL"" -> E at the end? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""SETUP"": \n   - S, E, T, U, P -> E in the 2nd position. This is acceptable. And we test S, T, U, P.\n\n This is a good candidate: ""SETUP"".\n\n But is ""SETUP"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.\n\n We are testing S, E, T, U, P. We know E is present, so we are testing S, T, U, P.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPITE"": \n   - S, P, I, T, E -> E at the end? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"" again? It has E in the 4th and tests S, P, I, L.\n\n I think ""SETUP"" is a good choice because it tests S and T which are very common, and U and P.\n\n But note: we are avoiding the 5th position for E, and in ""SETUP"", E is in the 2nd position.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""SETUP"".\n\n However, let me confirm: \n   - First guess: crane -> C,R,A,N,E (with E marked as present but wrong position, and the others absent).\n   - We are avoiding C,R,A,N and avoiding putting E in the 5th.\n\n ""SETUP"": \n   - S (new), E (we know is present, but in position 2), T (new), U (new), P (new).\n\n This covers 4 new common consonants and one known vowel.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SETUP"".\n\n But wait, what if the secret word has E in the 2nd position? Then we get a match. But we don\'t know. We are trying to find the position.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position that we haven\'t tried? In the first guess, E was in the 5th. Now we try in the 2nd.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""SETUP"".\n\n<guess>setup</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must **include E** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **avoid the 5th position**.\n- It must **exclude C, R, A, N** (confirmed absent).\n- To maximize information, prioritize **new common letters** (e.g., S, T, P, L, O) and **distinct letters**.\n- ""SETUP"" is chosen because:\n  - Contains E in the 2nd position (avoiding the 5th).\n  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, U, P.\n  - All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.\n  - Valid 5-letter word.\n\n<guess>setup</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: setup -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.\n  - E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""setup"" -> S(x), E(✓), T(✓), U(x), P(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S, U, P are absent.\n  - E is present and in the correct position (position 2, since ""setup"" is S-E-T-U-P, so E is the second letter).\n  - T is present and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""setup"", T is the third letter).\n\nSo, from the second guess:\n  - The secret word has E as the second letter and T as the third letter.\n  - Therefore, the word has the form: _ E T _ _\n\nAlso, we know that the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, P. So the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, S, U, P.\n\nWe know E and T are in the word and in the correct positions (E at position 2, T at position 3).\n\nWe have 6 tries and this is the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Has the form: _ E T _ _\n  - Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, U, P (since they are absent)\n  - Must include the letter E (we already have it in position 2) and T (in position 3), and the other letters must be from the remaining alphabet.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that E is present but not at the end, which is consistent because now we have it at position 2.\n\nNow, what letters are left? We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nThe first position: must be a letter not in the absent list. Similarly for the fourth and fifth.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe can think of common words that fit the pattern _ E T _ _.\n\nExamples:\n  - BETH? -> but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n  - Let\'s think: \n      - First position: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n      - Fourth and fifth: same set.\n\nCommon words:\n  - ""BETTY"" -> but has T at the end? Pattern: B E T T Y -> but we have T at position 3 and then another T at position 4? And Y at 5. But we don\'t know if T can be repeated? The feedback for T in the second guess was only for the third position. So it\'s possible to have another T? However, we don\'t have information about duplicate letters. But note: in the first guess, we had only one E and it was present, and in the second guess we have E and T. We haven\'t seen any duplicate letters yet.\n\nBut let\'s check: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we try. So we cannot rule out duplicates.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nBut ""BETTY"" has two T\'s. If we avoid duplicates, we can try words with distinct letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""DEITY"" -> D E I T Y -> but we have T at position 4? No, in ""DEITY"": D (1), E (2), I (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need T at position 3. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need T at position 3, so the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]\n\nSo:\n  - ""METRO"" -> but M E T R O -> but R is absent (from first guess). So no.\n  - ""FETCH"" -> F E T C H -> but C is absent. No.\n  - ""LETUP"" -> L E T U P -> but U and P are absent. No.\n\nWe must avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words:\n\n  - ""BETEL"": B E T E L -> but has two E\'s? And L at the end. But E is at position 2 and 4? We know E is at position 2, but we don\'t know if there is another E. Also, the absent letters: B is not absent? We haven\'t tried B. And E is present, T is present. L is new. But ""BETEL"" is a word? Yes, a type of leaf. But note: the pattern is B E T E L -> so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L. But we have E at position 4? That\'s allowed because we only know E is at position 2, but it could be elsewhere too? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said E is present but not at position 5, but it could be at other positions. However, in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so that doesn\'t prevent E from being at position 4. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? We might get confused if we use two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without E in the other positions to avoid confusion.\n\nBut we know E is at least at position 2. There might be more E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s try to use a word that doesn\'t have E in the other positions, so that if we get a feedback for E in another position, we know it\'s a duplicate.\n\nBut for now, we are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more letters.\n\nAnother word: ""METER"" -> M E T E R -> but R is absent. No.\n\n""JETTY"" -> J E T T Y -> has two T\'s. And J and Y are new. But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n""FETID"" -> F E T I D -> F, I, D are new. And no duplicates. This seems good.\n\n""FETID"" is a word meaning smelly. Pattern: F (1), E (2), T (3), I (4), D (5). \n\nThis fits: _ E T _ _ with F, I, D.\n\nAnd we are testing F, I, D.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BETID"" -> not a word.\n\n""KETCH"" -> K E T C H -> but C is absent. No.\n\n""LETCH"" -> L E T C H -> C absent. No.\n\n""WETLY"" -> W E T L Y -> W, L, Y are new. And no duplicates? ""WETLY"" has no duplicates.\n\nBut is ""WETLY"" common? It\'s an adverb meaning in a wet manner.\n\n""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are both options.\n\nAnother one: ""HETHS"" -> but H E T H S -> has two H\'s and S is absent. No.\n\n""VETCH"" -> V E T C H -> C absent. No.\n\n""METAL"" -> M E T A L -> but A is absent. No.\n\n""METED"" -> M E T E D -> has two E\'s. But we are testing M and D. However, duplicate E.\n\n""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> has two E\'s and T is at the end? Pattern: B E G E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:E, 5:T. But we need T at position 3, not 5. So no.\n\nSo among the options without duplicates and without absent letters: ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"".\n\nWe can also consider ""DEBIT"" -> but D E B I T -> T is at the end? We need T at position 3. So no.\n\n""DELFT"" -> D E L F T -> T at the end? No.\n\nWe need T at position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""MOTET"" -> M O T E T -> but T at position 3 and 5? And E at 4. But pattern: M O T E T -> so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have O and E? But E is at position 4? And we know E is at position 2? Wait, no, in this word E is at position 4. But we already have E at position 2? This word doesn\'t have E at position 2? It has E at position 4. But our pattern requires E at position 2? No, the pattern is fixed: the second letter must be E and the third must be T. So in ""MOTET"": \n  - Position 1: M\n  - Position 2: O? -> but we need E at position 2. So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo we must have E at position 2 and T at position 3.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]\n\nSo ""FETID"": F E T I D -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:I, 5:D -> fits.\n\n""WETLY"": W E T L Y -> 1:W, 2:E, 3:T, 4:L, 5:Y -> fits.\n\n""HELLO"" -> H E L L O -> but then position 3 is L, not T. Doesn\'t fit.\n\n""JETTY"": J E T T Y -> 1:J, 2:E, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> fits, but has two T\'s.\n\nWe might also consider ""BETON"" -> but N is absent.\n\n""LETHE"" -> L E T H E -> has two E\'s and H. But E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess said E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 5 in a different word? No, the feedback for the first guess was that E is present but not in the 5th position of that word. But in the secret word, E might be at position 5? Actually, no: because in the second guess we have E at position 2 and it was correct, so the secret word has E at position 2. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. So any word with E at position 5 would be invalid? But we are not putting E at position 5 in our guesses? We are building the word with E at position 2.\n\nIn ""LETHE"": L E T H E -> position 5 is E, which is not allowed because the first guess told us E is not at position 5. But wait, the first guess feedback was for the word ""crane"", which had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. So the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E at position 5. So ""LETHE"" would be invalid because it has E at position 5? But we are not guessing ""LETHE"", we are considering it as a candidate for the secret word? Actually, we are making a guess, so we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there. But in our guess, we are putting E at position 2, so we don\'t put it at 5. But for the secret word, we know position 5 is not E.\n\nSo in our guess, we can have E only at position 2? Actually, we can have E at other positions? But we know the secret word has E at position 2, so if we put E at another position, it might be a duplicate? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nBut in our guess, we are allowed to put E at other positions to test? However, we already know E is at position 2, so if we put E at position 4, and if it\'s not in the word, we get an absent mark? But we know E is in the word, so if we put it at position 4 and it\'s not there, then we know there is no duplicate? But it might be there and we get a \'-\' or a \'✓\'? \n\nBut to avoid confusion, we might avoid putting E in other positions in this guess? Because we are focusing on the other letters.\n\nSo for the third guess, we can choose a word that has E only at position 2 and no other E\'s, so that we can test the other letters without duplication.\n\nTherefore, ""FETID"" and ""WETLY"" are good because they have E only at position 2.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: L, I, D, F, W, Y, etc.\n\n""FETID"" tests F, I, D.\n""WETLY"" tests W, L, Y.\n\nBoth are valid. We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can think of which letters are more common.\n\nIn English 5-letter words, L, I, D are more common than W, Y? \n\nBut we have to consider the positions.\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth.\n\nCommon letters in the first position: many, but we can look for words that are common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has vowels in the fourth or fifth? We know the secret word has E at 2 and T at 3, so the remaining positions might have vowels? We haven\'t tested O, I, etc.\n\nIn ""FETID"", we have I at position 4, which is a vowel. In ""WETLY"", we have L and Y (Y can be a vowel).\n\nBut both are acceptable.\n\nI think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests F, I, D, which are common.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests O? We haven\'t tested O.\n\nFor example, ""METHOD"" -> but that\'s 6 letters.\n\n""METRO"" is invalid because of R.\n\n""BETON"" is invalid because of N.\n\n""VETO"" is 4 letters.\n\nHow about ""DETOX""? D E T O X -> but that\'s 5 letters: D(1), E(2), T(3), O(4), X(5). And we haven\'t tried D, O, X. So ""DETOX"" is a word.\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,U,P. D, O, X are not in that list.\n\nSo ""DETOX"" is a valid guess.\n\nNow, comparing ""FETID"", ""WETLY"", and ""DETOX"":\n\n  - ""FETID"": tests F, I, D\n  - ""WETLY"": tests W, L, Y\n  - ""DETOX"": tests D, O, X\n\nWe haven\'t tested O, so ""DETOX"" might be good to test O.\n\nAlso, X is less common, but we are testing it.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the secret word, so we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nSince we know the pattern is _ E T _ _, and we have three positions to test, we want to cover letters that are likely to be in the word.\n\nCommon letters in the fourth and fifth positions: vowels like O, I, or consonants like L, D, etc.\n\nI think ""DETOX"" is a good choice because it tests O, which is a common vowel, and D and X.\n\nBut X is not very common, but it\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> but T is at position 5? We need T at position 3. So no.\n\n""DEVOT"" -> not a word.\n\nSo I think ""DETOX"" is a valid and good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""DETOX"" is a 5-letter word meaning to remove toxins.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DETOX"".\n\nBut wait, in ""DETOX"", the letter O is at position 4 and X at position 5.\n\nWe are testing D at position 1, O at 4, X at 5.\n\nWe know E and T are fixed.\n\nSo the guess is ""DETOX"".\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like L or I.\n\nBut ""DETOX"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother common word: ""DELTA"" -> but A is absent.\n\n""FECAL"" -> but A is absent and C is absent? F E C A L -> C and A absent. No.\n\nSo I think ""DETOX"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have not tested L, I, etc. But we can do that in the next guess if needed.\n\nWe can also consider ""BETHS"" -> but H and S? S is absent. No.\n\nSo I choose ""DETOX"".\n\n<guess>detox</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n  - Letters `C`, `R`, `A`, `N` are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - `E` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked `-`).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""setup"" → Feedback: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)**  \n  - `S`, `U`, `P` are **absent**.  \n  - `E` is **correct and in position 2** (marked `✓`).  \n  - `T` is **correct and in position 3** (marked `✓`).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ E T _ _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  \n   - Position 2 = `E` (fixed).  \n   - Position 3 = `T` (fixed).  \n2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `N`, `S`, `U`, `P` cannot appear anywhere.  \n3. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `O`, `W`, `Y`).  \n4. **Constraints**:  \n   - Avoid `E` in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).  \n   - Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow possibilities.  \n- **Chosen word**: **""DETOX""**  \n  - Fits the `_ E T _ _` structure: `D` (pos 1), `E` (pos 2), `T` (pos 3), `O` (pos 4), `X` (pos 5).  \n  - Tests new common letters:  \n    - `D` (position 1)  \n    - `O` (position 4, tests a common vowel)  \n    - `X` (position 5, less common but valuable for elimination)  \n  - Avoids all absent letters and duplicates.  \n  - Valid English word (meaning: to remove toxins).  \n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n- If `D` is correct (pos 1), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  \n- If `O` is correct (pos 4), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  \n- If `X` is correct (pos 5), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests key letters while respecting the fixed positions and absent letters.\n\n<guess>detox</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: setup -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: detox -> FEEDBACK: D(-) E(✓) T(✓) O(x) X(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - Absent: C, R, A, N
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""setup"" -> S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)
  - Absent: S, U, P
  - E is correct at position 2.
  - T is correct at position 3.

Guess 3: ""detox"" -> D(-) E(✓) T(✓) O(x) X(x)
  - D is present but not in position 1 (since it's marked '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 1).
  - E is correct at position 2 (as before).
  - T is correct at position 3 (as before).
  - O and X are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ E T _ _ 
  (positions: 1: unknown, 2: E, 3: T, 4: unknown, 5: unknown)

- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, U, P, O, X
- Present letters (but position not fully known): D (we know it's present but not at position 1)

We also know that E is at position 2 and T at position 3, so they are fixed.

The letter D is present but not at position 1. Therefore, D must be in position 4 or 5 of the secret word.

We have used the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, P, D, O, X.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels) that are not absent: 
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, Y

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]
where:
  - letter1 cannot be D (because D is not at position 1) and must be from the remaining letters.
  - letter4 and letter5: one of them must be D (since D is present and not at position 1, so it must be at 4 or 5). The other can be from the remaining letters.

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

So the word must have D in position 4 or 5.

We can consider two cases:
Case 1: D at position 4 -> word pattern: [letter1] E T D [letter5]
Case 2: D at position 5 -> word pattern: [letter1] E T [letter4] D

We need to find a valid English word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

Case 1: _ E T D _
  - The last letter (position 5) must be a letter that can form a word. Possible words:
      - ""BETED"" -> not a common word? (bet as past tense of bet? but not 5 letters)
      - ""FETED"" -> F E T E D? But that has two E's? And E at position 2 and 4? But we have E at position 2, so position 4 is D? Then position 5 is the last letter. ""FETED"" is F E T E D -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:D -> but then D is at position 5, not 4. So that's case 2.

Actually, for case 1: we want D at position 4, so the word ends with D? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, then position 5 is the last.

So pattern: [1] E T D [5]

What words end with ""ETD""? That doesn't sound right. Let me think of words that have ""ETD"" in the middle? 

Actually, I can't think of any common word with the pattern _ E T D _.

For example:
  - ""METED"" -> M E T E D -> but that's M(1), E(2), T(3), E(4), D(5) -> so D is at position 5, not 4.

Similarly, ""FETED"" is F(1) E(2) T(3) E(4) D(5) -> again D at 5.

So case 1 (D at position 4) seems unlikely. Let me check if there is any word.

How about ""BETID""? But that's B E T I D -> D at position 5? And I is at 4.

I think case 1 is rare. So probably D is at position 5.

Case 2: D at position 5 -> pattern: [1] E T [4] D

So the word ends with ""T D""? Actually, the last two letters are [4] and D, so the ending is [letter]D.

Common words ending with ""TD""? Not many. But we have the pattern: [1] E T [4] D.

So the word is like _ E T _ D.

Examples:
  - ""BETED"" -> not a word? ""Betted"" is 6 letters. 
  - ""FETED"" -> F E T E D -> but that has E at position 4? So [4] is E, then D at 5. But we already have E at position 2? So the word would have two E's? That's possible.

""FETED"" is a word meaning honored or celebrated. It has two E's: one at position 2 and one at position 4.

But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. The feedback from the first guess only said E is present (at least one) and not at position 5. The second guess confirmed E at position 2. The third guess didn't have E at position 4? In ""detox"", we had E at 2 and T at 3, and then O and X. We didn't test E at position 4.

So ""FETED"" is a candidate: 
  - F (position 1, new letter), E (2, fixed), T (3, fixed), E (4, which is a duplicate E), D (5, but we know D is present and we are putting it at 5).

But we have feedback that D is present and not at position 1, so it can be at 5.

But is E allowed at position 4? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if there is a duplicate. The feedback only told us about one E (at position 2) so far. So a duplicate E is possible.

Another candidate: ""MUTED"" -> but U is absent. No.

""JETED"" -> not a word.

""VETTED"" -> 6 letters.

""WETTED"" -> 6 letters.

""LETTED"" -> 6 letters.

""METED"" -> M E T E D -> same as FETED but with M. ""METED"" is a word (past tense of mete). So M(1), E(2), T(3), E(4), D(5).

Similarly, ""FETED"" and ""METED"" are both candidates.

But we have to check the letters: 
  - For ""METED"": M is not absent? We haven't tried M. And E is already known, T known, D known (but we are testing its position). 
  - Similarly, ""FETED"": F is not absent.

But note: in ""METED"" and ""FETED"", we are using two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But it's possible.

Are there words without duplicate E?

For case 2: pattern [1] E T [4] D, with [4] not being E.

What could [4] be? It has to be a vowel or consonant that forms a word.

For example:
  - ""BETID"" -> B E T I D -> but I is at position 4, D at 5. ""BETID"" is not a common word? It might be an archaic word for happened, but not in common use. We need valid words.

  - ""JETTY"" -> but Y is at position 5? And we have D to put at 5? No, we are putting D at 5, so [4] must be a letter that with D makes sense? Actually, the word must end with [letter]D, not necessarily a specific pattern.

  - ""HETCH"" -> not a word.

  - ""KETCH"" -> but C is absent? And we need D at 5? ""KETCH"" ends with H.

  - ""FETID"" -> F E T I D -> this is the pattern: F(1), E(2), T(3), I(4), D(5). And ""FETID"" is a word (meaning smelly). And it has no duplicate E. This is a good candidate.

""FETID"" has I at position 4 and D at position 5. And we are testing F and I, and D is placed at 5.

We know D is present, so in ""FETID"", D is at position 5, which is allowed.

Similarly, we can have ""JETED"" -> not a word.

""LETED"" -> not a word.

So the candidates are:
  - ""FETED"" (with two E's) -> F E T E D
  - ""METED"" (with two E's) -> M E T E D
  - ""FETID"" (with I) -> F E T I D

We also have ""BETID"", but it's less common.

Now, we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, Y.

In ""FETED"", we test F and also we are testing if there is a second E (if we get a check for E at position 4, then we know there is a duplicate).

Similarly, ""METED"" tests M and a second E.

""FETID"" tests F, I, and D (but D we already know is present, so we are testing its position and the letter I).

But note: we know D is present, so in ""FETID"", we are putting D at position 5. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

We want to maximize information.

Since we have limited guesses, we might avoid duplicates if possible to get more information about new letters.

Therefore, ""FETID"" is better because it doesn't have duplicate E, so we test two new letters: F and I.

In ""FETED"", we test F but also use a duplicate E, which might not be in the word, so we get an 'x' for the second E? But if we get an 'x' for the E at position 4, then we know there is no duplicate E. But that's also information.

But we are testing F and also the duplicate E possibility.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have 3 more guesses (since 6 total, we used 3). So we can afford to test.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can test a word that doesn't have E at position 4 to avoid confusion? But we are forced to put E at position 2, so we cannot avoid that.

In ""FETID"", we have no E at position 4, so if the secret word has only one E (at position 2), then we don't get extra marks.

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests F and I, which are common letters.
  - It places D at position 5, which we know is present and we are testing its position.

We also have to consider that the secret word might not have D at position 5? But we know D is present and not at position 1, so it must be at 4 or 5. We are testing position 5.

If we get feedback that D is at position 5 (✓), then we know. If not, then it must be at position 4? But we don't have a candidate for position 4? Then we would have to adjust.

But if we guess ""FETID"" and D is not at position 5, then we get a minus for D, meaning it is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 4. Then we know the word is _ E T D _? But we couldn't find a common word for that pattern. So that would be problematic.

Therefore, it might be safer to assume D is at position 5 and guess accordingly.

But let's see if there are words with D at position 4.

We thought of ""FETED"" and ""METED"", which have D at position 5? No, in ""FETED"": positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:D -> so D is at 5.

Similarly, ""METED"": M(1), E(2), T(3), E(4), D(5).

Is there a word with D at position 4? For example, ""ETUDE"" -> but that's E T U D E, but U is absent and E at position 1? Not matching the pattern.

""BETED"" is not a word.

So I think the only possibilities are words with D at position 5 and a vowel or consonant at position 4.

Therefore, we can guess ""FETID"" to test I at position 4 and D at position 5.

But ""FETID"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""YETIS"" -> but S is absent and we need D? No.

""HEFTY"" -> but no D and Y at the end? Not matching.

So I think ""FETID"" is a good choice.

But let me check the letters: F, E, T, I, D. E and T are fixed, F and I are new, D is known present.

We are testing F at position 1, I at position 4, and D at position 5.

If we get:
  - F at position 1: if correct, ✓; if absent, x; if present elsewhere, -.
  - I at position 4: similarly.
  - D at position 5: similarly.

This will give us good information.

We can also consider ""MIGHT"" -> but no D and not matching pattern.

So I choose ""FETID"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and F, I, D are not absent.

Therefore, the guess is ""FETID"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)`  
  - `C`, `R`, `A`, `N` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **present** but **not in position 5**.  
- **Guess 2: ""setup""** → Feedback: `S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)`  
  - `S`, `U`, `P` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **correct at position 2**.  
  - `T` is **correct at position 3**.  
- **Guess 3: ""detox""** → Feedback: `D(-) E(✓) T(✓) O(x) X(x)`  
  - `D` is **present** but **not in position 1** (marked `-`).  
  - `E` and `T` are **correct** (positions 2 and 3, as before).  
  - `O` and `X` are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ E T _ _` (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
   - Position 2 = `E` (fixed).  
   - Position 3 = `T` (fixed).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `N`, `S`, `U`, `P`, `O`, `X` cannot appear.  
3. **Present letters**:  
   - `D` is **present** but **not in position 1**, so it must be in **position 4 or 5**.  
4. **Remaining letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `W`, `Y`).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 while placing `D` in position 5 (a likely spot based on common words).  
- **Chosen word**: **""FETID""**  
  - Fits the `_ E T _ _` structure: `F` (pos 1), `E` (pos 2), `T` (pos 3), `I` (pos 4), `D` (pos 5).  
  - Tests new common letters:  
    - `F` (position 1)  
    - `I` (position 4, tests a common vowel)  
    - `D` (position 5, confirming its placement)  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct letters for maximum information.  
  - Valid English word (meaning: smelling foul).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If `F` is correct (pos 1), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `I` is correct (pos 4), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `D` is correct (pos 5), we get `✓` (confirming its position); if not, we learn it must be in position 4.  

This guess efficiently tests key letters while leveraging the fixed `E` and `T` positions and the known presence of `D`.

<guess>fetid</guess>",fetid,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Guess 2: ""setup"" -> S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)

  - E is correct at position 2 (as before).
  - T is correct at position 3 (as before).
  - O and X are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ E T _ _ 
  (positions: 1: unknown, 2: E, 3: T, 4: unknown, 5: unknown)

- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, U, P, O, X
- Present letters (but position not fully known): D (we know it's present but not at position 1)

We also know that E is at position 2 and T at position 3, so they are fixed.

The letter D is present but not at position 1. Therefore, D must be in position 4 or 5 of the secret word.

We have used the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, P, D, O, X.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels) that are not absent: 
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, Y

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] E T [letter4] [letter5]
where:
  - letter1 cannot be D (because D is not at position 1) and must be from the remaining letters.
  - letter4 and letter5: one of them must be D (since D is present and not at position 1, so it must be at 4 or 5). The other can be from the remaining letters.

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

So the word must have D in position 4 or 5.

We can consider two cases:
Case 1: D at position 4 -> word pattern: [letter1] E T D [letter5]
Case 2: D at position 5 -> word pattern: [letter1] E T [letter4] D

We need to find a valid English word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

Case 1: _ E T D _
  - The last letter (position 5) must be a letter that can form a word. Possible words:
      - ""BETED"" -> not a common word? (bet as past tense of bet? but not 5 letters)
      - ""FETED"" -> F E T E D? But that has two E's? And E at position 2 and 4? But we have E at position 2, so position 4 is D? Then position 5 is the last letter. ""FETED"" is F E T E D -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:D -> but then D is at position 5, not 4. So that's case 2.

Actually, for case 1: we want D at position 4, so the word ends with D? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, then position 5 is the last.

So pattern: [1] E T D [5]

What words end with ""ETD""? That doesn't sound right. Let me think of words that have ""ETD"" in the middle? 

Actually, I can't think of any common word with the pattern _ E T D _.

For example:
  - ""METED"" -> M E T E D -> but that's M(1), E(2), T(3), E(4), D(5) -> so D is at position 5, not 4.

Similarly, ""FETED"" is F(1) E(2) T(3) E(4) D(5) -> again D at 5.

So case 1 (D at position 4) seems unlikely. Let me check if there is any word.

How about ""BETID""? But that's B E T I D -> D at position 5? And I is at 4.

I think case 1 is rare. So probably D is at position 5.

Case 2: D at position 5 -> pattern: [1] E T [4] D

So the word ends with ""T D""? Actually, the last two letters are [4] and D, so the ending is [letter]D.

Common words ending with ""TD""? Not many. But we have the pattern: [1] E T [4] D.

So the word is like _ E T _ D.

Examples:
  - ""BETED"" -> not a word? ""Betted"" is 6 letters. 
  - ""FETED"" -> F E T E D -> but that has E at position 4? So [4] is E, then D at 5. But we already have E at position 2? So the word would have two E's? That's possible.

""FETED"" is a word meaning honored or celebrated. It has two E's: one at position 2 and one at position 4.

But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. The feedback from the first guess only said E is present (at least one) and not at position 5. The second guess confirmed E at position 2. The third guess didn't have E at position 4? In ""detox"", we had E at 2 and T at 3, and then O and X. We didn't test E at position 4.

So ""FETED"" is a candidate: 
  - F (position 1, new letter), E (2, fixed), T (3, fixed), E (4, which is a duplicate E), D (5, but we know D is present and we are putting it at 5).

But we have feedback that D is present and not at position 1, so it can be at 5.

But is E allowed at position 4? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if there is a duplicate. The feedback only told us about one E (at position 2) so far. So a duplicate E is possible.

Another candidate: ""MUTED"" -> but U is absent. No.

""JETED"" -> not a word.

""VETTED"" -> 6 letters.

""WETTED"" -> 6 letters.

""LETTED"" -> 6 letters.

""METED"" -> M E T E D -> same as FETED but with M. ""METED"" is a word (past tense of mete). So M(1), E(2), T(3), E(4), D(5).

Similarly, ""FETED"" and ""METED"" are both candidates.

But we have to check the letters: 
  - For ""METED"": M is not absent? We haven't tried M. And E is already known, T known, D known (but we are testing its position). 
  - Similarly, ""FETED"": F is not absent.

But note: in ""METED"" and ""FETED"", we are using two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But it's possible.

Are there words without duplicate E?

For case 2: pattern [1] E T [4] D, with [4] not being E.

What could [4] be? It has to be a vowel or consonant that forms a word.

For example:
  - ""BETID"" -> B E T I D -> but I is at position 4, D at 5. ""BETID"" is not a common word? It might be an archaic word for happened, but not in common use. We need valid words.

  - ""JETTY"" -> but Y is at position 5? And we have D to put at 5? No, we are putting D at 5, so [4] must be a letter that with D makes sense? Actually, the word must end with [letter]D, not necessarily a specific pattern.

  - ""HETCH"" -> not a word.

  - ""KETCH"" -> but C is absent? And we need D at 5? ""KETCH"" ends with H.

  - ""FETID"" -> F E T I D -> this is the pattern: F(1), E(2), T(3), I(4), D(5). And ""FETID"" is a word (meaning smelly). And it has no duplicate E. This is a good candidate.

""FETID"" has I at position 4 and D at position 5. And we are testing F and I, and D is placed at 5.

We know D is present, so in ""FETID"", D is at position 5, which is allowed.

Similarly, we can have ""JETED"" -> not a word.

""LETED"" -> not a word.

So the candidates are:
  - ""FETED"" (with two E's) -> F E T E D
  - ""METED"" (with two E's) -> M E T E D
  - ""FETID"" (with I) -> F E T I D

We also have ""BETID"", but it's less common.

Now, we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, Y.

In ""FETED"", we test F and also we are testing if there is a second E (if we get a check for E at position 4, then we know there is a duplicate).

Similarly, ""METED"" tests M and a second E.

""FETID"" tests F, I, and D (but D we already know is present, so we are testing its position and the letter I).

But note: we know D is present, so in ""FETID"", we are putting D at position 5. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

We want to maximize information.

Since we have limited guesses, we might avoid duplicates if possible to get more information about new letters.

Therefore, ""FETID"" is better because it doesn't have duplicate E, so we test two new letters: F and I.

In ""FETED"", we test F but also use a duplicate E, which might not be in the word, so we get an 'x' for the second E? But if we get an 'x' for the E at position 4, then we know there is no duplicate E. But that's also information.

But we are testing F and also the duplicate E possibility.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have 3 more guesses (since 6 total, we used 3). So we can afford to test.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can test a word that doesn't have E at position 4 to avoid confusion? But we are forced to put E at position 2, so we cannot avoid that.

In ""FETID"", we have no E at position 4, so if the secret word has only one E (at position 2), then we don't get extra marks.

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests F and I, which are common letters.
  - It places D at position 5, which we know is present and we are testing its position.

We also have to consider that the secret word might not have D at position 5? But we know D is present and not at position 1, so it must be at 4 or 5. We are testing position 5.

If we get feedback that D is at position 5 (✓), then we know. If not, then it must be at position 4? But we don't have a candidate for position 4? Then we would have to adjust.

But if we guess ""FETID"" and D is not at position 5, then we get a minus for D, meaning it is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 4. Then we know the word is _ E T D _? But we couldn't find a common word for that pattern. So that would be problematic.

Therefore, it might be safer to assume D is at position 5 and guess accordingly.

But let's see if there are words with D at position 4.

We thought of ""FETED"" and ""METED"", which have D at position 5? No, in ""FETED"": positions: 1:F, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:D -> so D is at 5.

Similarly, ""METED"": M(1), E(2), T(3), E(4), D(5).

Is there a word with D at position 4? For example, ""ETUDE"" -> but that's E T U D E, but U is absent and E at position 1? Not matching the pattern.

""BETED"" is not a word.

So I think the only possibilities are words with D at position 5 and a vowel or consonant at position 4.

Therefore, we can guess ""FETID"" to test I at position 4 and D at position 5.

But ""FETID"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""YETIS"" -> but S is absent and we need D? No.

""HEFTY"" -> but no D and Y at the end? Not matching.

So I think ""FETID"" is a good choice.

But let me check the letters: F, E, T, I, D. E and T are fixed, F and I are new, D is known present.

We are testing F at position 1, I at position 4, and D at position 5.

If we get:
  - F at position 1: if correct, ✓; if absent, x; if present elsewhere, -.
  - I at position 4: similarly.
  - D at position 5: similarly.

This will give us good information.

We can also consider ""MIGHT"" -> but no D and not matching pattern.

So I choose ""FETID"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and F, I, D are not absent.

Therefore, the guess is ""FETID"".

<guess>fetid</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)`  
  - `C`, `R`, `A`, `N` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **present** but **not in position 5**.  
- **Guess 2: ""setup""** → Feedback: `S(x) E(✓) T(✓) U(x) P(x)`  
  - `S`, `U`, `P` are **absent**.  
  - `E` is **correct at position 2**.  
  - `T` is **correct at position 3**.  
- **Guess 3: ""detox""** → Feedback: `D(-) E(✓) T(✓) O(x) X(x)`  
  - `D` is **present** but **not in position 1** (marked `-`).  
  - `E` and `T` are **correct** (positions 2 and 3, as before).  
  - `O` and `X` are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ E T _ _` (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
   - Position 2 = `E` (fixed).  
   - Position 3 = `T` (fixed).  
2. **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `N`, `S`, `U`, `P`, `O`, `X` cannot appear.  
3. **Present letters**:  
   - `D` is **present** but **not in position 1**, so it must be in **position 4 or 5**.  
4. **Remaining letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `M`, `W`, `Y`).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 while placing `D` in position 5 (a likely spot based on common words).  
- **Chosen word**: **""FETID""**  
  - Fits the `_ E T _ _` structure: `F` (pos 1), `E` (pos 2), `T` (pos 3), `I` (pos 4), `D` (pos 5).  
  - Tests new common letters:  
    - `F` (position 1)  
    - `I` (position 4, tests a common vowel)  
    - `D` (position 5, confirming its placement)  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct letters for maximum information.  
  - Valid English word (meaning: smelling foul).  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If `F` is correct (pos 1), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `I` is correct (pos 4), we get `✓`; if absent, `x`; if present elsewhere, `-`.  
- If `D` is correct (pos 5), we get `✓` (confirming its position); if not, we learn it must be in position 4.  

This guess efficiently tests key letters while leveraging the fixed `E` and `T` positions and the known presence of `D`.",Guess 4: fetid -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) E(✓) T(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
