We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 To maximize information gain, a common strategy is to start with a word that has a good balance of common letters and minimal repeating letters.
 Let's choose a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular opener because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.
 However, note the example uses ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". Another good starter is ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) but might be less common.
 Alternatively, ""SALET"" is another good choice in Wordle. But since we are playing in a normal setting, let's use ""CRANE"".
 But note: we are allowed only real 5-letter words.

 After checking common starter words, ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and covers 5 distinct letters including 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the feedback will be given in the format: letter(symbol). We will interpret that in the next steps.

 Since it's the first guess, we have to pick one. Let's choose ""CRANE"".

<thinking>
The game begins with no information about the secret word. For an effective first guess, we should aim to cover multiple common letters and vowels to maximize potential feedback. 

Common strategies involve choosing words with:
- High-frequency vowels (A, E, O) and consonants (R, S, T, N)
- No repeating letters to test more characters at once

A strong opener like ""ROATE"" (an anagram of ""ORATE"") is often used, but it's moderately obscure. Instead, ""CRANE"" is an ideal balance:
- Includes common vowels (A, E)
- Common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses 5 distinct letters
- Is a familiar word

This choice will provide clear feedback on vowel positions, critical consonants, and potential for process-of-elimination in subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically:
  - A is not in position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5, with position 1 being the first letter).
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

Since A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed, we need to think of a new word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are present) but in different positions.
- Excludes C and R (since they are absent).
- Also, we should try to include other common letters to test more letters.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We must form a 5-letter English word that has A, N, E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the positions in the feedback are relative to the guess.

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> not in word
- Position 3: A -> in word, but not at position 3
- Position 4: N -> in word, but not at position 4
- Position 5: E -> in word, but not at position 5

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3, N at position 4, and E at position 5.

Moreover, we know the word has A, N, E, and two other letters (which are not C or R). We don't know the other two letters yet.

We should try to use a word that places A, N, and E in new positions and introduces two new letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that contain A, N, E, and two other consonants or vowels, avoiding C and R.

Possible words:

- We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Similarly, N can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).
- E can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

But note: we don't know the positions, so we have to try.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters.

For example:
- ""SANE?"" But that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""PLANE"" -> but P, L, A, N, E. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, which we must avoid because in the feedback A was at position 3 and was wrong. But wait: the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the new word, we can put A at a different position? Actually, we can, but we must not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that because it would put A in the same position that we know is wrong.

So we must avoid words that have A at position 3, N at position 4, or E at position 5.

Let me try to think of words with A, N, E.

- ""ANVIL"" -> but no E? Doesn't have E.
- ""EATEN"" -> has E, A, T, E, N. But it has two E's? Let's check: E at pos1, A at pos2, T at pos3, E at pos4, N at pos5. But we have E at pos1 and pos4, and we know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" only showed one E as present (at pos5, which was wrong). But it didn't say anything about duplicates. So the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So we must consider that possibility.

But in ""CRANE"", we had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more.

Similarly for A and N.

But in ""EATEN"", we have E at position 1 and 4, and A at position 2, N at position 5.

Now, in our feedback, we know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first guess). But in ""EATEN"", E is at position 1 and 4, which are allowed. Also, A is at position 2 (not 3, so allowed) and N is at position 5 (but in the first guess, N was at position 4 and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent N from being at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 5.

Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it can be at other positions.

So ""EATEN"" might be a candidate. But let's check the letters: it uses E, A, T, E, N. We are introducing T, which is a new letter. Also, we are avoiding C and R.

But note: we have two E's. Is that okay? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we have to consider that possibility.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to get clearer information.

Another word: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S. 
- Positions: E at 2, A at 3, N at 4, S at 5. 
But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was wrong. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. In ""LEANS"", A is at position 3, so that's not allowed.

Similarly, ""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, which is forbidden.

""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, same problem.

""WEANS"": same.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but with A not at 3, N not at 4, and E not at 5.

Let me try to put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that doesn't have N or E? Wait, it has A, D, I, E, U -> no N.

We need a word that has A, N, and E.

Try A at position 1: 
- ""ANODE"": A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was wrong. So we cannot put E at position 5 in this guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (or maybe even absent if there is only one E and it's not at 5). But to avoid redundant testing, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So in ""ANODE"": 
- A at 1: okay (since previously A was at 3, now at 1 is new)
- N at 2: okay (previously at 4, now at 2 is new)
- E at 5: not okay, because we know E is not at position 5.

So we cannot use ""ANODE"" because of E at 5.

Another word: ""ALINE"" -> A at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5. 
But N at position 4 is forbidden (we know N is not at position 4) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not good.

""AMINE"": A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5 -> same problem: N at 4 and E at 5.

""AZINE"" - not common.

Try putting A at position 2: 
- ""SAINT"" -> S, A, I, N, T -> but no E? We need E in the word because we know it's present. So must include E.

""SAINE"" - not a word.

""PAINT"" - no E.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> 
- A at position 2: okay (not 3)
- E at position 4: okay (not 5)
- N at position 5: okay (not 4) because previously N was at 4, but now at 5 is different.

So ""TAKEN"" has:
- T: new letter
- A: at position 2 (allowed)
- K: new letter
- E: at position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- N: at position 5 (allowed, since not 4)

Also, it avoids C and R.

So ""TAKEN"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

We can also consider ""BAKEN"" - not a word.

""MAKEN"" - not common.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N -> same as TAKEN but with W. Also valid.

But ""TAKEN"" is more common.

Another option: ""EAGLE"" -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another word: ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T. 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 3: not allowed! Because we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

Similarly, ""NEAPS"": N, E, A, P, S -> 
- N at 1: okay
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> A at 3: not allowed.

""YEANS"": same.

So ""TAKEN"" seems good.

But let me check: in ""TAKEN"", we have A at 2, E at 4, N at 5. That's acceptable.

We are introducing T and K, which are new.

Alternatively, ""NAIVE"": N, A, I, V, E -> 
- N at 1: okay (previously at 4, now at 1)
- A at 2: okay
- E at 5: not allowed (we know E is not at position 5)

So not good.

""DAVEN"": D, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

But is ""DAVEN"" a word? It might be obscure. ""Daven"" is a verb meaning to pray, but it's not very common. ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

""HAVEN"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""RAVEN"" -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R and C.

So ""HAVEN"" is acceptable: H, A, V, E, N.

Similarly, ""WAVEN"" - not a word.

""HAVEN"" and ""TAKEN"" are both good.

But ""TAKEN"" uses T and K, while ""HAVEN"" uses H and V. Both are common consonants.

We might also consider ""LANES"" but that has A at 3, which is not allowed.

Another word: ""SALNE"" - not a word.

""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""EASEL"" - no N.

So between ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"", which one? Both are valid.

We can also do ""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> 
- A at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay (previously at 4, now at 3 is new)
- E at 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""MEANT"": M, E, A, N, T -> 
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""NEATO"" - not a word.

So I think ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"" are good choices.

But note: we are trying to test new letters. In ""TAKEN"", we test T and K. In ""HAVEN"", we test H and V. Both are fine.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"" all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""BEANS"" -> but A at 3 not allowed.

""DEALT"" -> no N.

""HELPN"" - not a word.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. For example, S or T.

""TAKEN"" has T and K. K is less common than S or L.

What about ""SALET""? But A at 2? ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- But no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another idea: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> has two N's. 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4? From the first guess, we know N is not at position 4. But in ""SENNA"", we have N at position 3 and 4. The N at position 4 might be invalid? The feedback only said that the N at position 4 in ""CRANE"" was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the N at position 4 in ""SENNA"" might be correct? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So if the secret word has two N's, then in ""SENNA"", the N at position 3 might be correct or wrong, and the N at position 4 might be correct or wrong. But we know that in the secret word, there is at least one N, and it is not at position 4 (from the first guess). So if we put N at position 4 in a new guess, it might be marked as:
  - If the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4, then the N at position 4 would be marked as absent (x) or if it's at a different position, then the duplicate might be marked as absent? The rules are: each letter is marked independently.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word without duplicates for now.

So ""SENNA"" might be messy.

Similarly, ""ANENT"" - not common.

So back to ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"".

Another word: ""LATEN"" - not common.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay (but we are putting E at 1 and 4, and we know E is in the word but not at 5, so positions 1 and 4 are allowed)
- N at 5: okay (not 4)

But we have two E's. The secret word might have only one E, so the second E might be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, using a duplicate might give us information about frequency.

But for clarity, I prefer to use a word with distinct letters.

So ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"" is also distinct.

But ""TAKEN"" has the advantage of using T, which is a very common letter.

So I'll go with ""TAKEN"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""TAKEN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A, N, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- Specifically, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A, N, and E (since they are confirmed present), but in new positions (avoiding position 3 for A, position 4 for N, and position 5 for E).
- It must exclude C and R (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, introduce new common letters (e.g., T, K) and avoid duplicate letters for clarity.
- ""TAKEN"" fits these criteria:
  - A is in position 2 (not 3).
  - N is in position 5 (not 4).
  - E is in position 4 (not 5).
  - New letters T and K are tested.
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>TAKEN</guess>",TAKEN,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically:
  - A is not in position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5, with position 1 being the first letter).
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

Since A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed, we need to think of a new word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are present) but in different positions.
- Excludes C and R (since they are absent).
- Also, we should try to include other common letters to test more letters.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We must form a 5-letter English word that has A, N, E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the positions in the feedback are relative to the guess.

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> not in word
- Position 3: A -> in word, but not at position 3
- Position 4: N -> in word, but not at position 4
- Position 5: E -> in word, but not at position 5

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3, N at position 4, and E at position 5.

Moreover, we know the word has A, N, E, and two other letters (which are not C or R). We don't know the other two letters yet.

We should try to use a word that places A, N, and E in new positions and introduces two new letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that contain A, N, E, and two other consonants or vowels, avoiding C and R.

Possible words:

- We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Similarly, N can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).
- E can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

But note: we don't know the positions, so we have to try.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters.

For example:
- ""SANE?"" But that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""PLANE"" -> but P, L, A, N, E. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, which we must avoid because in the feedback A was at position 3 and was wrong. But wait: the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the new word, we can put A at a different position? Actually, we can, but we must not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that because it would put A in the same position that we know is wrong.

So we must avoid words that have A at position 3, N at position 4, or E at position 5.

Let me try to think of words with A, N, E.

- ""ANVIL"" -> but no E? Doesn't have E.
- ""EATEN"" -> has E, A, T, E, N. But it has two E's? Let's check: E at pos1, A at pos2, T at pos3, E at pos4, N at pos5. But we have E at pos1 and pos4, and we know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" only showed one E as present (at pos5, which was wrong). But it didn't say anything about duplicates. So the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So we must consider that possibility.

But in ""CRANE"", we had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more.

Similarly for A and N.

But in ""EATEN"", we have E at position 1 and 4, and A at position 2, N at position 5.

Now, in our feedback, we know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first guess). But in ""EATEN"", E is at position 1 and 4, which are allowed. Also, A is at position 2 (not 3, so allowed) and N is at position 5 (but in the first guess, N was at position 4 and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent N from being at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 5.

Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it can be at other positions.

So ""EATEN"" might be a candidate. But let's check the letters: it uses E, A, T, E, N. We are introducing T, which is a new letter. Also, we are avoiding C and R.

But note: we have two E's. Is that okay? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we have to consider that possibility.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to get clearer information.

Another word: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S. 
- Positions: E at 2, A at 3, N at 4, S at 5. 
But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was wrong. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. In ""LEANS"", A is at position 3, so that's not allowed.

Similarly, ""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, which is forbidden.

""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, same problem.

""WEANS"": same.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but with A not at 3, N not at 4, and E not at 5.

Let me try to put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that doesn't have N or E? Wait, it has A, D, I, E, U -> no N.

We need a word that has A, N, and E.

Try A at position 1: 
- ""ANODE"": A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was wrong. So we cannot put E at position 5 in this guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (or maybe even absent if there is only one E and it's not at 5). But to avoid redundant testing, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So in ""ANODE"": 
- A at 1: okay (since previously A was at 3, now at 1 is new)
- N at 2: okay (previously at 4, now at 2 is new)
- E at 5: not okay, because we know E is not at position 5.

So we cannot use ""ANODE"" because of E at 5.

Another word: ""ALINE"" -> A at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5. 
But N at position 4 is forbidden (we know N is not at position 4) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not good.

""AMINE"": A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5 -> same problem: N at 4 and E at 5.

""AZINE"" - not common.

Try putting A at position 2: 
- ""SAINT"" -> S, A, I, N, T -> but no E? We need E in the word because we know it's present. So must include E.

""SAINE"" - not a word.

""PAINT"" - no E.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> 
- A at position 2: okay (not 3)
- E at position 4: okay (not 5)
- N at position 5: okay (not 4) because previously N was at 4, but now at 5 is different.

So ""TAKEN"" has:
- T: new letter
- A: at position 2 (allowed)
- K: new letter
- E: at position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- N: at position 5 (allowed, since not 4)

Also, it avoids C and R.

So ""TAKEN"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

We can also consider ""BAKEN"" - not a word.

""MAKEN"" - not common.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N -> same as TAKEN but with W. Also valid.

But ""TAKEN"" is more common.

Another option: ""EAGLE"" -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another word: ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T. 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 3: not allowed! Because we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

Similarly, ""NEAPS"": N, E, A, P, S -> 
- N at 1: okay
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> A at 3: not allowed.

""YEANS"": same.

So ""TAKEN"" seems good.

But let me check: in ""TAKEN"", we have A at 2, E at 4, N at 5. That's acceptable.

We are introducing T and K, which are new.

Alternatively, ""NAIVE"": N, A, I, V, E -> 
- N at 1: okay (previously at 4, now at 1)
- A at 2: okay
- E at 5: not allowed (we know E is not at position 5)

So not good.

""DAVEN"": D, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

But is ""DAVEN"" a word? It might be obscure. ""Daven"" is a verb meaning to pray, but it's not very common. ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

""HAVEN"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""RAVEN"" -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R and C.

So ""HAVEN"" is acceptable: H, A, V, E, N.

Similarly, ""WAVEN"" - not a word.

""HAVEN"" and ""TAKEN"" are both good.

But ""TAKEN"" uses T and K, while ""HAVEN"" uses H and V. Both are common consonants.

We might also consider ""LANES"" but that has A at 3, which is not allowed.

Another word: ""SALNE"" - not a word.

""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""EASEL"" - no N.

So between ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"", which one? Both are valid.

We can also do ""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> 
- A at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay (previously at 4, now at 3 is new)
- E at 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""MEANT"": M, E, A, N, T -> 
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""NEATO"" - not a word.

So I think ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"" are good choices.

But note: we are trying to test new letters. In ""TAKEN"", we test T and K. In ""HAVEN"", we test H and V. Both are fine.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"" all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""BEANS"" -> but A at 3 not allowed.

""DEALT"" -> no N.

""HELPN"" - not a word.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. For example, S or T.

""TAKEN"" has T and K. K is less common than S or L.

What about ""SALET""? But A at 2? ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- But no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another idea: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> has two N's. 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4? From the first guess, we know N is not at position 4. But in ""SENNA"", we have N at position 3 and 4. The N at position 4 might be invalid? The feedback only said that the N at position 4 in ""CRANE"" was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the N at position 4 in ""SENNA"" might be correct? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So if the secret word has two N's, then in ""SENNA"", the N at position 3 might be correct or wrong, and the N at position 4 might be correct or wrong. But we know that in the secret word, there is at least one N, and it is not at position 4 (from the first guess). So if we put N at position 4 in a new guess, it might be marked as:
  - If the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4, then the N at position 4 would be marked as absent (x) or if it's at a different position, then the duplicate might be marked as absent? The rules are: each letter is marked independently.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word without duplicates for now.

So ""SENNA"" might be messy.

Similarly, ""ANENT"" - not common.

So back to ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"".

Another word: ""LATEN"" - not common.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay (but we are putting E at 1 and 4, and we know E is in the word but not at 5, so positions 1 and 4 are allowed)
- N at 5: okay (not 4)

But we have two E's. The secret word might have only one E, so the second E might be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, using a duplicate might give us information about frequency.

But for clarity, I prefer to use a word with distinct letters.

So ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"" is also distinct.

But ""TAKEN"" has the advantage of using T, which is a very common letter.

So I'll go with ""TAKEN"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""TAKEN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A, N, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- Specifically, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A, N, and E (since they are confirmed present), but in new positions (avoiding position 3 for A, position 4 for N, and position 5 for E).
- It must exclude C and R (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, introduce new common letters (e.g., T, K) and avoid duplicate letters for clarity.
- ""TAKEN"" fits these criteria:
  - A is in position 2 (not 3).
  - N is in position 5 (not 4).
  - E is in position 4 (not 5).
  - New letters T and K are tested.
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 2: TAKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,PENAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 To maximize information gain, a common strategy is to start with a word that has a good balance of common letters and minimal repeating letters.
 Let's choose a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular opener because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.
 However, note the example uses ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". Another good starter is ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) but might be less common.
 Alternatively, ""SALET"" is another good choice in Wordle. But since we are playing in a normal setting, let's use ""CRANE"".
 But note: we are allowed only real 5-letter words.

 After checking common starter words, ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and covers 5 distinct letters including 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the feedback will be given in the format: letter(symbol). We will interpret that in the next steps.

 Since it's the first guess, we have to pick one. Let's choose ""CRANE"".<thinking>
The game begins with no information about the secret word. For an effective first guess, we should aim to cover multiple common letters and vowels to maximize potential feedback. 

Common strategies involve choosing words with:
- High-frequency vowels (A, E, O) and consonants (R, S, T, N)
- No repeating letters to test more characters at once

A strong opener like ""ROATE"" (an anagram of ""ORATE"") is often used, but it's moderately obscure. Instead, ""CRANE"" is an ideal balance:
- Includes common vowels (A, E)
- Common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses 5 distinct letters
- Is a familiar word

This choice will provide clear feedback on vowel positions, critical consonants, and potential for process-of-elimination in subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically:
  - A is not in position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5, with position 1 being the first letter).
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

Since A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed, we need to think of a new word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are present) but in different positions.
- Excludes C and R (since they are absent).
- Also, we should try to include other common letters to test more letters.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We must form a 5-letter English word that has A, N, E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the positions in the feedback are relative to the guess.

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> not in word
- Position 3: A -> in word, but not at position 3
- Position 4: N -> in word, but not at position 4
- Position 5: E -> in word, but not at position 5

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3, N at position 4, and E at position 5.

Moreover, we know the word has A, N, E, and two other letters (which are not C or R). We don't know the other two letters yet.

We should try to use a word that places A, N, and E in new positions and introduces two new letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that contain A, N, E, and two other consonants or vowels, avoiding C and R.

Possible words:

- We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Similarly, N can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).
- E can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

But note: we don't know the positions, so we have to try.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters.

For example:
- ""SANE?"" But that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""PLANE"" -> but P, L, A, N, E. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, which we must avoid because in the feedback A was at position 3 and was wrong. But wait: the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the new word, we can put A at a different position? Actually, we can, but we must not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that because it would put A in the same position that we know is wrong.

So we must avoid words that have A at position 3, N at position 4, or E at position 5.

Let me try to think of words with A, N, E.

- ""ANVIL"" -> but no E? Doesn't have E.
- ""EATEN"" -> has E, A, T, E, N. But it has two E's? Let's check: E at pos1, A at pos2, T at pos3, E at pos4, N at pos5. But we have E at pos1 and pos4, and we know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" only showed one E as present (at pos5, which was wrong). But it didn't say anything about duplicates. So the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So we must consider that possibility.

But in ""CRANE"", we had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more.

Similarly for A and N.

But in ""EATEN"", we have E at position 1 and 4, and A at position 2, N at position 5.

Now, in our feedback, we know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first guess). But in ""EATEN"", E is at position 1 and 4, which are allowed. Also, A is at position 2 (not 3, so allowed) and N is at position 5 (but in the first guess, N was at position 4 and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent N from being at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 5.

Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it can be at other positions.

So ""EATEN"" might be a candidate. But let's check the letters: it uses E, A, T, E, N. We are introducing T, which is a new letter. Also, we are avoiding C and R.

But note: we have two E's. Is that okay? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we have to consider that possibility.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to get clearer information.

Another word: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S. 
- Positions: E at 2, A at 3, N at 4, S at 5. 
But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was wrong. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. In ""LEANS"", A is at position 3, so that's not allowed.

Similarly, ""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, which is forbidden.

""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, same problem.

""WEANS"": same.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but with A not at 3, N not at 4, and E not at 5.

Let me try to put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that doesn't have N or E? Wait, it has A, D, I, E, U -> no N.

We need a word that has A, N, and E.

Try A at position 1: 
- ""ANODE"": A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was wrong. So we cannot put E at position 5 in this guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (or maybe even absent if there is only one E and it's not at 5). But to avoid redundant testing, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So in ""ANODE"": 
- A at 1: okay (since previously A was at 3, now at 1 is new)
- N at 2: okay (previously at 4, now at 2 is new)
- E at 5: not okay, because we know E is not at position 5.

So we cannot use ""ANODE"" because of E at 5.

Another word: ""ALINE"" -> A at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5. 
But N at position 4 is forbidden (we know N is not at position 4) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not good.

""AMINE"": A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5 -> same problem: N at 4 and E at 5.

""AZINE"" - not common.

Try putting A at position 2: 
- ""SAINT"" -> S, A, I, N, T -> but no E? We need E in the word because we know it's present. So must include E.

""SAINE"" - not a word.

""PAINT"" - no E.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> 
- A at position 2: okay (not 3)
- E at position 4: okay (not 5)
- N at position 5: okay (not 4) because previously N was at 4, but now at 5 is different.

So ""TAKEN"" has:
- T: new letter
- A: at position 2 (allowed)
- K: new letter
- E: at position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- N: at position 5 (allowed, since not 4)

Also, it avoids C and R.

So ""TAKEN"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

We can also consider ""BAKEN"" - not a word.

""MAKEN"" - not common.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N -> same as TAKEN but with W. Also valid.

But ""TAKEN"" is more common.

Another option: ""EAGLE"" -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another word: ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T. 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 3: not allowed! Because we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

Similarly, ""NEAPS"": N, E, A, P, S -> 
- N at 1: okay
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> A at 3: not allowed.

""YEANS"": same.

So ""TAKEN"" seems good.

But let me check: in ""TAKEN"", we have A at 2, E at 4, N at 5. That's acceptable.

We are introducing T and K, which are new.

Alternatively, ""NAIVE"": N, A, I, V, E -> 
- N at 1: okay (previously at 4, now at 1)
- A at 2: okay
- E at 5: not allowed (we know E is not at position 5)

So not good.

""DAVEN"": D, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

But is ""DAVEN"" a word? It might be obscure. ""Daven"" is a verb meaning to pray, but it's not very common. ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

""HAVEN"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""RAVEN"" -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R and C.

So ""HAVEN"" is acceptable: H, A, V, E, N.

Similarly, ""WAVEN"" - not a word.

""HAVEN"" and ""TAKEN"" are both good.

But ""TAKEN"" uses T and K, while ""HAVEN"" uses H and V. Both are common consonants.

We might also consider ""LANES"" but that has A at 3, which is not allowed.

Another word: ""SALNE"" - not a word.

""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""EASEL"" - no N.

So between ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"", which one? Both are valid.

We can also do ""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> 
- A at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay (previously at 4, now at 3 is new)
- E at 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""MEANT"": M, E, A, N, T -> 
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""NEATO"" - not a word.

So I think ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"" are good choices.

But note: we are trying to test new letters. In ""TAKEN"", we test T and K. In ""HAVEN"", we test H and V. Both are fine.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"" all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""BEANS"" -> but A at 3 not allowed.

""DEALT"" -> no N.

""HELPN"" - not a word.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. For example, S or T.

""TAKEN"" has T and K. K is less common than S or L.

What about ""SALET""? But A at 2? ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- But no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another idea: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> has two N's. 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4? From the first guess, we know N is not at position 4. But in ""SENNA"", we have N at position 3 and 4. The N at position 4 might be invalid? The feedback only said that the N at position 4 in ""CRANE"" was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the N at position 4 in ""SENNA"" might be correct? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So if the secret word has two N's, then in ""SENNA"", the N at position 3 might be correct or wrong, and the N at position 4 might be correct or wrong. But we know that in the secret word, there is at least one N, and it is not at position 4 (from the first guess). So if we put N at position 4 in a new guess, it might be marked as:
  - If the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4, then the N at position 4 would be marked as absent (x) or if it's at a different position, then the duplicate might be marked as absent? The rules are: each letter is marked independently.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word without duplicates for now.

So ""SENNA"" might be messy.

Similarly, ""ANENT"" - not common.

So back to ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"".

Another word: ""LATEN"" - not common.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay (but we are putting E at 1 and 4, and we know E is in the word but not at 5, so positions 1 and 4 are allowed)
- N at 5: okay (not 4)

But we have two E's. The secret word might have only one E, so the second E might be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, using a duplicate might give us information about frequency.

But for clarity, I prefer to use a word with distinct letters.

So ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"" is also distinct.

But ""TAKEN"" has the advantage of using T, which is a very common letter.

So I'll go with ""TAKEN"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""TAKEN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A, N, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- Specifically, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A, N, and E (since they are confirmed present), but in new positions (avoiding position 3 for A, position 4 for N, and position 5 for E).
- It must exclude C and R (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, introduce new common letters (e.g., T, K) and avoid duplicate letters for clarity.
- ""TAKEN"" fits these criteria:
  - A is in position 2 (not 3).
  - N is in position 5 (not 4).
  - E is in position 4 (not 5).
  - New letters T and K are tested.
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.

But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n- ""PLANE"" -> but P, L, A, N, E. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, which we must avoid because in the feedback A was at position 3 and was wrong. But wait: the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the new word, we can put A at a different position? Actually, we can, but we must not put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that because it would put A in the same position that we know is wrong.\n\nSo we must avoid words that have A at position 3, N at position 4, or E at position 5.\n\nLet me try to think of words with A, N, E.\n\n- ""ANVIL"" -> but no E? Doesn\'t have E.\n- ""EATEN"" -> has E, A, T, E, N. But it has two E\'s? Let\'s check: E at pos1, A at pos2, T at pos3, E at pos4, N at pos5. But we have E at pos1 and pos4, and we know that E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" only showed one E as present (at pos5, which was wrong). But it didn\'t say anything about duplicates. So the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say the word has unique letters. So we must consider that possibility.\n\nBut in ""CRANE"", we had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more.\n\nSimilarly for A and N.\n\nBut in ""EATEN"", we have E at position 1 and 4, and A at position 2, N at position 5.\n\nNow, in our feedback, we know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first guess). But in ""EATEN"", E is at position 1 and 4, which are allowed. Also, A is at position 2 (not 3, so allowed) and N is at position 5 (but in the first guess, N was at position 4 and was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent N from being at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, E is not at position 5, but it can be at other positions.\n\nSo ""EATEN"" might be a candidate. But let\'s check the letters: it uses E, A, T, E, N. We are introducing T, which is a new letter. Also, we are avoiding C and R.\n\nBut note: we have two E\'s. Is that okay? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know. But we have to consider that possibility.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to get clearer information.\n\nAnother word: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S. \n- Positions: E at 2, A at 3, N at 4, S at 5. \nBut we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was wrong. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. In ""LEANS"", A is at position 3, so that\'s not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, which is forbidden.\n\n""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, same problem.\n\n""WEANS"": same.\n\nSo we need a word that has A, N, E but with A not at 3, N not at 4, and E not at 5.\n\nLet me try to put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that doesn\'t have N or E? Wait, it has A, D, I, E, U -> no N.\n\nWe need a word that has A, N, and E.\n\nTry A at position 1: \n- ""ANODE"": A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was wrong. So we cannot put E at position 5 in this guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (or maybe even absent if there is only one E and it\'s not at 5). But to avoid redundant testing, we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nSo in ""ANODE"": \n- A at 1: okay (since previously A was at 3, now at 1 is new)\n- N at 2: okay (previously at 4, now at 2 is new)\n- E at 5: not okay, because we know E is not at position 5.\n\nSo we cannot use ""ANODE"" because of E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""ALINE"" -> A at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5. \nBut N at position 4 is forbidden (we know N is not at position 4) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not good.\n\n""AMINE"": A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5 -> same problem: N at 4 and E at 5.\n\n""AZINE"" - not common.\n\nTry putting A at position 2: \n- ""SAINT"" -> S, A, I, N, T -> but no E? We need E in the word because we know it\'s present. So must include E.\n\n""SAINE"" - not a word.\n\n""PAINT"" - no E.\n\n""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> \n- A at position 2: okay (not 3)\n- E at position 4: okay (not 5)\n- N at position 5: okay (not 4) because previously N was at 4, but now at 5 is different.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" has:\n- T: new letter\n- A: at position 2 (allowed)\n- K: new letter\n- E: at position 4 (allowed, since not 5)\n- N: at position 5 (allowed, since not 4)\n\nAlso, it avoids C and R.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.\n\nWe can also consider ""BAKEN"" - not a word.\n\n""MAKEN"" - not common.\n\n""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N -> same as TAKEN but with W. Also valid.\n\nBut ""TAKEN"" is more common.\n\nAnother option: ""EAGLE"" -> but no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include A, N, and E.\n\nAnother word: ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T. \n- E at 1: okay\n- A at 3: not allowed! Because we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""NEAPS"": N, E, A, P, S -> \n- N at 1: okay\n- E at 2: okay\n- A at 3: not allowed.\n\n""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> A at 3: not allowed.\n\n""YEANS"": same.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check: in ""TAKEN"", we have A at 2, E at 4, N at 5. That\'s acceptable.\n\nWe are introducing T and K, which are new.\n\nAlternatively, ""NAIVE"": N, A, I, V, E -> \n- N at 1: okay (previously at 4, now at 1)\n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 5: not allowed (we know E is not at position 5)\n\nSo not good.\n\n""DAVEN"": D, A, V, E, N -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 4: okay\n- N at 5: okay\n\nBut is ""DAVEN"" a word? It might be obscure. ""Daven"" is a verb meaning to pray, but it\'s not very common. ""TAKEN"" is better.\n\n""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 4: okay\n- N at 5: okay\n\n""HAVEN"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""RAVEN"" -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.\n\nWe must avoid R and C.\n\nSo ""HAVEN"" is acceptable: H, A, V, E, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""WAVEN"" - not a word.\n\n""HAVEN"" and ""TAKEN"" are both good.\n\nBut ""TAKEN"" uses T and K, while ""HAVEN"" uses H and V. Both are common consonants.\n\nWe might also consider ""LANES"" but that has A at 3, which is not allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""SALNE"" - not a word.\n\n""ANEWS"" - not a word.\n\n""EASEL"" - no N.\n\nSo between ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"", which one? Both are valid.\n\nWe can also do ""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- N at 3: okay (previously at 4, now at 3 is new)\n- E at 5: not allowed.\n\nSo not good.\n\n""MEANT"": M, E, A, N, T -> \n- E at 2: okay\n- A at 3: not allowed.\n\n""NEATO"" - not a word.\n\nSo I think ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"" are good choices.\n\nBut note: we are trying to test new letters. In ""TAKEN"", we test T and K. In ""HAVEN"", we test H and V. Both are fine.\n\nBut we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but in ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"" all letters are distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""BEANS"" -> but A at 3 not allowed.\n\n""DEALT"" -> no N.\n\n""HELPN"" - not a word.\n\nI think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 3)
- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5)

Guess 2: TAKEN
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 2) [because in TAKEN, A is at position 2]
- K: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4) [in TAKEN, E is at position 4]
- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5) [in TAKEN, N is at position 5]

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, T, K (so these are not in the word)

Present letters (but position unknown): A, E, N (from both guesses, and they are still present but we don't know the positions)

Additionally, we have constraints on positions:
- A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 2 (from TAKEN). So A is not at pos 2 or 3.
- E cannot be at position 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 4 (from TAKEN). So E is not at pos 4 or 5.
- N cannot be at position 4 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 5 (from TAKEN). So N is not at pos 4 or 5.

Now, the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A, E, N, and two other letters that are not C, R, T, K.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K. So we can try to use new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: Since A cannot be at 2 or 3, and positions are 1 to 5, A can be at 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E cannot be at 4 or 5, so E can be at 1, 2, or 3.

N cannot be at 4 or 5, so N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to form a word that includes A, E, N and two new letters, with the position constraints.

Let's list possible positions:

- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- E: positions 1, 2, 3
- N: positions 1, 2, 3

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, T, K.

Let's think of words that have A, E, N and two new letters.

Common new letters to try: S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Also, note that A, E, N must be placed in their allowed positions.

For example, if we put A at position 1, then E and N must be in 2,3 or 1, but position 1 is taken by A, so E and N can be at 2 or 3.

Similarly, if A is at 4, then E and N must be at 1,2,3.

But E and N can only be at 1,2,3.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1.
Then the word starts with A.
E and N must be in positions 2,3 (since they can be at 1,2,3 but 1 is taken).
So the word could be A _ _ _ _
With E and N in the next two positions? But we have two more letters.

For example: ""AEGIS"" - but no N? We need N.

""ANISE"": A, N, I, S, E
- A at 1: allowed
- N at 2: allowed (since N can be at 2)
- E at 5: but E cannot be at 5! Because E is forbidden at 5. So not allowed.

""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: but E cannot be at 4? From TAKEN, E is not at 4. So E at 4 is forbidden. Also, N at 5 is forbidden? In ""ALIEN"", N is at 5, but we know N cannot be at 5. So not allowed.

""AMEND"": A, M, E, N, D
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 3: allowed (E can be at 3)
- N at 4: but N cannot be at 4! Forbidden. So not allowed.

""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

So it's hard to put A at 1 because the E and N end up in forbidden positions.

Option 2: A at position 4.
Then the word has A at position 4.
E and N must be at positions 1,2,3 (since they cannot be at 4 or 5, and A is at 4).

For example: _ _ _ A _
We need E and N in the first three positions.

Also, the last position is open, but E and N cannot be at 5, so the last position must be a new letter.

Example: ""SENNA"" - but we have N at 3 and 4? ""SENNA"" is S, E, N, N, A -> 
- S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, N at 4, A at 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A? But we are putting A at 4? In this case, if we want A at 4, but in ""SENNA"" A is at 5? Not at 4.

Let me define: we want A at position 4.

So the word: pos1: ?, pos2: ?, pos3: ?, pos4: A, pos5: ?

E and N must be in pos1,2,3.

For example: ""LEMON"" -> but no A? We need A at 4.

""DEMON"" -> no A.

""VENOM"" -> no A.

""MANOR"" -> but R is forbidden.

""PANEL"": P, A, N, E, L -> but A is at 2? We want A at 4.

How about ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> no A.

We need a word with A at 4.

For example: ""ULNAE"" - not common.

""PENNA"" - P, E, N, N, A -> 
- E at 2? Positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A -> but we want A at 4? Here A is at 5.

Not matching.

""LINAC"" -> but C is forbidden.

Another idea: ""DANCE"" -> but C is forbidden and A is at 2? Not at 4.

It's difficult. Let's try A at position 5.

Option 3: A at position 5.
Then the word ends with A.
E and N must be in positions 1,2,3.

For example: _ _ _ _ A

E and N in 1,2,3.

Example: ""PENDA"" -> P, E, N, D, A
- E at 1: allowed? E can be at 1.
- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)
- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)
- But we have to check the positions: 
  - E at 1: okay (not 4 or 5)
  - N at 3: okay (not 4 or 5)
  - A at 5: okay (not 2 or 3)

Also, we are introducing P, E, N, D, A. E and N are already known, so new letters P and D.

Is ""PENDA"" a word? Not common. ""Penda"" is a name, but let's find a common word.

""VENDA"" -> V, E, N, D, A -> same as above but V instead of P. ""Venda"" is a proper noun? Not ideal.

""MEDIA"" -> M, E, D, I, A -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 5: okay
- But no N? We must include N.

We need to include N.

""DENAY"" - not a word.

""LENSA"" - not common.

""MINAE"" -> M, I, N, A, E -> 
- N at 3: okay
- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.

We want A at 5.

""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> A at 2, not 5.

""ANSAE"" - not common.

Another common word: ""SENZA"" -> S, E, N, Z, A -> 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- A at 5: okay

And Z is a new letter. ""Senza"" is an English word? It means ""without"" in Italian, but sometimes used in English. But might be accepted.

But let's find a more common word.

""VENAL"": V, E, N, A, L -> 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.

Not at 5.

""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> A at 4, not 5.

""PENNA"" -> P, E, N, N, A -> A at 5, but N at 3 and 4. N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at position 4. So if we put N at 4, it would be invalid. In ""PENNA"", if we have N at 4, and the secret word has an N but not at 4, then the N at 4 might be marked as absent or wrong? But since there is another N at 3, it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's not use duplicates.

Another word: ""DONNA"" -> D, O, N, N, A -> duplicates and A at 5.

But N at 4 is forbidden.

So not good.

Perhaps we should consider that A might be at position 1, but earlier it was hard. Or maybe we missed a word.

Let's list all possible positions again:

A: 1,4,5
E: 1,2,3
N: 1,2,3

But if A is at 1, then E and N must be at 2 or 3, and the last two positions are new letters.

For example, ""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""ANKLE"": A, N, K, L, E -> but K is absent (from guess 2, K is x), so cannot use K.

K is not in the word.

""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 5: forbidden (E not at 5)

""ALPEN"" -> A, L, P, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- N at 5: forbidden

""AXMEN"" - not a word.

""ADMEN"" - A, D, M, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- N at 5: forbidden

So all have E or N at forbidden positions.

Perhaps A at 4.

Let's try to put A at 4.

Word: _ _ _ A _

E and N in positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""SENNA"" is not structured that way.

""PINNA"" -> P, I, N, N, A -> A at 5, not 4.

How about ""LINAC"" - not allowed.

""TONAL"" -> T is absent.

""VINAL"" -> V, I, N, A, L -> A at 4? Positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> yes, A at 4.
- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)
- E is not in the word? We must have E in the word. ""VINAL"" has no E.

So not.

""DENAY"" - not a word.

""PENNA"" doesn't work.

Another idea: ""OAKEN"" -> but O, A, K, E, N -> K is absent, and A is at 2 which is forbidden for A? A cannot be at 2, from TAKEN feedback.

In ""OAKEN"", A is at 2, which we know is wrong.

So not.

Perhaps we need to use a word where E or N is at position 1.

Let me try to put E at position 1.

Then the word starts with E.

A can be at 4 or 5, and N at 2 or 3.

For example: ""E _ _ _ _""

""ELAND"": E, L, A, N, D -> 
- E at 1: allowed
- A at 3: but A cannot be at 3! Forbidden.
- N at 4: forbidden

""EVADE"": E, V, A, D, E -> 
- A at 3: forbidden
- and duplicate E

""EXAMS"" -> no N.

""ENACT"": E, N, A, C, T -> C and T are absent.

""ENDOW"" -> no A.

""ENIAC"" - not common.

""ENOLA"": E, N, O, L, A -> 
- E at 1: allowed
- N at 2: allowed
- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)
- Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A

Check constraints:
- A at 5: allowed (not 2 or 3)
- E at 1: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- N at 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)

Also, new letters O and L.

Is ""ENOLA"" a word? ""Enola"" is a proper name (like Enola Gay), but might be accepted in word games. Let's find a common word.

""ANODE"" -> but A at 1, not E.

""ELAIN"" - not a word.

""OLENA"" - not common.

"" SENNA"" has no E at 1.

Another common word: ""MEDIA"" but no N.

""BEANO"" -> B, E, A, N, O -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- A at 3: forbidden

Not allowed.

""DEANO"" - not a word.

""LEMAN"" -> L, E, M, A, N -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- A at 4: allowed (A can be at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

So not.

""PELMA"" - not a word.

Perhaps ""AMINE"" but A at 1, M, I, N, E -> N at 4 forbidden, E at 5 forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let's list all possible words that contain A, E, N and satisfy the position constraints.

Since A can be at 1,4,5; E at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,3, and they must be in different positions.

Possible combinations:

- If A at 1, then E and N at 2 and 3 (in some order), and the last two positions new letters not C,R,T,K.

Words: like ""ANEWS"" not word, ""ANELE"" - A, N, E, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at 3 and 5? Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E -> E at 3 and 5. E at 5 is forbidden, and duplicate.

""ANENT"" - A, N, E, N, T -> duplicate N, and T absent.

""ANVIL"" no E.

""ANYDE"" not word.

""ALEWIFE"" too long.

Perhaps ""AESIR"" - A, E, S, I, R -> R absent, and no N.

Not.

Maybe we missed that the word might have more than one of the known letters? But we have only three known letters so far.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, but we don't know.

For example, it might have two E's or two N's.

In that case, our constraints might be for one occurrence.

For instance, for E, we know that position 5 and 4 are wrong for some E, but if there is another E, it could be at 5? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present, and for each instance.

In guess 1, E at 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 5.

In guess 2, E at 4 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 4.

But if there is another E, it could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates directly.

Similarly for N.

To simplify, let's assume no duplicates for now, but we might need to consider.

But in the feedback, for ""TAKEN"", we have A, E, N all marked as present but wrong position, and they are all distinct, so likely the word has at least these three, and possibly two more distinct letters.

But it could have duplicates.

To move forward, let's try a word that has A, E, N and two new letters, with A at 5, E at 1, N at 2, for example.

"" PENDA"" not common.

""WENDA"" not common.

""VILLA"" no E or N.

""Fella"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""SALON"" but no E.

Let's think of common words containing A, E, N.

For example, ""OCEAN"" -> O, C, E, A, N -> C is absent.

""URBAN"" no E.

""LEARN"" -> L, E, A, R, N -> R is absent.

""HEARD"" no N.

""BEARD"" no N.

""NEVER"" has E duplicate, and R absent.

""ENTER"" no A.

""EERIE"" no A or N.

""ANGRY"" no E.

""RINSE"" no A.

""RAINY"" no E.

""SAINT"" no E.

""PIANO"" no E.

""PLANE"" -> P, L, A, N, E -> A at 3 forbidden, and E at 5 forbidden.

But in ""PLANE"", A is at 3, which we know is wrong, and E at 5, which is wrong.

So not allowed.

""ALONE"" -> A, L, O, N, E -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- N at 4: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""PHONE"" no A.

I recall that ""DIANE"" might be a name, but let's try ""DIANE"": D, I, A, N, E -> 
- A at 3: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""FAINE"" -> F, A, I, N, E -> 
- A at 2: forbidden (A not at 2)
- N at 4: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

Perhaps ""MAIZE"" no N.

I'm stuck.

Another approach: since A can be at 1,4,5, and it's hard at 1 or 4, let's try A at 5 with E and N in 1,2,3.

Common word: ""HYENA"" -> H, Y, E, N, A -> 
- E at 3: allowed
- N at 4: forbidden! N at position 4 is not allowed.

In ""HYENA"", positions: 1:H, 2:Y, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A -> N at 4 is forbidden.

""ARENA"" -> A, R, E, N, A -> R absent, and A at 1 and 5, but A at 1 is allowed, but R absent.

"" More common: ""SIREN"" no A.

""QUEEN"" no A.

""GIVEN"" no A.

""OXBOW"" no.

Perhaps ""LAPSE"" no N.

Let's give up on that and consider that the word might have the letters in the allowed positions.

Another word: ""USNEA"" -> U, S, N, E, A -> 
- N at 3: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- A at 5: allowed

E at 4 is forbidden.

""ZONAE"" -> Z, O, N, A, E -> 
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed (A can be at 4)
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""XENIA"" -> X, E, N, I, A -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 5: allowed

Positions: 1:X, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A

Check:
- A at 5: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed

New letters X and I.

Is ""XENIA"" a word? It is a biological term, but might be accepted.

But let's see if there's a better word.

""GENOA"" -> G, E, N, O, A -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 5: allowed

""GENOA"" is a proper noun (a place), but commonly used in English.

In Wordle, proper nouns might not be allowed, but sometimes they are.

Another one: ""VENOM"" no A.

""MINCE"" C absent.

"" since we have to make a guess, let's go with ""GENOA"".

But ""GENOA"" has no duplicate letters, and satisfies the position constraints.

Letters: G, E, N, O, A.

G, O are new.

And it avoids C,R,T,K.

So feedback will tell us about G and O.

If not ""GENOA"", then ""XENIA"" or ""ENOLA"".

But ""ENOLA"" has E at 1, N at 2, O, L, A at 5.

""ENOLA"" is also possible.

But let's choose ""GENOA"" as it is more common.

Or ""SENZA"" if we allow it.

Another common word: ""CANOE"" -> C absent.

""BASIN"" no E.

""TALON"" T absent.

""PAEON"" -> P, A, E, O, N -> 
- A at 2: forbidden
- E at 3: allowed
- N at 5: forbidden

Not.

""AEONS"" -> A, E, O, N, S -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- O at 3: new
- N at 4: forbidden
- S at 5: new

N at 4 is forbidden.

""ANODE"" -> A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

I think ""GENOA"" is a reasonable choice.

Or ""XENIA"".

But let's go with ""GENOA"".

So guess: ""GENOA""

But in ""GENOA"", we have:
- G: new
- E: at position 2 (previously not tested at 2? In CRANE E was at 5, in TAKEN E was at 4, so position 2 is new for E)
- N: at position 3 (previously at 4 in CRANE and 5 in TAKEN, so position 3 is new)
- O: new
- A: at position 5 (previously at 3 in CRANE and 2 in TAKEN, so position 5 is new for A)

And all constraints satisfied.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(-)  
  - C and R are absent from the secret word.
  - A, N, and E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
    - A is not in position 3.
    - N is not in position 4.
    - E is not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: TAKEN** → Feedback: T(x), A(-), K(x), E(-), N(-)  
  - T and K are absent from the secret word.
  - A, E, and N are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
    - A is not in position 2.
    - E is not in position 4.
    - N is not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, K (cannot appear in the secret word).
- **Present letters**: A, E, N (must appear in the secret word, but positions are unknown).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.
  - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.
  - N: Positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word must contain A, E, N, and two additional letters not in {C, R, T, K}. Common unused letters include S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A, E, and N in positions that satisfy the constraints.
  - Tests new common letters to gather more information.
  - Avoids positions where A, E, or N are known to be invalid.
- After evaluating options, ""GENOA"" is a strong choice:
  - **G** and **O** are new letters (not previously tested).
  - Positions:
    - E is at position 2 (allowed, as E cannot be at 4 or 5).
    - N is at position 3 (allowed, as N cannot be at 4 or 5).
    - A is at position 5 (allowed, as A cannot be at 2 or 3).
  - ""GENOA"" is a valid 5-letter English word (referring to a type of salami or a geographical location, commonly accepted in word games).

This guess maximizes information gain by testing two new letters (G and O) while respecting all known constraints.

<guess>GENOA</guess>",GENOA,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 3)
- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5)

Guess 2: TAKEN
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 2) [because in TAKEN, A is at position 2]
- K: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4) [in TAKEN, E is at position 4]
- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5) [in TAKEN, N is at position 5]

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, T, K (so these are not in the word)

Present letters (but position unknown): A, E, N (from both guesses, and they are still present but we don't know the positions)

Additionally, we have constraints on positions:
- A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 2 (from TAKEN). So A is not at pos 2 or 3.
- E cannot be at position 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 4 (from TAKEN). So E is not at pos 4 or 5.
- N cannot be at position 4 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 5 (from TAKEN). So N is not at pos 4 or 5.

Now, the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A, E, N, and two other letters that are not C, R, T, K.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K. So we can try to use new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: Since A cannot be at 2 or 3, and positions are 1 to 5, A can be at 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E cannot be at 4 or 5, so E can be at 1, 2, or 3.

N cannot be at 4 or 5, so N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to form a word that includes A, E, N and two new letters, with the position constraints.

Let's list possible positions:

- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- E: positions 1, 2, 3
- N: positions 1, 2, 3

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, T, K.

Let's think of words that have A, E, N and two new letters.

Common new letters to try: S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Also, note that A, E, N must be placed in their allowed positions.

For example, if we put A at position 1, then E and N must be in 2,3 or 1, but position 1 is taken by A, so E and N can be at 2 or 3.

Similarly, if A is at 4, then E and N must be at 1,2,3.

But E and N can only be at 1,2,3.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1.
Then the word starts with A.
E and N must be in positions 2,3 (since they can be at 1,2,3 but 1 is taken).
So the word could be A _ _ _ _
With E and N in the next two positions? But we have two more letters.

For example: ""AEGIS"" - but no N? We need N.

""ANISE"": A, N, I, S, E
- A at 1: allowed
- N at 2: allowed (since N can be at 2)
- E at 5: but E cannot be at 5! Because E is forbidden at 5. So not allowed.

""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: but E cannot be at 4? From TAKEN, E is not at 4. So E at 4 is forbidden. Also, N at 5 is forbidden? In ""ALIEN"", N is at 5, but we know N cannot be at 5. So not allowed.

""AMEND"": A, M, E, N, D
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 3: allowed (E can be at 3)
- N at 4: but N cannot be at 4! Forbidden. So not allowed.

""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

So it's hard to put A at 1 because the E and N end up in forbidden positions.

Option 2: A at position 4.
Then the word has A at position 4.
E and N must be at positions 1,2,3 (since they cannot be at 4 or 5, and A is at 4).

For example: _ _ _ A _
We need E and N in the first three positions.

Also, the last position is open, but E and N cannot be at 5, so the last position must be a new letter.

Example: ""SENNA"" - but we have N at 3 and 4? ""SENNA"" is S, E, N, N, A -> 
- S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, N at 4, A at 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A? But we are putting A at 4? In this case, if we want A at 4, but in ""SENNA"" A is at 5? Not at 4.

Let me define: we want A at position 4.

So the word: pos1: ?, pos2: ?, pos3: ?, pos4: A, pos5: ?

E and N must be in pos1,2,3.

For example: ""LEMON"" -> but no A? We need A at 4.

""DEMON"" -> no A.

""VENOM"" -> no A.

""MANOR"" -> but R is forbidden.

""PANEL"": P, A, N, E, L -> but A is at 2? We want A at 4.

How about ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> no A.

We need a word with A at 4.

For example: ""ULNAE"" - not common.

""PENNA"" - P, E, N, N, A -> 
- E at 2? Positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A -> but we want A at 4? Here A is at 5.

Not matching.

""LINAC"" -> but C is forbidden.

Another idea: ""DANCE"" -> but C is forbidden and A is at 2? Not at 4.

It's difficult. Let's try A at position 5.

Option 3: A at position 5.
Then the word ends with A.
E and N must be in positions 1,2,3.

For example: _ _ _ _ A

E and N in 1,2,3.

Example: ""PENDA"" -> P, E, N, D, A
- E at 1: allowed? E can be at 1.
- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)
- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)
- But we have to check the positions: 
  - E at 1: okay (not 4 or 5)
  - N at 3: okay (not 4 or 5)
  - A at 5: okay (not 2 or 3)

Also, we are introducing P, E, N, D, A. E and N are already known, so new letters P and D.

Is ""PENDA"" a word? Not common. ""Penda"" is a name, but let's find a common word.

""VENDA"" -> V, E, N, D, A -> same as above but V instead of P. ""Venda"" is a proper noun? Not ideal.

""MEDIA"" -> M, E, D, I, A -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 5: okay
- But no N? We must include N.

We need to include N.

""DENAY"" - not a word.

""LENSA"" - not common.

""MINAE"" -> M, I, N, A, E -> 
- N at 3: okay
- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.

We want A at 5.

""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> A at 2, not 5.

""ANSAE"" - not common.

Another common word: ""SENZA"" -> S, E, N, Z, A -> 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- A at 5: okay

And Z is a new letter. ""Senza"" is an English word? It means ""without"" in Italian, but sometimes used in English. But might be accepted.

But let's find a more common word.

""VENAL"": V, E, N, A, L -> 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.

Not at 5.

""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> A at 4, not 5.

""PENNA"" -> P, E, N, N, A -> A at 5, but N at 3 and 4. N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at position 4. So if we put N at 4, it would be invalid. In ""PENNA"", if we have N at 4, and the secret word has an N but not at 4, then the N at 4 might be marked as absent or wrong? But since there is another N at 3, it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's not use duplicates.

Another word: ""DONNA"" -> D, O, N, N, A -> duplicates and A at 5.

But N at 4 is forbidden.

So not good.

Perhaps we should consider that A might be at position 1, but earlier it was hard. Or maybe we missed a word.

Let's list all possible positions again:

A: 1,4,5
E: 1,2,3
N: 1,2,3

But if A is at 1, then E and N must be at 2 or 3, and the last two positions are new letters.

For example, ""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""ANKLE"": A, N, K, L, E -> but K is absent (from guess 2, K is x), so cannot use K.

K is not in the word.

""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 5: forbidden (E not at 5)

""ALPEN"" -> A, L, P, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- N at 5: forbidden

""AXMEN"" - not a word.

""ADMEN"" - A, D, M, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- N at 5: forbidden

So all have E or N at forbidden positions.

Perhaps A at 4.

Let's try to put A at 4.

Word: _ _ _ A _

E and N in positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""SENNA"" is not structured that way.

""PINNA"" -> P, I, N, N, A -> A at 5, not 4.

How about ""LINAC"" - not allowed.

""TONAL"" -> T is absent.

""VINAL"" -> V, I, N, A, L -> A at 4? Positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> yes, A at 4.
- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)
- E is not in the word? We must have E in the word. ""VINAL"" has no E.

So not.

""DENAY"" - not a word.

""PENNA"" doesn't work.

Another idea: ""OAKEN"" -> but O, A, K, E, N -> K is absent, and A is at 2 which is forbidden for A? A cannot be at 2, from TAKEN feedback.

In ""OAKEN"", A is at 2, which we know is wrong.

So not.

Perhaps we need to use a word where E or N is at position 1.

Let me try to put E at position 1.

Then the word starts with E.

A can be at 4 or 5, and N at 2 or 3.

For example: ""E _ _ _ _""

""ELAND"": E, L, A, N, D -> 
- E at 1: allowed
- A at 3: but A cannot be at 3! Forbidden.
- N at 4: forbidden

""EVADE"": E, V, A, D, E -> 
- A at 3: forbidden
- and duplicate E

""EXAMS"" -> no N.

""ENACT"": E, N, A, C, T -> C and T are absent.

""ENDOW"" -> no A.

""ENIAC"" - not common.

""ENOLA"": E, N, O, L, A -> 
- E at 1: allowed
- N at 2: allowed
- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)
- Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A

Check constraints:
- A at 5: allowed (not 2 or 3)
- E at 1: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- N at 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)

Also, new letters O and L.

Is ""ENOLA"" a word? ""Enola"" is a proper name (like Enola Gay), but might be accepted in word games. Let's find a common word.

""ANODE"" -> but A at 1, not E.

""ELAIN"" - not a word.

""OLENA"" - not common.

"" SENNA"" has no E at 1.

Another common word: ""MEDIA"" but no N.

""BEANO"" -> B, E, A, N, O -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- A at 3: forbidden

Not allowed.

""DEANO"" - not a word.

""LEMAN"" -> L, E, M, A, N -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- A at 4: allowed (A can be at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

So not.

""PELMA"" - not a word.

Perhaps ""AMINE"" but A at 1, M, I, N, E -> N at 4 forbidden, E at 5 forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let's list all possible words that contain A, E, N and satisfy the position constraints.

Since A can be at 1,4,5; E at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,3, and they must be in different positions.

Possible combinations:

- If A at 1, then E and N at 2 and 3 (in some order), and the last two positions new letters not C,R,T,K.

Words: like ""ANEWS"" not word, ""ANELE"" - A, N, E, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at 3 and 5? Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E -> E at 3 and 5. E at 5 is forbidden, and duplicate.

""ANENT"" - A, N, E, N, T -> duplicate N, and T absent.

""ANVIL"" no E.

""ANYDE"" not word.

""ALEWIFE"" too long.

Perhaps ""AESIR"" - A, E, S, I, R -> R absent, and no N.

Not.

Maybe we missed that the word might have more than one of the known letters? But we have only three known letters so far.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, but we don't know.

For example, it might have two E's or two N's.

In that case, our constraints might be for one occurrence.

For instance, for E, we know that position 5 and 4 are wrong for some E, but if there is another E, it could be at 5? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present, and for each instance.

In guess 1, E at 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 5.

In guess 2, E at 4 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 4.

But if there is another E, it could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates directly.

Similarly for N.

To simplify, let's assume no duplicates for now, but we might need to consider.

But in the feedback, for ""TAKEN"", we have A, E, N all marked as present but wrong position, and they are all distinct, so likely the word has at least these three, and possibly two more distinct letters.

But it could have duplicates.

To move forward, let's try a word that has A, E, N and two new letters, with A at 5, E at 1, N at 2, for example.

"" PENDA"" not common.

""WENDA"" not common.

""VILLA"" no E or N.

""Fella"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""SALON"" but no E.

Let's think of common words containing A, E, N.

For example, ""OCEAN"" -> O, C, E, A, N -> C is absent.

""URBAN"" no E.

""LEARN"" -> L, E, A, R, N -> R is absent.

""HEARD"" no N.

""BEARD"" no N.

""NEVER"" has E duplicate, and R absent.

""ENTER"" no A.

""EERIE"" no A or N.

""ANGRY"" no E.

""RINSE"" no A.

""RAINY"" no E.

""SAINT"" no E.

""PIANO"" no E.

""PLANE"" -> P, L, A, N, E -> A at 3 forbidden, and E at 5 forbidden.

But in ""PLANE"", A is at 3, which we know is wrong, and E at 5, which is wrong.

So not allowed.

""ALONE"" -> A, L, O, N, E -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- N at 4: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""PHONE"" no A.

I recall that ""DIANE"" might be a name, but let's try ""DIANE"": D, I, A, N, E -> 
- A at 3: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""FAINE"" -> F, A, I, N, E -> 
- A at 2: forbidden (A not at 2)
- N at 4: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

Perhaps ""MAIZE"" no N.

I'm stuck.

Another approach: since A can be at 1,4,5, and it's hard at 1 or 4, let's try A at 5 with E and N in 1,2,3.

Common word: ""HYENA"" -> H, Y, E, N, A -> 
- E at 3: allowed
- N at 4: forbidden! N at position 4 is not allowed.

In ""HYENA"", positions: 1:H, 2:Y, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A -> N at 4 is forbidden.

""ARENA"" -> A, R, E, N, A -> R absent, and A at 1 and 5, but A at 1 is allowed, but R absent.

"" More common: ""SIREN"" no A.

""QUEEN"" no A.

""GIVEN"" no A.

""OXBOW"" no.

Perhaps ""LAPSE"" no N.

Let's give up on that and consider that the word might have the letters in the allowed positions.

Another word: ""USNEA"" -> U, S, N, E, A -> 
- N at 3: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- A at 5: allowed

E at 4 is forbidden.

""ZONAE"" -> Z, O, N, A, E -> 
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed (A can be at 4)
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""XENIA"" -> X, E, N, I, A -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 5: allowed

Positions: 1:X, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A

Check:
- A at 5: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed

New letters X and I.

Is ""XENIA"" a word? It is a biological term, but might be accepted.

But let's see if there's a better word.

""GENOA"" -> G, E, N, O, A -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 5: allowed

""GENOA"" is a proper noun (a place), but commonly used in English.

In Wordle, proper nouns might not be allowed, but sometimes they are.

Another one: ""VENOM"" no A.

""MINCE"" C absent.

"" since we have to make a guess, let's go with ""GENOA"".

But ""GENOA"" has no duplicate letters, and satisfies the position constraints.

Letters: G, E, N, O, A.

G, O are new.

And it avoids C,R,T,K.

So feedback will tell us about G and O.

If not ""GENOA"", then ""XENIA"" or ""ENOLA"".

But ""ENOLA"" has E at 1, N at 2, O, L, A at 5.

""ENOLA"" is also possible.

But let's choose ""GENOA"" as it is more common.

Or ""SENZA"" if we allow it.

Another common word: ""CANOE"" -> C absent.

""BASIN"" no E.

""TALON"" T absent.

""PAEON"" -> P, A, E, O, N -> 
- A at 2: forbidden
- E at 3: allowed
- N at 5: forbidden

Not.

""AEONS"" -> A, E, O, N, S -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- O at 3: new
- N at 4: forbidden
- S at 5: new

N at 4 is forbidden.

""ANODE"" -> A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

I think ""GENOA"" is a reasonable choice.

Or ""XENIA"".

But let's go with ""GENOA"".

So guess: ""GENOA""

But in ""GENOA"", we have:
- G: new
- E: at position 2 (previously not tested at 2? In CRANE E was at 5, in TAKEN E was at 4, so position 2 is new for E)
- N: at position 3 (previously at 4 in CRANE and 5 in TAKEN, so position 3 is new)
- O: new
- A: at position 5 (previously at 3 in CRANE and 2 in TAKEN, so position 5 is new for A)

And all constraints satisfied.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(-)  
  - C and R are absent from the secret word.
  - A, N, and E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
    - A is not in position 3.
    - N is not in position 4.
    - E is not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: TAKEN** → Feedback: T(x), A(-), K(x), E(-), N(-)  
  - T and K are absent from the secret word.
  - A, E, and N are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
    - A is not in position 2.
    - E is not in position 4.
    - N is not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, K (cannot appear in the secret word).
- **Present letters**: A, E, N (must appear in the secret word, but positions are unknown).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.
  - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.
  - N: Positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word must contain A, E, N, and two additional letters not in {C, R, T, K}. Common unused letters include S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A, E, and N in positions that satisfy the constraints.
  - Tests new common letters to gather more information.
  - Avoids positions where A, E, or N are known to be invalid.
- After evaluating options, ""GENOA"" is a strong choice:
  - **G** and **O** are new letters (not previously tested).
  - Positions:
    - E is at position 2 (allowed, as E cannot be at 4 or 5).
    - N is at position 3 (allowed, as N cannot be at 4 or 5).
    - A is at position 5 (allowed, as A cannot be at 2 or 3).
  - ""GENOA"" is a valid 5-letter English word (referring to a type of salami or a geographical location, commonly accepted in word games).

This guess maximizes information gain by testing two new letters (G and O) while respecting all known constraints.",Guess 3: GENOA -> FEEDBACK: G(x) E(✓) N(✓) O(x) A(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PENAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 To maximize information gain, a common strategy is to start with a word that has a good balance of common letters and minimal repeating letters.
 Let's choose a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular opener because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.
 However, note the example uses ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". Another good starter is ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) but might be less common.
 Alternatively, ""SALET"" is another good choice in Wordle. But since we are playing in a normal setting, let's use ""CRANE"".
 But note: we are allowed only real 5-letter words.

 After checking common starter words, ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and covers 5 distinct letters including 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the feedback will be given in the format: letter(symbol). We will interpret that in the next steps.

 Since it's the first guess, we have to pick one. Let's choose ""CRANE"".<thinking>
The game begins with no information about the secret word. For an effective first guess, we should aim to cover multiple common letters and vowels to maximize potential feedback. 

Common strategies involve choosing words with:
- High-frequency vowels (A, E, O) and consonants (R, S, T, N)
- No repeating letters to test more characters at once

A strong opener like ""ROATE"" (an anagram of ""ORATE"") is often used, but it's moderately obscure. Instead, ""CRANE"" is an ideal balance:
- Includes common vowels (A, E)
- Common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses 5 distinct letters
- Is a familiar word

This choice will provide clear feedback on vowel positions, critical consonants, and potential for process-of-elimination in subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically:
  - A is not in position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5, with position 1 being the first letter).
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

We also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.

Since A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed, we need to think of a new word that:
- Includes A, N, and E (since they are present) but in different positions.
- Excludes C and R (since they are absent).
- Also, we should try to include other common letters to test more letters.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We must form a 5-letter English word that has A, N, E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the positions in the feedback are relative to the guess.

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> not in word
- Position 3: A -> in word, but not at position 3
- Position 4: N -> in word, but not at position 4
- Position 5: E -> in word, but not at position 5

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3, N at position 4, and E at position 5.

Moreover, we know the word has A, N, E, and two other letters (which are not C or R). We don't know the other two letters yet.

We should try to use a word that places A, N, and E in new positions and introduces two new letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that contain A, N, E, and two other consonants or vowels, avoiding C and R.

Possible words:

- We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Similarly, N can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).
- E can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

But note: we don't know the positions, so we have to try.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters.

For example:
- ""SANE?"" But that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""PLANE"" -> but P, L, A, N, E. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, which we must avoid because in the feedback A was at position 3 and was wrong. But wait: the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the new word, we can put A at a different position? Actually, we can, but we must not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that because it would put A in the same position that we know is wrong.

So we must avoid words that have A at position 3, N at position 4, or E at position 5.

Let me try to think of words with A, N, E.

- ""ANVIL"" -> but no E? Doesn't have E.
- ""EATEN"" -> has E, A, T, E, N. But it has two E's? Let's check: E at pos1, A at pos2, T at pos3, E at pos4, N at pos5. But we have E at pos1 and pos4, and we know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" only showed one E as present (at pos5, which was wrong). But it didn't say anything about duplicates. So the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So we must consider that possibility.

But in ""CRANE"", we had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more.

Similarly for A and N.

But in ""EATEN"", we have E at position 1 and 4, and A at position 2, N at position 5.

Now, in our feedback, we know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first guess). But in ""EATEN"", E is at position 1 and 4, which are allowed. Also, A is at position 2 (not 3, so allowed) and N is at position 5 (but in the first guess, N was at position 4 and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent N from being at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 5.

Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it can be at other positions.

So ""EATEN"" might be a candidate. But let's check the letters: it uses E, A, T, E, N. We are introducing T, which is a new letter. Also, we are avoiding C and R.

But note: we have two E's. Is that okay? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we have to consider that possibility.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to get clearer information.

Another word: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S. 
- Positions: E at 2, A at 3, N at 4, S at 5. 
But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was wrong. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. In ""LEANS"", A is at position 3, so that's not allowed.

Similarly, ""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, which is forbidden.

""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, same problem.

""WEANS"": same.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but with A not at 3, N not at 4, and E not at 5.

Let me try to put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that doesn't have N or E? Wait, it has A, D, I, E, U -> no N.

We need a word that has A, N, and E.

Try A at position 1: 
- ""ANODE"": A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was wrong. So we cannot put E at position 5 in this guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (or maybe even absent if there is only one E and it's not at 5). But to avoid redundant testing, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So in ""ANODE"": 
- A at 1: okay (since previously A was at 3, now at 1 is new)
- N at 2: okay (previously at 4, now at 2 is new)
- E at 5: not okay, because we know E is not at position 5.

So we cannot use ""ANODE"" because of E at 5.

Another word: ""ALINE"" -> A at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5. 
But N at position 4 is forbidden (we know N is not at position 4) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not good.

""AMINE"": A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5 -> same problem: N at 4 and E at 5.

""AZINE"" - not common.

Try putting A at position 2: 
- ""SAINT"" -> S, A, I, N, T -> but no E? We need E in the word because we know it's present. So must include E.

""SAINE"" - not a word.

""PAINT"" - no E.

""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> 
- A at position 2: okay (not 3)
- E at position 4: okay (not 5)
- N at position 5: okay (not 4) because previously N was at 4, but now at 5 is different.

So ""TAKEN"" has:
- T: new letter
- A: at position 2 (allowed)
- K: new letter
- E: at position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- N: at position 5 (allowed, since not 4)

Also, it avoids C and R.

So ""TAKEN"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

We can also consider ""BAKEN"" - not a word.

""MAKEN"" - not common.

""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N -> same as TAKEN but with W. Also valid.

But ""TAKEN"" is more common.

Another option: ""EAGLE"" -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another word: ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T. 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 3: not allowed! Because we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

Similarly, ""NEAPS"": N, E, A, P, S -> 
- N at 1: okay
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> A at 3: not allowed.

""YEANS"": same.

So ""TAKEN"" seems good.

But let me check: in ""TAKEN"", we have A at 2, E at 4, N at 5. That's acceptable.

We are introducing T and K, which are new.

Alternatively, ""NAIVE"": N, A, I, V, E -> 
- N at 1: okay (previously at 4, now at 1)
- A at 2: okay
- E at 5: not allowed (we know E is not at position 5)

So not good.

""DAVEN"": D, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

But is ""DAVEN"" a word? It might be obscure. ""Daven"" is a verb meaning to pray, but it's not very common. ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- N at 5: okay

""HAVEN"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""RAVEN"" -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R and C.

So ""HAVEN"" is acceptable: H, A, V, E, N.

Similarly, ""WAVEN"" - not a word.

""HAVEN"" and ""TAKEN"" are both good.

But ""TAKEN"" uses T and K, while ""HAVEN"" uses H and V. Both are common consonants.

We might also consider ""LANES"" but that has A at 3, which is not allowed.

Another word: ""SALNE"" - not a word.

""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""EASEL"" - no N.

So between ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"", which one? Both are valid.

We can also do ""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> 
- A at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay (previously at 4, now at 3 is new)
- E at 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""MEANT"": M, E, A, N, T -> 
- E at 2: okay
- A at 3: not allowed.

""NEATO"" - not a word.

So I think ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"" are good choices.

But note: we are trying to test new letters. In ""TAKEN"", we test T and K. In ""HAVEN"", we test H and V. Both are fine.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"" all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""BEANS"" -> but A at 3 not allowed.

""DEALT"" -> no N.

""HELPN"" - not a word.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. For example, S or T.

""TAKEN"" has T and K. K is less common than S or L.

What about ""SALET""? But A at 2? ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> 
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay
- But no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, and E.

Another idea: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> has two N's. 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4? From the first guess, we know N is not at position 4. But in ""SENNA"", we have N at position 3 and 4. The N at position 4 might be invalid? The feedback only said that the N at position 4 in ""CRANE"" was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the N at position 4 in ""SENNA"" might be correct? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So if the secret word has two N's, then in ""SENNA"", the N at position 3 might be correct or wrong, and the N at position 4 might be correct or wrong. But we know that in the secret word, there is at least one N, and it is not at position 4 (from the first guess). So if we put N at position 4 in a new guess, it might be marked as:
  - If the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4, then the N at position 4 would be marked as absent (x) or if it's at a different position, then the duplicate might be marked as absent? The rules are: each letter is marked independently.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word without duplicates for now.

So ""SENNA"" might be messy.

Similarly, ""ANENT"" - not common.

So back to ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"".

Another word: ""LATEN"" - not common.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 2: okay
- E at 4: okay (but we are putting E at 1 and 4, and we know E is in the word but not at 5, so positions 1 and 4 are allowed)
- N at 5: okay (not 4)

But we have two E's. The secret word might have only one E, so the second E might be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, using a duplicate might give us information about frequency.

But for clarity, I prefer to use a word with distinct letters.

So ""TAKEN"" is better.

""HAVEN"" is also distinct.

But ""TAKEN"" has the advantage of using T, which is a very common letter.

So I'll go with ""TAKEN"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""TAKEN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C and R are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A, N, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").
- Specifically, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A, N, and E (since they are confirmed present), but in new positions (avoiding position 3 for A, position 4 for N, and position 5 for E).
- It must exclude C and R (confirmed absent).
- To maximize information, introduce new common letters (e.g., T, K) and avoid duplicate letters for clarity.
- ""TAKEN"" fits these criteria:
  - A is in position 2 (not 3).
  - N is in position 5 (not 4).
  - E is in position 4 (not 5).
  - New letters T and K are tested.
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>TAKEN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 3)
- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5)

Guess 2: TAKEN
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 2) [because in TAKEN, A is at position 2]
- K: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4) [in TAKEN, E is at position 4]
- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5) [in TAKEN, N is at position 5]

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, T, K (so these are not in the word)

Present letters (but position unknown): A, E, N (from both guesses, and they are still present but we don't know the positions)

Additionally, we have constraints on positions:
- A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 2 (from TAKEN). So A is not at pos 2 or 3.
- E cannot be at position 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 4 (from TAKEN). So E is not at pos 4 or 5.
- N cannot be at position 4 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 5 (from TAKEN). So N is not at pos 4 or 5.

Now, the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A, E, N, and two other letters that are not C, R, T, K.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K. So we can try to use new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: Since A cannot be at 2 or 3, and positions are 1 to 5, A can be at 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E cannot be at 4 or 5, so E can be at 1, 2, or 3.

N cannot be at 4 or 5, so N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to form a word that includes A, E, N and two new letters, with the position constraints.

Let's list possible positions:

- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- E: positions 1, 2, 3
- N: positions 1, 2, 3

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, T, K.

Let's think of words that have A, E, N and two new letters.

Common new letters to try: S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Also, note that A, E, N must be placed in their allowed positions.

For example, if we put A at position 1, then E and N must be in 2,3 or 1, but position 1 is taken by A, so E and N can be at 2 or 3.

Similarly, if A is at 4, then E and N must be at 1,2,3.

But E and N can only be at 1,2,3.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1.
Then the word starts with A.
E and N must be in positions 2,3 (since they can be at 1,2,3 but 1 is taken).
So the word could be A _ _ _ _
With E and N in the next two positions? But we have two more letters.

For example: ""AEGIS"" - but no N? We need N.

""ANISE"": A, N, I, S, E
- A at 1: allowed
- N at 2: allowed (since N can be at 2)
- E at 5: but E cannot be at 5! Because E is forbidden at 5. So not allowed.

""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: but E cannot be at 4? From TAKEN, E is not at 4. So E at 4 is forbidden. Also, N at 5 is forbidden? In ""ALIEN"", N is at 5, but we know N cannot be at 5. So not allowed.

""AMEND"": A, M, E, N, D
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 3: allowed (E can be at 3)
- N at 4: but N cannot be at 4! Forbidden. So not allowed.

""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

So it's hard to put A at 1 because the E and N end up in forbidden positions.

Option 2: A at position 4.
Then the word has A at position 4.
E and N must be at positions 1,2,3 (since they cannot be at 4 or 5, and A is at 4).

For example: _ _ _ A _
We need E and N in the first three positions.

Also, the last position is open, but E and N cannot be at 5, so the last position must be a new letter.

Example: ""SENNA"" - but we have N at 3 and 4? ""SENNA"" is S, E, N, N, A -> 
- S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, N at 4, A at 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A? But we are putting A at 4? In this case, if we want A at 4, but in ""SENNA"" A is at 5? Not at 4.

Let me define: we want A at position 4.

So the word: pos1: ?, pos2: ?, pos3: ?, pos4: A, pos5: ?

E and N must be in pos1,2,3.

For example: ""LEMON"" -> but no A? We need A at 4.

""DEMON"" -> no A.

""VENOM"" -> no A.

""MANOR"" -> but R is forbidden.

""PANEL"": P, A, N, E, L -> but A is at 2? We want A at 4.

How about ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> no A.

We need a word with A at 4.

For example: ""ULNAE"" - not common.

""PENNA"" - P, E, N, N, A -> 
- E at 2? Positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A -> but we want A at 4? Here A is at 5.

Not matching.

""LINAC"" -> but C is forbidden.

Another idea: ""DANCE"" -> but C is forbidden and A is at 2? Not at 4.

It's difficult. Let's try A at position 5.

Option 3: A at position 5.
Then the word ends with A.
E and N must be in positions 1,2,3.

For example: _ _ _ _ A

E and N in 1,2,3.

Example: ""PENDA"" -> P, E, N, D, A
- E at 1: allowed? E can be at 1.
- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)
- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)
- But we have to check the positions: 
  - E at 1: okay (not 4 or 5)
  - N at 3: okay (not 4 or 5)
  - A at 5: okay (not 2 or 3)

Also, we are introducing P, E, N, D, A. E and N are already known, so new letters P and D.

Is ""PENDA"" a word? Not common. ""Penda"" is a name, but let's find a common word.

""VENDA"" -> V, E, N, D, A -> same as above but V instead of P. ""Venda"" is a proper noun? Not ideal.

""MEDIA"" -> M, E, D, I, A -> 
- E at 1: okay
- A at 5: okay
- But no N? We must include N.

We need to include N.

""DENAY"" - not a word.

""LENSA"" - not common.

""MINAE"" -> M, I, N, A, E -> 
- N at 3: okay
- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.

We want A at 5.

""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> A at 2, not 5.

""ANSAE"" - not common.

Another common word: ""SENZA"" -> S, E, N, Z, A -> 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- A at 5: okay

And Z is a new letter. ""Senza"" is an English word? It means ""without"" in Italian, but sometimes used in English. But might be accepted.

But let's find a more common word.

""VENAL"": V, E, N, A, L -> 
- E at 2: okay
- N at 3: okay
- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.

Not at 5.

""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> A at 4, not 5.

""PENNA"" -> P, E, N, N, A -> A at 5, but N at 3 and 4. N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at position 4. So if we put N at 4, it would be invalid. In ""PENNA"", if we have N at 4, and the secret word has an N but not at 4, then the N at 4 might be marked as absent or wrong? But since there is another N at 3, it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's not use duplicates.

Another word: ""DONNA"" -> D, O, N, N, A -> duplicates and A at 5.

But N at 4 is forbidden.

So not good.

Perhaps we should consider that A might be at position 1, but earlier it was hard. Or maybe we missed a word.

Let's list all possible positions again:

A: 1,4,5
E: 1,2,3
N: 1,2,3

But if A is at 1, then E and N must be at 2 or 3, and the last two positions are new letters.

For example, ""ANEWS"" - not a word.

""ANKLE"": A, N, K, L, E -> but K is absent (from guess 2, K is x), so cannot use K.

K is not in the word.

""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 5: forbidden (E not at 5)

""ALPEN"" -> A, L, P, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- N at 5: forbidden

""AXMEN"" - not a word.

""ADMEN"" - A, D, M, E, N -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- N at 5: forbidden

So all have E or N at forbidden positions.

Perhaps A at 4.

Let's try to put A at 4.

Word: _ _ _ A _

E and N in positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""SENNA"" is not structured that way.

""PINNA"" -> P, I, N, N, A -> A at 5, not 4.

How about ""LINAC"" - not allowed.

""TONAL"" -> T is absent.

""VINAL"" -> V, I, N, A, L -> A at 4? Positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> yes, A at 4.
- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)
- E is not in the word? We must have E in the word. ""VINAL"" has no E.

So not.

""DENAY"" - not a word.

""PENNA"" doesn't work.

Another idea: ""OAKEN"" -> but O, A, K, E, N -> K is absent, and A is at 2 which is forbidden for A? A cannot be at 2, from TAKEN feedback.

In ""OAKEN"", A is at 2, which we know is wrong.

So not.

Perhaps we need to use a word where E or N is at position 1.

Let me try to put E at position 1.

Then the word starts with E.

A can be at 4 or 5, and N at 2 or 3.

For example: ""E _ _ _ _""

""ELAND"": E, L, A, N, D -> 
- E at 1: allowed
- A at 3: but A cannot be at 3! Forbidden.
- N at 4: forbidden

""EVADE"": E, V, A, D, E -> 
- A at 3: forbidden
- and duplicate E

""EXAMS"" -> no N.

""ENACT"": E, N, A, C, T -> C and T are absent.

""ENDOW"" -> no A.

""ENIAC"" - not common.

""ENOLA"": E, N, O, L, A -> 
- E at 1: allowed
- N at 2: allowed
- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)
- Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A

Check constraints:
- A at 5: allowed (not 2 or 3)
- E at 1: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- N at 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)

Also, new letters O and L.

Is ""ENOLA"" a word? ""Enola"" is a proper name (like Enola Gay), but might be accepted in word games. Let's find a common word.

""ANODE"" -> but A at 1, not E.

""ELAIN"" - not a word.

""OLENA"" - not common.

"" SENNA"" has no E at 1.

Another common word: ""MEDIA"" but no N.

""BEANO"" -> B, E, A, N, O -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- A at 3: forbidden

Not allowed.

""DEANO"" - not a word.

""LEMAN"" -> L, E, M, A, N -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- A at 4: allowed (A can be at 4)
- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)

So not.

""PELMA"" - not a word.

Perhaps ""AMINE"" but A at 1, M, I, N, E -> N at 4 forbidden, E at 5 forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let's list all possible words that contain A, E, N and satisfy the position constraints.

Since A can be at 1,4,5; E at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,3, and they must be in different positions.

Possible combinations:

- If A at 1, then E and N at 2 and 3 (in some order), and the last two positions new letters not C,R,T,K.

Words: like ""ANEWS"" not word, ""ANELE"" - A, N, E, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at 3 and 5? Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E -> E at 3 and 5. E at 5 is forbidden, and duplicate.

""ANENT"" - A, N, E, N, T -> duplicate N, and T absent.

""ANVIL"" no E.

""ANYDE"" not word.

""ALEWIFE"" too long.

Perhaps ""AESIR"" - A, E, S, I, R -> R absent, and no N.

Not.

Maybe we missed that the word might have more than one of the known letters? But we have only three known letters so far.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, but we don't know.

For example, it might have two E's or two N's.

In that case, our constraints might be for one occurrence.

For instance, for E, we know that position 5 and 4 are wrong for some E, but if there is another E, it could be at 5? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present, and for each instance.

In guess 1, E at 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 5.

In guess 2, E at 4 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 4.

But if there is another E, it could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates directly.

Similarly for N.

To simplify, let's assume no duplicates for now, but we might need to consider.

But in the feedback, for ""TAKEN"", we have A, E, N all marked as present but wrong position, and they are all distinct, so likely the word has at least these three, and possibly two more distinct letters.

But it could have duplicates.

To move forward, let's try a word that has A, E, N and two new letters, with A at 5, E at 1, N at 2, for example.

"" PENDA"" not common.

""WENDA"" not common.

""VILLA"" no E or N.

""Fella"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""SALON"" but no E.

Let's think of common words containing A, E, N.

For example, ""OCEAN"" -> O, C, E, A, N -> C is absent.

""URBAN"" no E.

""LEARN"" -> L, E, A, R, N -> R is absent.

""HEARD"" no N.

""BEARD"" no N.

""NEVER"" has E duplicate, and R absent.

""ENTER"" no A.

""EERIE"" no A or N.

""ANGRY"" no E.

""RINSE"" no A.

""RAINY"" no E.

""SAINT"" no E.

""PIANO"" no E.

""PLANE"" -> P, L, A, N, E -> A at 3 forbidden, and E at 5 forbidden.

But in ""PLANE"", A is at 3, which we know is wrong, and E at 5, which is wrong.

So not allowed.

""ALONE"" -> A, L, O, N, E -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- N at 4: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""PHONE"" no A.

I recall that ""DIANE"" might be a name, but let's try ""DIANE"": D, I, A, N, E -> 
- A at 3: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""FAINE"" -> F, A, I, N, E -> 
- A at 2: forbidden (A not at 2)
- N at 4: forbidden
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

Perhaps ""MAIZE"" no N.

I'm stuck.

Another approach: since A can be at 1,4,5, and it's hard at 1 or 4, let's try A at 5 with E and N in 1,2,3.

Common word: ""HYENA"" -> H, Y, E, N, A -> 
- E at 3: allowed
- N at 4: forbidden! N at position 4 is not allowed.

In ""HYENA"", positions: 1:H, 2:Y, 3:E, 4:N, 5:A -> N at 4 is forbidden.

""ARENA"" -> A, R, E, N, A -> R absent, and A at 1 and 5, but A at 1 is allowed, but R absent.

"" More common: ""SIREN"" no A.

""QUEEN"" no A.

""GIVEN"" no A.

""OXBOW"" no.

Perhaps ""LAPSE"" no N.

Let's give up on that and consider that the word might have the letters in the allowed positions.

Another word: ""USNEA"" -> U, S, N, E, A -> 
- N at 3: allowed
- E at 4: forbidden
- A at 5: allowed

E at 4 is forbidden.

""ZONAE"" -> Z, O, N, A, E -> 
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed (A can be at 4)
- E at 5: forbidden

Not.

""XENIA"" -> X, E, N, I, A -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 5: allowed

Positions: 1:X, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A

Check:
- A at 5: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed

New letters X and I.

Is ""XENIA"" a word? It is a biological term, but might be accepted.

But let's see if there's a better word.

""GENOA"" -> G, E, N, O, A -> 
- E at 2: allowed
- N at 3: allowed
- A at 5: allowed

""GENOA"" is a proper noun (a place), but commonly used in English.

In Wordle, proper nouns might not be allowed, but sometimes they are.

Another one: ""VENOM"" no A.

""MINCE"" C absent.

"" since we have to make a guess, let's go with ""GENOA"".

But ""GENOA"" has no duplicate letters, and satisfies the position constraints.

Letters: G, E, N, O, A.

G, O are new.

And it avoids C,R,T,K.

So feedback will tell us about G and O.

If not ""GENOA"", then ""XENIA"" or ""ENOLA"".

But ""ENOLA"" has E at 1, N at 2, O, L, A at 5.

""ENOLA"" is also possible.

But let's choose ""GENOA"" as it is more common.

Or ""SENZA"" if we allow it.

Another common word: ""CANOE"" -> C absent.

""BASIN"" no E.

""TALON"" T absent.

""PAEON"" -> P, A, E, O, N -> 
- A at 2: forbidden
- E at 3: allowed
- N at 5: forbidden

Not.

""AEONS"" -> A, E, O, N, S -> 
- A at 1: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- O at 3: new
- N at 4: forbidden
- S at 5: new

N at 4 is forbidden.

""ANODE"" -> A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

I think ""GENOA"" is a reasonable choice.

Or ""XENIA"".

But let's go with ""GENOA"".

So guess: ""GENOA""

But in ""GENOA"", we have:
- G: new
- E: at position 2 (previously not tested at 2? In CRANE E was at 5, in TAKEN E was at 4, so position 2 is new for E)
- N: at position 3 (previously at 4 in CRANE and 5 in TAKEN, so position 3 is new)
- O: new
- A: at position 5 (previously at 3 in CRANE and 2 in TAKEN, so position 5 is new for A)

And all constraints satisfied.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(-)  
  - C and R are absent from the secret word.
  - A, N, and E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
    - A is not in position 3.
    - N is not in position 4.
    - E is not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: TAKEN** → Feedback: T(x), A(-), K(x), E(-), N(-)  
  - T and K are absent from the secret word.
  - A, E, and N are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
    - A is not in position 2.
    - E is not in position 4.
    - N is not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, K (cannot appear in the secret word).
- **Present letters**: A, E, N (must appear in the secret word, but positions are unknown).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.
  - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.
  - N: Positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word must contain A, E, N, and two additional letters not in {C, R, T, K}. Common unused letters include S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A, E, and N in positions that satisfy the constraints.
  - Tests new common letters to gather more information.
  - Avoids positions where A, E, or N are known to be invalid.
- After evaluating options, ""GENOA"" is a strong choice:
  - **G** and **O** are new letters (not previously tested).
  - Positions:
    - E is at position 2 (allowed, as E cannot be at 4 or 5).
    - N is at position 3 (allowed, as N cannot be at 4 or 5).
    - A is at position 5 (allowed, as A cannot be at 2 or 3).
  - ""GENOA"" is a valid 5-letter English word (referring to a type of salami or a geographical location, commonly accepted in word games).

This guess maximizes information gain by testing two new letters (G and O) while respecting all known constraints.

We have no prior information about the secret word.\n To maximize information gain, a common strategy is to start with a word that has a good balance of common letters and minimal repeating letters.\n Let\'s choose a word that includes several common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular opener because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n However, note the example uses ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". Another good starter is ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) but might be less common.\n Alternatively, ""SALET"" is another good choice in Wordle. But since we are playing in a normal setting, let\'s use ""CRANE"".\n But note: we are allowed only real 5-letter words.\n\n After checking common starter words, ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and covers 5 distinct letters including 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N).\n\n Let\'s go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.\n\n However, note that the feedback will be given in the format: letter(symbol). We will interpret that in the next steps.\n\n Since it\'s the first guess, we have to pick one. Let\'s choose ""CRANE"".<thinking>\nThe game begins with no information about the secret word. For an effective first guess, we should aim to cover multiple common letters and vowels to maximize potential feedback. \n\nCommon strategies involve choosing words with:\n- High-frequency vowels (A, E, O) and consonants (R, S, T, N)\n- No repeating letters to test more characters at once\n\nA strong opener like ""ROATE"" (an anagram of ""ORATE"") is often used, but it\'s moderately obscure. Instead, ""CRANE"" is an ideal balance:\n- Includes common vowels (A, E)\n- Common consonants (C, R, N)\n- Uses 5 distinct letters\n- Is a familiar word\n\nThis choice will provide clear feedback on vowel positions, critical consonants, and potential for process-of-elimination in subsequent guesses.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letters A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically:\n  - A is not in position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5, with position 1 being the first letter).\n  - N is not in position 4.\n  - E is not in position 5.\n\nWe also know that the secret word contains A, N, and E, and does not contain C or R.\n\nSince A, N, and E are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed, we need to think of a new word that:\n- Includes A, N, and E (since they are present) but in different positions.\n- Excludes C and R (since they are absent).\n- Also, we should try to include other common letters to test more letters.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter English word that has A, N, E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the positions in the feedback are relative to the guess.\n\nIn ""CRANE"":\n- Position 1: C -> not in word\n- Position 2: R -> not in word\n- Position 3: A -> in word, but not at position 3\n- Position 4: N -> in word, but not at position 4\n- Position 5: E -> in word, but not at position 5\n\nSo for the next guess, we should avoid putting A at position 3, N at position 4, and E at position 5.\n\nMoreover, we know the word has A, N, E, and two other letters (which are not C or R). We don\'t know the other two letters yet.\n\nWe should try to use a word that places A, N, and E in new positions and introduces two new letters to test.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that contain A, N, E, and two other consonants or vowels, avoiding C and R.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).\n- Similarly, N can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n- E can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the positions, so we have to try.\n\nAlso, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.\n\nLet me list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""SANE?"" But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n- ""PLANE"" -> but P, L, A, N, E. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, which we must avoid because in the feedback A was at position 3 and was wrong. But wait: the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the new word, we can put A at a different position? Actually, we can, but we must not put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. However, in ""PLANE"", A is at position 3, so we cannot use that because it would put A in the same position that we know is wrong.\n\nSo we must avoid words that have A at position 3, N at position 4, or E at position 5.\n\nLet me try to think of words with A, N, E.\n\n- ""ANVIL"" -> but no E? Doesn\'t have E.\n- ""EATEN"" -> has E, A, T, E, N. But it has two E\'s? Let\'s check: E at pos1, A at pos2, T at pos3, E at pos4, N at pos5. But we have E at pos1 and pos4, and we know that E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. However, the feedback for ""CRANE"" only showed one E as present (at pos5, which was wrong). But it didn\'t say anything about duplicates. So the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say the word has unique letters. So we must consider that possibility.\n\nBut in ""CRANE"", we had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E, but it might have more.\n\nSimilarly for A and N.\n\nBut in ""EATEN"", we have E at position 1 and 4, and A at position 2, N at position 5.\n\nNow, in our feedback, we know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first guess). But in ""EATEN"", E is at position 1 and 4, which are allowed. Also, A is at position 2 (not 3, so allowed) and N is at position 5 (but in the first guess, N was at position 4 and was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent N from being at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said that N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, E is not at position 5, but it can be at other positions.\n\nSo ""EATEN"" might be a candidate. But let\'s check the letters: it uses E, A, T, E, N. We are introducing T, which is a new letter. Also, we are avoiding C and R.\n\nBut note: we have two E\'s. Is that okay? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know. But we have to consider that possibility.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicates to get clearer information.\n\nAnother word: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S. \n- Positions: E at 2, A at 3, N at 4, S at 5. \nBut we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was wrong. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. In ""LEANS"", A is at position 3, so that\'s not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEANS"": M, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, which is forbidden.\n\n""DEANS"": D, E, A, N, S -> A at 3, same problem.\n\n""WEANS"": same.\n\nSo we need a word that has A, N, E but with A not at 3, N not at 4, and E not at 5.\n\nLet me try to put A at position 1: e.g., ""ADIEU"" -> but that doesn\'t have N or E? Wait, it has A, D, I, E, U -> no N.\n\nWe need a word that has A, N, and E.\n\nTry A at position 1: \n- ""ANODE"": A at 1, N at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was wrong. So we cannot put E at position 5 in this guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (or maybe even absent if there is only one E and it\'s not at 5). But to avoid redundant testing, we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nSo in ""ANODE"": \n- A at 1: okay (since previously A was at 3, now at 1 is new)\n- N at 2: okay (previously at 4, now at 2 is new)\n- E at 5: not okay, because we know E is not at position 5.\n\nSo we cannot use ""ANODE"" because of E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""ALINE"" -> A at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5. \nBut N at position 4 is forbidden (we know N is not at position 4) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not good.\n\n""AMINE"": A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, N at 4, E at 5 -> same problem: N at 4 and E at 5.\n\n""AZINE"" - not common.\n\nTry putting A at position 2: \n- ""SAINT"" -> S, A, I, N, T -> but no E? We need E in the word because we know it\'s present. So must include E.\n\n""SAINE"" - not a word.\n\n""PAINT"" - no E.\n\n""TAKEN"": T, A, K, E, N -> \n- A at position 2: okay (not 3)\n- E at position 4: okay (not 5)\n- N at position 5: okay (not 4) because previously N was at 4, but now at 5 is different.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" has:\n- T: new letter\n- A: at position 2 (allowed)\n- K: new letter\n- E: at position 4 (allowed, since not 5)\n- N: at position 5 (allowed, since not 4)\n\nAlso, it avoids C and R.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.\n\nWe can also consider ""BAKEN"" - not a word.\n\n""MAKEN"" - not common.\n\n""WAKEN"": W, A, K, E, N -> same as TAKEN but with W. Also valid.\n\nBut ""TAKEN"" is more common.\n\nAnother option: ""EAGLE"" -> but no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include A, N, and E.\n\nAnother word: ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T. \n- E at 1: okay\n- A at 3: not allowed! Because we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""NEAPS"": N, E, A, P, S -> \n- N at 1: okay\n- E at 2: okay\n- A at 3: not allowed.\n\n""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> A at 3: not allowed.\n\n""YEANS"": same.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check: in ""TAKEN"", we have A at 2, E at 4, N at 5. That\'s acceptable.\n\nWe are introducing T and K, which are new.\n\nAlternatively, ""NAIVE"": N, A, I, V, E -> \n- N at 1: okay (previously at 4, now at 1)\n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 5: not allowed (we know E is not at position 5)\n\nSo not good.\n\n""DAVEN"": D, A, V, E, N -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 4: okay\n- N at 5: okay\n\nBut is ""DAVEN"" a word? It might be obscure. ""Daven"" is a verb meaning to pray, but it\'s not very common. ""TAKEN"" is better.\n\n""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 4: okay\n- N at 5: okay\n\n""HAVEN"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""RAVEN"" -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.\n\nWe must avoid R and C.\n\nSo ""HAVEN"" is acceptable: H, A, V, E, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""WAVEN"" - not a word.\n\n""HAVEN"" and ""TAKEN"" are both good.\n\nBut ""TAKEN"" uses T and K, while ""HAVEN"" uses H and V. Both are common consonants.\n\nWe might also consider ""LANES"" but that has A at 3, which is not allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""SALNE"" - not a word.\n\n""ANEWS"" - not a word.\n\n""EASEL"" - no N.\n\nSo between ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"", which one? Both are valid.\n\nWe can also do ""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- N at 3: okay (previously at 4, now at 3 is new)\n- E at 5: not allowed.\n\nSo not good.\n\n""MEANT"": M, E, A, N, T -> \n- E at 2: okay\n- A at 3: not allowed.\n\n""NEATO"" - not a word.\n\nSo I think ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"" are good choices.\n\nBut note: we are trying to test new letters. In ""TAKEN"", we test T and K. In ""HAVEN"", we test H and V. Both are fine.\n\nBut we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but in ""TAKEN"" and ""HAVEN"" all letters are distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""BEANS"" -> but A at 3 not allowed.\n\n""DEALT"" -> no N.\n\n""HELPN"" - not a word.\n\nI think ""TAKEN"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. For example, S or T.\n\n""TAKEN"" has T and K. K is less common than S or L.\n\nWhat about ""SALET""? But A at 2? ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> \n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 4: okay\n- But no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit N.\n\nWe must include A, N, and E.\n\nAnother idea: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> has two N\'s. \n- E at 2: okay\n- N at 3: okay\n- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4? From the first guess, we know N is not at position 4. But in ""SENNA"", we have N at position 3 and 4. The N at position 4 might be invalid? The feedback only said that the N at position 4 in ""CRANE"" was wrong, but if the word has two N\'s, then the N at position 4 in ""SENNA"" might be correct? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. So if the secret word has two N\'s, then in ""SENNA"", the N at position 3 might be correct or wrong, and the N at position 4 might be correct or wrong. But we know that in the secret word, there is at least one N, and it is not at position 4 (from the first guess). So if we put N at position 4 in a new guess, it might be marked as:\n  - If the secret word has only one N and it\'s not at position 4, then the N at position 4 would be marked as absent (x) or if it\'s at a different position, then the duplicate might be marked as absent? The rules are: each letter is marked independently.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, it\'s better to use a word without duplicates for now.\n\nSo ""SENNA"" might be messy.\n\nSimilarly, ""ANENT"" - not common.\n\nSo back to ""TAKEN"" or ""HAVEN"".\n\nAnother word: ""LATEN"" - not common.\n\n""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> \n- E at 1: okay\n- A at 2: okay\n- E at 4: okay (but we are putting E at 1 and 4, and we know E is in the word but not at 5, so positions 1 and 4 are allowed)\n- N at 5: okay (not 4)\n\nBut we have two E\'s. The secret word might have only one E, so the second E might be marked as absent? But we don\'t know. However, using a duplicate might give us information about frequency.\n\nBut for clarity, I prefer to use a word with distinct letters.\n\nSo ""TAKEN"" is better.\n\n""HAVEN"" is also distinct.\n\nBut ""TAKEN"" has the advantage of using T, which is a very common letter.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TAKEN"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""TAKEN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C and R are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A, N, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").\n- Specifically, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A, N, and E (since they are confirmed present), but in new positions (avoiding position 3 for A, position 4 for N, and position 5 for E).\n- It must exclude C and R (confirmed absent).\n- To maximize information, introduce new common letters (e.g., T, K) and avoid duplicate letters for clarity.\n- ""TAKEN"" fits these criteria:\n  - A is in position 2 (not 3).\n  - N is in position 5 (not 4).\n  - E is in position 4 (not 5).\n  - New letters T and K are tested.\n  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>TAKEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 3)\n- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4)\n- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: TAKEN\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 2) [because in TAKEN, A is at position 2]\n- K: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 4) [in TAKEN, E is at position 4]\n- N: - (in the word, but wrong position; not at position 5) [in TAKEN, N is at position 5]\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, T, K (so these are not in the word)\n\nPresent letters (but position unknown): A, E, N (from both guesses, and they are still present but we don\'t know the positions)\n\nAdditionally, we have constraints on positions:\n- A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 2 (from TAKEN). So A is not at pos 2 or 3.\n- E cannot be at position 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 4 (from TAKEN). So E is not at pos 4 or 5.\n- N cannot be at position 4 (from CRANE) and cannot be at position 5 (from TAKEN). So N is not at pos 4 or 5.\n\nNow, the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A, E, N, and two other letters that are not C, R, T, K.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K. So we can try to use new common letters to test.\n\nPossible positions for A: Since A cannot be at 2 or 3, and positions are 1 to 5, A can be at 1, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at 4 or 5, so E can be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\nN cannot be at 4 or 5, so N can be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe need to form a word that includes A, E, N and two new letters, with the position constraints.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions:\n\n- A: positions 1, 4, 5\n- E: positions 1, 2, 3\n- N: positions 1, 2, 3\n\nBut note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.\n\nWe also need to avoid the absent letters: C, R, T, K.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A, E, N and two new letters.\n\nCommon new letters to try: S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nAlso, note that A, E, N must be placed in their allowed positions.\n\nFor example, if we put A at position 1, then E and N must be in 2,3 or 1, but position 1 is taken by A, so E and N can be at 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, if A is at 4, then E and N must be at 1,2,3.\n\nBut E and N can only be at 1,2,3.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1.\nThen the word starts with A.\nE and N must be in positions 2,3 (since they can be at 1,2,3 but 1 is taken).\nSo the word could be A _ _ _ _\nWith E and N in the next two positions? But we have two more letters.\n\nFor example: ""AEGIS"" - but no N? We need N.\n\n""ANISE"": A, N, I, S, E\n- A at 1: allowed\n- N at 2: allowed (since N can be at 2)\n- E at 5: but E cannot be at 5! Because E is forbidden at 5. So not allowed.\n\n""ALIEN"": A, L, I, E, N\n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 4: but E cannot be at 4? From TAKEN, E is not at 4. So E at 4 is forbidden. Also, N at 5 is forbidden? In ""ALIEN"", N is at 5, but we know N cannot be at 5. So not allowed.\n\n""AMEND"": A, M, E, N, D\n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 3: allowed (E can be at 3)\n- N at 4: but N cannot be at 4! Forbidden. So not allowed.\n\n""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N\n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)\n- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)\n\nSo it\'s hard to put A at 1 because the E and N end up in forbidden positions.\n\nOption 2: A at position 4.\nThen the word has A at position 4.\nE and N must be at positions 1,2,3 (since they cannot be at 4 or 5, and A is at 4).\n\nFor example: _ _ _ A _\nWe need E and N in the first three positions.\n\nAlso, the last position is open, but E and N cannot be at 5, so the last position must be a new letter.\n\nExample: ""SENNA"" - but we have N at 3 and 4? ""SENNA"" is S, E, N, N, A -> \n- S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, N at 4, A at 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A? But we are putting A at 4? In this case, if we want A at 4, but in ""SENNA"" A is at 5? Not at 4.\n\nLet me define: we want A at position 4.\n\nSo the word: pos1: ?, pos2: ?, pos3: ?, pos4: A, pos5: ?\n\nE and N must be in pos1,2,3.\n\nFor example: ""LEMON"" -> but no A? We need A at 4.\n\n""DEMON"" -> no A.\n\n""VENOM"" -> no A.\n\n""MANOR"" -> but R is forbidden.\n\n""PANEL"": P, A, N, E, L -> but A is at 2? We want A at 4.\n\nHow about ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> no A.\n\nWe need a word with A at 4.\n\nFor example: ""ULNAE"" - not common.\n\n""PENNA"" - P, E, N, N, A -> \n- E at 2?

Let\'s try A at position 5.\n\nOption 3: A at position 5.\nThen the word ends with A.\nE and N must be in positions 1,2,3.\n\nFor example: _ _ _ _ A\n\nE and N in 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""PENDA"" -> P, E, N, D, A\n- E at 1: allowed? E can be at 1.\n- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)\n- A at 5: allowed (A can be at 5)\n- But we have to check the positions: \n  - E at 1: okay (not 4 or 5)\n  - N at 3: okay (not 4 or 5)\n  - A at 5: okay (not 2 or 3)\n\nAlso, we are introducing P, E, N, D, A. E and N are already known, so new letters P and D.\n\nIs ""PENDA"" a word? Not common. ""Penda"" is a name, but let\'s find a common word.\n\n""VENDA"" -> V, E, N, D, A -> same as above but V instead of P. ""Venda"" is a proper noun? Not ideal.\n\n""MEDIA"" -> M, E, D, I, A -> \n- E at 1: okay\n- A at 5: okay\n- But no N? We must include N.\n\nWe need to include N.\n\n""DENAY"" - not a word.\n\n""LENSA"" - not common.\n\n""MINAE"" -> M, I, N, A, E -> \n- N at 3: okay\n- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.\n\nWe want A at 5.\n\n""MANSE"" -> M, A, N, S, E -> A at 2, not 5.\n\n""ANSAE"" - not common.\n\nAnother common word: ""SENZA"" -> S, E, N, Z, A -> \n- E at 2: okay\n- N at 3: okay\n- A at 5: okay\n\nAnd Z is a new letter. ""Senza"" is an English word? It means ""without"" in Italian, but sometimes used in English. But might be accepted.\n\nBut let\'s find a more common word.\n\n""VENAL"": V, E, N, A, L -> \n- E at 2: okay\n- N at 3: okay\n- A at 4: but we are trying A at 5? Here A is at 4.\n\nNot at 5.\n\n""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> A at 4, not 5.\n\n""PENNA"" -> P, E, N, N, A -> A at 5, but N at 3 and 4. N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at position 4. So if we put N at 4, it would be invalid. In ""PENNA"", if we have N at 4, and the secret word has an N but not at 4, then the N at 4 might be marked as absent or wrong? But since there is another N at 3, it might be messy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s not use duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""DONNA"" -> D, O, N, N, A -> duplicates and A at 5.\n\nBut N at 4 is forbidden.\n\nSo not good.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that A might be at position 1, but earlier it was hard. Or maybe we missed a word.\n\nLet\'s list all possible positions again:\n\nA: 1,4,5\nE: 1,2,3\nN: 1,2,3\n\nBut if A is at 1, then E and N must be at 2 or 3, and the last two positions are new letters.\n\nFor example, ""ANEWS"" - not a word.\n\n""ANKLE"": A, N, K, L, E -> but K is absent (from guess 2, K is x), so cannot use K.\n\nK is not in the word.\n\n""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> \n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 5: forbidden (E not at 5)\n\n""ALPEN"" -> A, L, P, E, N -> \n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 4: forbidden (E not at 4)\n- N at 5: forbidden (N not at 5)\n\n""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> \n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 4: forbidden\n- N at 5: forbidden\n\n""AXMEN"" - not a word.\n\n""ADMEN"" - A, D, M, E, N -> \n- A at 1: allowed\n- E at 4: forbidden\n- N at 5: forbidden\n\nSo all have E or N at forbidden positions.\n\nPerhaps A at 4.\n\nLet\'s try to put A at 4.\n\nWord: _ _ _ A _\n\nE and N in positions 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""SENNA"" is not structured that way.\n\n""PINNA"" -> P, I, N, N, A -> A at 5, not 4.\n\nHow about ""LINAC"" - not allowed.\n\n""TONAL"" -> T is absent.\n\n""VINAL"" -> V, I, N, A, L -> A at 4? Positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> yes, A at 4.\n- N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3)\n- E is not in the word? We must have E in the word. ""VINAL"" has no E.\n\nSo not.\n\n""DENAY"" - not a word.\n\n""PENNA"" doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother idea: ""OAKEN"" -> but O, A, K, E, N -> K is absent, and A is at 2 which is forbidden for A? A cannot be at 2, from TAKEN feedback.\n\nIn ""OAKEN"", A is at 2, which we know is wrong.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps we need to use a word where E or N is at position 1.\n\nLet me try to put E at position 1.\n\nThen the word starts with E.\n\nA can be at 4 or 5, and N at 2 or 3.\n\nFor example: ""E _ _ _ _""\n\n""ELAND"": E, L, A, N, D -> \n- E at 1: allowed\n- A at 3: but A cannot be at 3!

Let\'s list all possible words that contain A, E, N and satisfy the position constraints.\n\nSince A can be at 1,4,5; E at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,3, and they must be in different positions.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- If A at 1, then E and N at 2 and 3 (in some order), and the last two positions new letters not C,R,T,K.\n\nWords: like ""ANEWS"" not word, ""ANELE"" - A, N, E, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at 3 and 5? Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:E, 4:L, 5:E -> E at 3 and 5. E at 5 is forbidden, and duplicate.\n\n""ANENT"" - A, N, E, N, T -> duplicate N, and T absent.\n\n""ANVIL"" no E.\n\n""ANYDE"" not word.\n\n""ALEWIFE"" too long.\n\nPerhaps ""AESIR"" - A, E, S, I, R -> R absent, and no N.\n\nNot.\n\nMaybe we missed that the word might have more than one of the known letters? But we have only three known letters so far.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters, but we don\'t know.\n\nFor example, it might have two E\'s or two N\'s.\n\nIn that case, our constraints might be for one occurrence.\n\nFor instance, for E, we know that position 5 and 4 are wrong for some E, but if there is another E, it could be at 5? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present, and for each instance.\n\nIn guess 1, E at 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 5.\n\nIn guess 2, E at 4 was marked as present but wrong position, so there is at least one E not at 4.\n\nBut if there is another E, it could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates directly.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nTo simplify, let\'s assume no duplicates for now, but we might need to consider.\n\nBut in the feedback, for ""TAKEN"", we have A, E, N all marked as present but wrong position, and they are all distinct, so likely the word has at least these three, and possibly two more distinct letters.\n\nBut it could have duplicates.\n\nTo move forward, let\'s try a word that has A, E, N and two new letters, with A at 5, E at 1, N at 2, for example.\n\n"" PENDA"" not common.\n\n""WENDA"" not common.\n\n""VILLA"" no E or N.\n\n""Fella"" not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""SALON"" but no E.\n\nLet\'s think of common words containing A, E, N.\n\nFor example, ""OCEAN"" -> O, C, E, A, N -> C is absent.\n\n""URBAN"" no E.\n\n""LEARN"" -> L, E, A, R, N -> R is absent.\n\n""HEARD"" no N.\n\n""BEARD"" no N.\n\n""NEVER"" has E duplicate, and R absent.\n\n""ENTER"" no A.\n\n""EERIE"" no A or N.\n\n""ANGRY"" no E.\n\n""RINSE"" no A.\n\n""RAINY"" no E.\n\n""SAINT"" no E.\n\n""PIANO"" no E.\n\n""PLANE"" -> P, L, A, N, E -> A at 3 forbidden, and E at 5 forbidden.\n\nBut in ""PLANE"", A is at 3, which we know is wrong, and E at 5, which is wrong.\n\nSo not allowed.\n\n""ALONE"" -> A, L, O, N, E -> \n- A at 1: allowed\n- N at 4: forbidden\n- E at 5: forbidden\n\nNot.\n\n""PHONE"" no A.\n\nI recall that ""DIANE"" might be a name, but let\'s try ""DIANE"": D, I, A, N, E -> \n- A at 3: forbidden\n- E at 5: forbidden\n\nNot.\n\n""FAINE"" -> F, A, I, N, E -> \n- A at 2: forbidden (A not at 2)\n- N at 4: forbidden\n- E at 5: forbidden\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""MAIZE"" no N.\n\nI\'m stuck.\n\nAnother approach: since A can be at 1,4,5, and it\'s hard at 1 or 4, let\'s try A at 5 with E and N in 1,2,3.\n\nCommon word: ""HYENA"" -> H, Y, E, N, A -> \n- E at 3: allowed\n- N at 4: forbidden!

In CRANE E was at 5, in TAKEN E was at 4, so position 2 is new for E)\n- N: at position 3 (previously at 4 in CRANE and 5 in TAKEN, so position 3 is new)\n- O: new\n- A: at position 5 (previously at 3 in CRANE and 2 in TAKEN, so position 5 is new for A)\n\nAnd all constraints satisfied.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(-)  \n  - C and R are absent from the secret word.\n  - A, N, and E are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n    - A is not in position 3.\n    - N is not in position 4.\n    - E is not in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2: TAKEN** → Feedback: T(x), A(-), K(x), E(-), N(-)  \n  - T and K are absent from the secret word.\n  - A, E, and N are present but in the wrong positions. Specifically:\n    - A is not in position 2.\n    - E is not in position 4.\n    - N is not in position 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, K (cannot appear in the secret word).\n- **Present letters**: A, E, N (must appear in the secret word, but positions are unknown).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).\n  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).\n  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 2).\n- **Remaining possible positions**:\n  - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E: Positions 1, 2, or 3.\n  - N: Positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- The secret word must contain A, E, N, and two additional letters not in {C, R, T, K}. Common unused letters include S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize a word that:\n  - Includes A, E, and N in positions that satisfy the constraints.\n  - Tests new common letters to gather more information.\n  - Avoids positions where A, E, or N are known to be invalid.\n- After evaluating options, ""GENOA"" is a strong choice:\n  - **G** and **O** are new letters (not previously tested).\n  - Positions:\n    - E is at position 2 (allowed, as E cannot be at 4 or 5).\n    - N is at position 3 (allowed, as N cannot be at 4 or 5).\n    - A is at position 5 (allowed, as A cannot be at 2 or 3).\n  - ""GENOA"" is a valid 5-letter English word (referring to a type of salami or a geographical location, commonly accepted in word games).\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain by testing two new letters (G and O) while respecting all known constraints.\n\n<guess>GENOA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) K(x) E(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: GENOA -> FEEDBACK: G(x) E(✓) N(✓) O(x) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C and R are absent. A, N, E are present but not in the guessed positions.

Guess 2: TAKEN -> T(x) A(-) K(x) E(-) N(-)
Meaning: T and K are absent. A, E, N are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: GENOA -> G(x) E(✓) N(✓) O(x) A(-)
Meaning: G and O are absent. E is correct at position 3? Let's number the positions:
G E N O A
1 2 3 4 5

So feedback:
- G: absent (x)
- E: correct at position 2 (because it's the second letter and marked ✓)
- N: correct at position 3 (third letter, ✓)
- O: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-), and since it was guessed at position 5, A cannot be at position 5.

From Guess 3:
- E is in the secret word and is at position 2 (because ✓ in position 2).
- N is in the secret word and is at position 3 (✓ in position 3).
- A is present but not at position 5 (so A is in the word but not at pos 5).
- G and O are absent.

Now, we know:
- Confirmed positions: Position 2 is E, Position 3 is N. So the secret word has the form _ E N _ _
- A is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are taken by E and N, and we know A cannot be at pos 2 (from previous) or pos 3 (since it's taken by N, and also from Guess 1 A wasn't at 3). The only possible positions for A are 1 or 4. But we just guessed position 5 for A and it was wrong, so A must be at position 1 or 4.
- We have one more letter to place (since the word has 5 letters, and we know E and N at 2 and 3, A must be in one of the remaining spots, and another letter).

But we also know from previous that A could not be at pos 2 or 3 (from Guesses 1 and 2). Now, from Guess 3, A cannot be at pos 5.

So A must be at position 1 or 4.

Moreover, we know the secret word contains A and has letters at pos 1 and 4 to be filled, and pos 5.

Now, the letters we know:
- Present letters: We have A, E, N. But E and N are fixed at positions 2 and 3. A is still to be placed at 1 or 4.

Additionally, there must be one more letter at position 4 or 1 (depending on A) and position 5.

Also, we know absent letters: C, R, T, K, G, O.

So absent letters: C, R, T, K, G, O.

Now, common letters left: S, L, I, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Since the word has the form _ E N _ _, and A is at either position 1 or 4.

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then word: A E N _ _
With the last two positions to be filled by letters not in the absent list.

Case 2: A at position 4.
Then word: _ E N A _
With position 1 and 5 to be filled.

Also, from earlier feedback, we have no information about duplicates, so all letters are distinct so far.

Now, let's see possible words.

First, consider case 1: ""A E N _ _""

The last two letters must be filled, and they cannot be absent letters or A,E,N (unless duplicate, but we have no evidence).

But A is at position 1, so the last two should be new letters.

Possible words: 
- ""AENGL"" but G absent.
- ""AENDR""? Not word.

Common words: ""PENAL"" but P is allowed? ""PENAL"" is P,E,N,A,L -> but if we put A at position 1, but in ""PENAL"" A is at position 4? Not matching.

For ""A E N _ _"", possible words:
- ""BENCH"" C absent.
- ""LENDS"" L,E,N,D,S -> but this has E at 2, N at 3, but A is not in the word? But we need A. So words must contain A.

Therefore, in case 1, since A is only at position 1, the word is ""A"" then E,N,Something,Something.

But the last two positions must include the letter A only once, so they are different.

Words starting with ""AEN"": 
- ""AENEO"" - not a word.
- ""AENEAS"" too long.
- ""AENGUS"" too long.

"" ""There are very few English words starting with ""AEN"". For example, ""aeneous"" is not 5 letters.

Common words: none?

Perhaps ""SAUNA"" but not starting with AEN.

So case 1 might be impossible. Therefore, A must be at position 4.

Case 2: A at position 4.
Secret word: _ E N A _
Position 1 and 5 are unknown letters.

And we need to include A at position 4.

Letters at position 1 and 5 must be present and not absent.

Also, since the word has five letters, and we know A,E,N are present, and position 2 and 3 are E and N, position 4 is A.

So position 1 and 5 are the remaining letters, and must not be absent.

Possible words: ? E N A ?

Must end with something.

Common words: 
- ""SENNA"" -> but S,E,N,N,A -> but position 4 is A? In SENNA, if positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. But we need position 4 to be A, but in SENNA it's N (then A at 5). Not matching.

- ""VENAL"" V,E,N,A,L -> positions: 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> yes! This matches the form.

Other options:
- ""PENAL"" P,E,N,A,L -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L
- ""MENAD"" M,E,N,A,D -> similar
- ""DENAR"" D,E,N,A,R -> but R is absent (from Guess 1)
- ""VENAR"" not a word.

So possible words: 
- VENAL: V,E,N,A,L
- PENAL: P,E,N,A,L
- MENAD (if accepted: a type of spirit, but might not be common)
- BENAM (B,E,N,A,M) - to name, but uncommon
- WENAS (not common)
- SENAM is not common.
- Also, ""DENAY"" not a word.

But ""PENAL"" and ""VENAL"" are common.

Now, absent letters: C,R,T,K,G,O.

Neither V nor P nor L is in the absent list.

So both ""VENAL"" and ""PENAL"" are candidates.

But we also have position 1 and 5 to determine.

But we don't know which letter is which.

Another candidate: ""FINAL"" has I and L, but N is at position 3? FINAL: F,I,N,A,L -> positions 1:F, 2:I, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need position 2 to be E, not I. So no.

""ZEBRA"" doesn't have E and N in the middle.

So for the form ? E N A ?, only letters that can be at the ends.

Now, L is common.

Another possibility: ""SENAS"" not word.

But ""VELAR"" V,E,L,A,R -> but that has L at position 3, but we need N at position 3? Not the same.

So back to PENAL and VENAL.

Also, the feedback from Guess 3: we learned that A is present but not at position 5, so in the secret word, A is not at 5. In both PENAL and VENAL, A is at position 4, so that's fine.

Also, we haven't tested V, P, L.

So we can choose either.

But let's see which one gives more information.

Since we have limited tries, we can guess one.

But note: in VENAL and PENAL, the last letter L is common.

So we can guess a word that tests L and another letter.

But we don't have more information.

Also, from previous, we know that A is not at 5, so if we guess VENAL, for example, we can confirm the entire word.

Similarly for PENAL.

But we don't know yet.

Another word: ""RENAL"" but R is absent, so no.

So between VENAL and PENAL.

VENAL: V is less common, PENAL might be more common.

We can also consider that position 1 could be other letters: for example, ""DENAR"" but R absent.

Or ""KENAF"" K absent.

""XENIA"" was guessed? No, GENOA but different.

But ""SENZA"" not fitting.

So I think VENAL or PENAL.

We also note that the secret word must contain five letters, and we have three confirmed: E at 2, N at 3, A at 4. And A is confirmed present.

Now, for the guess, we can guess one of them.

Let's look for more words.

WORD: ""FENAL""? Not common.

""HEMAL"" not EN.

So limited options.

Perhaps ""WENCH"" but C absent.

So let's go with PENAL.

But earlier in Guess 2, we used TAKEN, which had N at the end, but now N is fixed at 3.

Another idea: the missed letter at position 1 and 5.

For example, in PENAL, P at 1, L at 5.

Similarly V at 1, L at 5.

L is common.

But in the feedback from previous, we have no information about L.

So by guessing PENAL or VENAL, we can win or get close.

Since we know E and N are correct at positions 2 and 3, if we guess PENAL and position 4 is A but we don't know if that's correct? In the form ?ENA? we have A at 4, which we were going to assume.

In Guess 3, GENOA had A at 5 which was wrong, but that doesn't say about position 4.

But in the secret word, A could be at 1 or 4, but as we saw, there are no common words with A at 1 given the constraints, so likely A is at 4.

Therefore, the word is ? E N A ?

We need to guess position 1 and 5.

Common possibilities: 
- L is a common ending, like in PENAL, VENAL.

Also, other letters: M? BENAM not common. D? DENAR not really. S? SENA not common.

Therefore, I conclude that PENAL or VENAL is the most likely.

To choose, PENAL is more common.

Perhaps ""YEAN?"" but YE or something.

Another option: ""MEANS"" no, because S at 5, but position 2 must be E, not A.

I think PENAL is best.

But PENAL ends with L, which is not tested.

Similarly.

But let's make a guess of PENAL.

Then if it's correct, we win.

If not, we refine.

Guessing VENAL.

But PENAL might be better.

Since we have E in position 2 correct and N at 3 correct, the key is to find position 1 and 5.

But in PENAL and VENAL, both have L at 5.

So if we guess a word that explores possible letters for position 1 and L.

For example, guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we have only one more guess? We have up to 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.

We can guess PENAL directly.

But to test more letters, we could use a different word.

But since we know E and N are fixed, the only unknown are position 1 and 5, and we know they are not absent.

But we have many letters not tested: eg S,I,L,D,U,M,P,B,W,V, etc.

But if we guess PENAL:
- If the answer is PENAL, we win.
- If not, feedback might show which letter is wrong.

Similarly for VENAL.

But to save guesses, we can guess one of them.

Alternatively, guess a word that has different letters at 1 and 5, to test them.

But it's hard without wasting a guess.

For example, guess ""SALEP"" but not fitting.

But I think for this response, we'll go with PENAL.

But on second thought, let's confirm the words.

Secret word must have E at 2, N at 3, A at 4? Or A could be at 1, but we saw no words, so likely at 4.

So guess: ""PENAL""

### Thought Process After Guess 3 Feedback:
- **Feedback from Guess 3 (GENOA)**:
  - G(x): Absent.
  - E(✓): Correct at position 2.
  - N(✓): Correct at position 3.
  - O(x): Absent.
  - A(-): Present but not at position 5.
- **Confirmed Information**:
  - Position 2 is `E`, and position 3 is `N` (from E(✓) and N(✓)). Thus, the secret word has the pattern `_ E N _ _`.
  - `A` is in the word but not at position 5 (from A(-) in GENOA).
  - Absent letters: C, R, T, K, G, O (from cumulative feedback).
- **Analysis of `A` Position**:
  - `A` cannot be at position 2 (from TAKEN feedback) or position 3 (occupied by `N`). It also cannot be at position 5 (from GENOA feedback). Therefore, `A` must be at position 1 or 4.
  - After testing common words:
    - If `A` is at position 1 (`A E N _ _`), no valid English words fit (e.g., ""AEN__"" words like ""AENEO"" or ""AENDR"" are invalid).
    - Thus, `A` must be at position 4, making the pattern `_ E N A _`.
- **Secret Word Structure**:
  - The word is `[letter1] E N A [letter5]`.
  - `letter1` and `letter5` must not be in the absent list (C, R, T, K, G, O).
  - Common unused letters include S, L, I, D, U, M, P, B, V, W.
- **Valid Word Options**:
  - ""PENAL"" (P,E,N,A,L): Fits the pattern, uses common letters P and L.
  - ""VENAL"" (V,E,N,A,L): Fits the pattern, uses letters V and L.
- **Decision**:
  - ""PENAL"" is prioritized as it uses P (a more common letter than V) and tests L (untested so far).
  - Guessing ""PENAL"" resolves:
    - If correct, the word is solved.
    - If incorrect, feedback on P and L will refine further guesses.

<guess>PENAL</guess>",PENAL,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C and R are absent. A, N, E are present but not in the guessed positions.

Guess 2: TAKEN -> T(x) A(-) K(x) E(-) N(-)
Meaning: T and K are absent. A, E, N are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: GENOA -> G(x) E(✓) N(✓) O(x) A(-)
Meaning: G and O are absent. E is correct at position 3? Let's number the positions:
G E N O A
1 2 3 4 5

So feedback:
- G: absent (x)
- E: correct at position 2 (because it's the second letter and marked ✓)
- N: correct at position 3 (third letter, ✓)
- O: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-), and since it was guessed at position 5, A cannot be at position 5.

From Guess 3:
- E is in the secret word and is at position 2 (because ✓ in position 2).
- N is in the secret word and is at position 3 (✓ in position 3).
- A is present but not at position 5 (so A is in the word but not at pos 5).
- G and O are absent.

Now, we know:
- Confirmed positions: Position 2 is E, Position 3 is N. So the secret word has the form _ E N _ _
- A is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are taken by E and N, and we know A cannot be at pos 2 (from previous) or pos 3 (since it's taken by N, and also from Guess 1 A wasn't at 3). The only possible positions for A are 1 or 4. But we just guessed position 5 for A and it was wrong, so A must be at position 1 or 4.
- We have one more letter to place (since the word has 5 letters, and we know E and N at 2 and 3, A must be in one of the remaining spots, and another letter).

But we also know from previous that A could not be at pos 2 or 3 (from Guesses 1 and 2). Now, from Guess 3, A cannot be at pos 5.

So A must be at position 1 or 4.

Moreover, we know the secret word contains A and has letters at pos 1 and 4 to be filled, and pos 5.

Now, the letters we know:
- Present letters: We have A, E, N. But E and N are fixed at positions 2 and 3. A is still to be placed at 1 or 4.

Additionally, there must be one more letter at position 4 or 1 (depending on A) and position 5.

Also, we know absent letters: C, R, T, K, G, O.

So absent letters: C, R, T, K, G, O.

Now, common letters left: S, L, I, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Since the word has the form _ E N _ _, and A is at either position 1 or 4.

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then word: A E N _ _
With the last two positions to be filled by letters not in the absent list.

Case 2: A at position 4.
Then word: _ E N A _
With position 1 and 5 to be filled.

Also, from earlier feedback, we have no information about duplicates, so all letters are distinct so far.

Now, let's see possible words.

First, consider case 1: ""A E N _ _""

The last two letters must be filled, and they cannot be absent letters or A,E,N (unless duplicate, but we have no evidence).

But A is at position 1, so the last two should be new letters.

Possible words: 
- ""AENGL"" but G absent.
- ""AENDR""? Not word.

Common words: ""PENAL"" but P is allowed? ""PENAL"" is P,E,N,A,L -> but if we put A at position 1, but in ""PENAL"" A is at position 4? Not matching.

For ""A E N _ _"", possible words:
- ""BENCH"" C absent.
- ""LENDS"" L,E,N,D,S -> but this has E at 2, N at 3, but A is not in the word? But we need A. So words must contain A.

Therefore, in case 1, since A is only at position 1, the word is ""A"" then E,N,Something,Something.

But the last two positions must include the letter A only once, so they are different.

Words starting with ""AEN"": 
- ""AENEO"" - not a word.
- ""AENEAS"" too long.
- ""AENGUS"" too long.

"" ""There are very few English words starting with ""AEN"". For example, ""aeneous"" is not 5 letters.

Common words: none?

Perhaps ""SAUNA"" but not starting with AEN.

So case 1 might be impossible. Therefore, A must be at position 4.

Case 2: A at position 4.
Secret word: _ E N A _
Position 1 and 5 are unknown letters.

And we need to include A at position 4.

Letters at position 1 and 5 must be present and not absent.

Also, since the word has five letters, and we know A,E,N are present, and position 2 and 3 are E and N, position 4 is A.

So position 1 and 5 are the remaining letters, and must not be absent.

Possible words: ? E N A ?

Must end with something.

Common words: 
- ""SENNA"" -> but S,E,N,N,A -> but position 4 is A? In SENNA, if positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. But we need position 4 to be A, but in SENNA it's N (then A at 5). Not matching.

- ""VENAL"" V,E,N,A,L -> positions: 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> yes! This matches the form.

Other options:
- ""PENAL"" P,E,N,A,L -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L
- ""MENAD"" M,E,N,A,D -> similar
- ""DENAR"" D,E,N,A,R -> but R is absent (from Guess 1)
- ""VENAR"" not a word.

So possible words: 
- VENAL: V,E,N,A,L
- PENAL: P,E,N,A,L
- MENAD (if accepted: a type of spirit, but might not be common)
- BENAM (B,E,N,A,M) - to name, but uncommon
- WENAS (not common)
- SENAM is not common.
- Also, ""DENAY"" not a word.

But ""PENAL"" and ""VENAL"" are common.

Now, absent letters: C,R,T,K,G,O.

Neither V nor P nor L is in the absent list.

So both ""VENAL"" and ""PENAL"" are candidates.

But we also have position 1 and 5 to determine.

But we don't know which letter is which.

Another candidate: ""FINAL"" has I and L, but N is at position 3? FINAL: F,I,N,A,L -> positions 1:F, 2:I, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> but we need position 2 to be E, not I. So no.

""ZEBRA"" doesn't have E and N in the middle.

So for the form ? E N A ?, only letters that can be at the ends.

Now, L is common.

Another possibility: ""SENAS"" not word.

But ""VELAR"" V,E,L,A,R -> but that has L at position 3, but we need N at position 3? Not the same.

So back to PENAL and VENAL.

Also, the feedback from Guess 3: we learned that A is present but not at position 5, so in the secret word, A is not at 5. In both PENAL and VENAL, A is at position 4, so that's fine.

Also, we haven't tested V, P, L.

So we can choose either.

But let's see which one gives more information.

Since we have limited tries, we can guess one.

But note: in VENAL and PENAL, the last letter L is common.

So we can guess a word that tests L and another letter.

But we don't have more information.

Also, from previous, we know that A is not at 5, so if we guess VENAL, for example, we can confirm the entire word.

Similarly for PENAL.

But we don't know yet.

Another word: ""RENAL"" but R is absent, so no.

So between VENAL and PENAL.

VENAL: V is less common, PENAL might be more common.

We can also consider that position 1 could be other letters: for example, ""DENAR"" but R absent.

Or ""KENAF"" K absent.

""XENIA"" was guessed? No, GENOA but different.

But ""SENZA"" not fitting.

So I think VENAL or PENAL.

We also note that the secret word must contain five letters, and we have three confirmed: E at 2, N at 3, A at 4. And A is confirmed present.

Now, for the guess, we can guess one of them.

Let's look for more words.

WORD: ""FENAL""? Not common.

""HEMAL"" not EN.

So limited options.

Perhaps ""WENCH"" but C absent.

So let's go with PENAL.

But earlier in Guess 2, we used TAKEN, which had N at the end, but now N is fixed at 3.

Another idea: the missed letter at position 1 and 5.

For example, in PENAL, P at 1, L at 5.

Similarly V at 1, L at 5.

L is common.

But in the feedback from previous, we have no information about L.

So by guessing PENAL or VENAL, we can win or get close.

Since we know E and N are correct at positions 2 and 3, if we guess PENAL and position 4 is A but we don't know if that's correct? In the form ?ENA? we have A at 4, which we were going to assume.

In Guess 3, GENOA had A at 5 which was wrong, but that doesn't say about position 4.

But in the secret word, A could be at 1 or 4, but as we saw, there are no common words with A at 1 given the constraints, so likely A is at 4.

Therefore, the word is ? E N A ?

We need to guess position 1 and 5.

Common possibilities: 
- L is a common ending, like in PENAL, VENAL.

Also, other letters: M? BENAM not common. D? DENAR not really. S? SENA not common.

Therefore, I conclude that PENAL or VENAL is the most likely.

To choose, PENAL is more common.

Perhaps ""YEAN?"" but YE or something.

Another option: ""MEANS"" no, because S at 5, but position 2 must be E, not A.

I think PENAL is best.

But PENAL ends with L, which is not tested.

Similarly.

But let's make a guess of PENAL.

Then if it's correct, we win.

If not, we refine.

Guessing VENAL.

But PENAL might be better.

Since we have E in position 2 correct and N at 3 correct, the key is to find position 1 and 5.

But in PENAL and VENAL, both have L at 5.

So if we guess a word that explores possible letters for position 1 and L.

For example, guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

We can guess PENAL directly.
