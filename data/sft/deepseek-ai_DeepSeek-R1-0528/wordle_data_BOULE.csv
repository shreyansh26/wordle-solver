We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback.
 To start, we should pick a word that has common letters and a good distribution to get the most information.

 One common strategy is to start with a word that has:
 - Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 - Common consonants: R, T, S, N, L, etc.

 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, ROATE, etc.

 Let me choose a word that uses five common letters and doesn't repeat any letter to maximize information.

 I'm going to choose: ""CRANE""
 Why?
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
 - It covers a good set of frequent letters.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.

 Format the response as required.
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a 5-letter word with common letters to test multiple possibilities. Since no feedback is available yet, I'll prioritize words with high-frequency letters in English (like E, A, R, S, T) and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A word like ""SLATE"" is often effective:
- Contains frequent letters: S, L, A, T, E
- Covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- No repeating letters, which helps test more letters

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROAST"" could work, but ""SLATE"" slightly edges out in letter frequency analysis for common 5-letter words. Therefore, I'll start with ""SLATE"".

We received feedback for SLATE: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since E is the last letter).
 - L is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - S, A, T are not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E (so pattern: ? ? ? ? E)
 - The secret word contains an L, but not in the 2nd position.
 - We must avoid using S, A, T in any new guess because they are not in the word.

 Since E is fixed at position 5, and L is in the word (but not at position 2), we can try to find words that have:
 - Any of the first four positions for L? However, we know L cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback on SLATE: L at pos2 is marked as wrong position, meaning L must be elsewhere).

 Also, note that the word does not contain S, A, T.

 We have 6 positions for L: positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is ruled out, and 5 is fixed as E). But note: position 5 is E, so L can be at 1, 3, or 4.

 We need a word that ends with E and contains L (in position 1, 3, or 4) and avoids S, A, T.

 Let's brainstorm common words ending with E that contain L and without S, A, T.

 Possibilities: 
 - L at position 1: words like ? ? ? ? E -> L? ? ? E. Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"", but we must avoid A (in LANCE) and T? Also note that N and C are not ruled out? But also ""LUNGE"", ""LODGE"", etc.

 But wait, we know some letters that are absent: S, A, T are out. So:

 Let's list words that are 5 letters, ending with E, containing L (and not containing S, A, T), and L not in the second position if that position is tried? Actually, we don't know about position 1,3,4 yet.

 Since L is not at position 2, but we don't know the secret word, we must place L at either 1, 3, or 4.

 Also, we don't know other letters. We might want to test more common letters? We have eliminated three letters (S, A, T) and know E is at the end and L is present.

 I think we should try a word that:
 1. Ends with E.
 2. Contains L in either position 1, 3, or 4.
 3. Tests other common letters (like N, O, I, R, etc.) without using S, A, T.

 Let me think of words:

 Possibilities:
 Position 1: L -> words: L_ _ _ E
   Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"" (but has A -> invalid because A is out), ""LEGAL"" (but has A -> invalid) -> so avoid A? Also, ""LINEN"" -> but doesn't end with E? Wait, it must end with E.

 Actually, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> ends with E, has L at position 1, and no S,A,T. But wait, we don't know about U,N,G? We are free to test.

 Alternative: ""CYCLE"", but not common? and has C twice? Maybe not.

 Another: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> ends with D? No, must end with E. Wait, we need the last letter E.

 So, ""OIL"" + ""E"" doesn't work? But ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> 5 letters? And ends with D? No.

 Let me think again: words like ""LIVED"" -> ends with D? No. We need words with pattern _ _ _ _ E.

 How about ""PULSE""? But it has S -> eliminated. ""MOUSE""? Has S and E at the end? But S is eliminated.

 ""LATHE""? Has A and T -> eliminated.

 I'm considering ""NOBLE"": 
   N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, E is at position 5, and L is at position 4 (so not position 2). So, L at position 4? And avoids S,A,T? Yes.

 Also, ""CYCLE"": C Y C L E -> has L at position 4? And ends with E? But has two C's? Maybe.

 Alternatively, ""RIDGE""? No L? Doesn't contain L? So must contain L.

 We need words that include L. Another good one: ""CYCLE"" might be not very common? How about ""MAPLE""? But M A P L E -> has A -> invalid? Yes, A is eliminated.

 Another: ""APPLE""? Has A -> invalid.

 ""EAGLE""? Has A and E at the end? But A is invalid.

 ""OZONE""? Doesn't have L? So no.

 I found ""PHONE""? No L? Doesn't have L.

 Let me try to think of words with L in position 3: _ _ L _ E

 Examples: ""IDLER"", ""TABLET"" is 6 letters? So 5 letters: ""AISLE"" -> has A and S? Eliminated.

 ""BUGLE"" -> B U G L E -> L at position 4? Actually, positions: 
 B(1) U(2) G(3) L(4) E(5) -> so L at position 4? 
 But wait, we don't know about U and G? And avoids A, S, T? Yes.

 But we have E at position 5? and L at position 4? So that's a possibility. However, we also need to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, to get more coverage, we can try:

 ""FIELD""? No, ends with D? We need E. So ""FIELD"" doesn't work. 

 ""FILE"" is 4 letters? So 5 letters: ""FILLE""? Not a word.

 How about ""MILLE""? Not a word? We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""OUNCE""? Ends with E? O U N C E -> yes, but does not have L? We need the L somewhere.

 Let me consider L at position 1: 
 - LOIRE? Not English? 
 - ""LONGE"": L O N G E -> this is a word? In English, ""longe"" (like a long strap for horse) is accepted? 
   However, it has O,N,G? And avoids A,S,T? Maybe use ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> valid word? yes.

 Or ""LANCE"" but has A -> invalid. 

 So, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L1, U2, N3, G4, E5. 
 But note: we know L is not at position 2? This is position 1, so that's fine? Actually, the feedback only said L is in the word but not at position 2? It could be at 1.

 However, in ""LUNGE"", L is at position 1? Which is allowed because the feedback for position 2 was not L? We have no feedback about position 1.

 Alternatively, let's think of L at position 3: 
 Pattern: _ _ L _ E
 Example: ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> wait, 5 letters: I(1) D(2) L(3) E(4) R(5) -> doesn't end with E? It ends with R? 

 Let me check: 
 ""IDLER"" -> positions: I(1), D(2), L(3), E(4), R(5). But we need E at position 5? Here E is at position 4? So incorrect.

 Another: ""PILED"": P I L E D -> ends with D? So not.

 Actually, to have E at the end and L at position 3: the word would be ? ? L ? E. 
 Example: ""CYCLE"": C(1) Y(2) C(3) L(4) E(5) -> but here L is at position 4? Not position 3? 

 Pattern for position 3: _ _ L ? E -> then the 4th letter must be filled and then E at the end? 
 Example: ""SPLICE"" has S? Eliminated. ""APPLY"" doesn't end with E? 

 How about ""FLAKE""? Has A? Eliminated. ""STOLE""? has T? Eliminated.

 Trying L at position 4: _ _ _ L E
 Examples: ""TABLE""? has A -> invalid. ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> valid? Yes. Avoids S, A, T? Yes. 
 Also, ""MAPLE"" has A -> invalid. ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> avoids S,A,T? Yes.

 So, ""RIFLE"" and ""NOBLE"" are candidates. Also ""BUGLE"", ""EAGLE"" -> EAGLE has A -> invalid.

 Another: ""CYCLE"": This is valid? But C,Y,C,L,E -> two C's? It might be valid? But note that we are testing new letters? 

 However, we also want to maximize new letter coverage? We have E at the end and L somewhere. And we eliminated S, A, T. So we have not tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 I think ""RIFLE"" is good: R I F L E -> letters: R, I, F, L, E (with E at the end and L at position 4). 
 But note: we already know E is at the end and L is included? So we are testing R, I, F? 

 However, we also have position constraints: 
 We don't know about the first three positions? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> tests N, O, B? 

 Which one to pick? We might want to test more common letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that includes L in a different position? Since we are not sure, maybe we should test position 1 for L? 

 But note: in the feedback, L at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Meaning L is in the secret word at another position? But we haven't tested position 1. So it could be at position 1? 

 However, if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? And ends with E? 

 To test multiple possibilities, I think ""NOBLE"" is a safe choice? Or even ""GRUEL""? Ends with E? G R U E L -> positions: G R U E L -> no? 5 letters: G(1) R(2) U(3) E(4) L(5)? Wait, that doesn't end with E? That ends with L? 

 We need E at position 5? So:

 ""NOBLE"": letters N, O, B, L, E -> pattern: N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, the positions: 
 - Position 1: N -> if we guess ""NOBLE"", then:
   Position 1: N (we don't know)
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: B
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> known to be correct? 

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us E is at position 5? So if we guess any word, we must have E at position 5? So when we say ""NOBLE"", we are putting E at position 5? Which we know is correct.

 However, we also have L at position 4? And we know L is in the word? But we don't know if it is at position 4? 

 But this guess, if L is at position 4? Then we will get L(✓). Otherwise, if L is at another position? Then we will get L(-) at position 4? Or if L is at position 1? Then we won't see L at position 4? So we are testing L only at position 4? 

 Why not try L at position 1? Then we can see if L is at position 1? 

 So, let me decide: we haven't tested position 1? Maybe it's better to try L at position 1? Then we can rule out or confirm?

 How about ""LOUIE""? But not English? 

 ""LEONE""? Is it English? Oh, probably not common.

 ""LEVEL""? Has V and two E? But E is at position 2? And we know E is at position 5? So the word has E at position 5? But if the word has E at position 2? Then that E would have been marked? But in first guess we had E only at position 5? So if there is another E? It would be shown. 

 But in our feedback? We got E(✓) at position 5? And we don't know if there are other E? 

 However, ""LEVEL"": L E V E L -> ends with L? Not E.

 So, I think ""RIFLE"" is good? Or even ""BILLE""? Not a word.

 Another word: ""LUCRE"": L U C R E -> ends with E? and L at position 1? And avoids A,S,T? Yes.

 So, let me use ""LUCRE"": 
   L at 1: if correct? ✓, else if L is in the word? we'll get -, else if not? but we know L is in the word? So if L is not at 1? then we know it's in another position? 

 That might be good? Because if L is not at position 1? Then it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out position 2? 

 Similarly, we can test L at position 1? 

 But also, testing common letters? 

 How about ""CLIME"": C L I M E -> this has: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). 
 However, we know L cannot be at position 2? Because that's what the feedback said? So if we guess L at position 2? We know it's wrong? So why put L at position 2? 

 So, I think ""LUCRE"": L(1), U(2), C(3), R(4), E(5) 
 - But position 2: U? We don't know? 
 - But position 1: L? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> we know position 5 is E? So we focus on L at 4? 

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said L is in the word but not at position 2. So, if we use a word with L at position 1? Then we are testing position 1? 

 I think I will go with ""LUCRE"" to test L at position 1? 

 But wait: are there better choices? 

 Considering letter frequency? The remaining letters we haven't tested? 
 We have used: S,L,A,T,E -> so letters we know: E and L are in? S,A,T are out? 

 So, we want to test U, C, R? and also maybe other common ones? 

 But ""LUCRE"" tests L (which we know) at a new position? And U, C, R? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"" tests N, O, B? 

 Which set of letters is more common? R, U, C? 

 R is common? Also, we might want to test vowels? We know E is in (at the end)? and L is in? But we don't have other vowels? 

 We have only E? The word may have more vowels? We know A is out? So vowels remaining: E (we have), and then O, I, U? 

 Maybe test U? 

 I think ""LUCRE"" is a good choice? 

 Let me check if ""LUCRE"" is accepted? Yes, it's a valid word (means profit or gain).

 So, guess ""LUCRE"":

 Expected pattern: 
 Position 1: L -> 
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: C
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: E -> so E

 If the secret word is, for example, ""RUBLE""? But R would be at position 1? Then we would have L at position 4? But that doesn't match L at position 1? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 But we will get feedback? 

 Alternatively, ""BUYER""? Doesn't have L? 

 I think ""LUCRE"" is a valid guess.

 But note: we don't know if U, C, R are in the word? 

 However, we want to gain maximum information? 

 One more alternative: ""PLUME""? But has P,L,U,M,E -> E at end? But we have L at position 2? Which we know is not the position? So if L is in the word, it can't be at position 2? So why put L at position 2? 

 Similarly, in ""LUCRE"", we put L at position 1? which is not position 2? So allowed? 

 So I decide: ""LUCRE""

 But wait: in the feedback, L was marked as ""-"" at position 2? That means L is in the word but not at position 2? So when we guess ""LUCRE"", we put L at position 1? If the secret word has L at position 1? We get L(✓)? If the secret word has L at position 3 or 4? Then we will get L(-) for position 1? 

 So that's good? 

 Now, what if the secret word has no L at position 1? Then we get L(-)? Meaning L must be at position 3 or 4? 

 We can design accordingly? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""LUCRE"". 
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)):
- **E** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (position 5).
- **L** is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **S, A, T** are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- It must include **L**, but not in position 2 (so **L** must appear in position 1, 3, or 4).
- It should avoid **S, A, T**, and test new common letters to gather additional information.
- ""LUCRE"" (meaning profit or advantage) fits these criteria:
  - Ends with **E**.
  - Places **L** in position 1 to test if that's the correct slot for **L**.
  - Introduces new letters **U, C, R** (common consonants).
  - Avoids eliminated letters **S, A, T**.

<guess>LUCRE</guess>",LUCRE,"We received feedback for SLATE: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since E is the last letter).
 - L is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - S, A, T are not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E (so pattern: ? ? ? ? E)
 - The secret word contains an L, but not in the 2nd position.
 - We must avoid using S, A, T in any new guess because they are not in the word.

 Since E is fixed at position 5, and L is in the word (but not at position 2), we can try to find words that have:
 - Any of the first four positions for L? However, we know L cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback on SLATE: L at pos2 is marked as wrong position, meaning L must be elsewhere).

 Also, note that the word does not contain S, A, T.

 We have 6 positions for L: positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is ruled out, and 5 is fixed as E). But note: position 5 is E, so L can be at 1, 3, or 4.

 We need a word that ends with E and contains L (in position 1, 3, or 4) and avoids S, A, T.

 Let's brainstorm common words ending with E that contain L and without S, A, T.

 Possibilities: 
 - L at position 1: words like ? ? ? ? E -> L? ? ? E. Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"", but we must avoid A (in LANCE) and T? Also note that N and C are not ruled out? But also ""LUNGE"", ""LODGE"", etc.

 But wait, we know some letters that are absent: S, A, T are out. So:

 Let's list words that are 5 letters, ending with E, containing L (and not containing S, A, T), and L not in the second position if that position is tried? Actually, we don't know about position 1,3,4 yet.

 Since L is not at position 2, but we don't know the secret word, we must place L at either 1, 3, or 4.

 Also, we don't know other letters. We might want to test more common letters? We have eliminated three letters (S, A, T) and know E is at the end and L is present.

 I think we should try a word that:
 1. Ends with E.
 2. Contains L in either position 1, 3, or 4.
 3. Tests other common letters (like N, O, I, R, etc.) without using S, A, T.

 Let me think of words:

 Possibilities:
 Position 1: L -> words: L_ _ _ E
   Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"" (but has A -> invalid because A is out), ""LEGAL"" (but has A -> invalid) -> so avoid A? Also, ""LINEN"" -> but doesn't end with E? Wait, it must end with E.

 Actually, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> ends with E, has L at position 1, and no S,A,T. But wait, we don't know about U,N,G? We are free to test.

 Alternative: ""CYCLE"", but not common? and has C twice? Maybe not.

 Another: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> ends with D? No, must end with E. Wait, we need the last letter E.

 So, ""OIL"" + ""E"" doesn't work? But ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> 5 letters? And ends with D? No.

 Let me think again: words like ""LIVED"" -> ends with D? No. We need words with pattern _ _ _ _ E.

 How about ""PULSE""? But it has S -> eliminated. ""MOUSE""? Has S and E at the end? But S is eliminated.

 ""LATHE""? Has A and T -> eliminated.

 I'm considering ""NOBLE"": 
   N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, E is at position 5, and L is at position 4 (so not position 2). So, L at position 4? And avoids S,A,T? Yes.

 Also, ""CYCLE"": C Y C L E -> has L at position 4? And ends with E? But has two C's? Maybe.

 Alternatively, ""RIDGE""? No L? Doesn't contain L? So must contain L.

 We need words that include L. Another good one: ""CYCLE"" might be not very common? How about ""MAPLE""? But M A P L E -> has A -> invalid? Yes, A is eliminated.

 Another: ""APPLE""? Has A -> invalid.

 ""EAGLE""? Has A and E at the end? But A is invalid.

 ""OZONE""? Doesn't have L? So no.

 I found ""PHONE""? No L? Doesn't have L.

 Let me try to think of words with L in position 3: _ _ L _ E

 Examples: ""IDLER"", ""TABLET"" is 6 letters? So 5 letters: ""AISLE"" -> has A and S? Eliminated.

 ""BUGLE"" -> B U G L E -> L at position 4? Actually, positions: 
 B(1) U(2) G(3) L(4) E(5) -> so L at position 4? 
 But wait, we don't know about U and G? And avoids A, S, T? Yes.

 But we have E at position 5? and L at position 4? So that's a possibility. However, we also need to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, to get more coverage, we can try:

 ""FIELD""? No, ends with D? We need E. So ""FIELD"" doesn't work. 

 ""FILE"" is 4 letters? So 5 letters: ""FILLE""? Not a word.

 How about ""MILLE""? Not a word? We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""OUNCE""? Ends with E? O U N C E -> yes, but does not have L? We need the L somewhere.

 Let me consider L at position 1: 
 - LOIRE? Not English? 
 - ""LONGE"": L O N G E -> this is a word? In English, ""longe"" (like a long strap for horse) is accepted? 
   However, it has O,N,G? And avoids A,S,T? Maybe use ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> valid word? yes.

 Or ""LANCE"" but has A -> invalid. 

 So, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L1, U2, N3, G4, E5. 
 But note: we know L is not at position 2? This is position 1, so that's fine? Actually, the feedback only said L is in the word but not at position 2? It could be at 1.

 However, in ""LUNGE"", L is at position 1? Which is allowed because the feedback for position 2 was not L? We have no feedback about position 1.

 Alternatively, let's think of L at position 3: 
 Pattern: _ _ L _ E
 Example: ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> wait, 5 letters: I(1) D(2) L(3) E(4) R(5) -> doesn't end with E? It ends with R? 

 Let me check: 
 ""IDLER"" -> positions: I(1), D(2), L(3), E(4), R(5). But we need E at position 5? Here E is at position 4? So incorrect.

 Another: ""PILED"": P I L E D -> ends with D? So not.

 Actually, to have E at the end and L at position 3: the word would be ? ? L ? E. 
 Example: ""CYCLE"": C(1) Y(2) C(3) L(4) E(5) -> but here L is at position 4? Not position 3? 

 Pattern for position 3: _ _ L ? E -> then the 4th letter must be filled and then E at the end? 
 Example: ""SPLICE"" has S? Eliminated. ""APPLY"" doesn't end with E? 

 How about ""FLAKE""? Has A? Eliminated. ""STOLE""? has T? Eliminated.

 Trying L at position 4: _ _ _ L E
 Examples: ""TABLE""? has A -> invalid. ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> valid? Yes. Avoids S, A, T? Yes. 
 Also, ""MAPLE"" has A -> invalid. ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> avoids S,A,T? Yes.

 So, ""RIFLE"" and ""NOBLE"" are candidates. Also ""BUGLE"", ""EAGLE"" -> EAGLE has A -> invalid.

 Another: ""CYCLE"": This is valid? But C,Y,C,L,E -> two C's? It might be valid? But note that we are testing new letters? 

 However, we also want to maximize new letter coverage? We have E at the end and L somewhere. And we eliminated S, A, T. So we have not tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 I think ""RIFLE"" is good: R I F L E -> letters: R, I, F, L, E (with E at the end and L at position 4). 
 But note: we already know E is at the end and L is included? So we are testing R, I, F? 

 However, we also have position constraints: 
 We don't know about the first three positions? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> tests N, O, B? 

 Which one to pick? We might want to test more common letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that includes L in a different position? Since we are not sure, maybe we should test position 1 for L? 

 But note: in the feedback, L at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Meaning L is in the secret word at another position? But we haven't tested position 1. So it could be at position 1? 

 However, if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? And ends with E? 

 To test multiple possibilities, I think ""NOBLE"" is a safe choice? Or even ""GRUEL""? Ends with E? G R U E L -> positions: G R U E L -> no? 5 letters: G(1) R(2) U(3) E(4) L(5)? Wait, that doesn't end with E? That ends with L? 

 We need E at position 5? So:

 ""NOBLE"": letters N, O, B, L, E -> pattern: N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, the positions: 
 - Position 1: N -> if we guess ""NOBLE"", then:
   Position 1: N (we don't know)
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: B
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> known to be correct? 

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us E is at position 5? So if we guess any word, we must have E at position 5? So when we say ""NOBLE"", we are putting E at position 5? Which we know is correct.

 However, we also have L at position 4? And we know L is in the word? But we don't know if it is at position 4? 

 But this guess, if L is at position 4? Then we will get L(✓). Otherwise, if L is at another position? Then we will get L(-) at position 4? Or if L is at position 1? Then we won't see L at position 4? So we are testing L only at position 4? 

 Why not try L at position 1? Then we can see if L is at position 1? 

 So, let me decide: we haven't tested position 1? Maybe it's better to try L at position 1? Then we can rule out or confirm?

 How about ""LOUIE""? But not English? 

 ""LEONE""? Is it English? Oh, probably not common.

 ""LEVEL""? Has V and two E? But E is at position 2? And we know E is at position 5? So the word has E at position 5? But if the word has E at position 2? Then that E would have been marked? But in first guess we had E only at position 5? So if there is another E? It would be shown. 

 But in our feedback? We got E(✓) at position 5? And we don't know if there are other E? 

 However, ""LEVEL"": L E V E L -> ends with L? Not E.

 So, I think ""RIFLE"" is good? Or even ""BILLE""? Not a word.

 Another word: ""LUCRE"": L U C R E -> ends with E? and L at position 1? And avoids A,S,T? Yes.

 So, let me use ""LUCRE"": 
   L at 1: if correct? ✓, else if L is in the word? we'll get -, else if not? but we know L is in the word? So if L is not at 1? then we know it's in another position? 

 That might be good? Because if L is not at position 1? Then it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out position 2? 

 Similarly, we can test L at position 1? 

 But also, testing common letters? 

 How about ""CLIME"": C L I M E -> this has: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). 
 However, we know L cannot be at position 2? Because that's what the feedback said? So if we guess L at position 2? We know it's wrong? So why put L at position 2? 

 So, I think ""LUCRE"": L(1), U(2), C(3), R(4), E(5) 
 - But position 2: U? We don't know? 
 - But position 1: L? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> we know position 5 is E? So we focus on L at 4? 

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said L is in the word but not at position 2. So, if we use a word with L at position 1? Then we are testing position 1? 

 I think I will go with ""LUCRE"" to test L at position 1? 

 But wait: are there better choices? 

 Considering letter frequency? The remaining letters we haven't tested? 
 We have used: S,L,A,T,E -> so letters we know: E and L are in? S,A,T are out? 

 So, we want to test U, C, R? and also maybe other common ones? 

 But ""LUCRE"" tests L (which we know) at a new position? And U, C, R? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"" tests N, O, B? 

 Which set of letters is more common? R, U, C? 

 R is common? Also, we might want to test vowels? We know E is in (at the end)? and L is in? But we don't have other vowels? 

 We have only E? The word may have more vowels? We know A is out? So vowels remaining: E (we have), and then O, I, U? 

 Maybe test U? 

 I think ""LUCRE"" is a good choice? 

 Let me check if ""LUCRE"" is accepted? Yes, it's a valid word (means profit or gain).

 So, guess ""LUCRE"":

 Expected pattern: 
 Position 1: L -> 
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: C
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: E -> so E

 If the secret word is, for example, ""RUBLE""? But R would be at position 1? Then we would have L at position 4? But that doesn't match L at position 1? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 But we will get feedback? 

 Alternatively, ""BUYER""? Doesn't have L? 

 I think ""LUCRE"" is a valid guess.

 But note: we don't know if U, C, R are in the word? 

 However, we want to gain maximum information? 

 One more alternative: ""PLUME""? But has P,L,U,M,E -> E at end? But we have L at position 2? Which we know is not the position? So if L is in the word, it can't be at position 2? So why put L at position 2? 

 Similarly, in ""LUCRE"", we put L at position 1? which is not position 2? So allowed? 

 So I decide: ""LUCRE""

 But wait: in the feedback, L was marked as ""-"" at position 2? That means L is in the word but not at position 2? So when we guess ""LUCRE"", we put L at position 1? If the secret word has L at position 1? We get L(✓)? If the secret word has L at position 3 or 4? Then we will get L(-) for position 1? 

 So that's good? 

 Now, what if the secret word has no L at position 1? Then we get L(-)? Meaning L must be at position 3 or 4? 

 We can design accordingly? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""LUCRE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)):
- **E** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (position 5).
- **L** is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **S, A, T** are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- It must include **L**, but not in position 2 (so **L** must appear in position 1, 3, or 4).
- It should avoid **S, A, T**, and test new common letters to gather additional information.
- ""LUCRE"" (meaning profit or advantage) fits these criteria:
  - Ends with **E**.
  - Places **L** in position 1 to test if that's the correct slot for **L**.
  - Introduces new letters **U, C, R** (common consonants).
  - Avoids eliminated letters **S, A, T**.",Guess 2: LUCRE -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(-) C(x) R(x) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback.
 To start, we should pick a word that has common letters and a good distribution to get the most information.

 One common strategy is to start with a word that has:
 - Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 - Common consonants: R, T, S, N, L, etc.

 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, ROATE, etc.

 Let me choose a word that uses five common letters and doesn't repeat any letter to maximize information.

 I'm going to choose: ""CRANE""
 Why?
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
 - It covers a good set of frequent letters.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.

 Format the response as required.<thinking>
For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a 5-letter word with common letters to test multiple possibilities. Since no feedback is available yet, I'll prioritize words with high-frequency letters in English (like E, A, R, S, T) and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A word like ""SLATE"" is often effective:
- Contains frequent letters: S, L, A, T, E
- Covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- No repeating letters, which helps test more letters

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROAST"" could work, but ""SLATE"" slightly edges out in letter frequency analysis for common 5-letter words. Therefore, I'll start with ""SLATE"".
</thinking>

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for SLATE: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since E is the last letter).
 - L is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - S, A, T are not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E (so pattern: ? ? ? ? E)
 - The secret word contains an L, but not in the 2nd position.
 - We must avoid using S, A, T in any new guess because they are not in the word.

 Since E is fixed at position 5, and L is in the word (but not at position 2), we can try to find words that have:
 - Any of the first four positions for L? However, we know L cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback on SLATE: L at pos2 is marked as wrong position, meaning L must be elsewhere).

 Also, note that the word does not contain S, A, T.

 We have 6 positions for L: positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is ruled out, and 5 is fixed as E). But note: position 5 is E, so L can be at 1, 3, or 4.

 We need a word that ends with E and contains L (in position 1, 3, or 4) and avoids S, A, T.

 Let's brainstorm common words ending with E that contain L and without S, A, T.

 Possibilities: 
 - L at position 1: words like ? ? ? ? E -> L? ? ? E. Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"", but we must avoid A (in LANCE) and T? Also note that N and C are not ruled out? But also ""LUNGE"", ""LODGE"", etc.

 But wait, we know some letters that are absent: S, A, T are out. So:

 Let's list words that are 5 letters, ending with E, containing L (and not containing S, A, T), and L not in the second position if that position is tried? Actually, we don't know about position 1,3,4 yet.

 Since L is not at position 2, but we don't know the secret word, we must place L at either 1, 3, or 4.

 Also, we don't know other letters. We might want to test more common letters? We have eliminated three letters (S, A, T) and know E is at the end and L is present.

 I think we should try a word that:
 1. Ends with E.
 2. Contains L in either position 1, 3, or 4.
 3. Tests other common letters (like N, O, I, R, etc.) without using S, A, T.

 Let me think of words:

 Possibilities:
 Position 1: L -> words: L_ _ _ E
   Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"" (but has A -> invalid because A is out), ""LEGAL"" (but has A -> invalid) -> so avoid A? Also, ""LINEN"" -> but doesn't end with E? Wait, it must end with E.

 Actually, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> ends with E, has L at position 1, and no S,A,T. But wait, we don't know about U,N,G? We are free to test.

 Alternative: ""CYCLE"", but not common? and has C twice? Maybe not.

 Another: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> ends with D? No, must end with E. Wait, we need the last letter E.

 So, ""OIL"" + ""E"" doesn't work? But ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> 5 letters? And ends with D? No.

 Let me think again: words like ""LIVED"" -> ends with D? No. We need words with pattern _ _ _ _ E.

 How about ""PULSE""? But it has S -> eliminated. ""MOUSE""? Has S and E at the end? But S is eliminated.

 ""LATHE""? Has A and T -> eliminated.

 I'm considering ""NOBLE"": 
   N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, E is at position 5, and L is at position 4 (so not position 2). So, L at position 4? And avoids S,A,T? Yes.

 Also, ""CYCLE"": C Y C L E -> has L at position 4? And ends with E? But has two C's? Maybe.

 Alternatively, ""RIDGE""? No L? Doesn't contain L? So must contain L.

 We need words that include L. Another good one: ""CYCLE"" might be not very common? How about ""MAPLE""? But M A P L E -> has A -> invalid? Yes, A is eliminated.

 Another: ""APPLE""? Has A -> invalid.

 ""EAGLE""? Has A and E at the end? But A is invalid.

 ""OZONE""? Doesn't have L? So no.

 I found ""PHONE""? No L? Doesn't have L.

 Let me try to think of words with L in position 3: _ _ L _ E

 Examples: ""IDLER"", ""TABLET"" is 6 letters? So 5 letters: ""AISLE"" -> has A and S? Eliminated.

 ""BUGLE"" -> B U G L E -> L at position 4? Actually, positions: 
 B(1) U(2) G(3) L(4) E(5) -> so L at position 4? 
 But wait, we don't know about U and G? And avoids A, S, T? Yes.

 But we have E at position 5? and L at position 4? So that's a possibility. However, we also need to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, to get more coverage, we can try:

 ""FIELD""? No, ends with D? We need E. So ""FIELD"" doesn't work. 

 ""FILE"" is 4 letters? So 5 letters: ""FILLE""? Not a word.

 How about ""MILLE""? Not a word? We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""OUNCE""? Ends with E? O U N C E -> yes, but does not have L? We need the L somewhere.

 Let me consider L at position 1: 
 - LOIRE? Not English? 
 - ""LONGE"": L O N G E -> this is a word? In English, ""longe"" (like a long strap for horse) is accepted? 
   However, it has O,N,G? And avoids A,S,T? Maybe use ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> valid word? yes.

 Or ""LANCE"" but has A -> invalid. 

 So, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L1, U2, N3, G4, E5. 
 But note: we know L is not at position 2? This is position 1, so that's fine? Actually, the feedback only said L is in the word but not at position 2? It could be at 1.

 However, in ""LUNGE"", L is at position 1? Which is allowed because the feedback for position 2 was not L? We have no feedback about position 1.

 Alternatively, let's think of L at position 3: 
 Pattern: _ _ L _ E
 Example: ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> wait, 5 letters: I(1) D(2) L(3) E(4) R(5) -> doesn't end with E? It ends with R? 

 Let me check: 
 ""IDLER"" -> positions: I(1), D(2), L(3), E(4), R(5). But we need E at position 5? Here E is at position 4? So incorrect.

 Another: ""PILED"": P I L E D -> ends with D? So not.

 Actually, to have E at the end and L at position 3: the word would be ? ? L ? E. 
 Example: ""CYCLE"": C(1) Y(2) C(3) L(4) E(5) -> but here L is at position 4? Not position 3? 

 Pattern for position 3: _ _ L ? E -> then the 4th letter must be filled and then E at the end? 
 Example: ""SPLICE"" has S? Eliminated. ""APPLY"" doesn't end with E? 

 How about ""FLAKE""? Has A? Eliminated. ""STOLE""? has T? Eliminated.

 Trying L at position 4: _ _ _ L E
 Examples: ""TABLE""? has A -> invalid. ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> valid? Yes. Avoids S, A, T? Yes. 
 Also, ""MAPLE"" has A -> invalid. ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> avoids S,A,T? Yes.

 So, ""RIFLE"" and ""NOBLE"" are candidates. Also ""BUGLE"", ""EAGLE"" -> EAGLE has A -> invalid.

 Another: ""CYCLE"": This is valid? But C,Y,C,L,E -> two C's? It might be valid? But note that we are testing new letters? 

 However, we also want to maximize new letter coverage? We have E at the end and L somewhere. And we eliminated S, A, T. So we have not tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 I think ""RIFLE"" is good: R I F L E -> letters: R, I, F, L, E (with E at the end and L at position 4). 
 But note: we already know E is at the end and L is included? So we are testing R, I, F? 

 However, we also have position constraints: 
 We don't know about the first three positions? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> tests N, O, B? 

 Which one to pick? We might want to test more common letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that includes L in a different position? Since we are not sure, maybe we should test position 1 for L? 

 But note: in the feedback, L at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Meaning L is in the secret word at another position? But we haven't tested position 1. So it could be at position 1? 

 However, if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? And ends with E? 

 To test multiple possibilities, I think ""NOBLE"" is a safe choice? Or even ""GRUEL""? Ends with E? G R U E L -> positions: G R U E L -> no? 5 letters: G(1) R(2) U(3) E(4) L(5)? Wait, that doesn't end with E? That ends with L? 

 We need E at position 5? So:

 ""NOBLE"": letters N, O, B, L, E -> pattern: N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, the positions: 
 - Position 1: N -> if we guess ""NOBLE"", then:
   Position 1: N (we don't know)
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: B
   Position 4: L
   Position 5: E -> known to be correct? 

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us E is at position 5? So if we guess any word, we must have E at position 5? So when we say ""NOBLE"", we are putting E at position 5? Which we know is correct.

 However, we also have L at position 4? And we know L is in the word? But we don't know if it is at position 4? 

 But this guess, if L is at position 4? Then we will get L(✓). Otherwise, if L is at another position? Then we will get L(-) at position 4? Or if L is at position 1? Then we won't see L at position 4? So we are testing L only at position 4? 

 Why not try L at position 1? Then we can see if L is at position 1? 

 So, let me decide: we haven't tested position 1? Maybe it's better to try L at position 1? Then we can rule out or confirm?

 How about ""LOUIE""? But not English? 

 ""LEONE""? Is it English? Oh, probably not common.

 ""LEVEL""? Has V and two E? But E is at position 2? And we know E is at position 5? So the word has E at position 5? But if the word has E at position 2? Then that E would have been marked? But in first guess we had E only at position 5? So if there is another E? It would be shown. 

 But in our feedback? We got E(✓) at position 5? And we don't know if there are other E? 

 However, ""LEVEL"": L E V E L -> ends with L? Not E.

 So, I think ""RIFLE"" is good? Or even ""BILLE""? Not a word.

 Another word: ""LUCRE"": L U C R E -> ends with E? and L at position 1? And avoids A,S,T? Yes.

 So, let me use ""LUCRE"": 
   L at 1: if correct? ✓, else if L is in the word? we'll get -, else if not? but we know L is in the word? So if L is not at 1? then we know it's in another position? 

 That might be good? Because if L is not at position 1? Then it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out position 2? 

 Similarly, we can test L at position 1? 

 But also, testing common letters? 

 How about ""CLIME"": C L I M E -> this has: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). 
 However, we know L cannot be at position 2? Because that's what the feedback said? So if we guess L at position 2? We know it's wrong? So why put L at position 2? 

 So, I think ""LUCRE"": L(1), U(2), C(3), R(4), E(5) 
 - But position 2: U? We don't know? 
 - But position 1: L? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> we know position 5 is E? So we focus on L at 4? 

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said L is in the word but not at position 2. So, if we use a word with L at position 1? Then we are testing position 1? 

 I think I will go with ""LUCRE"" to test L at position 1? 

 But wait: are there better choices? 

 Considering letter frequency? The remaining letters we haven't tested? 
 We have used: S,L,A,T,E -> so letters we know: E and L are in? S,A,T are out? 

 So, we want to test U, C, R? and also maybe other common ones? 

 But ""LUCRE"" tests L (which we know) at a new position? And U, C, R? 

 Alternatively, ""NOBLE"" tests N, O, B? 

 Which set of letters is more common? R, U, C? 

 R is common? Also, we might want to test vowels? We know E is in (at the end)? and L is in? But we don't have other vowels? 

 We have only E? The word may have more vowels? We know A is out? So vowels remaining: E (we have), and then O, I, U? 

 Maybe test U? 

 I think ""LUCRE"" is a good choice? 

 Let me check if ""LUCRE"" is accepted? Yes, it's a valid word (means profit or gain).

 So, guess ""LUCRE"":

 Expected pattern: 
 Position 1: L -> 
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: C
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: E -> so E

 If the secret word is, for example, ""RUBLE""? But R would be at position 1? Then we would have L at position 4? But that doesn't match L at position 1? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 But we will get feedback? 

 Alternatively, ""BUYER""? Doesn't have L? 

 I think ""LUCRE"" is a valid guess.

 But note: we don't know if U, C, R are in the word? 

 However, we want to gain maximum information? 

 One more alternative: ""PLUME""? But has P,L,U,M,E -> E at end? But we have L at position 2? Which we know is not the position? So if L is in the word, it can't be at position 2? So why put L at position 2? 

 Similarly, in ""LUCRE"", we put L at position 1? which is not position 2? So allowed? 

 So I decide: ""LUCRE""

 But wait: in the feedback, L was marked as ""-"" at position 2? That means L is in the word but not at position 2? So when we guess ""LUCRE"", we put L at position 1? If the secret word has L at position 1? We get L(✓)? If the secret word has L at position 3 or 4? Then we will get L(-) for position 1? 

 So that's good? 

 Now, what if the secret word has no L at position 1? Then we get L(-)? Meaning L must be at position 3 or 4? 

 We can design accordingly? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""LUCRE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)):
- **E** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (position 5).
- **L** is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **S, A, T** are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- It must include **L**, but not in position 2 (so **L** must appear in position 1, 3, or 4).
- It should avoid **S, A, T**, and test new common letters to gather additional information.
- ""LUCRE"" (meaning profit or advantage) fits these criteria:
  - Ends with **E**.
  - Places **L** in position 1 to test if that's the correct slot for **L**.
  - Introduces new letters **U, C, R** (common consonants).
  - Avoids eliminated letters **S, A, T**.

However, we know L cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback on SLATE: L at pos2 is marked as wrong position, meaning L must be elsewhere).\n\n Also, note that the word does not contain S, A, T.\n\n We have 6 positions for L: positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is ruled out, and 5 is fixed as E). But note: position 5 is E, so L can be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\n We need a word that ends with E and contains L (in position 1, 3, or 4) and avoids S, A, T.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm common words ending with E that contain L and without S, A, T.\n\n Possibilities: \n - L at position 1: words like ? ? ? ?

So:\n\n Let\'s list words that are 5 letters, ending with E, containing L (and not containing S, A, T), and L not in the second position if that position is tried? Actually, we don\'t know about position 1,3,4 yet.\n\n Since L is not at position 2, but we don\'t know the secret word, we must place L at either 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Also, we don\'t know other letters.

Contains L in either position 1, 3, or 4.\n 3. Tests other common letters (like N, O, I, R, etc.) without using S, A, T.\n\n Let me think of words:\n\n Possibilities:\n Position 1: L -> words: L_ _ _ E\n   Examples: ""LOVE"", ""LANCE"" (but has A -> invalid because A is out), ""LEGAL"" (but has A -> invalid) -> so avoid A? Also, ""LINEN"" -> but doesn\'t end with E? Wait, it must end with E.\n\n Actually, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> ends with E, has L at position 1, and no S,A,T. But wait, we don\'t know about U,N,G? We are free to test.\n\n Alternative: ""CYCLE"", but not common? and has C twice? Maybe not.\n\n Another: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> ends with D? No, must end with E. Wait, we need the last letter E.\n\n So, ""OIL"" + ""E"" doesn\'t work? But ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> 5 letters? And ends with D? No.\n\n Let me think again: words like ""LIVED"" -> ends with D? No. We need words with pattern _ _ _ _ E.\n\n How about ""PULSE""? But it has S -> eliminated. ""MOUSE""? Has S and E at the end? But S is eliminated.\n\n ""LATHE""? Has A and T -> eliminated.\n\n I\'m considering ""NOBLE"": \n   N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, E is at position 5, and L is at position 4 (so not position 2). So, L at position 4? And avoids S,A,T? Yes.\n\n Also, ""CYCLE"": C Y C L E -> has L at position 4? And ends with E? But has two C\'s? Maybe.\n\n Alternatively, ""RIDGE""? No L? Doesn\'t contain L? So must contain L.\n\n We need words that include L. Another good one: ""CYCLE"" might be not very common? How about ""MAPLE""? But M A P L E -> has A -> invalid? Yes, A is eliminated.\n\n Another: ""APPLE""? Has A -> invalid.\n\n ""EAGLE""? Has A and E at the end? But A is invalid.\n\n ""OZONE""? Doesn\'t have L? So no.\n\n I found ""PHONE""? No L? Doesn\'t have L.\n\n Let me try to think of words with L in position 3: _ _ L _ E\n\n Examples: ""IDLER"", ""TABLET"" is 6 letters? So 5 letters: ""AISLE"" -> has A and S?

Yes.\n\n But we have E at position 5? and L at position 4? So that\'s a possibility. However, we also need to test other common letters.\n\n Alternatively, to get more coverage, we can try:\n\n ""FIELD""? No, ends with D? We need E. So ""FIELD"" doesn\'t work. \n\n ""FILE"" is 4 letters? So 5 letters: ""FILLE""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""MILLE""? Not a word? We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""OUNCE""? Ends with E? O U N C E -> yes, but does not have L? We need the L somewhere.\n\n Let me consider L at position 1: \n - LOIRE? Not English? \n - ""LONGE"": L O N G E -> this is a word? In English, ""longe"" (like a long strap for horse) is accepted? \n   However, it has O,N,G? And avoids A,S,T? Maybe use ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> valid word? yes.\n\n Or ""LANCE"" but has A -> invalid. \n\n So, ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> positions: L1, U2, N3, G4, E5. \n But note: we know L is not at position 2? This is position 1, so that\'s fine? Actually, the feedback only said L is in the word but not at position 2? It could be at 1.\n\n However, in ""LUNGE"", L is at position 1? Which is allowed because the feedback for position 2 was not L? We have no feedback about position 1.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s think of L at position 3: \n Pattern: _ _ L _ E\n Example: ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> wait, 5 letters: I(1) D(2) L(3) E(4) R(5) -> doesn\'t end with E? It ends with R? \n\n Let me check: \n ""IDLER"" -> positions: I(1), D(2), L(3), E(4), R(5). But we need E at position 5? Here E is at position 4? So incorrect.\n\n Another: ""PILED"": P I L E D -> ends with D? So not.\n\n Actually, to have E at the end and L at position 3: the word would be ? ? L ? E. \n Example: ""CYCLE"": C(1) Y(2) C(3) L(4) E(5) -> but here L is at position 4? Not position 3? \n\n Pattern for position 3: _ _ L ? E -> then the 4th letter must be filled and then E at the end? \n Example: ""SPLICE"" has S? Eliminated. ""APPLY"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n How about ""FLAKE""? Has A? Eliminated. ""STOLE""? has T? Eliminated.\n\n Trying L at position 4: _ _ _ L E\n Examples: ""TABLE""? has A -> invalid. ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> valid? Yes. Avoids S, A, T? Yes. \n Also, ""MAPLE"" has A -> invalid. ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> avoids S,A,T? Yes.\n\n So, ""RIFLE"" and ""NOBLE"" are candidates. Also ""BUGLE"", ""EAGLE"" -> EAGLE has A -> invalid.\n\n Another: ""CYCLE"": This is valid? But C,Y,C,L,E -> two C\'s? It might be valid? But note that we are testing new letters? \n\n However, we also want to maximize new letter coverage? We have E at the end and L somewhere. And we eliminated S, A, T. So we have not tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n I think ""RIFLE"" is good: R I F L E -> letters: R, I, F, L, E (with E at the end and L at position 4). \n But note: we already know E is at the end and L is included? So we are testing R, I, F? \n\n However, we also have position constraints: \n We don\'t know about the first three positions? \n\n Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N O B L E -> tests N, O, B? \n\n Which one to pick? We might want to test more common letters? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that includes L in a different position? Since we are not sure, maybe we should test position 1 for L? \n\n But note: in the feedback, L at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Meaning L is in the secret word at another position? But we haven\'t tested position 1. So it could be at position 1? \n\n However, if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? And ends with E? \n\n To test multiple possibilities, I think ""NOBLE"" is a safe choice? Or even ""GRUEL""? Ends with E? G R U E L -> positions: G R U E L -> no? 5 letters: G(1) R(2) U(3) E(4) L(5)? Wait, that doesn\'t end with E? That ends with L? \n\n We need E at position 5? So:\n\n ""NOBLE"": letters N, O, B, L, E -> pattern: N O B L E -> ends with E? Actually, the positions: \n - Position 1: N -> if we guess ""NOBLE"", then:\n   Position 1: N (we don\'t know)\n   Position 2: O\n   Position 3: B\n   Position 4: L\n   Position 5: E -> known to be correct? \n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us E is at position 5? So if we guess any word, we must have E at position 5? So when we say ""NOBLE"", we are putting E at position 5? Which we know is correct.\n\n However, we also have L at position 4? And we know L is in the word? But we don\'t know if it is at position 4? \n\n But this guess, if L is at position 4? Then we will get L(✓). Otherwise, if L is at another position? Then we will get L(-) at position 4? Or if L is at position 1? Then we won\'t see L at position 4? So we are testing L only at position 4? \n\n Why not try L at position 1? Then we can see if L is at position 1? \n\n So, let me decide: we haven\'t tested position 1? Maybe it\'s better to try L at position 1? Then we can rule out or confirm?\n\n How about ""LOUIE""? But not English? \n\n ""LEONE""? Is it English? Oh, probably not common.\n\n ""LEVEL""? Has V and two E? But E is at position 2? And we know E is at position 5? So the word has E at position 5? But if the word has E at position 2? Then that E would have been marked? But in first guess we had E only at position 5? So if there is another E? It would be shown. \n\n But in our feedback? We got E(✓) at position 5? And we don\'t know if there are other E? \n\n However, ""LEVEL"": L E V E L -> ends with L? Not E.\n\n So, I think ""RIFLE"" is good? Or even ""BILLE""? Not a word.\n\n Another word: ""LUCRE"": L U C R E -> ends with E? and L at position 1? And avoids A,S,T? Yes.\n\n So, let me use ""LUCRE"": \n   L at 1: if correct? ✓, else if L is in the word? we\'ll get -, else if not? but we know L is in the word? So if L is not at 1? then we know it\'s in another position? \n\n That might be good? Because if L is not at position 1? Then it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out position 2? \n\n Similarly, we can test L at position 1? \n\n But also, testing common letters? \n\n How about ""CLIME"": C L I M E -> this has: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). \n However, we know L cannot be at position 2? Because that\'s what the feedback said? So if we guess L at position 2? We know it\'s wrong? So why put L at position 2? \n\n So, I think ""LUCRE"": L(1), U(2), C(3), R(4), E(5) \n - But position 2: U? We don\'t know? \n - But position 1: L? \n\n Alternatively, ""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) -> we know position 5 is E? So we focus on L at 4? \n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess said L is in the word but not at position 2. So, if we use a word with L at position 1?

We have two pieces of feedback:
1. From SLATE: 
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A(x): A is not in the word.
   - T(x): T is not in the word.
   - E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5 (so the word ends with E).

2. From LUCRE:
   - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 1. (Because we guessed L at position 1 and got a '-')
   - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 2. (Guessed at position 2)
   - C(x): C is not in the word.
   - R(x): R is not in the word.
   - E(✓): E is confirmed again at position 5.

Combining what we know:
- The secret word ends with E: pattern [_, _, _, _, E]
- Letters in the word: L, U, E (since both L and U were marked as present but wrong position)
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, C, R (from the x's)
- Constraints for L and U:
  - L cannot be in position 1 (from LUCRE feedback) or position 2 (from SLATE feedback). So L must be in position 3 or 4.
  - U cannot be in position 2 (as per LUCRE). So U can be in position 1, 3, or 4. But position 1 is open, positions 3 and 4 might have L?

Also, from SLATE, L was in the word but not at position 2. There were no constraints on other letters at that time. Now we know L cannot be at position 1 either.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, containing L and U, avoiding S, A, T, C, R.

Additionally, we know:
- Since U was guessed at position 2 and marked '-', U is in the word but not at position 2.
- We have narrowed L to positions 3 or 4.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: Not L (known) and not any of the forbidden letters. Could be U? U is not forbidden and can be at position 1.
- Position 2: Cannot be U (because of LUCRE feedback) and also not L (from SLATE).
- Position 3: Possible for L or U.
- Position 4: Possible for L or U.

But note: The word must contain both L and U.

Let's consider:
- If L is at position 3, then position 4 is free for U? But note U might also be at position 1? However, we don't know.
- Similarly, if L is at position 4, then position 3 could be U? Or position 1 could be U.

We need a word that meets these.

Also, we should test other common letters? Since we have eliminated S, A, T, C, R, the remaining common letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, let's think of words ending in E, containing L and U, avoiding S,A,T,C,R.

Pattern possibilities:

Option 1: U in position 1, L in position 3? Then pattern: U _ L _ E
Examples: ""UNLIE"" not a word. ""UGLIE"" not a word.

Option 2: U in position 1, L in position 4: U _ _ L E.
Examples: ""UMPLE"" not a word. ""UPTLE"" not a word.

Option 3: U in position 3, L in position 4: _ _ U L E.
Examples: 
  - ""BOULE"" (a shape) - but has B and O? 
  - ""DOULE""? Not common? 
  - ""FOULE"" (not English? Probably not accepted)
  - ""MOULE"" (not English? ""Mould"" is common, but E ending? ""MOULE"" is not recognized)
  - Let's try ""OGLE""? Not 5 letters? And doesn't have U? 

Alternatively, ""OUPLE"" not a word.

I recall ""WHOLE""? W H O L E -> L at position 4, but doesn't have U? And O at position 3.

What if L is in position 3 and U in position 4? Pattern: _ _ L U E? 
Then the word would be ...? ""SLOPE"" has S (eliminated) and O at 3, L at 4? Wait, we need L at position 3 and U at 4? 
But ""VALUE"" has V, A, L, U, E? But A is eliminated? ""VALUE"" contains A -> invalid.

Another: an L at position 3 and U at position 1? Pattern: U _ L _ E -> ""UGLIE"" not a word? 

Alternatively, U at position 3 and L at position 1? But L position 1 is already known to be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the positions are:
L must be at 3 or 4? And U must be at 1, 3, or 4? But not 2.

Let me list words that contain U and L and end with E? 

Possible English words:
1. ""VALUE"" - but contains A? And A is already eliminated? Also T? Not necessarily but A is out? Actually, VALUE has A -> invalid.
2. ""GULDE"" not a word?
3. ""FLUME"" - has F,L,U,M,E -> avoid? F,L,U,M,E? Letters: F is not eliminated, nor M? But does it end with E? Yes: F L U M E? Positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). 
   But note: if we guess FLUME, then:
   - Position 2: L? But we know L cannot be at position 2? Because in SLATE, we had L at position 2 and it was marked as '-', meaning L is not in position 2. So FLUME has L at position 2? Which would get a '-'? But we are trying to put L at a position that might be correct? So in FLUME, position 2 L would be incorrect? Then the '-', meaning L is elsewhere? But we know L must be at position 3 or 4? So FLUME might not be good? 

However, we are constrained: the secret word has L in either position 3 or 4? So if we guess FLUME, we put L at position 2? Which we know is incorrect? That wouldn't help? 

Therefore, we need to avoid putting L at position 2? 

In fact, no word that puts L at position 1 or 2 can be helpful? Because we already know L is not at 1 or 2? 

So, we must guess a word that places L at position 3 or 4? And U at position 1, 3, or 4? But not 2? 

Now, consider the pattern: position 3 for L? Then U might be at position 1? Then pattern: U ? L ? E

Or if L at position 3 and U at position 4: _ ? L U E

Similarly, if L at position 4, then U could be at position 1: U ? ? L E
or U at position 3: _ ? U L E

Now, let's search for valid words:
- Pattern U _ L _ E: ""UNLIVE""? U N L I E -> that's 5 letters! And it means to bring back to life? But is it accepted? Maybe. Also, avoids S,A,T,C,R? Yes: U, N, L, I, E? 
  But note: position 3 is L? And we know L must be at position 3 or 4? In this case, L is at position 3? That's a possibility? 

""Unlive"" - but we are not sure if it's common or accepted?

Another: ""UMBLE"" - not common? 

- Pattern U _ _ L E: Let's say L at position 4? Then we need a word: U ? ? L E. Example: ""BUXOMLY""? Too long? 
  How about ""FULLY""? Doesn't end with E? 
  ""BUGLE""? But has B,U,G,L,E? But U is at position 2? But we know U cannot be at position 2? Because in LUCRE, U at position 2 got a '-', meaning U is not at position 2? So we cannot put U at position 2? 

Therefore, in ""UMBLE""? If it were a word, U(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5)? That would be okay? But ""UMBLE"" is not a common word? 

Another possibility: ""CURLE"" not a word? 

Now, pattern: _ _ L U E (if L at position 3 and U at position 4): 
Example: ""CLUES""? But has C? and S? Eliminated? 
""FLUE"" is 4 letters? So add a letter: ""CLUED""? Ends with D? 
Alternatively, ""GLUED""? Ends with D? 
""PLUED"" not a word? 
How about ""VALUE""? Again, A? 
""OILED""? Ends with D? 

Now, pattern: _ _ U L E (if U at position 3 and L at position 4): 
Example: ""FOULE""? Not English? 
""SOULE""? Has S? Eliminated? 
""BOULE"": B O U L E -> that's a valid word? 
Letters: B, O, U, L, E? Avoids S,A,T,C,R? Yes? 
Meaning: a shape? 

So, ""BOULE"" is a candidate? 
Pattern: B(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), E(5). 
But also, L is at position 4? Which is possible? 

Also, U is at position 3? 

Another candidate: ""POULE"" - perhaps? But not common? 

Given that ""BOULE"" is more recognized? 

Alternatively, maybe ""GOLEM""? Doesn't end with E? 

Another word: ""WHOLE"" only has W,H,O,L,E? No U? 

But we must have U? 

So, let me settle on ""BOULE""? 

Or what about ""MOULE""? Not English? 

Also, we haven't tested many letters? So with ""BOULE"", we test B, O, and we know U and L are in? 

Another word: ""UNPLE"" not a word? 

Wait, what about ""UNLIE""? That's not common? 

I propose ""BOULE"". 

But note: In ""BOULE"", 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: U? 
- Position 4: L? 
- Position 5: E? 

Now, we know:
- In secret word, L must be at position 3 or 4? And U must be at position 1, 3 or 4? But here in ""BOULE"", U is at position 3? L at position 4? 

So it fits the constraints? 

Let's see: 
We eliminate C, R, S, A, T? So B, O are new? 

If the secret word is ""BOULE"", then: 
- U is at position 3? Which is allowed? 
- L is at position 4? Which aligns with the constraints?

Also, there might be other possibilities? Like ""UNLIE"" but that might not be accepted? So ""BOULE"" seems safe? 

But wait, is ""BOULE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a form of cheese or a shape? 

So, let's guess ""BOULE"". 

Alternatively, ""FOCUS"" doesn't have E? 

Another candidate: ""GULPS"" not ending in E? 

Therefore, I think ""BOULE"" is the best choice? 

But note: we might be missing the possibility of U at position 1? But we have no word concept? So we'll see? 

Or perhaps ""ULCER""? But has C and R? Eliminated? 

No. 

So, here we go: Guess ""BOULE""

To confirm: 
Guess should be: BOULE

Now, note: if the L is at position 3? Then we would have to adjust? But in BOULE, L is at position 4? 

But we'll get feedback: 
- B(?) at position 1 -> might be correct? Or not? 
- O(?) at position 2? 
- U(?) at position 3? 
- L(?) at position 4? 
- E(✓) at position 5? 

And if L is at position 3? Then we will get L(-) at position 4? And similarly for U?

So it will help narrow down? 

I think ""BOULE"" is a good guess.
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- **SLATE**: S(x), L(-), A(x), T(x), E(✓) → Secret word ends with E, contains L (not in position 2), excludes S, A, T.
- **LUCRE**: L(-), U(-), C(x), R(x), E(✓) → L is not in position 1, U is in the word but not in position 2, excludes C, R.

Key constraints:
- Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`.
- Contains U and L, both misplaced in prior guesses:
  - L must occupy position 3 or 4 (cannot be position 1 or 2).
  - U cannot be position 2, so must be 1, 3, or 4.
- Excluded letters: S, A, T, C, R.
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

After evaluating possible words ending in E that include U and L while avoiding excluded letters:
- **BOULE** fits best:
  - Pattern: `B O U L E`
    - Tests U in position 3 and L in position 4 (both valid positions).
    - Tests new common letters: B, O (both high-frequency).
  - Avoids conflicts: U avoids position 2; L avoids positions 1–2.
  - Valid English word (noun: a form of bread or shape).

This guess efficiently probes U and L positions while expanding coverage to high-frequency consonants (B) and vowels (O).

<guess>BOULE</guess>",BOULE,"We have two pieces of feedback:
1. From SLATE: 
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A(x): A is not in the word.
   - T(x): T is not in the word.
   - E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5 (so the word ends with E).

2. From LUCRE:
   - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 1. (Because we guessed L at position 1 and got a '-')
   - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 2. (Guessed at position 2)
   - C(x): C is not in the word.
   - R(x): R is not in the word.
   - E(✓): E is confirmed again at position 5.

Combining what we know:
- The secret word ends with E: pattern [_, _, _, _, E]
- Letters in the word: L, U, E (since both L and U were marked as present but wrong position)
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, C, R (from the x's)
- Constraints for L and U:
  - L cannot be in position 1 (from LUCRE feedback) or position 2 (from SLATE feedback). So L must be in position 3 or 4.
  - U cannot be in position 2 (as per LUCRE). So U can be in position 1, 3, or 4. But position 1 is open, positions 3 and 4 might have L?

Also, from SLATE, L was in the word but not at position 2. There were no constraints on other letters at that time. Now we know L cannot be at position 1 either.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, containing L and U, avoiding S, A, T, C, R.

Additionally, we know:
- Since U was guessed at position 2 and marked '-', U is in the word but not at position 2.
- We have narrowed L to positions 3 or 4.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: Not L (known) and not any of the forbidden letters. Could be U? U is not forbidden and can be at position 1.
- Position 2: Cannot be U (because of LUCRE feedback) and also not L (from SLATE).
- Position 3: Possible for L or U.
- Position 4: Possible for L or U.

But note: The word must contain both L and U.

Let's consider:
- If L is at position 3, then position 4 is free for U? But note U might also be at position 1? However, we don't know.
- Similarly, if L is at position 4, then position 3 could be U? Or position 1 could be U.

We need a word that meets these.

Also, we should test other common letters? Since we have eliminated S, A, T, C, R, the remaining common letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, let's think of words ending in E, containing L and U, avoiding S,A,T,C,R.

Pattern possibilities:

Option 1: U in position 1, L in position 3? Then pattern: U _ L _ E
Examples: ""UNLIE"" not a word. ""UGLIE"" not a word.

Option 2: U in position 1, L in position 4: U _ _ L E.
Examples: ""UMPLE"" not a word. ""UPTLE"" not a word.

Option 3: U in position 3, L in position 4: _ _ U L E.
Examples: 
  - ""BOULE"" (a shape) - but has B and O? 
  - ""DOULE""? Not common? 
  - ""FOULE"" (not English? Probably not accepted)
  - ""MOULE"" (not English? ""Mould"" is common, but E ending? ""MOULE"" is not recognized)
  - Let's try ""OGLE""? Not 5 letters? And doesn't have U? 

Alternatively, ""OUPLE"" not a word.

I recall ""WHOLE""? W H O L E -> L at position 4, but doesn't have U? And O at position 3.

What if L is in position 3 and U in position 4? Pattern: _ _ L U E? 
Then the word would be ...? ""SLOPE"" has S (eliminated) and O at 3, L at 4? Wait, we need L at position 3 and U at 4? 
But ""VALUE"" has V, A, L, U, E? But A is eliminated? ""VALUE"" contains A -> invalid.

Another: an L at position 3 and U at position 1? Pattern: U _ L _ E -> ""UGLIE"" not a word? 

Alternatively, U at position 3 and L at position 1? But L position 1 is already known to be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the positions are:
L must be at 3 or 4? And U must be at 1, 3, or 4? But not 2.

Let me list words that contain U and L and end with E? 

Possible English words:
1. ""VALUE"" - but contains A? And A is already eliminated? Also T? Not necessarily but A is out? Actually, VALUE has A -> invalid.
2. ""GULDE"" not a word?
3. ""FLUME"" - has F,L,U,M,E -> avoid? F,L,U,M,E? Letters: F is not eliminated, nor M? But does it end with E? Yes: F L U M E? Positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). 
   But note: if we guess FLUME, then:
   - Position 2: L? But we know L cannot be at position 2? Because in SLATE, we had L at position 2 and it was marked as '-', meaning L is not in position 2. So FLUME has L at position 2? Which would get a '-'? But we are trying to put L at a position that might be correct? So in FLUME, position 2 L would be incorrect? Then the '-', meaning L is elsewhere? But we know L must be at position 3 or 4? So FLUME might not be good? 

However, we are constrained: the secret word has L in either position 3 or 4? So if we guess FLUME, we put L at position 2? Which we know is incorrect? That wouldn't help? 

Therefore, we need to avoid putting L at position 2? 

In fact, no word that puts L at position 1 or 2 can be helpful? Because we already know L is not at 1 or 2? 

So, we must guess a word that places L at position 3 or 4? And U at position 1, 3, or 4? But not 2? 

Now, consider the pattern: position 3 for L? Then U might be at position 1? Then pattern: U ? L ? E

Or if L at position 3 and U at position 4: _ ? L U E

Similarly, if L at position 4, then U could be at position 1: U ? ? L E
or U at position 3: _ ? U L E

Now, let's search for valid words:
- Pattern U _ L _ E: ""UNLIVE""? U N L I E -> that's 5 letters! And it means to bring back to life? But is it accepted? Maybe. Also, avoids S,A,T,C,R? Yes: U, N, L, I, E? 
  But note: position 3 is L? And we know L must be at position 3 or 4? In this case, L is at position 3? That's a possibility? 

""Unlive"" - but we are not sure if it's common or accepted?

Another: ""UMBLE"" - not common? 

- Pattern U _ _ L E: Let's say L at position 4? Then we need a word: U ? ? L E. Example: ""BUXOMLY""? Too long? 
  How about ""FULLY""? Doesn't end with E? 
  ""BUGLE""? But has B,U,G,L,E? But U is at position 2? But we know U cannot be at position 2? Because in LUCRE, U at position 2 got a '-', meaning U is not at position 2? So we cannot put U at position 2? 

Therefore, in ""UMBLE""? If it were a word, U(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5)? That would be okay? But ""UMBLE"" is not a common word? 

Another possibility: ""CURLE"" not a word? 

Now, pattern: _ _ L U E (if L at position 3 and U at position 4): 
Example: ""CLUES""? But has C? and S? Eliminated? 
""FLUE"" is 4 letters? So add a letter: ""CLUED""? Ends with D? 
Alternatively, ""GLUED""? Ends with D? 
""PLUED"" not a word? 
How about ""VALUE""? Again, A? 
""OILED""? Ends with D? 

Now, pattern: _ _ U L E (if U at position 3 and L at position 4): 
Example: ""FOULE""? Not English? 
""SOULE""? Has S? Eliminated? 
""BOULE"": B O U L E -> that's a valid word? 
Letters: B, O, U, L, E? Avoids S,A,T,C,R? Yes? 
Meaning: a shape? 

So, ""BOULE"" is a candidate? 
Pattern: B(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), E(5). 
But also, L is at position 4? Which is possible? 

Also, U is at position 3? 

Another candidate: ""POULE"" - perhaps? But not common? 

Given that ""BOULE"" is more recognized? 

Alternatively, maybe ""GOLEM""? Doesn't end with E? 

Another word: ""WHOLE"" only has W,H,O,L,E? No U?

Another word: ""UNPLE"" not a word? 

Wait, what about ""UNLIE""? That's not common? 

I propose ""BOULE"". 

But note: In ""BOULE"", 
- Position 1: B? 
- Position 2: O? 
- Position 3: U? 
- Position 4: L? 
- Position 5: E? 

Now, we know:
- In secret word, L must be at position 3 or 4? And U must be at position 1, 3 or 4? But here in ""BOULE"", U is at position 3? L at position 4? 

So it fits the constraints? 

Let's see: 
We eliminate C, R, S, A, T? So B, O are new?

So, here we go: Guess ""BOULE""

To confirm:

Now, note: if the L is at position 3? Then we would have to adjust? But in BOULE, L is at position 4? 

But we'll get feedback:
