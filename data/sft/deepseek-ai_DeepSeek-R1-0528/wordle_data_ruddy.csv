We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

We know R must be in the word, so let's try to put R in a different position. Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is already tried and wrong).

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should also avoid repeating the same letters to get more information.

Let's think of a word that has R and doesn't have C, A, N, E.

Some options:
- Words with R in position 1: ""ROTLS"" (not a word), ""ROAST"" (but A is not allowed, and we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.
- We need a valid 5-letter word without C, A, N, E.

Let me list some words:
- ""ROBOT"" -> but has O twice? Actually, that's allowed but we might get less information. Also, we don't know about O and B and T.
- ""ROWDY"" -> R at position 1, and avoids the forbidden letters.

But let's check if ""ROWDY"" is valid? Yes.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but it has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn't have any of those.

But in ""SPORT"", R is at position 4. That might be a good position to try.

Alternatively, we can try ""TRIES"" but it has E which is not allowed. So avoid E.

We must avoid E as well.

So, let's think of words without C, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> R is at position 4.
- ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> but D is repeated? Actually, it's two D's? ""DRUID"" has D at 1 and 5, and R at 2. But we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? Actually, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. So in ""DRUID"", R is at position 2 again? That would be the same position, so we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again because we already know it's not there. So ""DRUID"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2 again.

We should avoid position 2 for R.

So, for the next guess, we can put R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to find words with R in one of these positions and without C, A, N, E.

Options:
- R at 1: ""ROBOT"", ""ROWDY"", ""ROTIS"" (not a word), ""ROBES"" (but has E) -> avoid E. So ""ROWDY"" is good? R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters? Yes, and no forbidden letters.

- R at 3: ""BORED"" (has E) -> avoid, ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y. That's good. Or ""HORDE"" (has E) -> avoid. So ""FORTY"" is a good option? But we don't know about F, O, T, Y.

- R at 4: ""SPORT"" as above, or ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y) -> but we already have ""ROWDY"" which is similar.

- R at 5: ""LATER"" (has A and E) -> avoid, ""RUMOR"" (has U, M, O, R; but R at the end? Actually, R is at position 5 and 2? But we are putting R at 5, and we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be repeated? The feedback didn't show two R's, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the first guess we only had one R and it was marked as present, so if the word had two R's, we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each occurrence. But if the secret word has one R and we guess one R, we get one mark. If we guess two R's and the word has one, then one R might be marked as present (if one is in the right position or not) and the other as absent? But in this case, we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it was marked as present, so the word has at least one R. It might have more? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid repeating R in the same guess? But we don't have to, but it might be inefficient. Since we are trying to get maximum information, we should use distinct letters if possible.

So, for the next guess, we want to use as many new letters as possible and avoid the known absent letters (C, A, N, E) and avoid putting R in position 2.

Let me choose between ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"".

""ROWDY"": R at 1, and letters: R, O, W, D, Y. All new and distinct.
""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> R at 4, and letters: S, P, O, R, T. Also distinct and new.
""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> distinct and new.

Any of these would be good. But note that O is in both ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"". We don't know about O yet.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R is in a new position (position 4). Also, S and T are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""ROWDY"" to put R at the beginning.

But let's see: we know R is in the word, so by putting it in a new position we can figure out where it belongs.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it covers more common consonants.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

But let's write it: S P O R T

We hope to get feedback on S, P, O, R, T.

If we get a ✓ on R at position 4, then we know R is at position 4. Otherwise, if we get a '-' then R is in the word but not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5. But we are trying position 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""SPORT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include R (since it's in the word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- Avoid the letters C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, P).
- ""SPORT"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and repeats no letters.

But if the secret word has one R and we guess one R, we get one mark. If we guess two R's and the word has one, then one R might be marked as present (if one is in the right position or not) and the other as absent? But in this case, we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it was marked as present, so the word has at least one R. It might have more? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid repeating R in the same guess? But we don't have to, but it might be inefficient. Since we are trying to get maximum information, we should use distinct letters if possible.

So, for the next guess, we want to use as many new letters as possible and avoid the known absent letters (C, A, N, E) and avoid putting R in position 2.

Let me choose between ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"".

""ROWDY"": R at 1, and letters: R, O, W, D, Y. All new and distinct.
""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> R at 4, and letters: S, P, O, R, T. Also distinct and new.
""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> distinct and new.

Any of these would be good. But note that O is in both ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"". We don't know about O yet.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R is in a new position (position 4). Also, S and T are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""ROWDY"" to put R at the beginning.

But let's see: we know R is in the word, so by putting it in a new position we can figure out where it belongs.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it covers more common consonants.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

But let's write it: S P O R T

We hope to get feedback on S, P, O, R, T.

If we get a ✓ on R at position 4, then we know R is at position 4. Otherwise, if we get a '-' then R is in the word but not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5. But we are trying position 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include R (since it's in the word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- Avoid the letters C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, P).
- ""SPORT"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and repeats no letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This tells us:
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: sport -> S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
This tells us:
  - R is still in the word but not in position 4 (since we got a '-' for R in position 4).
  - S, P, O, T are not in the word.

So, overall we know:
- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 or 4.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.
- Therefore, the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding these absent ones.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R is present).

We also know R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 and 4 are tried and not correct).

Now, for our next guess:
- We must include R in either position 1, 3, or 5.
- We must avoid using C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.
- We should use other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we can try a word with R in position 1, for example.

Possible letters: Let's list common ones: L, I, B, D, H, M, etc.

We can try to form a word with R at the start and then use other common remaining letters.

Possible words:
- ""RULER"": but U, L, E, R -> but E is invalid (we know E is absent), so no.
- ""RIDER"": R, I, D, E, R -> E is invalid? Also, R repeated? And we don't know if R is repeated? But we know E is out, so skip.
- ""RIVAL"": R, I, V, A, L -> but A is invalid (absent).

We need words without the forbidden letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T.

So, available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and R but we are including it).

Let me think of common patterns:

- ""BRICK"": but B,R,I,C,K -> but C is invalid? So no.
- ""FRUIT"": F,R,U,I,T -> T is absent, so invalid? T was tried in ""sport"" and was x, so T is absent, so avoid T? Yes.

Alternative: How about ""DRAWL"": D,R,A,W,L -> A is absent? No.

We must avoid A and T.

Another idea: ""GRIMY"": G,R,I,M,Y -> letters: G, R, I, M, Y. None are forbidden? Check: G is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. So G is okay? Yes. Similarly, I, M, Y are okay? Yes.

And R is in position 2? But we need to know that R cannot be in position 2? We tried R in position 2 and 4 and got '-' both times, meaning R is in the word but not in pos 2 or 4. So if we put R in position 2, we'll get a '-' again? But that doesn't help? Actually, we want to put R in a position we think it might be, so position 1, 3, or 5.

In ""GRIMY"", R is in position 2? We don't want that because we already know it's not there.

We need a word with R in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try R in position 1: 
- ""ROWDY"": but O and W? O is forbidden? In guess 2 ""sport"", O was marked x, so O is absent. So ""ROWDY"" has O, which is invalid? Avoid O.

R at 1: alternatives: ""RIVET"" -> V,E,T: E and T are absent? Invalid.
""RUM"" is 3 letters? We need 5.

""ROUGH"": O and U? O is forbidden? Yes.

""LIGHT"": no R? We need R in the word.

Perhaps R at position 3:
- ??R??
For example, ""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y -> O is absent? Invalid.

""FERRY"": E and R repeated? E is absent? Invalid.

""BERRY"": E? Absent? Invalid.

""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? Invalid.

""DIRGE"": D,I,R,G,E -> E is absent? Invalid.

""FOUND"": no R? We have to include R.

Perhaps R at position 5:
- ????R
For example: ""WATER"": W,A,T,E,R -> A,T,E: all absent? Invalid.
""LIVER"": L,I,V,E,R -> E absent? Invalid.

Alternatively, less common letters? How about ""QUIRK"": Q,U,I,R,K -> letters Q,U,I,K? Avoid? But they are not forbidden? We haven't tried.
Q,U,I,R,K. R in position 4? But we know position 4 is not correct? Already tried? Wait, we tried position 4 in ""sport"" and got '-' meaning R is present but not at position 4. So if we put R in position 4 again, we will get another '-' and it won't tell us anything new? So we should put R in a different position: 1,3, or 5.

In ""QUIRK"", R is in position 4? Same as before? We should avoid position 4? We need to test positions 1,3,5.

Another word: ""QUICK"": but C is absent? Invalid.

""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E absent? Invalid.

""BUILD"": no R? We need R.

Perhaps ""GIRLY"": G,I,R,L,Y -> R is at position 3? Yes. That seems good: G,I,R,L,Y? Does it exist? ""GIRLY"" is a word? Meaning like girly? Actually, yes, it's an adjective meaning girl-like.

Letters: G,I,R,L,Y. All are not in the forbidden list? 
- G: not forbidden? Yes.
- I: not forbidden? Yes.
- R: we know it's there, so including it is necessary? And it's at position 3, which we haven't tested.
- L: not forbidden? Yes.
- Y: not forbidden? Yes.

And we avoid O,S,P, etc.

So ""GIRLY"" seems valid: R at position 3.

Other options? ""MIRTH"": M,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? From feedback of ""sport"", T is absent? So T cannot be in the word? Therefore, ""MIRTH"" has T? Invalid.

""BIRTH"": similarly invalid? Has T.

""LIRKS""? Not a common word? ""LIRK"" is not common? So stick with ""GIRLY"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. Also, we know R must be in the word, and we are testing position 3.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 5: ""ABHOR"" has A,O? Absent? Invalid.

Therefore, ""GIRLY"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we need to pick a word that maximizes information? Since we have many unknowns.

Another candidate: ""BUYER"" -> E absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"": U,M,O,R -> O present? Wait, O is absent? In the second guess, O was marked x, so O is absent? So ""RUMOR"" has O? Invalid.

""DRUID"": D,R,U,I,D -> D? And R? But R is at position 2? We know position 2 is wrong? So we avoid? Also, D repeated? But we can use? But R in position 2 again? That would be ineffective? Because we know it's not at position 2.

So, we avoid placing R at position 2.

Therefore, ""GIRLY"" with R at position 3 seems good? But what about the meaning? It's valid.

Can we try ""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K -> C is absent? Invalid? Because we know C is absent from first guess? Yes.

Another word: ""GRIMY"" but we cannot put R at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""BRUSH"": B,R,U,S,H -> S is absent? Invalid.

So, overall, I think ""GIRLY"" is a good guess? Let me confirm: G, I, R, L, Y? All letters not forbidden? Yes? Absent letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G, I, R, L, Y are all not in that list.

Therefore, we can try ""GIRLY"".

But note: we haven't tested G, I, L, Y? So we will get information on these? Yes.

So, I'll go with ""GIRLY"" as the third guess.

In summary, we place R in position 3 to test that location, and use new letters.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""sport""): R is in the word but not in position 4. S, P, O, T are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- R must be in the secret word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these.
- The secret word consists of letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, with R being confirmed present.

For the next guess:
- Must include R in one of the untested positions (1, 3, or 5) to help locate it.
- Avoid all absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T).
- Use new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information gain.
- ""GIRLY"" is selected because:
  - Places R in position 3 (a previously untested position).
  - Uses new letters G, I, L, Y (all from the valid set and common).
  - Forms a valid English word (meaning ""characteristic of a girl"").
  - Avoids repeating letters and previously dismissed letters.

<guess>girly</guess>",girly,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

- R: we know it's there, so including it is necessary? And it's at position 3, which we haven't tested.
- L: not forbidden? Yes.
- Y: not forbidden? Yes.

And we avoid O,S,P, etc.

So ""GIRLY"" seems valid: R at position 3.

Other options? ""MIRTH"": M,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? From feedback of ""sport"", T is absent? So T cannot be in the word? Therefore, ""MIRTH"" has T? Invalid.

""BIRTH"": similarly invalid? Has T.

""LIRKS""? Not a common word? ""LIRK"" is not common? So stick with ""GIRLY"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. Also, we know R must be in the word, and we are testing position 3.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 5: ""ABHOR"" has A,O? Absent? Invalid.

Therefore, ""GIRLY"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we need to pick a word that maximizes information? Since we have many unknowns.

Another candidate: ""BUYER"" -> E absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"": U,M,O,R -> O present? Wait, O is absent? In the second guess, O was marked x, so O is absent? So ""RUMOR"" has O? Invalid.

""DRUID"": D,R,U,I,D -> D? And R? But R is at position 2? We know position 2 is wrong? So we avoid? Also, D repeated? But we can use? But R in position 2 again? That would be ineffective? Because we know it's not at position 2.

So, we avoid placing R at position 2.

Therefore, ""GIRLY"" with R at position 3 seems good? But what about the meaning? It's valid.

Can we try ""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K -> C is absent? Invalid? Because we know C is absent from first guess? Yes.

Another word: ""GRIMY"" but we cannot put R at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""BRUSH"": B,R,U,S,H -> S is absent? Invalid.

So, overall, I think ""GIRLY"" is a good guess? Let me confirm: G, I, R, L, Y? All letters not forbidden? Yes? Absent letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G, I, R, L, Y are all not in that list.

Therefore, we can try ""GIRLY"".

But note: we haven't tested G, I, L, Y? So we will get information on these? Yes.

So, I'll go with ""GIRLY"" as the third guess.

In summary, we place R in position 3 to test that location, and use new letters.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""sport""): R is in the word but not in position 4. S, P, O, T are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- R must be in the secret word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these.
- The secret word consists of letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, with R being confirmed present.

For the next guess:
- Must include R in one of the untested positions (1, 3, or 5) to help locate it.
- Avoid all absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T).
- Use new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information gain.
- ""GIRLY"" is selected because:
  - Places R in position 3 (a previously untested position).
  - Uses new letters G, I, L, Y (all from the valid set and common).
  - Forms a valid English word (meaning ""characteristic of a girl"").
  - Avoids repeating letters and previously dismissed letters.",Guess 3: girly -> FEEDBACK: G(x) I(x) R(-) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ruddy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

We know R must be in the word, so let's try to put R in a different position. Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is already tried and wrong).

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should also avoid repeating the same letters to get more information.

Let's think of a word that has R and doesn't have C, A, N, E.

Some options:
- Words with R in position 1: ""ROTLS"" (not a word), ""ROAST"" (but A is not allowed, and we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.
- We need a valid 5-letter word without C, A, N, E.

Let me list some words:
- ""ROBOT"" -> but has O twice? Actually, that's allowed but we might get less information. Also, we don't know about O and B and T.
- ""ROWDY"" -> R at position 1, and avoids the forbidden letters.

But let's check if ""ROWDY"" is valid? Yes.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but it has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn't have any of those.

But in ""SPORT"", R is at position 4. That might be a good position to try.

Alternatively, we can try ""TRIES"" but it has E which is not allowed. So avoid E.

We must avoid E as well.

So, let's think of words without C, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> R is at position 4.
- ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> but D is repeated? Actually, it's two D's? ""DRUID"" has D at 1 and 5, and R at 2. But we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? Actually, in the first guess R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. So in ""DRUID"", R is at position 2 again? That would be the same position, so we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again because we already know it's not there. So ""DRUID"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2 again.

We should avoid position 2 for R.

So, for the next guess, we can put R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to find words with R in one of these positions and without C, A, N, E.

Options:
- R at 1: ""ROBOT"", ""ROWDY"", ""ROTIS"" (not a word), ""ROBES"" (but has E) -> avoid E. So ""ROWDY"" is good? R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters? Yes, and no forbidden letters.

- R at 3: ""BORED"" (has E) -> avoid, ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y. That's good. Or ""HORDE"" (has E) -> avoid. So ""FORTY"" is a good option? But we don't know about F, O, T, Y.

- R at 4: ""SPORT"" as above, or ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y) -> but we already have ""ROWDY"" which is similar.

- R at 5: ""LATER"" (has A and E) -> avoid, ""RUMOR"" (has U, M, O, R; but R at the end? Actually, R is at position 5 and 2? But we are putting R at 5, and we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be repeated? The feedback didn't show two R's, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the first guess we only had one R and it was marked as present, so if the word had two R's, we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each occurrence. But if the secret word has one R and we guess one R, we get one mark. If we guess two R's and the word has one, then one R might be marked as present (if one is in the right position or not) and the other as absent? But in this case, we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it was marked as present, so the word has at least one R. It might have more? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid repeating R in the same guess? But we don't have to, but it might be inefficient. Since we are trying to get maximum information, we should use distinct letters if possible.

So, for the next guess, we want to use as many new letters as possible and avoid the known absent letters (C, A, N, E) and avoid putting R in position 2.

Let me choose between ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"".

""ROWDY"": R at 1, and letters: R, O, W, D, Y. All new and distinct.
""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> R at 4, and letters: S, P, O, R, T. Also distinct and new.
""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> distinct and new.

Any of these would be good. But note that O is in both ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"". We don't know about O yet.

I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R is in a new position (position 4). Also, S and T are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""ROWDY"" to put R at the beginning.

But let's see: we know R is in the word, so by putting it in a new position we can figure out where it belongs.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it covers more common consonants.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

But let's write it: S P O R T

We hope to get feedback on S, P, O, R, T.

If we get a ✓ on R at position 4, then we know R is at position 4. Otherwise, if we get a '-' then R is in the word but not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5. But we are trying position 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include R (since it's in the word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- Avoid the letters C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, P).
- ""SPORT"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and repeats no letters.

<guess>sport</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This tells us:
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: sport -> S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
This tells us:
  - R is still in the word but not in position 4 (since we got a '-' for R in position 4).
  - S, P, O, T are not in the word.

So, overall we know:
- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 or 4.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.
- Therefore, the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding these absent ones.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R is present).

We also know R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 and 4 are tried and not correct).

Now, for our next guess:
- We must include R in either position 1, 3, or 5.
- We must avoid using C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.
- We should use other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we can try a word with R in position 1, for example.

Possible letters: Let's list common ones: L, I, B, D, H, M, etc.

We can try to form a word with R at the start and then use other common remaining letters.

Possible words:
- ""RULER"": but U, L, E, R -> but E is invalid (we know E is absent), so no.
- ""RIDER"": R, I, D, E, R -> E is invalid? Also, R repeated? And we don't know if R is repeated? But we know E is out, so skip.
- ""RIVAL"": R, I, V, A, L -> but A is invalid (absent).

We need words without the forbidden letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T.

So, available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and R but we are including it).

Let me think of common patterns:

- ""BRICK"": but B,R,I,C,K -> but C is invalid? So no.
- ""FRUIT"": F,R,U,I,T -> T is absent, so invalid? T was tried in ""sport"" and was x, so T is absent, so avoid T? Yes.

Alternative: How about ""DRAWL"": D,R,A,W,L -> A is absent? No.

We must avoid A and T.

Another idea: ""GRIMY"": G,R,I,M,Y -> letters: G, R, I, M, Y. None are forbidden? Check: G is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. So G is okay? Yes. Similarly, I, M, Y are okay? Yes.

And R is in position 2? But we need to know that R cannot be in position 2? We tried R in position 2 and 4 and got '-' both times, meaning R is in the word but not in pos 2 or 4. So if we put R in position 2, we'll get a '-' again? But that doesn't help? Actually, we want to put R in a position we think it might be, so position 1, 3, or 5.

In ""GRIMY"", R is in position 2? We don't want that because we already know it's not there.

We need a word with R in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try R in position 1: 
- ""ROWDY"": but O and W? O is forbidden? In guess 2 ""sport"", O was marked x, so O is absent. So ""ROWDY"" has O, which is invalid? Avoid O.

R at 1: alternatives: ""RIVET"" -> V,E,T: E and T are absent? Invalid.
""RUM"" is 3 letters? We need 5.

""ROUGH"": O and U? O is forbidden? Yes.

""LIGHT"": no R? We need R in the word.

Perhaps R at position 3:
- ??R??
For example, ""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y -> O is absent? Invalid.

""FERRY"": E and R repeated? E is absent? Invalid.

""BERRY"": E? Absent? Invalid.

""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? Invalid.

""DIRGE"": D,I,R,G,E -> E is absent? Invalid.

""FOUND"": no R? We have to include R.

Perhaps R at position 5:
- ????R
For example: ""WATER"": W,A,T,E,R -> A,T,E: all absent? Invalid.
""LIVER"": L,I,V,E,R -> E absent? Invalid.

Alternatively, less common letters? How about ""QUIRK"": Q,U,I,R,K -> letters Q,U,I,K? Avoid? But they are not forbidden? We haven't tried.
Q,U,I,R,K. R in position 4? But we know position 4 is not correct? Already tried? Wait, we tried position 4 in ""sport"" and got '-' meaning R is present but not at position 4. So if we put R in position 4 again, we will get another '-' and it won't tell us anything new? So we should put R in a different position: 1,3, or 5.

In ""QUIRK"", R is in position 4? Same as before? We should avoid position 4? We need to test positions 1,3,5.

Another word: ""QUICK"": but C is absent? Invalid.

""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E absent? Invalid.

""BUILD"": no R? We need R.

Perhaps ""GIRLY"": G,I,R,L,Y -> R is at position 3? Yes. That seems good: G,I,R,L,Y? Does it exist? ""GIRLY"" is a word? Meaning like girly? Actually, yes, it's an adjective meaning girl-like.

Letters: G,I,R,L,Y. All are not in the forbidden list? 
- G: not forbidden? Yes.
- I: not forbidden? Yes.
- R: we know it's there, so including it is necessary? And it's at position 3, which we haven't tested.
- L: not forbidden? Yes.
- Y: not forbidden? Yes.

And we avoid O,S,P, etc.

So ""GIRLY"" seems valid: R at position 3.

Other options? ""MIRTH"": M,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? From feedback of ""sport"", T is absent? So T cannot be in the word? Therefore, ""MIRTH"" has T? Invalid.

""BIRTH"": similarly invalid? Has T.

""LIRKS""? Not a common word? ""LIRK"" is not common? So stick with ""GIRLY"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. Also, we know R must be in the word, and we are testing position 3.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 5: ""ABHOR"" has A,O? Absent? Invalid.

Therefore, ""GIRLY"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we need to pick a word that maximizes information? Since we have many unknowns.

Another candidate: ""BUYER"" -> E absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"": U,M,O,R -> O present? Wait, O is absent? In the second guess, O was marked x, so O is absent? So ""RUMOR"" has O? Invalid.

""DRUID"": D,R,U,I,D -> D? And R? But R is at position 2? We know position 2 is wrong? So we avoid? Also, D repeated? But we can use? But R in position 2 again? That would be ineffective? Because we know it's not at position 2.

So, we avoid placing R at position 2.

Therefore, ""GIRLY"" with R at position 3 seems good? But what about the meaning? It's valid.

Can we try ""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K -> C is absent? Invalid? Because we know C is absent from first guess? Yes.

Another word: ""GRIMY"" but we cannot put R at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""BRUSH"": B,R,U,S,H -> S is absent? Invalid.

So, overall, I think ""GIRLY"" is a good guess? Let me confirm: G, I, R, L, Y? All letters not forbidden? Yes? Absent letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G, I, R, L, Y are all not in that list.

Therefore, we can try ""GIRLY"".

But note: we haven't tested G, I, L, Y? So we will get information on these? Yes.

So, I'll go with ""GIRLY"" as the third guess.

In summary, we place R in position 3 to test that location, and use new letters.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""sport""): R is in the word but not in position 4. S, P, O, T are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- R must be in the secret word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these.
- The secret word consists of letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, with R being confirmed present.

So ""DRUID"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2 again.\n\nWe should avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we can put R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to find words with R in one of these positions and without C, A, N, E.\n\nOptions:\n- R at 1: ""ROBOT"", ""ROWDY"", ""ROTIS"" (not a word), ""ROBES"" (but has E) -> avoid E. So ""ROWDY"" is good? R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters? Yes, and no forbidden letters.\n\n- R at 3: ""BORED"" (has E) -> avoid, ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y. That\'s good. Or ""HORDE"" (has E) -> avoid. So ""FORTY"" is a good option? But we don\'t know about F, O, T, Y.\n\n- R at 4: ""SPORT"" as above, or ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y) -> but we already have ""ROWDY"" which is similar.\n\n- R at 5: ""LATER"" (has A and E) -> avoid, ""RUMOR"" (has U, M, O, R; but R at the end? Actually, R is at position 5 and 2? But we are putting R at 5, and we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be repeated? The feedback didn\'t show two R\'s, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the first guess we only had one R and it was marked as present, so if the word had two R\'s, we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each occurrence. But if the secret word has one R and we guess one R, we get one mark. If we guess two R\'s and the word has one, then one R might be marked as present (if one is in the right position or not) and the other as absent? But in this case, we don\'t know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it was marked as present, so the word has at least one R. It might have more? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should avoid repeating R in the same guess? But we don\'t have to, but it might be inefficient. Since we are trying to get maximum information, we should use distinct letters if possible.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we want to use as many new letters as possible and avoid the known absent letters (C, A, N, E) and avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nLet me choose between ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"".\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 1, and letters: R, O, W, D, Y. All new and distinct.\n""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> R at 4, and letters: S, P, O, R, T. Also distinct and new.\n""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> distinct and new.\n\nAny of these would be good. But note that O is in both ""ROWDY"" and ""SPORT"" and ""FORTY"". We don\'t know about O yet.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R is in a new position (position 4). Also, S and T are very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""ROWDY"" to put R at the beginning.\n\nBut let\'s see: we know R is in the word, so by putting it in a new position we can figure out where it belongs.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPORT"" because it covers more common consonants.\n\nSo, second guess: ""SPORT""\n\nBut let\'s write it: S P O R T\n\nWe hope to get feedback on S, P, O, R, T.\n\nIf we get a ✓ on R at position 4, then we know R is at position 4. Otherwise, if we get a \'-\' then R is in the word but not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5. But we are trying position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\nI think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with -).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R (since it\'s in the word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.\n- Avoid the letters C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, P).\n- ""SPORT"" is chosen because:\n  - It places R in position 4 (a new position to test).\n  - It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and repeats no letters.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nThis tells us:\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: sport -> S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nThis tells us:\n  - R is still in the word but not in position 4 (since we got a \'-\' for R in position 4).\n  - S, P, O, T are not in the word.\n\nSo, overall we know:\n- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 or 4.\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.\n- Therefore, the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding these absent ones.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R is present).\n\nWe also know R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 and 4 are tried and not correct).\n\nNow, for our next guess:\n- We must include R in either position 1, 3, or 5.\n- We must avoid using C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.\n- We should use other common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can try a word with R in position 1, for example.\n\nPossible letters: Let\'s list common ones: L, I, B, D, H, M, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word with R at the start and then use other common remaining letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""RULER"": but U, L, E, R -> but E is invalid (we know E is absent), so no.\n- ""RIDER"": R, I, D, E, R -> E is invalid? Also, R repeated? And we don\'t know if R is repeated? But we know E is out, so skip.\n- ""RIVAL"": R, I, V, A, L -> but A is invalid (absent).\n\nWe need words without the forbidden letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T.\n\nSo, available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and R but we are including it).\n\nLet me think of common patterns:\n\n- ""BRICK"": but B,R,I,C,K -> but C is invalid? So no.\n- ""FRUIT"": F,R,U,I,T -> T is absent, so invalid? T was tried in ""sport"" and was x, so T is absent, so avoid T? Yes.\n\nAlternative: How about ""DRAWL"": D,R,A,W,L -> A is absent? No.\n\nWe must avoid A and T.\n\nAnother idea: ""GRIMY"": G,R,I,M,Y -> letters: G, R, I, M, Y. None are forbidden? Check: G is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. So G is okay? Yes. Similarly, I, M, Y are okay? Yes.\n\nAnd R is in position 2? But we need to know that R cannot be in position 2? We tried R in position 2 and 4 and got \'-\' both times, meaning R is in the word but not in pos 2 or 4. So if we put R in position 2, we\'ll get a \'-\' again? But that doesn\'t help? Actually, we want to put R in a position we think it might be, so position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nIn ""GRIMY"", R is in position 2? We don\'t want that because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nWe need a word with R in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nLet me try R in position 1: \n- ""ROWDY"": but O and W? O is forbidden? In guess 2 ""sport"", O was marked x, so O is absent. So ""ROWDY"" has O, which is invalid? Avoid O.\n\nR at 1: alternatives: ""RIVET"" -> V,E,T: E and T are absent? Invalid.\n""RUM"" is 3 letters? We need 5.\n\n""ROUGH"": O and U? O is forbidden? Yes.\n\n""LIGHT"": no R? We need R in the word.\n\nPerhaps R at position 3:\n- ??R??\nFor example, ""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y -> O is absent? Invalid.\n\n""FERRY"": E and R repeated? E is absent? Invalid.\n\n""BERRY"": E? Absent? Invalid.\n\n""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? Invalid.\n\n""DIRGE"": D,I,R,G,E -> E is absent? Invalid.\n\n""FOUND"": no R? We have to include R.\n\nPerhaps R at position 5:\n- ????R\nFor example: ""WATER"": W,A,T,E,R -> A,T,E: all absent? Invalid.\n""LIVER"": L,I,V,E,R -> E absent? Invalid.\n\nAlternatively, less common letters? How about ""QUIRK"": Q,U,I,R,K -> letters Q,U,I,K? Avoid? But they are not forbidden? We haven\'t tried.\nQ,U,I,R,K. R in position 4? But we know position 4 is not correct? Already tried? Wait, we tried position 4 in ""sport"" and got \'-\' meaning R is present but not at position 4. So if we put R in position 4 again, we will get another \'-\' and it won\'t tell us anything new? So we should put R in a different position: 1,3, or 5.\n\nIn ""QUIRK"", R is in position 4? Same as before? We should avoid position 4? We need to test positions 1,3,5.\n\nAnother word: ""QUICK"": but C is absent? Invalid.\n\n""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E absent? Invalid.\n\n""BUILD"": no R? We need R.\n\nPerhaps ""GIRLY"": G,I,R,L,Y -> R is at position 3? Yes. That seems good: G,I,R,L,Y? Does it exist? ""GIRLY"" is a word? Meaning like girly? Actually, yes, it\'s an adjective meaning girl-like.\n\nLetters: G,I,R,L,Y. All are not in the forbidden list? \n- G: not forbidden? Yes.\n- I: not forbidden? Yes.\n- R: we know it\'s there, so including it is necessary? And it\'s at position 3, which we haven\'t tested.\n- L: not forbidden? Yes.\n- Y: not forbidden? Yes.\n\nAnd we avoid O,S,P, etc.\n\nSo ""GIRLY"" seems valid: R at position 3.\n\nOther options? ""MIRTH"": M,I,R,T,H -> T is absent? From feedback of ""sport"", T is absent? So T cannot be in the word? Therefore, ""MIRTH"" has T? Invalid.\n\n""BIRTH"": similarly invalid? Has T.\n\n""LIRKS""? Not a common word? ""LIRK"" is not common? So stick with ""GIRLY"".\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. Also, we know R must be in the word, and we are testing position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can try R in position 5: ""ABHOR"" has A,O? Absent? Invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""GIRLY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we need to pick a word that maximizes information? Since we have many unknowns.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BUYER"" -> E absent? Invalid.\n\n""RUMOR"": U,M,O,R -> O present? Wait, O is absent? In the second guess, O was marked x, so O is absent? So ""RUMOR"" has O? Invalid.\n\n""DRUID"": D,R,U,I,D -> D? And R? But R is at position 2? We know position 2 is wrong? So we avoid? Also, D repeated? But we can use? But R in position 2 again? That would be ineffective? Because we know it\'s not at position 2.\n\nSo, we avoid placing R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""GIRLY"" with R at position 3 seems good? But what about the meaning? It\'s valid.\n\nCan we try ""FLICK""? F,L,I,C,K -> C is absent? Invalid? Because we know C is absent from first guess? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""GRIMY"" but we cannot put R at position 2? Same issue.\n\nHow about ""BRUSH"": B,R,U,S,H -> S is absent? Invalid.\n\nSo, overall, I think ""GIRLY"" is a good guess? Let me confirm: G, I, R, L, Y? All letters not forbidden? Yes? Absent letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G, I, R, L, Y are all not in that list.\n\nTherefore, we can try ""GIRLY"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested G, I, L, Y? So we will get information on these? Yes.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""GIRLY"" as the third guess.\n\nIn summary, we place R in position 3 to test that location, and use new letters.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- Guess 2 (""sport""): R is in the word but not in position 4. S, P, O, T are not in the word.\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- R must be in the secret word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 5).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these.\n- The secret word consists of letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, with R being confirmed present.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R in one of the untested positions (1, 3, or 5) to help locate it.\n- Avoid all absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T).\n- Use new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information gain.\n- ""GIRLY"" is selected because:\n  - Places R in position 3 (a previously untested position).\n  - Uses new letters G, I, L, Y (all from the valid set and common).\n  - Forms a valid English word (meaning ""characteristic of a girl"").\n  - Avoids repeating letters and previously dismissed letters.\n\n<guess>girly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: girly -> FEEDBACK: G(x) I(x) R(-) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""girly"":
G: x (not in the word)
I: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
L: x (not in the word)
Y: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in the 5th position (since in ""girly"" it was at position 5 and got a check).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew it's not in 2 or 4, so now not in 3 either).
- G, I, L are not in the word.

Now, we know:
- The secret word has Y in the 5th position.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, it must be in position 1 (since position 5 is taken by Y, so R cannot be at 5? Wait, position 5 is Y, so R must be at position 1? Because positions 2,3,4 are ruled out and 5 is taken by Y? But the word has 5 positions, so R must be at position 1? Because we have tried positions 2,3,4 and they were wrong, and position 5 is now known to be Y, so R must be at position 1? Yes.

Therefore, we can deduce that R is at position 1.

But let's confirm: the feedback for R in ""girly"" was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. We already knew it wasn't at 2 or 4. And now position 5 is Y, so the only position left is 1. So R must be at position 1.

Additionally, we have new absent letters: G, I, L.

So, total absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, G, I, L.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must start with R (position 1) and end with Y (position 5).
- Must not contain: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, G, I, L.

So, the middle three letters (positions 2,3,4) must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Now, we have 3 letters to determine: positions 2,3,4.

We have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 more? But we might solve it in this guess.

We can try to guess a word that fits: R _ _ _ Y

And the middle letters from the available set.

Common letters left: B, D, F, H, K, M, U, W, etc.

Possible words:
- RUBBY? Not a word? Or Ruby? But Ruby is 4 letters? We need 5.
- RUDDY: R, U, D, D, Y -> but D repeated? And it's a word? Yes, meaning reddish. But we have to check if the letters are allowed? U and D are in the available set? Yes. But we don't know about D and U? And we have two D's? But that's okay? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? But we haven't seen any yet? But it's possible.

But we need to get information? We have three positions to figure out? So we might want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we are close, we might solve it.

Alternatively, we can list possible words that fit the pattern.

Possible words: R _ _ _ Y

With the middle three letters from B,D,F,H,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common words:
- RUMBY? Not a word.
- RUPEE? But E is absent? Invalid.
- RUDDY: R, U, D, D, Y -> valid? Yes. But D repeated? So we get less information? But if it's the word, we solve it? But we don't know.
- RUSTY: but S and T are absent? Invalid.
- RICEY: I and E absent? Invalid.
- RABBY? Not a word? Or RABBI? But that has A? Absent? Invalid.
- ROCKY: O absent? Invalid.
- RALLY: L absent? Invalid.
- RILLY? Not a word? Or RILLY is not standard? Rilly is not common? Usually ""really"" but that's 6 letters? So no.

Another word: ""RUMBA"" but A absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning reddish or ruddy complexion.

But we have to consider: we have two D's? But we don't know if D is in the word? So we can try.

But we might want to use a word with all new letters? But we have limited letters left? And we have to include R and Y? But we know R and Y are fixed? So we are only guessing the middle three.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

""RUGBY"": R, U, G, B, Y -> but G is absent? From the third guess, G was marked x? So G is absent? Therefore, ""RUGBY"" has G? Invalid.

""RICEY"": invalid.

""RIPEY"": I and E absent? Invalid.

""RIDGY"": I and G absent? Invalid.

""RANDY"": A and N absent? Invalid.

""ROWTH""? Not a word? Or ""wroth""? But that starts with W? Not R.

""ROWDY"": O absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" seems one of the few options? But let's see if there are others.

""RUSHY"": S and H? S is absent? Invalid.

""RUTHY""? Not a word? Or ""ruth"" is 4 letters.

""REFER"": E absent? Invalid.

""REEDY"": E absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we have to check: in the available letters, D and U are allowed? Yes.

But we have two D's? So if we guess ""RUDDY"", and if it's not the word, we might not get much information? Because if the word has one D, then we might get a '-' for one D and an 'x' for the other? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word with three distinct new letters? But we have to form a word.

For example: R with B, D, F? But what word? ""RUBIFY""? Too long? 6 letters? No.

""RABID"": A absent? Invalid.

""RADII"": A absent? Invalid.

""RACKS"": A and C and S absent? Invalid.

""RADAR"": A absent? Invalid.

""RAGED"": A,G,E absent? Invalid.

""RIFLE"": I,F,L,E? F is allowed? But I and L and E are absent? Invalid.

""RIVET"": I,V,E,T? V is allowed? But I,E,T absent? Invalid.

""ROWDY"": O absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" seems the most common? Or ""RUMMY"": R,U,M,M,Y -> M repeated? And U? But M is allowed? And U? But we don't know about M and U? And it's a word? Yes, meaning a card game or a type of fish.

""RUMMY"": R, U, M, M, Y -> R at 1, Y at 5? Yes. And letters: U, M, M? So two M's? But we can try? And it avoids the absent letters? Check: U is not absent? M is not absent? Yes.

So we have two candidates: ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But we need to choose one? We can also consider ""RUBBY"" but not a word? Or ""RUBBLE"" too long? 6 letters.

Another one: ""RUBUS""? Not common? Or ""rubus"" is a genus? Not a common word? Probably not.

""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are both valid.

But we have to think about information? If we guess ""RUDDY"" and it's wrong, we might not know about U and D? But if we get feedback, we can deduce? But we have two D's? So if the word has one D, we get one '-' and one 'x'? But we don't know which position? It might be messy.

Similarly, ""RUMMY"" has two M's? Same issue.

Is there a word with three distinct letters? For example: R, B, D, F, Y? But we need a word? ""R"" + three distinct + ""Y"".

For example: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? ""RUBEY""? Not a word? ""RUBY"" is 4.

""RABBY"" not a word? ""RABBI"" has A? Invalid.

""RADIO"" has A and O? Invalid.

""RADII"" has A? Invalid.

""REFIT"" has E and T? Invalid.

""REMIT"" has E? Invalid.

""RIVET"" has I,E,T? Invalid.

""ROWTH"" not a word? ""WROTH"" is a word? But starts with W? Not R.

""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are the main options? Or ""RUSHY"" but S absent? Invalid.

""RUSKY""? Not common? Or ""rusky"" is not standard? ""RUSKY"" might be a name? Not a common word.

""RUSTY"" invalid? S and T absent.

""RUTTY"": R,U,T,T,Y -> T absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"": O absent? Invalid.

""RUMBA"": A absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"" invalid? O absent.

""RUMEN"": E absent? Invalid.

""RUMPS"": S absent? Invalid.

""RUMPY"": M,P? P absent? Invalid? P is absent? From guess 2, P is absent? Yes.

So ""RUMMY"" is okay? M is not absent? Yes.

Similarly, ""RUDDY"" is okay? D is not absent? Yes.

Another word: ""RUBLE"": E absent? Invalid? ""RUBLE"" is a currency? But E at the end? And we know E is absent? So invalid.

""RUBLE"" has E? Yes, so invalid.

""RUDER"": E absent? Invalid.

""RUDES""? Not a word? And S absent? Invalid.

So, we are left with ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But we also have ""RUBUS""? Not common? Or ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? So not.

""RUBIN""? Not a word? Or ""ruby"" related? Not standard.

""RUBBY"" is not in the dictionary? So probably not.

Therefore, we have to choose between ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But note: we have Y at the end? And R at the start? So both fit.

We can also consider ""RUCKY""? Not a word? Or ""lucky"" with R? Not.

""RUCKS"": S absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" is more common? Or ""RUMMY"" is also common? But we have to pick one.

But we have to think: we have three positions? And we have two words? But we might solve it? Or if not, we get feedback.

But we have two more guesses? We used 3, so 3 left? But we might solve in this one? Or if not, we can use the feedback.

But to maximize information? If we use a word with distinct letters? But we don't have one? So we have to choose one.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBIED""? 6 letters? No.

""RUBIES""? 6 letters? No.

""RUBIFY""? 6 letters? No.

""RUBINE""? Not common? And E? Invalid.

So, I think we have to choose between ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But let's see the letters: for ""RUDDY"", we have U and D? For ""RUMMY"", we have U and M.

We don't know about U, D, M? So both are possible.

But we can also consider ""RUBBY"" but not a word? Or ""RUBBLE"" too long? No.

""RUBLE"" has E? Invalid.

""RUBLE"" same? Invalid.

""RUBUS"" is a genus? But not common? And we are playing Wordle? So common words? Probably.

But ""RUDDY"" is a common word? Yes? Meaning reddish? Or healthy complexion? Yes.

""RUMMY"" is also common? Card game? Yes.

But we have to pick one? Let's pick ""RUDDY"" because it has two D's? But we don't know? Or ""RUMMY"" has two M's? Same.

But we can also think: we have position 2,3,4 to guess? And we have to use three letters? But we don't know which ones.

Another idea: we can use a word that has letters that are common? But we have limited common letters left? D and U are common? M is also common? But we don't know.

But we have to make a guess? I'll go with ""RUDDY"" because it's a word? And we can see.

But let's see the feedback we might get? If we guess ""RUDDY"":
- R at 1: should be ✓ because we know R is at 1? But we haven't confirmed position 1? We deduced it must be at 1? But we haven't tested it? Actually, we haven't placed R at position 1 before? We placed R at position 2 in ""crane"", position 4 in ""sport"", position 3 in ""girly""? So position 1 is untested? But we deduced it must be at 1? Because the only position left? And we know it's in the word? And position 5 is Y? So yes, it must be at 1? So we can assume R at 1 is correct? But we haven't had a ✓ for R? But logically it must be? So in the guess, we can put R at 1 and expect a ✓.

Similarly, Y at 5 is ✓.

Then for U at position 2: if it's in the word, we get feedback? Similarly for D at 3 and D at 4.

But if the word is ""RUDDY"", we get all ✓? But if not, we get feedback.

But we have to consider: what if the word has only one D? Then we might get one D as '-' and one as 'x'? But we don't know which one? So it might be ambiguous? But we can use the next guess? But we have two more? So it's okay? But we might solve it if it's ""RUDDY"".

Similarly for ""RUMMY"".

But let's see if there is a word with distinct letters? For example: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBIN"" not common? ""RUBY"" is the gem? 4 letters.

""RUBIED"" not 5.

""RUBY"" is 4, so not.

""RUBUS"" is 5 letters? And it's a word? In botany? But not common? So probably not the secret word? Wordle uses common words? So we can avoid? But we don't know.

Another word: ""RUDAS""? Not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDES"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDIS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDIST""? Too long? 6 letters? No.

""RUDD"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUDY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUDDY"" is 5? Yes.

Similarly, ""RUMMY"" is 5.

But we also have ""RUMBA"" is 5? But A absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"" O absent? Invalid.

""RUMPY"" P absent? Invalid.

""RUMEN"" E absent? Invalid.

""RUMPS"" S absent? Invalid.

""RUMBO""? Not common? Or ""rumbo"" is a cocktail? But not very common? So probably not.

""RUMOR"" invalid? O absent.

So, I think ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are the main candidates? But we also have ""RUBUS""? Let's not consider it? Or ""RUBES""? Not common? And E and S absent? Invalid.

""RUBES"" has E and S? Both absent? Invalid.

""RUBIES"" 6 letters? No.

So, we have to choose one? Let's choose ""RUDDY"" as it is more common? Or ""RUMMY"" is also common? But let's pick ""RUDDY"".

But we can also consider ""RUKHS""? Not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RULER"" has E and L? Both absent? Invalid.

""RULY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUMOR"" invalid.

""RUMBA"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" is not allowed? O absent.

Another word: ""RUMOR"" is not, but ""RUMOR"" has O? Absent? Yes.

""RUMOR"" is spelled R-U-M-O-R? O is in position 4? And O is absent? So invalid.

So, I think we go with ""RUDDY"".

But let's see the feedback we have: we know Y is at 5? And R must be at 1? So we can guess ""RUDDY"".

If it's not, we get feedback on U and D.

But we have two D's? So if the word has one D, we might get one D as present and one as absent? But we can figure out from the position? For example, if the word has D at position 3, then in ""RUDDY"", position 3 is D? If it's correct, we get ✓? If not, we get '-' or 'x'? But we have two D's? So it might be confusing? But we can handle it.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct letters? But we don't have one? So we have to.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4? No.

""RUBY"" is not 5.

""RUBIED"" not 5.

""RUBIGO""? Not common? And O? Absent? Invalid.

""RUBRIC"" too long? 6 letters? No.

""RUDDOCK""? 7 letters? No.

""RUDAS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

So, I think ""RUDDY"" is a valid guess.

But we also have ""RUMMY""? Let's see if we can get more information? But we have to guess one.

Perhaps ""RUDDY"" is more likely? Or ""RUMMY""? But we don't know.

But we can also consider ""RUBUS"" but not common? So probably not.

So, I'll go with ""RUDDY"".

But let's think: we have position 2,3,4 to be filled with letters from B,D,F,H,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

And we know the word is R _ _ _ Y.

Possible words:
- RUDDY: R U D D Y
- RUMMY: R U M M Y
- RUBBY: not a word? Or ""ruby"" is 4.
- RUMBA: R U M B A -> A absent? Invalid.
- RUMOR: O absent? Invalid.
- RUDER: E absent? Invalid.
- RUDES: S absent? Invalid.
- RUDAS: S absent? Invalid.

- RUMPS: S absent? Invalid.
- RUMPY: P absent? Invalid.
- RUMBO: O absent? Invalid.
- RUMEN: E absent? Invalid.
- RUMMY: valid.
- RUDDY: valid.
- RUBUS: not common? But let's say it's possible? But unlikely.
- RUBES: E and S absent? Invalid.
- RUBIN: not common? And I? I is absent? From guess 3, I is absent? Yes, so ""RUBIN"" has I? Invalid? I is absent? So ""RUBIN"" has I? Yes, so invalid.

""RUBIN"" has I? R-U-B-I-N? I is at position 4? And I is absent? So invalid.

""RUBY"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""RUBY"" is not 5.

""RUBY"" is 4, so not.

""RUBIED"" not 5.

""RUBIO"" has O and I? Both absent? Invalid.

""RUBLE"" has E? Invalid.

""RUBLI"" not common? And I? Invalid.

""RUDAS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDDS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are the only common words? Yes.

But we also have ""RUTHY""? Not common? Or ""ruth"" is 4.

""RUTTY"" has T? T absent? Invalid.

""RUVET"" has E and T? Invalid.

""RUVID""? Not common? And I? I absent? ""RUVED""? E absent? Invalid.

""RUGBY"" has G? G absent? Invalid.

""RUGAL""? U,G,A,L? A and G and L absent? Invalid.

""RUGGY"" has G? Invalid.

""RULED"" has E and L? Invalid.

""RUMAL""? U,M,A,L? A and L absent? Invalid.

""RUMBA"" invalid? A absent.

""RUMEN"" invalid? E absent.

""RUMEX""? E and X? E absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"" invalid? O absent.

""RUMPF""? F? But ""rumpf"" is not common? And P? P absent? ""RUMPF"" has P? R-U-M-P-F? P at position 4? P is absent? So invalid.

""RUMPY"" has P? Invalid.

""RUMPS"" has S? Invalid.

""RUNCH""? U,N? N absent? Invalid.

""RUND"" not 5 letters? ""RUNDLE"" is 6? No.

""RUNED"" has E and N? Invalid.

""RUNNY"" has N? N absent? Invalid.

""RUNTS"" has N and T and S? Invalid.

""RUNTY"" has N and T? Invalid.

""RUPEE"" has E? Invalid.

""RUPIA"" has A and I? Invalid.

""RURAL"" has U,R,A,L? A and L absent? And R repeated? But we know R is at position 1? And we have R at position 3? But we don't know if the word has two R's? But in this case, A and L are absent? So invalid.

""RUSHY"" has S and H? S absent? Invalid.

""RUSKS"" has S and K? S absent? Invalid.

""RUSMA"" has S and A? Invalid.

""RUSSE"" has S and E? Invalid.

""RUSTS"" has S and T? Invalid.

""RUSTY"" has S and T? Invalid.

""RUTHS"" has T and H and S? Invalid.

""RUTTY"" has T? Invalid.

""RUVID"" not common? And I? Invalid.

So, only ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are common words that fit the pattern and the letter constraints.

Therefore, we can guess one of them? I'll guess ""RUDDY"" first? But we have to make a guess.

Since we have to, let's guess ""RUDDY"".

But we can also think: in the feedback for ""girly"", Y was at position 5 and correct? So we know that.

And R must be at position 1? So in ""RUDDY"", we have:
- Position 1: R -> should be correct? ✓
- Position 2: U -> unknown
- Position 3: D -> unknown
- Position 4: D -> unknown
- Position 5: Y -> ✓

If the word is ""RUDDY"", we get all ✓? But if it's ""RUMMY"", we get R✓, U?, M? M? Y✓? But we have D's? So if it's ""RUMMY"", then U might be correct or not? But in ""RUMMY"", U is at position 2? So if we guess ""RUDDY"", and the word is ""RUMMY"", then:
- R at 1: ✓
- U at 2: if U is in the word and at position 2, then ✓? But in ""RUMMY"", U is at position 2? So if the word is ""RUMMY"", then U at position 2 is correct? But we are guessing U at position 2? So if it's correct, we get ✓? But if not, we get something else? But in ""RUDDY"", we have U at 2, D at 3, D at 4.

If the word is ""RUMMY"", then:
- U at 2: should be ✓ (because in ""RUMMY"", U is at 2)
- D at 3: not in the word? So x
- D at 4: not in the word? So x
- But we have two D's? Both x? And U ✓, R ✓, Y ✓.

But we don't know about M? But we didn't guess M? So we get feedback: R(✓) U(✓) D(x) D(x) Y(✓)

Then we know the word is R U ? ? Y, and the two ? are not D? And we know it must be M M? So we can guess ""RUMMY"" next? But we have only two guesses left? But we can solve it.

Similarly, if we guess ""RUMMY"" and it's ""RUDDY"", we get R(✓) U(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓) and then we know it's R U ? ? Y with not M? So we guess ""RUDDY"".

But in both cases, we can solve in the next guess? But we might solve it in this guess if we are lucky.

But we have to choose one? Let's choose ""RUDDY"" as it is more common? Or flip a coin? I'll go with ""RUDDY"".

So, fourth guess: ""RUDDY""

But let's make sure: we have not used ""RUDDY"" before? No.

So, I'll guess ""RUDDY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is in the word but not in position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""girly"")**: Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). R is in the word but not in position 3. G, I, L are absent.

### Deductions:
1. **R must be in position 1**: R is confirmed present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Position 5 is occupied by Y, so R must be at position 1.
2. **Y is fixed at position 5**: Confirmed by the ✓ in ""girly"".
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, G, I, L. The secret word contains none of these.
4. **Available letters for positions 2, 3, and 4**: B, D, F, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since R and Y are fixed at positions 1 and 5).
5. **Possible words**: The secret word pattern is `R _ _ _ Y`. Common English words fitting this pattern and the letter constraints include ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"". Both are valid, but ""RUDDY"" is chosen for this guess as it uses common letters (U, D) and allows testing of position 2 with U and positions 3/4 with D.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test ""RUDDY"" to potentially solve the word if correct.
- If incorrect, feedback on U (position 2) and D (positions 3 and 4) will help narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if U is present/absent, or if D is present in one or both positions). This leaves 2 guesses to solve.

<guess>ruddy</guess>",ruddy,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""girly"":
G: x (not in the word)
I: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
L: x (not in the word)
Y: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in the 5th position (since in ""girly"" it was at position 5 and got a check).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew it's not in 2 or 4, so now not in 3 either).
- G, I, L are not in the word.

Now, we know:
- The secret word has Y in the 5th position.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, it must be in position 1 (since position 5 is taken by Y, so R cannot be at 5? Wait, position 5 is Y, so R must be at position 1? Because positions 2,3,4 are ruled out and 5 is taken by Y? But the word has 5 positions, so R must be at position 1? Because we have tried positions 2,3,4 and they were wrong, and position 5 is now known to be Y, so R must be at position 1? Yes.

Therefore, we can deduce that R is at position 1.

But let's confirm: the feedback for R in ""girly"" was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. We already knew it wasn't at 2 or 4. And now position 5 is Y, so the only position left is 1. So R must be at position 1.

Additionally, we have new absent letters: G, I, L.

So, total absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, G, I, L.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must start with R (position 1) and end with Y (position 5).
- Must not contain: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, G, I, L.

So, the middle three letters (positions 2,3,4) must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Now, we have 3 letters to determine: positions 2,3,4.

We have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 more? But we might solve it in this guess.

We can try to guess a word that fits: R _ _ _ Y

And the middle letters from the available set.

Common letters left: B, D, F, H, K, M, U, W, etc.

Possible words:
- RUBBY? Not a word? Or Ruby? But Ruby is 4 letters? We need 5.
- RUDDY: R, U, D, D, Y -> but D repeated? And it's a word? Yes, meaning reddish. But we have to check if the letters are allowed? U and D are in the available set? Yes. But we don't know about D and U? And we have two D's? But that's okay? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? But we haven't seen any yet? But it's possible.

But we need to get information? We have three positions to figure out? So we might want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we are close, we might solve it.

Alternatively, we can list possible words that fit the pattern.

Possible words: R _ _ _ Y

With the middle three letters from B,D,F,H,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common words:
- RUMBY? Not a word.
- RUPEE? But E is absent? Invalid.
- RUDDY: R, U, D, D, Y -> valid? Yes. But D repeated? So we get less information? But if it's the word, we solve it? But we don't know.
- RUSTY: but S and T are absent? Invalid.
- RICEY: I and E absent? Invalid.
- RABBY? Not a word? Or RABBI? But that has A? Absent? Invalid.
- ROCKY: O absent? Invalid.
- RALLY: L absent? Invalid.
- RILLY? Not a word? Or RILLY is not standard? Rilly is not common? Usually ""really"" but that's 6 letters? So no.

Another word: ""RUMBA"" but A absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning reddish or ruddy complexion.

But we have to consider: we have two D's? But we don't know if D is in the word? So we can try.

But we might want to use a word with all new letters? But we have limited letters left? And we have to include R and Y? But we know R and Y are fixed? So we are only guessing the middle three.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

""RUGBY"": R, U, G, B, Y -> but G is absent? From the third guess, G was marked x? So G is absent? Therefore, ""RUGBY"" has G? Invalid.

""RICEY"": invalid.

""RIPEY"": I and E absent? Invalid.

""RIDGY"": I and G absent? Invalid.

""RANDY"": A and N absent? Invalid.

""ROWTH""? Not a word? Or ""wroth""? But that starts with W? Not R.

""ROWDY"": O absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" seems one of the few options? But let's see if there are others.

""RUSHY"": S and H? S is absent? Invalid.

""RUTHY""? Not a word? Or ""ruth"" is 4 letters.

""REFER"": E absent? Invalid.

""REEDY"": E absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we have to check: in the available letters, D and U are allowed? Yes.

But we have two D's? So if we guess ""RUDDY"", and if it's not the word, we might not get much information? Because if the word has one D, then we might get a '-' for one D and an 'x' for the other? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word with three distinct new letters? But we have to form a word.

For example: R with B, D, F? But what word? ""RUBIFY""? Too long? 6 letters? No.

""RABID"": A absent? Invalid.

""RADII"": A absent? Invalid.

""RACKS"": A and C and S absent? Invalid.

""RADAR"": A absent? Invalid.

""RAGED"": A,G,E absent? Invalid.

""RIFLE"": I,F,L,E? F is allowed? But I and L and E are absent? Invalid.

""RIVET"": I,V,E,T? V is allowed? But I,E,T absent? Invalid.

""ROWDY"": O absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" seems the most common? Or ""RUMMY"": R,U,M,M,Y -> M repeated? And U? But M is allowed? And U? But we don't know about M and U? And it's a word? Yes, meaning a card game or a type of fish.

""RUMMY"": R, U, M, M, Y -> R at 1, Y at 5? Yes. And letters: U, M, M? So two M's? But we can try? And it avoids the absent letters? Check: U is not absent? M is not absent? Yes.

So we have two candidates: ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But we need to choose one? We can also consider ""RUBBY"" but not a word? Or ""RUBBLE"" too long? 6 letters.

Another one: ""RUBUS""? Not common? Or ""rubus"" is a genus? Not a common word? Probably not.

""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are both valid.

But we have to think about information? If we guess ""RUDDY"" and it's wrong, we might not know about U and D? But if we get feedback, we can deduce? But we have two D's? So if the word has one D, we get one '-' and one 'x'? But we don't know which position? It might be messy.

Similarly, ""RUMMY"" has two M's? Same issue.

Is there a word with three distinct letters? For example: R, B, D, F, Y? But we need a word? ""R"" + three distinct + ""Y"".

For example: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? ""RUBEY""? Not a word? ""RUBY"" is 4.

""RABBY"" not a word? ""RABBI"" has A? Invalid.

""RADIO"" has A and O? Invalid.

""RADII"" has A? Invalid.

""REFIT"" has E and T? Invalid.

""REMIT"" has E? Invalid.

""RIVET"" has I,E,T? Invalid.

""ROWTH"" not a word? ""WROTH"" is a word? But starts with W? Not R.

""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are the main options? Or ""RUSHY"" but S absent? Invalid.

""RUSKY""? Not common? Or ""rusky"" is not standard? ""RUSKY"" might be a name? Not a common word.

""RUSTY"" invalid? S and T absent.

""RUTTY"": R,U,T,T,Y -> T absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"": O absent? Invalid.

""RUMBA"": A absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"" invalid? O absent.

""RUMEN"": E absent? Invalid.

""RUMPS"": S absent? Invalid.

""RUMPY"": M,P? P absent? Invalid? P is absent? From guess 2, P is absent? Yes.

So ""RUMMY"" is okay? M is not absent? Yes.

Similarly, ""RUDDY"" is okay? D is not absent? Yes.

Another word: ""RUBLE"": E absent? Invalid? ""RUBLE"" is a currency? But E at the end? And we know E is absent? So invalid.

""RUBLE"" has E? Yes, so invalid.

""RUDER"": E absent? Invalid.

""RUDES""? Not a word? And S absent? Invalid.

So, we are left with ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But we also have ""RUBUS""? Not common? Or ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? So not.

""RUBIN""? Not a word? Or ""ruby"" related? Not standard.

""RUBBY"" is not in the dictionary? So probably not.

Therefore, we have to choose between ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But note: we have Y at the end? And R at the start? So both fit.

We can also consider ""RUCKY""? Not a word? Or ""lucky"" with R? Not.

""RUCKS"": S absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" is more common? Or ""RUMMY"" is also common? But we have to pick one.

But we have to think: we have three positions? And we have two words? But we might solve it? Or if not, we get feedback.

But we have two more guesses? We used 3, so 3 left? But we might solve in this one? Or if not, we can use the feedback.

But to maximize information? If we use a word with distinct letters? But we don't have one? So we have to choose one.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBIED""? 6 letters? No.

""RUBIES""? 6 letters? No.

""RUBIFY""? 6 letters? No.

""RUBINE""? Not common? And E? Invalid.

So, I think we have to choose between ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"".

But let's see the letters: for ""RUDDY"", we have U and D? For ""RUMMY"", we have U and M.

We don't know about U, D, M? So both are possible.

But we can also consider ""RUBBY"" but not a word? Or ""RUBBLE"" too long? No.

""RUBLE"" has E? Invalid.

""RUBLE"" same? Invalid.

""RUBUS"" is a genus? But not common? And we are playing Wordle? So common words? Probably.

But ""RUDDY"" is a common word? Yes? Meaning reddish? Or healthy complexion? Yes.

""RUMMY"" is also common? Card game? Yes.

But we have to pick one? Let's pick ""RUDDY"" because it has two D's? But we don't know? Or ""RUMMY"" has two M's? Same.

But we can also think: we have position 2,3,4 to guess? And we have to use three letters? But we don't know which ones.

Another idea: we can use a word that has letters that are common? But we have limited common letters left? D and U are common? M is also common? But we don't know.

But we have to make a guess? I'll go with ""RUDDY"" because it's a word? And we can see.

But let's see the feedback we might get? If we guess ""RUDDY"":
- R at 1: should be ✓ because we know R is at 1? But we haven't confirmed position 1? We deduced it must be at 1? But we haven't tested it? Actually, we haven't placed R at position 1 before? We placed R at position 2 in ""crane"", position 4 in ""sport"", position 3 in ""girly""? So position 1 is untested? But we deduced it must be at 1? Because the only position left? And we know it's in the word? And position 5 is Y? So yes, it must be at 1? So we can assume R at 1 is correct? But we haven't had a ✓ for R? But logically it must be? So in the guess, we can put R at 1 and expect a ✓.

Similarly, Y at 5 is ✓.

Then for U at position 2: if it's in the word, we get feedback? Similarly for D at 3 and D at 4.

But if the word is ""RUDDY"", we get all ✓? But if not, we get feedback.

But we have to consider: what if the word has only one D? Then we might get one D as '-' and one as 'x'? But we don't know which one? So it might be ambiguous? But we can use the next guess? But we have two more? So it's okay? But we might solve it if it's ""RUDDY"".

Similarly for ""RUMMY"".

But let's see if there is a word with distinct letters? For example: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBIN"" not common? ""RUBY"" is the gem? 4 letters.

""RUBIED"" not 5.

""RUBY"" is 4, so not.

""RUBUS"" is 5 letters? And it's a word? In botany? But not common? So probably not the secret word? Wordle uses common words? So we can avoid? But we don't know.

Another word: ""RUDAS""? Not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDES"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDIS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDIST""? Too long? 6 letters? No.

""RUDD"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUDY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUDDY"" is 5? Yes.

Similarly, ""RUMMY"" is 5.

But we also have ""RUMBA"" is 5? But A absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"" O absent? Invalid.

""RUMPY"" P absent? Invalid.

""RUMEN"" E absent? Invalid.

""RUMPS"" S absent? Invalid.

""RUMBO""? Not common? Or ""rumbo"" is a cocktail? But not very common? So probably not.

""RUMOR"" invalid? O absent.

So, I think ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are the main candidates? But we also have ""RUBUS""? Let's not consider it? Or ""RUBES""? Not common? And E and S absent? Invalid.

""RUBES"" has E and S? Both absent? Invalid.

""RUBIES"" 6 letters? No.

So, we have to choose one? Let's choose ""RUDDY"" as it is more common? Or ""RUMMY"" is also common? But let's pick ""RUDDY"".

But we can also consider ""RUKHS""? Not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RULER"" has E and L? Both absent? Invalid.

""RULY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUMOR"" invalid.

""RUMBA"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" invalid.

""RUMOR"" is not allowed? O absent.

Another word: ""RUMOR"" is not, but ""RUMOR"" has O? Absent? Yes.

""RUMOR"" is spelled R-U-M-O-R? O is in position 4? And O is absent? So invalid.

So, I think we go with ""RUDDY"".

But let's see the feedback we have: we know Y is at 5? And R must be at 1? So we can guess ""RUDDY"".

If it's not, we get feedback on U and D.

But we have two D's? So if the word has one D, we might get one D as present and one as absent? But we can figure out from the position? For example, if the word has D at position 3, then in ""RUDDY"", position 3 is D? If it's correct, we get ✓? If not, we get '-' or 'x'? But we have two D's? So it might be confusing? But we can handle it.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct letters? But we don't have one? So we have to.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4? No.

""RUBY"" is not 5.

""RUBIED"" not 5.

""RUBIGO""? Not common? And O? Absent? Invalid.

""RUBRIC"" too long? 6 letters? No.

""RUDDOCK""? 7 letters? No.

""RUDAS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

So, I think ""RUDDY"" is a valid guess.

But we also have ""RUMMY""? Let's see if we can get more information? But we have to guess one.

Perhaps ""RUDDY"" is more likely? Or ""RUMMY""? But we don't know.

But we can also consider ""RUBUS"" but not common? So probably not.

So, I'll go with ""RUDDY"".

But let's think: we have position 2,3,4 to be filled with letters from B,D,F,H,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

And we know the word is R _ _ _ Y.

Possible words:
- RUDDY: R U D D Y
- RUMMY: R U M M Y
- RUBBY: not a word? Or ""ruby"" is 4.
- RUMBA: R U M B A -> A absent? Invalid.
- RUMOR: O absent? Invalid.
- RUDER: E absent? Invalid.
- RUDES: S absent? Invalid.
- RUDAS: S absent? Invalid.
- RUKHS: S absent? Invalid.
- RUMPS: S absent? Invalid.
- RUMPY: P absent? Invalid.
- RUMBO: O absent? Invalid.
- RUMEN: E absent? Invalid.
- RUMMY: valid.
- RUDDY: valid.
- RUBUS: not common? But let's say it's possible? But unlikely.
- RUBES: E and S absent? Invalid.
- RUBIN: not common? And I? I is absent? From guess 3, I is absent? Yes, so ""RUBIN"" has I? Invalid? I is absent? So ""RUBIN"" has I? Yes, so invalid.

""RUBIN"" has I? R-U-B-I-N? I is at position 4? And I is absent? So invalid.

""RUBY"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""RUBY"" is not 5.

""RUBY"" is 4, so not.

""RUBIED"" not 5.

""RUBIO"" has O and I? Both absent? Invalid.

""RUBLI"" not common? And I? Invalid.

""RUDAS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDDS"" not common? And S absent? Invalid.

""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are the only common words? Yes.

But we also have ""RUTHY""? Not common? Or ""ruth"" is 4.

""RUTTY"" has T? T absent? Invalid.

""RUVET"" has E and T? Invalid.

""RUVID""? Not common? And I? I absent? ""RUVED""? E absent? Invalid.

""RUGGY"" has G? Invalid.

""RULED"" has E and L? Invalid.

""RUMAL""? U,M,A,L? A and L absent? Invalid.

""RUMBA"" invalid? A absent.

""RUMEN"" invalid? E absent.

""RUMEX""? E and X? E absent? Invalid.

""RUMOR"" invalid? O absent.

""RUMPF""? F? But ""rumpf"" is not common? And P? P absent? ""RUMPF"" has P? R-U-M-P-F? P at position 4? P is absent? So invalid.

""RUMPY"" has P? Invalid.

""RUMPS"" has S? Invalid.

""RUNCH""? U,N? N absent? Invalid.

""RUNTS"" has N and T and S? Invalid.

""RUNTY"" has N and T? Invalid.

""RUPEE"" has E? Invalid.

""RUPIA"" has A and I? Invalid.

""RURAL"" has U,R,A,L? A and L absent? And R repeated? But we know R is at position 1? And we have R at position 3? But we don't know if the word has two R's? But in this case, A and L are absent? So invalid.

""RUSHY"" has S and H? S absent? Invalid.

""RUSKS"" has S and K? S absent? Invalid.

""RUSMA"" has S and A? Invalid.

""RUSSE"" has S and E? Invalid.

""RUSTS"" has S and T? Invalid.

""RUSTY"" has S and T? Invalid.

""RUTHS"" has T and H and S? Invalid.

""RUTTY"" has T? Invalid.

""RUVID"" not common? And I? Invalid.

So, only ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"" are common words that fit the pattern and the letter constraints.

Therefore, we can guess one of them? I'll guess ""RUDDY"" first? But we have to make a guess.

Since we have to, let's guess ""RUDDY"".

But we can also think: in the feedback for ""girly"", Y was at position 5 and correct? So we know that.

And R must be at position 1? So in ""RUDDY"", we have:
- Position 1: R -> should be correct? ✓
- Position 2: U -> unknown
- Position 3: D -> unknown
- Position 4: D -> unknown
- Position 5: Y -> ✓

If the word is ""RUDDY"", we get all ✓? But if it's ""RUMMY"", we get R✓, U?, M? M? Y✓? But we have D's? So if it's ""RUMMY"", then U might be correct or not? But in ""RUMMY"", U is at position 2? So if we guess ""RUDDY"", and the word is ""RUMMY"", then:
- R at 1: ✓
- U at 2: if U is in the word and at position 2, then ✓? But in ""RUMMY"", U is at position 2? So if the word is ""RUMMY"", then U at position 2 is correct? But we are guessing U at position 2? So if it's correct, we get ✓? But if not, we get something else? But in ""RUDDY"", we have U at 2, D at 3, D at 4.

If the word is ""RUMMY"", then:
- U at 2: should be ✓ (because in ""RUMMY"", U is at 2)
- D at 3: not in the word? So x
- D at 4: not in the word? So x
- But we have two D's? Both x? And U ✓, R ✓, Y ✓.

But we don't know about M? But we didn't guess M? So we get feedback: R(✓) U(✓) D(x) D(x) Y(✓)

Then we know the word is R U ? ? Y, and the two ? are not D? And we know it must be M M? So we can guess ""RUMMY"" next? But we have only two guesses left? But we can solve it.

Similarly, if we guess ""RUMMY"" and it's ""RUDDY"", we get R(✓) U(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓) and then we know it's R U ? ? Y with not M? So we guess ""RUDDY"".

But in both cases, we can solve in the next guess? But we might solve it in this guess if we are lucky.

But we have to choose one? Let's choose ""RUDDY"" as it is more common? Or flip a coin? I'll go with ""RUDDY"".

So, fourth guess: ""RUDDY""

But let's make sure: we have not used ""RUDDY"" before? No.

So, I'll guess ""RUDDY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is in the word but not in position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""girly"")**: Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). R is in the word but not in position 3. G, I, L are absent.

### Deductions:
1. **R must be in position 1**: R is confirmed present but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Position 5 is occupied by Y, so R must be at position 1.
2. **Y is fixed at position 5**: Confirmed by the ✓ in ""girly"".
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, G, I, L. The secret word contains none of these.
4. **Available letters for positions 2, 3, and 4**: B, D, F, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since R and Y are fixed at positions 1 and 5).
5. **Possible words**: The secret word pattern is `R _ _ _ Y`. Common English words fitting this pattern and the letter constraints include ""RUDDY"" and ""RUMMY"". Both are valid, but ""RUDDY"" is chosen for this guess as it uses common letters (U, D) and allows testing of position 2 with U and positions 3/4 with D.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test ""RUDDY"" to potentially solve the word if correct.
- If incorrect, feedback on U (position 2) and D (positions 3 and 4) will help narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if U is present/absent, or if D is present in one or both positions). This leaves 2 guesses to solve.",Guess 4: ruddy -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
