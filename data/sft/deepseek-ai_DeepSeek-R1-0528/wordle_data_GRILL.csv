We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. 
 There is no feedback yet since it's the first turn.
 A good starting word should have common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"" are often good starters.
 Let me choose a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""ROAST"":
   R, O, A, S, T -> all fairly common.

 Another is ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E -> includes A and E, and common consonants.

 Another is ""SLATE"":
   S, L, A, T, E -> has S, T, A, E which are common.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let me ensure ""CRANE"" is a 5-letter word: yes, it is.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE
</think>
<thought>
For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained. A strong starter typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to test multiple positions at once. Based on English letter frequency, vowels like A, E and consonants like R, S, T, N are ideal. 

The word ""ROATE"" is statistically effective—it contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T), covering five distinct letters. Alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also popular, but ""ROATE"" ranks highly in solving efficiency for similar games. It's a valid word (meaning a financial yield curve) that adheres to the rules.

This guess will test:
- High-frequency letters: R, A, E, T, O
- Positions of all letters simultaneously
- Quickly reveal potential vowels/consonants in the secret word

We have feedback from the first guess: ROATE -> R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with ""-"" meaning wrong position).
   - O, A, T, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").

 Important deductions:
 1. The secret word contains the letter R, but it is not in the first position (since our guess had R in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position, meaning R is present elsewhere).
 2. The letters O, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 1, and the word is 5 letters, R must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we must avoid using O, A, T, E in any new guess because they are not in the secret word.

 Now, for the next guess, we need:
   - To include R, but not in the first position (try it in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - To avoid the letters O, A, T, E entirely.

 Also, we want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet. Common consonants: S, L, N, I, C, U, etc. (but note U is a vowel and we haven't tested it).

 Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new common letters as possible and arrange R in a different position.

 Let's recall: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. So we should try R in one of the remaining positions.

 Common 5-letter words without O, A, T, E? 

 We can think of words that have R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 and use other common letters.

 Example positions for R:
   Position 2: e.g., CR? but C is not tested -> but note we must avoid O,A,T,E.
   Position 3: e.g., ? R ? ? ?
   Position 4: e.g., ? ? R ? ?
   Position 5: e.g., ? ? ? ? R

 Also note: We have not tested the vowels I, U (since O, A, E are out). We should test one of them to see if they are present? But the secret word must have vowels too.

 However, the feedback tells us that O, A, E are absent, so the vowels must be from I, U, or sometimes Y. But Y is less common.

 Possible vowels: I, U, Y.

 We should try to include one or two vowels that haven't been tested? But also consonants.

 Since R is the only known letter, we can try a word that has R in a different position and introduces new common letters.

 List of potential words without O,A,T,E and with R in a position other than 1:

 Common words:
   With R in position 2: 
      CRISP -> but C,R,I,S,P -> no O,A,T,E -> acceptable? Let's check letters: C, R, I, S, P. 
      However, we have to avoid using known absent letters: O,A,T,E are absent, so this is okay.
      But we don't know if these letters are present. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

   With R in position 3:
      PINCH -> but no R. 
      WORD: SHIRK -> S,H,I,R,K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> avoids O,A,T,E.
      WORD: SPUR? -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   With R in position 4:
      PLUMB? -> but no R. Instead, consider: WINCH? -> but no R. 
      WORD: BLUR? -> too short. 
      WORD: SQUID -> no R.

   With R in position 5:
      MINOR -> but has O -> not allowed. 
      OTHER: RIGID -> R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1. So if we try a word with R in position 5? 
        WORD: LUMPS -> no R.
        WORD: VIVID -> no R.

 After review, let's try to get R in position 2 or 3 or 4 and include new common letters.

 I think CRISP is a good candidate:
   It has R in position 2 (which is a position R could potentially be, since it was not in position 1).
   It introduces new common letters: C, I, S, P.

 Alternatively, consider SHIRK: 
   R is in position 4, and introduces S, H, I, K.

 Another option: PRICK -> P,R,I,C,K -> R in position 2? Actually position 2? P is position 1 -> wait: 
   P R I C K -> R is in position 2? But the feedback said R was in the word but not position 1, so placing R in position 2 is allowed? 
   However, in the feedback of the first guess, R was in position 1 and was wrong. The secret word has R, but we don't know where. So putting R in position 2 in the new guess is acceptable.

 But note: we must use only letters that are not O,A,T,E and try to cover new ones.

 Considering CRISP:
   - We place R in position 2 (which is a new position).
   - We test C (common consonant), I (vowel), S (common consonant), P (common consonant).

 This gives us a lot of new information.

 Another word: BRICK -> has B,R,I,C,K -> avoids O,A,T,E. R is in position 2 again.

 However, note: the feedback told us that R is in the word. But we don't know if it's in multiple positions? Probably not, we just need to find one occurrence.

 Let me compare common words: 
   CRISP: uses C, R, I, S, P -> all new letters. This is very efficient for gathering information.

 But note: we must not use the letter E (which is excluded) and we are not using O,A,T.

 Important: The guess must be a valid English word. CRISP is valid.

 Now, what about placing R in a position that wasn't position 1? Our feedback said R was not in position 1. CRISP has R in position 2 -> which is allowed.

 Let's choose CRISP.

 Alternatively, we might consider using the vowel U? But since I is also a vowel and more common, testing I might be better.

 After consideration, I'll go with CRISP.

 But note: we are avoiding E, which is good. So:

 Guess: CRISP -> C(position1), R(position2), I(position3), S(position4), P(position5).

 Let's hope this gives us more information.

 If the secret word doesn't have R in position 2, then we get a ""-"" for R again? Which tells us R is in another position.

 We have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 total tries, but we used one, so 5 left. This is our second guess.

 Therefore, we'll guess CRISP.
</think>
<thought>
The feedback from the first guess (ROATE → R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)) reveals:
- R is in the secret word but NOT in the first position.
- O, A, T, E are ABSENT from the secret word.

Therefore:
1. Avoid using O, A, T, E in the next guess.
2. Include R in a position other than 1 (positions 2–5).
3. Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters not yet attempted (e.g., I, S, C, N, L).

Given this context:
- Common vowels still untested: I, U, Y (I is most frequent).
- Common consonants still untested: S, N, L, C, H, etc.
- A strong candidate word should include R (not in position 1), introduce multiple new letters, and omit forbidden characters.

Optimal strategy: Guess **CRISP** because:
- It places R in position 2 (the first valid alternative to position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (C, S, P) and the vowel I.
- It omits forbidden letters (O, A, T, E).
- The word is valid and maximizes potential letter/position information.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. 
 There is no feedback yet since it's the first turn.
 A good starting word should have common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"" are often good starters.
 Let me choose a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""ROAST"":
   R, O, A, S, T -> all fairly common.

 Another is ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E -> includes A and E, and common consonants.

 Another is ""SLATE"":
   S, L, A, T, E -> has S, T, A, E which are common.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let me ensure ""CRANE"" is a 5-letter word: yes, it is.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE<thought>
For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained. A strong starter typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to test multiple positions at once. Based on English letter frequency, vowels like A, E and consonants like R, S, T, N are ideal. 

The word ""ROATE"" is statistically effective—it contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T), covering five distinct letters. Alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also popular, but ""ROATE"" ranks highly in solving efficiency for similar games. It's a valid word (meaning a financial yield curve) that adheres to the rules.

This guess will test:
- High-frequency letters: R, A, E, T, O
- Positions of all letters simultaneously
- Quickly reveal potential vowels/consonants in the secret word

<guess>ROATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ROATE -> R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with ""-"" meaning wrong position).
   - O, A, T, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").

 Important deductions:
 1. The secret word contains the letter R, but it is not in the first position (since our guess had R in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position, meaning R is present elsewhere).
 2. The letters O, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 1, and the word is 5 letters, R must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we must avoid using O, A, T, E in any new guess because they are not in the secret word.

 Now, for the next guess, we need:
   - To include R, but not in the first position (try it in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - To avoid the letters O, A, T, E entirely.

 Also, we want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet. Common consonants: S, L, N, I, C, U, etc. (but note U is a vowel and we haven't tested it).

 Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new common letters as possible and arrange R in a different position.

 Let's recall: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. So we should try R in one of the remaining positions.

 Common 5-letter words without O, A, T, E? 

 We can think of words that have R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 and use other common letters.

 Example positions for R:
   Position 2: e.g., CR? but C is not tested -> but note we must avoid O,A,T,E.
   Position 3: e.g., ? R ? ? ?
   Position 4: e.g., ? ? R ? ?
   Position 5: e.g., ? ? ? ? R

 Also note: We have not tested the vowels I, U (since O, A, E are out). We should test one of them to see if they are present? But the secret word must have vowels too.

 However, the feedback tells us that O, A, E are absent, so the vowels must be from I, U, or sometimes Y. But Y is less common.

 Possible vowels: I, U, Y.

 We should try to include one or two vowels that haven't been tested? But also consonants.

 Since R is the only known letter, we can try a word that has R in a different position and introduces new common letters.

 List of potential words without O,A,T,E and with R in a position other than 1:

 Common words:
   With R in position 2: 
      CRISP -> but C,R,I,S,P -> no O,A,T,E -> acceptable? Let's check letters: C, R, I, S, P. 
      However, we have to avoid using known absent letters: O,A,T,E are absent, so this is okay.
      But we don't know if these letters are present. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

   With R in position 3:
      PINCH -> but no R. 
      WORD: SHIRK -> S,H,I,R,K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> avoids O,A,T,E.
      WORD: SPUR? -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   With R in position 4:
      PLUMB? -> but no R. Instead, consider: WINCH? -> but no R. 
      WORD: BLUR? -> too short. 
      WORD: SQUID -> no R.

   With R in position 5:
      MINOR -> but has O -> not allowed. 
      OTHER: RIGID -> R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1. So if we try a word with R in position 5? 
        WORD: LUMPS -> no R.
        WORD: VIVID -> no R.

 After review, let's try to get R in position 2 or 3 or 4 and include new common letters.

 I think CRISP is a good candidate:
   It has R in position 2 (which is a position R could potentially be, since it was not in position 1).
   It introduces new common letters: C, I, S, P.

 Alternatively, consider SHIRK: 
   R is in position 4, and introduces S, H, I, K.

 Another option: PRICK -> P,R,I,C,K -> R in position 2? Actually position 2? P is position 1 -> wait: 
   P R I C K -> R is in position 2? But the feedback said R was in the word but not position 1, so placing R in position 2 is allowed? 
   However, in the feedback of the first guess, R was in position 1 and was wrong. The secret word has R, but we don't know where. So putting R in position 2 in the new guess is acceptable.

 But note: we must use only letters that are not O,A,T,E and try to cover new ones.

 Considering CRISP:
   - We place R in position 2 (which is a new position).
   - We test C (common consonant), I (vowel), S (common consonant), P (common consonant).

 This gives us a lot of new information.

 Another word: BRICK -> has B,R,I,C,K -> avoids O,A,T,E. R is in position 2 again.

 However, note: the feedback told us that R is in the word. But we don't know if it's in multiple positions? Probably not, we just need to find one occurrence.

 Let me compare common words: 
   CRISP: uses C, R, I, S, P -> all new letters. This is very efficient for gathering information.

 But note: we must not use the letter E (which is excluded) and we are not using O,A,T.

 Important: The guess must be a valid English word. CRISP is valid.

 Now, what about placing R in a position that wasn't position 1? Our feedback said R was not in position 1. CRISP has R in position 2 -> which is allowed.

 Let's choose CRISP.

 Alternatively, we might consider using the vowel U? But since I is also a vowel and more common, testing I might be better.

 After consideration, I'll go with CRISP.

 But note: we are avoiding E, which is good. So:

 Guess: CRISP -> C(position1), R(position2), I(position3), S(position4), P(position5).

 Let's hope this gives us more information.

 If the secret word doesn't have R in position 2, then we get a ""-"" for R again? Which tells us R is in another position.

 We have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 total tries, but we used one, so 5 left. This is our second guess.

 Therefore, we'll guess CRISP.<thought>
The feedback from the first guess (ROATE → R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)) reveals:
- R is in the secret word but NOT in the first position.
- O, A, T, E are ABSENT from the secret word.

Therefore:
1. Avoid using O, A, T, E in the next guess.
2. Include R in a position other than 1 (positions 2–5).
3. Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters not yet attempted (e.g., I, S, C, N, L).

Given this context:
- Common vowels still untested: I, U, Y (I is most frequent).
- Common consonants still untested: S, N, L, C, H, etc.
- A strong candidate word should include R (not in position 1), introduce multiple new letters, and omit forbidden characters.

Optimal strategy: Guess **CRISP** because:
- It places R in position 2 (the first valid alternative to position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (C, S, P) and the vowel I.
- It omits forbidden letters (O, A, T, E).
- The word is valid and maximizes potential letter/position information.

We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position → ""-"" (so R is in the word, not at position 1)
  O, A, T, E: absent → ""x""

Second guess: CRISP
  C: absent → ""x""
  R: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning R is in position 2 of the secret word?)
  I: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning I is in position 3 of the secret word?)
  S: absent → ""x""
  P: absent → ""x""

But note: the feedback for R and I in CRISP is ""✓"", meaning:
  - The secret word has R in the second position.
  - The secret word has I in the third position.

Also, from the first guess, we knew R was present (but not at position 1). Now we know it is at position 2.

Additionally, from CRISP, we know:
  C, S, P are absent → we can add them to the exclusion list.

So, letters we know are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P.

Letters we know are present: R (at position 2) and I (at position 3).

Also, since the secret word has R at position 2 and I at position 3, we know the word has at least the pattern: _ R I _ _

We have 5 positions:

Position 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters. And note that we don't know what letter is here, but it cannot be O, A, T, E, C, S, P.
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: unknown (and must not be O, A, T, E, C, S, P, or R,I? Wait, R and I are already used, but since R is in position 2, it can appear again? But typically in these games, letters can repeat? However, the feedback doesn't explicitly say whether duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven't encountered duplicates yet. To be safe, we can assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise. Because if there were duplicates, we might have seen feedback indicating a duplicate.

Looking back at the feedback for ROATE: R was present (but not position 1) and we had no indication of a duplicate. Similarly, in CRISP, we had only one R and one I. So let's assume for now the word has no duplicate letters.

Therefore, positions 1, 4, and 5 must be letters not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P} and also not R or I? But R and I are already used? So we need three new distinct letters that are not excluded and not R or I.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

where letter1, letter4, letter5 are:
  - Not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I} (so avoiding 9 letters: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I)
  - They must be English letters we haven't tried yet.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _, and uses only letters from the remaining set.

We have to pick a valid English word. Also, we want to maximize coverage of new letters? We have only three positions to fill.

Possible words that come to mind:
  BRING? -> B R I N G -> which has G and N, which are untested? But note: we must avoid taken letters? B is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed. However, BRING has an N and a G. But also, note: the pattern must have R at 2 and I at 3: so B R I N G -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

Check: letters in BRING: B,R,I,N,G -> R and I are known to be at positions 2 and 3? Yes. The others: B, N, G are allowed? Yes, they haven't been tested.

But note: in CRISP we got feedback that S and P are absent. We also excluded O,A,T,E,C. So BRING uses only fresh letters and fits the pattern? But we don't know if N and G are in the word? This guess might be the solution? Or it might test new letters.

Wait: the word must be valid and we don't know the secret word. So BRING is a valid guess.

Alternatively, we might think of other words:
  FRISK? -> F R I S K, but S is forbidden? We know S is absent (from Guess 2: S got ""x""). So we cannot use S.

  Another: PRINT -> P R I N T -> but P and T are excluded. T is excluded from the first guess? Yes: T got ""x"" in ROATE? First guess: T was absent? Yes, T got ""x"" in ROATE? Actually: In ROATE: A was in pos3 and got ""x"", T was in pos4 and got ""x"". So T is excluded. Therefore PRINT is invalid because it uses P and T? P is excluded? Guess2: P got ""x"", so P is absent. T we already know is absent.

  Another: DRINK -> D R I N K -> D, N, K are fresh? And the pattern fits: _ R I N K.

  Similarly: GRIND -> G R I N D -> G, N, D fresh.

  Or: BRINK: B R I N K -> B, N, K fresh.

  Also: FRIGID? too long? 5 letters: FRICK? -> not a word. FRUIT? -> F R U I T -> but U is in position 4? But U is allowed? Actually: FRUIT would have I at position 4? But we need position 3 to be I? So no.

Let's list possible words matching the pattern _ R I _ _ with the constraints.

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? but we also have to form a word.

Words that come to mind:
  BRING (as above)
  BRINK
  DRINK
  GRINS? -> but S is excluded? We cannot use S? So GRIN? is 4 letters? We need 5 letter words? So GRINS is not allowed if we cannot use S? And S is excluded.

Alternatively:
  FRIAR? -> but second R? We don't know if duplicate R is allowed? And also A is excluded? Wait: A is absent? So no.

  PRICE? -> uses P (absent) and E (absent) -> no.

After thinking, valid words:
  BRING: B R I N G -> uses B, N, G
  BRINK: B R I N K -> uses B, N, K
  DRINK: D R I N K -> D, N, K
  GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, M, Y
  KRIS? -> too short.

But note: we have only 3 unknown positions? Actually two: positions 4 and 5? No: position 1,4,5.

Wait, the pattern: position1: ?, position4: ?, position5: ?.

So we must choose a word that starts with a letter in the available set and ends with two letters also in the available set? And contains only allowed letters.

Let me think of a common word: BRING is common? Yes.

Also: FRISK: we cannot because S is excluded.

Another: WRING -> W R I N G -> W, N, G? W is allowed? Yes.

Similarly: PRIG? -> too short? No, 5 letter? PRIG is 4? PRIGY? not a word.

We should avoid using letters that are rare? But N, G, K, etc. are common.

Now: how to choose? We are testing as many letters as possible? We have three unknown letters? Since we are at guess 3, we want to maximize information? But also we might solve it? But that would be lucky.

If we guess BRING and it's wrong, we get feedback on B, N, G? Which is good? But note: position 4 and 5 are also unknown.

We could test multiple possibilities? For example, if we test B, N, G in BRING, then we get:
  If B is correct? Then we have B at position1? And then N and G? Which might be correct or not.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that covers more common letters? The remaining common letters? Common consonants: L, N, H, etc.

But note: we have many options: we don't need to cover all, but we need information.

But since we know the pattern is ? R I ? ?, we can pick a word that uses common letters? But also we want to test possible letters.

I think BRING is a solid choice? But let me see:

Common bigrams after ""I""? Often: NG, NK, ND, etc.

So we can try BRING? which tests B, N, G.

Alternatively, if we choose H R I N G -> HRING? Not a valid word? Or BRINK? Then tests B, N, K.

Another word: GRIND: G R I N D -> tests G, N, D? D is less common? But valid.

Wait: what about U? We haven't tested U? But U is a vowel? Maybe the word is BRINY? B R I N Y -> N and Y? Y can be a consonant or vowel? Valid word? Yes.

Or FRITZ: F R I T Z -> but T is absent? So no.

After considering, BRING is a very common word? So I'll go with that? Because it's common and we don't have any clues for the other letters.

But note: we have multiple possibilities? So to avoid burning a guess? We should try to test as many new letters as possible? For example, instead of using N (which appears in many words), we might test a different set? But then we lose coverage? Actually, N is common? So testing N might be good.

Let me look for a word that uses unique letters? For example, that doesn't reuse letters? But we must use distinct letters? But the secret word might reuse? But we have no evidence? So we guess distinct.

Now: in BRING, we use three new letters: B, N, G. This is good? Because we test all three at once. If they are all correct, we win? If one is wrong, we get feedback? Then based on that, we can guess again? Since we have 4 tries left? Wait: we have 3 guesses so far? This is the third? Wait: Guess1, Guess2, now Guess3? Then we have three more left? So we can afford to test.

But we might be able to cover more if we don't fix N and G? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might try a word that uses letters that appear in many possible words? For example, N appears in BRINK, BRING, etc. So if we get N present? Then we know position4?

But I think guessing BRING is reasonable? Also, note: the secret word might be BRINK? Or something else? But we don't know? So we test.

To be systematic, we can think of the candidate list? But without knowing? We guess.

I decided to guess BRING? Because it fits and tests common letters.

But wait: the feedback from Guess2? In Guess2 CRISP? We got R(✓) and I(✓) meaning positions 2 and 3? Also, C, S, P absent? So we are safe using B, N, G? Which haven't been tried? And avoiding the excluded ones.

So: let's guess BRING? But note: BRING: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

If the secret word were BRINK? Then we would get B? How? Position1: B -> if secret is BRINK? Then both start with B? So we get ""✓"" for B? Then position4: N vs K? So ""x"" for N? Because K is the actual letter? And position5: G vs K? So G would be absent? And K is present? But wait? We don't have K in BRING? So we wouldn't know? Actually? The secret word BRINK has one K? At position5? So in BRING? We have G at position5? Then feedback: 
  position1: B (if secret starts with B? then ✓) else? 
  position4: N (if secret has N? then feedback depends? If secret is BRINK? Then secret position4 is N? Wait: BRINK:1:B,2:R,3:I,4:N,5:K? So position4 is N? Then if we guess BRING? which has N at position4? That would match? Wait no: BRING has G at position5? So:
  Guess: B R I N G
  Secret: B R I N K

Then feedback: 
  position1: B ✓
  position2: R ✓
  position3: I ✓
  position4: N ✓? Because it's the correct letter? Wait: N is correct? So ✓? Then position5: G vs K -> G is not K? And K is in the secret? But we have no information? So? Actually: 
  The secret has K? And we guessed G? So G is absent? So position5: x? 

Therefore: feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)? But we don't know that K is present? Only that G is absent? And we have three correct so far? Then we would know the word ends with K? But only if we get that three ✓ and one x.

But we don't? Because if we get BRING guess? And the secret is BRINK? Then we have positions1-4 correct? So ✓ for B, R, I, N? and x for G? Which tells us position5 is not G? So we know the word is B R I N ??? But? Actually? The feedback does not tell us that K is in the word? Only that G is not? And we already know G is absent? Then we must try other letters? So we lose a guess? 

But that's unavoidable.

In this case, with BRING? We risk that position4 being N? And position5 being something else? We have many possibilities? For example, if N is correct at position4? Then we need to test the last letter? If not? Then we know position4 is not N.

So? I think BRING is a valid guess? And we'll see.

But to be strategic? Maybe we can choose a word that doesn't assume N at position4? For example? We don't know what letter is at position4? So we can guess a word that uses all new letters? But uses a letter that is more common? Or in a more common position? 

But? If we don't fix N? Then we have more uncertainty? For example? If we guess a word where position4 is not N? Then we test a different set? For instance? GRIMY: G R I M Y -> tests G, M, Y? Which are less common? Hence? BRING? with N in position4? N is a common ending? So? It might be likely? Actually? In English? The position after I? Common? For example? In words ending with ""ING""? So BRING? CRING? But C is excluded? So BRING? FRING? Not that common? But BRING? That's a word.

After consideration? I'll go with BRING? Because? It is a common word? And we test N? Which is a common letter? And G? Also common? So? Let's choose that? Of you agree?

Let's note: if the secret word is BRING? Then we get five ✓ and win? Else? We get feedback on B, N, G.

Therefore? Let's guess BRING?<thought>
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- Secret word contains R in position 2 and I in position 3 → pattern: _ R I _ _
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E (from Guess 1), and C, S, P (from Guess 2)
- Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Given pattern _ R I _ _ and exclusions:
- Position 1 must be one of the available consonants/vowels (likely consonant given English words).
- Positions 4 and 5 must be available letters, distinct from R/I and exclusions.

Optimal strategy: Guess a valid word matching this pattern while maximizing information:
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, L, U) → ""N"" and ""G"" are common.
- ""BRING"" is a valid choice: tests new letters B, N, G, with ""N"" in a common bigram (""IN"") and ""G"" in common trigram (""ING"").
- Alternatives like BRINK, DRINK risk similar letters (e.g., ""K"" vs. ""G"") without additional coverage.
- ""BRING"" covers three new letters efficiently and provides immediate feedback on high-frequency positions/postfixes.
</thought>

<guess>BRING</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ROATE → R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → R present (wrong position), O/A/T/E absent  
- Guess 2: CRISP → C(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), P(x) → R correct at position 2, I correct at position 3, C/S/P absent  

Deductions:  
- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _  
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Strategic goal:  
- Guess a valid word matching the pattern _ R I _ _ using untested letters to maximize information.  
- Prioritize common letters and plausible endings (e.g., ""N"" and ""G"" in ""ING"" bigrams).  

Selected word: **BRING**  
- Tests B (position 1), N (position 4), G (position 5) → three new common letters  
- ""BRING"" is a common English word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.  

<guess>BRING</guess>",BRING,"We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position → ""-"" (so R is in the word, not at position 1)
  O, A, T, E: absent → ""x""

Second guess: CRISP
  C: absent → ""x""
  R: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning R is in position 2 of the secret word?)
  I: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning I is in position 3 of the secret word?)
  S: absent → ""x""
  P: absent → ""x""

But note: the feedback for R and I in CRISP is ""✓"", meaning:
  - The secret word has R in the second position.
  - The secret word has I in the third position.

Also, from the first guess, we knew R was present (but not at position 1). Now we know it is at position 2.

Additionally, from CRISP, we know:
  C, S, P are absent → we can add them to the exclusion list.

So, letters we know are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P.

Letters we know are present: R (at position 2) and I (at position 3).

Also, since the secret word has R at position 2 and I at position 3, we know the word has at least the pattern: _ R I _ _

We have 5 positions:

Position 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters. And note that we don't know what letter is here, but it cannot be O, A, T, E, C, S, P.
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: unknown (and must not be O, A, T, E, C, S, P, or R,I? Wait, R and I are already used, but since R is in position 2, it can appear again? But typically in these games, letters can repeat? However, the feedback doesn't explicitly say whether duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven't encountered duplicates yet. To be safe, we can assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise. Because if there were duplicates, we might have seen feedback indicating a duplicate.

Looking back at the feedback for ROATE: R was present (but not position 1) and we had no indication of a duplicate. Similarly, in CRISP, we had only one R and one I. So let's assume for now the word has no duplicate letters.

Therefore, positions 1, 4, and 5 must be letters not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P} and also not R or I? But R and I are already used? So we need three new distinct letters that are not excluded and not R or I.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

where letter1, letter4, letter5 are:
  - Not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I} (so avoiding 9 letters: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I)
  - They must be English letters we haven't tried yet.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _, and uses only letters from the remaining set.

We have to pick a valid English word. Also, we want to maximize coverage of new letters? We have only three positions to fill.

Possible words that come to mind:
  BRING? -> B R I N G -> which has G and N, which are untested? But note: we must avoid taken letters? B is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed. However, BRING has an N and a G. But also, note: the pattern must have R at 2 and I at 3: so B R I N G -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

Check: letters in BRING: B,R,I,N,G -> R and I are known to be at positions 2 and 3? Yes. The others: B, N, G are allowed? Yes, they haven't been tested.

But note: in CRISP we got feedback that S and P are absent. We also excluded O,A,T,E,C. So BRING uses only fresh letters and fits the pattern? But we don't know if N and G are in the word? This guess might be the solution? Or it might test new letters.

Wait: the word must be valid and we don't know the secret word. So BRING is a valid guess.

Alternatively, we might think of other words:
  FRISK? -> F R I S K, but S is forbidden? We know S is absent (from Guess 2: S got ""x""). So we cannot use S.

  Another: PRINT -> P R I N T -> but P and T are excluded. T is excluded from the first guess? Yes: T got ""x"" in ROATE? First guess: T was absent? Yes, T got ""x"" in ROATE? Actually: In ROATE: A was in pos3 and got ""x"", T was in pos4 and got ""x"". So T is excluded. Therefore PRINT is invalid because it uses P and T? P is excluded? Guess2: P got ""x"", so P is absent. T we already know is absent.

  Another: DRINK -> D R I N K -> D, N, K are fresh? And the pattern fits: _ R I N K.

  Similarly: GRIND -> G R I N D -> G, N, D fresh.

  Or: BRINK: B R I N K -> B, N, K fresh.

  Also: FRIGID? too long? 5 letters: FRICK? -> not a word. FRUIT? -> F R U I T -> but U is in position 4? But U is allowed? Actually: FRUIT would have I at position 4? But we need position 3 to be I? So no.

Let's list possible words matching the pattern _ R I _ _ with the constraints.

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? but we also have to form a word.

Words that come to mind:
  BRING (as above)
  BRINK
  DRINK
  GRINS? -> but S is excluded? We cannot use S? So GRIN? is 4 letters? We need 5 letter words? So GRINS is not allowed if we cannot use S? And S is excluded.

Alternatively:
  FRIAR? -> but second R? We don't know if duplicate R is allowed? And also A is excluded? Wait: A is absent? So no.

  PRICE? -> uses P (absent) and E (absent) -> no.

After thinking, valid words:
  BRING: B R I N G -> uses B, N, G
  BRINK: B R I N K -> uses B, N, K
  DRINK: D R I N K -> D, N, K
  GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, M, Y
  KRIS? -> too short.

But note: we have only 3 unknown positions? Actually two: positions 4 and 5? No: position 1,4,5.

Wait, the pattern: position1: ?, position4: ?, position5: ?.

So we must choose a word that starts with a letter in the available set and ends with two letters also in the available set? And contains only allowed letters.

Let me think of a common word: BRING is common? Yes.

Also: FRISK: we cannot because S is excluded.

Another: WRING -> W R I N G -> W, N, G? W is allowed? Yes.

Similarly: PRIG? -> too short? No, 5 letter? PRIG is 4? PRIGY? not a word.

We should avoid using letters that are rare? But N, G, K, etc. are common.

Now: how to choose? We are testing as many letters as possible? We have three unknown letters? Since we are at guess 3, we want to maximize information? But also we might solve it? But that would be lucky.

If we guess BRING and it's wrong, we get feedback on B, N, G? Which is good? But note: position 4 and 5 are also unknown.

We could test multiple possibilities? For example, if we test B, N, G in BRING, then we get:
  If B is correct? Then we have B at position1? And then N and G? Which might be correct or not.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that covers more common letters? The remaining common letters? Common consonants: L, N, H, etc.

But note: we have many options: we don't need to cover all, but we need information.

But since we know the pattern is ? R I ? ?, we can pick a word that uses common letters? But also we want to test possible letters.

I think BRING is a solid choice? But let me see:

Common bigrams after ""I""? Often: NG, NK, ND, etc.

So we can try BRING? which tests B, N, G.

Alternatively, if we choose H R I N G -> HRING? Not a valid word? Or BRINK? Then tests B, N, K.

Another word: GRIND: G R I N D -> tests G, N, D? D is less common? But valid.

Wait: what about U? We haven't tested U? But U is a vowel? Maybe the word is BRINY? B R I N Y -> N and Y? Y can be a consonant or vowel? Valid word? Yes.

Or FRITZ: F R I T Z -> but T is absent? So no.

After considering, BRING is a very common word? So I'll go with that? Because it's common and we don't have any clues for the other letters.

But note: we have multiple possibilities? So to avoid burning a guess? We should try to test as many new letters as possible? For example, instead of using N (which appears in many words), we might test a different set? But then we lose coverage? Actually, N is common? So testing N might be good.

Let me look for a word that uses unique letters? For example, that doesn't reuse letters? But we must use distinct letters? But the secret word might reuse? But we have no evidence? So we guess distinct.

Now: in BRING, we use three new letters: B, N, G. This is good? Because we test all three at once. If they are all correct, we win? If one is wrong, we get feedback? Then based on that, we can guess again? Since we have 4 tries left? Wait: we have 3 guesses so far? This is the third? Wait: Guess1, Guess2, now Guess3? Then we have three more left? So we can afford to test.

But we might be able to cover more if we don't fix N and G? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might try a word that uses letters that appear in many possible words? For example, N appears in BRINK, BRING, etc. So if we get N present? Then we know position4?

But I think guessing BRING is reasonable? Also, note: the secret word might be BRINK? Or something else? But we don't know? So we test.

To be systematic, we can think of the candidate list? But without knowing? We guess.

I decided to guess BRING? Because it fits and tests common letters.

But wait: the feedback from Guess2? In Guess2 CRISP? We got R(✓) and I(✓) meaning positions 2 and 3? Also, C, S, P absent? So we are safe using B, N, G? Which haven't been tried? And avoiding the excluded ones.

So: let's guess BRING? But note: BRING: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

If the secret word were BRINK? Then we would get B? How? Position1: B -> if secret is BRINK? Then both start with B? So we get ""✓"" for B? Then position4: N vs K? So ""x"" for N? Because K is the actual letter? And position5: G vs K? So G would be absent? And K is present? But wait? We don't have K in BRING? So we wouldn't know? Actually? The secret word BRINK has one K? At position5? So in BRING? We have G at position5? Then feedback: 
  position1: B (if secret starts with B? then ✓) else? 
  position4: N (if secret has N? then feedback depends? If secret is BRINK? Then secret position4 is N? Wait: BRINK:1:B,2:R,3:I,4:N,5:K? So position4 is N? Then if we guess BRING? which has N at position4? That would match? Wait no: BRING has G at position5? So:
  Guess: B R I N G
  Secret: B R I N K

Then feedback: 
  position1: B ✓
  position2: R ✓
  position3: I ✓
  position4: N ✓? Because it's the correct letter? Wait: N is correct? So ✓? Then position5: G vs K -> G is not K? And K is in the secret? But we have no information? So? Actually: 
  The secret has K? And we guessed G? So G is absent? So position5: x? 

Therefore: feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)? But we don't know that K is present? Only that G is absent? And we have three correct so far? Then we would know the word ends with K? But only if we get that three ✓ and one x.

But we don't? Because if we get BRING guess? And the secret is BRINK? Then we have positions1-4 correct? So ✓ for B, R, I, N? and x for G? Which tells us position5 is not G? So we know the word is B R I N ??? But? Actually? The feedback does not tell us that K is in the word? Only that G is not? And we already know G is absent? Then we must try other letters? So we lose a guess? 

But that's unavoidable.

In this case, with BRING? We risk that position4 being N? And position5 being something else? We have many possibilities? For example, if N is correct at position4? Then we need to test the last letter? If not? Then we know position4 is not N.

So? I think BRING is a valid guess? And we'll see.

But to be strategic? Maybe we can choose a word that doesn't assume N at position4? For example? We don't know what letter is at position4? So we can guess a word that uses all new letters? But uses a letter that is more common? Or in a more common position? 

But? If we don't fix N? Then we have more uncertainty? For example? If we guess a word where position4 is not N? Then we test a different set? For instance? GRIMY: G R I M Y -> tests G, M, Y? Which are less common? Hence? BRING? with N in position4? N is a common ending? So? It might be likely? Actually? In English? The position after I? Common? For example? In words ending with ""ING""? So BRING? CRING? But C is excluded? So BRING? FRING? Not that common? But BRING? That's a word.

After consideration? I'll go with BRING? Because? It is a common word? And we test N? Which is a common letter? And G? Also common? So? Let's choose that? Of you agree?

Let's note: if the secret word is BRING? Then we get five ✓ and win? Else? We get feedback on B, N, G.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. 
 There is no feedback yet since it's the first turn.
 A good starting word should have common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"" are often good starters.
 Let me choose a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""ROAST"":
   R, O, A, S, T -> all fairly common.

 Another is ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E -> includes A and E, and common consonants.

 Another is ""SLATE"":
   S, L, A, T, E -> has S, T, A, E which are common.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let me ensure ""CRANE"" is a 5-letter word: yes, it is.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE<thought>
For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained. A strong starter typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to test multiple positions at once. Based on English letter frequency, vowels like A, E and consonants like R, S, T, N are ideal. 

The word ""ROATE"" is statistically effective—it contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T), covering five distinct letters. Alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also popular, but ""ROATE"" ranks highly in solving efficiency for similar games. It's a valid word (meaning a financial yield curve) that adheres to the rules.

This guess will test:
- High-frequency letters: R, A, E, T, O
- Positions of all letters simultaneously
- Quickly reveal potential vowels/consonants in the secret word

Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ROATE -> R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with ""-"" meaning wrong position).
   - O, A, T, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").

 Important deductions:
 1. The secret word contains the letter R, but it is not in the first position (since our guess had R in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position, meaning R is present elsewhere).
 2. The letters O, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 1, and the word is 5 letters, R must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we must avoid using O, A, T, E in any new guess because they are not in the secret word.

 Now, for the next guess, we need:
   - To include R, but not in the first position (try it in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - To avoid the letters O, A, T, E entirely.

 Also, we want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet. Common consonants: S, L, N, I, C, U, etc. (but note U is a vowel and we haven't tested it).

 Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new common letters as possible and arrange R in a different position.

 Let's recall: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. So we should try R in one of the remaining positions.

 Common 5-letter words without O, A, T, E? 

 We can think of words that have R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 and use other common letters.

 Example positions for R:
   Position 2: e.g., CR? but C is not tested -> but note we must avoid O,A,T,E.
   Position 3: e.g., ? R ? ? ?
   Position 4: e.g., ? ? R ? ?
   Position 5: e.g., ? ? ? ? R

 Also note: We have not tested the vowels I, U (since O, A, E are out). We should test one of them to see if they are present? But the secret word must have vowels too.

 However, the feedback tells us that O, A, E are absent, so the vowels must be from I, U, or sometimes Y. But Y is less common.

 Possible vowels: I, U, Y.

 We should try to include one or two vowels that haven't been tested? But also consonants.

 Since R is the only known letter, we can try a word that has R in a different position and introduces new common letters.

 List of potential words without O,A,T,E and with R in a position other than 1:

 Common words:
   With R in position 2: 
      CRISP -> but C,R,I,S,P -> no O,A,T,E -> acceptable? Let's check letters: C, R, I, S, P. 
      However, we have to avoid using known absent letters: O,A,T,E are absent, so this is okay.
      But we don't know if these letters are present. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

   With R in position 3:
      PINCH -> but no R. 
      WORD: SHIRK -> S,H,I,R,K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> avoids O,A,T,E.
      WORD: SPUR? -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   With R in position 4:
      PLUMB? -> but no R. Instead, consider: WINCH? -> but no R. 
      WORD: BLUR? -> too short. 
      WORD: SQUID -> no R.

   With R in position 5:
      MINOR -> but has O -> not allowed. 
      OTHER: RIGID -> R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1. So if we try a word with R in position 5? 
        WORD: LUMPS -> no R.
        WORD: VIVID -> no R.

 After review, let's try to get R in position 2 or 3 or 4 and include new common letters.

 I think CRISP is a good candidate:
   It has R in position 2 (which is a position R could potentially be, since it was not in position 1).
   It introduces new common letters: C, I, S, P.

 Alternatively, consider SHIRK: 
   R is in position 4, and introduces S, H, I, K.

 Another option: PRICK -> P,R,I,C,K -> R in position 2? Actually position 2? P is position 1 -> wait: 
   P R I C K -> R is in position 2? But the feedback said R was in the word but not position 1, so placing R in position 2 is allowed? 
   However, in the feedback of the first guess, R was in position 1 and was wrong. The secret word has R, but we don't know where. So putting R in position 2 in the new guess is acceptable.

 But note: we must use only letters that are not O,A,T,E and try to cover new ones.

 Considering CRISP:
   - We place R in position 2 (which is a new position).
   - We test C (common consonant), I (vowel), S (common consonant), P (common consonant).

 This gives us a lot of new information.

 Another word: BRICK -> has B,R,I,C,K -> avoids O,A,T,E. R is in position 2 again.

 However, note: the feedback told us that R is in the word. But we don't know if it's in multiple positions? Probably not, we just need to find one occurrence.

 Let me compare common words: 
   CRISP: uses C, R, I, S, P -> all new letters. This is very efficient for gathering information.

 But note: we must not use the letter E (which is excluded) and we are not using O,A,T.

 Important: The guess must be a valid English word. CRISP is valid.

 Now, what about placing R in a position that wasn't position 1? Our feedback said R was not in position 1. CRISP has R in position 2 -> which is allowed.

 Let's choose CRISP.

 Alternatively, we might consider using the vowel U? But since I is also a vowel and more common, testing I might be better.

 After consideration, I'll go with CRISP.

 But note: we are avoiding E, which is good. So:

 Guess: CRISP -> C(position1), R(position2), I(position3), S(position4), P(position5).

 Let's hope this gives us more information.

 If the secret word doesn't have R in position 2, then we get a ""-"" for R again? Which tells us R is in another position.

 We have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 total tries, but we used one, so 5 left. This is our second guess.

 Therefore, we'll guess CRISP.<thought>
The feedback from the first guess (ROATE → R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)) reveals:
- R is in the secret word but NOT in the first position.
- O, A, T, E are ABSENT from the secret word.

Therefore:
1. Avoid using O, A, T, E in the next guess.
2. Include R in a position other than 1 (positions 2–5).
3. Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters not yet attempted (e.g., I, S, C, N, L).

Given this context:
- Common vowels still untested: I, U, Y (I is most frequent).
- Common consonants still untested: S, N, L, C, H, etc.
- A strong candidate word should include R (not in position 1), introduce multiple new letters, and omit forbidden characters.

Optimal strategy: Guess **CRISP** because:
- It places R in position 2 (the first valid alternative to position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (C, S, P) and the vowel I.
- It omits forbidden letters (O, A, T, E).
- The word is valid and maximizes potential letter/position information.

<guess>CRISP</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position → ""-"" (so R is in the word, not at position 1)
  O, A, T, E: absent → ""x""

Second guess: CRISP
  C: absent → ""x""
  R: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning R is in position 2 of the secret word?)
  I: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning I is in position 3 of the secret word?)
  S: absent → ""x""
  P: absent → ""x""

But note: the feedback for R and I in CRISP is ""✓"", meaning:
  - The secret word has R in the second position.
  - The secret word has I in the third position.

Also, from the first guess, we knew R was present (but not at position 1). Now we know it is at position 2.

Additionally, from CRISP, we know:
  C, S, P are absent → we can add them to the exclusion list.

So, letters we know are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P.

Letters we know are present: R (at position 2) and I (at position 3).

Also, since the secret word has R at position 2 and I at position 3, we know the word has at least the pattern: _ R I _ _

We have 5 positions:

Position 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters. And note that we don't know what letter is here, but it cannot be O, A, T, E, C, S, P.
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: unknown (and must not be O, A, T, E, C, S, P, or R,I? Wait, R and I are already used, but since R is in position 2, it can appear again? But typically in these games, letters can repeat? However, the feedback doesn't explicitly say whether duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven't encountered duplicates yet. To be safe, we can assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise. Because if there were duplicates, we might have seen feedback indicating a duplicate.

Looking back at the feedback for ROATE: R was present (but not position 1) and we had no indication of a duplicate. Similarly, in CRISP, we had only one R and one I. So let's assume for now the word has no duplicate letters.

Therefore, positions 1, 4, and 5 must be letters not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P} and also not R or I? But R and I are already used? So we need three new distinct letters that are not excluded and not R or I.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

where letter1, letter4, letter5 are:
  - Not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I} (so avoiding 9 letters: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I)
  - They must be English letters we haven't tried yet.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _, and uses only letters from the remaining set.

We have to pick a valid English word. Also, we want to maximize coverage of new letters? We have only three positions to fill.

Possible words that come to mind:
  BRING? -> B R I N G -> which has G and N, which are untested? But note: we must avoid taken letters? B is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed. However, BRING has an N and a G. But also, note: the pattern must have R at 2 and I at 3: so B R I N G -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

Check: letters in BRING: B,R,I,N,G -> R and I are known to be at positions 2 and 3? Yes. The others: B, N, G are allowed? Yes, they haven't been tested.

But note: in CRISP we got feedback that S and P are absent. We also excluded O,A,T,E,C. So BRING uses only fresh letters and fits the pattern? But we don't know if N and G are in the word? This guess might be the solution? Or it might test new letters.

Wait: the word must be valid and we don't know the secret word. So BRING is a valid guess.

Alternatively, we might think of other words:
  FRISK? -> F R I S K, but S is forbidden? We know S is absent (from Guess 2: S got ""x""). So we cannot use S.

  Another: PRINT -> P R I N T -> but P and T are excluded. T is excluded from the first guess? Yes: T got ""x"" in ROATE? First guess: T was absent? Yes, T got ""x"" in ROATE? Actually: In ROATE: A was in pos3 and got ""x"", T was in pos4 and got ""x"". So T is excluded. Therefore PRINT is invalid because it uses P and T? P is excluded? Guess2: P got ""x"", so P is absent. T we already know is absent.

  Another: DRINK -> D R I N K -> D, N, K are fresh? And the pattern fits: _ R I N K.

  Similarly: GRIND -> G R I N D -> G, N, D fresh.

  Or: BRINK: B R I N K -> B, N, K fresh.

  Also: FRIGID? too long? 5 letters: FRICK? -> not a word. FRUIT? -> F R U I T -> but U is in position 4? But U is allowed? Actually: FRUIT would have I at position 4? But we need position 3 to be I? So no.

Let's list possible words matching the pattern _ R I _ _ with the constraints.

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? but we also have to form a word.

Words that come to mind:
  BRING (as above)
  BRINK
  DRINK
  GRINS? -> but S is excluded? We cannot use S? So GRIN? is 4 letters? We need 5 letter words? So GRINS is not allowed if we cannot use S? And S is excluded.

Alternatively:
  FRIAR? -> but second R? We don't know if duplicate R is allowed? And also A is excluded? Wait: A is absent? So no.

  PRICE? -> uses P (absent) and E (absent) -> no.

After thinking, valid words:
  BRING: B R I N G -> uses B, N, G
  BRINK: B R I N K -> uses B, N, K
  DRINK: D R I N K -> D, N, K
  GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, M, Y
  KRIS? -> too short.

But note: we have only 3 unknown positions? Actually two: positions 4 and 5? No: position 1,4,5.

Wait, the pattern: position1: ?, position4: ?, position5: ?.

So we must choose a word that starts with a letter in the available set and ends with two letters also in the available set? And contains only allowed letters.

Let me think of a common word: BRING is common? Yes.

Also: FRISK: we cannot because S is excluded.

Another: WRING -> W R I N G -> W, N, G? W is allowed? Yes.

Similarly: PRIG? -> too short? No, 5 letter? PRIG is 4? PRIGY? not a word.

We should avoid using letters that are rare? But N, G, K, etc. are common.

Now: how to choose? We are testing as many letters as possible? We have three unknown letters? Since we are at guess 3, we want to maximize information? But also we might solve it? But that would be lucky.

If we guess BRING and it's wrong, we get feedback on B, N, G? Which is good? But note: position 4 and 5 are also unknown.

We could test multiple possibilities? For example, if we test B, N, G in BRING, then we get:
  If B is correct? Then we have B at position1? And then N and G? Which might be correct or not.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that covers more common letters? The remaining common letters? Common consonants: L, N, H, etc.

But note: we have many options: we don't need to cover all, but we need information.

But since we know the pattern is ? R I ? ?, we can pick a word that uses common letters? But also we want to test possible letters.

I think BRING is a solid choice? But let me see:

Common bigrams after ""I""? Often: NG, NK, ND, etc.

So we can try BRING? which tests B, N, G.

Alternatively, if we choose H R I N G -> HRING? Not a valid word? Or BRINK? Then tests B, N, K.

Another word: GRIND: G R I N D -> tests G, N, D? D is less common? But valid.

Wait: what about U? We haven't tested U? But U is a vowel? Maybe the word is BRINY? B R I N Y -> N and Y? Y can be a consonant or vowel? Valid word? Yes.

Or FRITZ: F R I T Z -> but T is absent? So no.

After considering, BRING is a very common word? So I'll go with that? Because it's common and we don't have any clues for the other letters.

But note: we have multiple possibilities? So to avoid burning a guess? We should try to test as many new letters as possible? For example, instead of using N (which appears in many words), we might test a different set? But then we lose coverage? Actually, N is common? So testing N might be good.

Let me look for a word that uses unique letters? For example, that doesn't reuse letters? But we must use distinct letters? But the secret word might reuse? But we have no evidence? So we guess distinct.

Now: in BRING, we use three new letters: B, N, G. This is good? Because we test all three at once. If they are all correct, we win? If one is wrong, we get feedback? Then based on that, we can guess again? Since we have 4 tries left? Wait: we have 3 guesses so far? This is the third? Wait: Guess1, Guess2, now Guess3? Then we have three more left? So we can afford to test.

But we might be able to cover more if we don't fix N and G? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might try a word that uses letters that appear in many possible words? For example, N appears in BRINK, BRING, etc. So if we get N present? Then we know position4?

But I think guessing BRING is reasonable? Also, note: the secret word might be BRINK? Or something else? But we don't know? So we test.

To be systematic, we can think of the candidate list? But without knowing? We guess.

I decided to guess BRING? Because it fits and tests common letters.

But wait: the feedback from Guess2? In Guess2 CRISP? We got R(✓) and I(✓) meaning positions 2 and 3? Also, C, S, P absent? So we are safe using B, N, G? Which haven't been tried? And avoiding the excluded ones.

So: let's guess BRING? But note: BRING: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

If the secret word were BRINK? Then we would get B? How? Position1: B -> if secret is BRINK? Then both start with B? So we get ""✓"" for B? Then position4: N vs K? So ""x"" for N? Because K is the actual letter? And position5: G vs K? So G would be absent? And K is present? But wait? We don't have K in BRING? So we wouldn't know? Actually? The secret word BRINK has one K? At position5? So in BRING? We have G at position5? Then feedback: 
  position1: B (if secret starts with B? then ✓) else? 
  position4: N (if secret has N? then feedback depends? If secret is BRINK? Then secret position4 is N? Wait: BRINK:1:B,2:R,3:I,4:N,5:K? So position4 is N? Then if we guess BRING? which has N at position4? That would match? Wait no: BRING has G at position5? So:
  Guess: B R I N G
  Secret: B R I N K

Then feedback: 
  position1: B ✓
  position2: R ✓
  position3: I ✓
  position4: N ✓? Because it's the correct letter? Wait: N is correct? So ✓? Then position5: G vs K -> G is not K? And K is in the secret? But we have no information? So? Actually: 
  The secret has K? And we guessed G? So G is absent? So position5: x? 

Therefore: feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)? But we don't know that K is present? Only that G is absent? And we have three correct so far? Then we would know the word ends with K? But only if we get that three ✓ and one x.

But we don't? Because if we get BRING guess? And the secret is BRINK? Then we have positions1-4 correct? So ✓ for B, R, I, N? and x for G? Which tells us position5 is not G? So we know the word is B R I N ??? But? Actually? The feedback does not tell us that K is in the word? Only that G is not? And we already know G is absent? Then we must try other letters? So we lose a guess? 

But that's unavoidable.

In this case, with BRING? We risk that position4 being N? And position5 being something else? We have many possibilities? For example, if N is correct at position4? Then we need to test the last letter? If not? Then we know position4 is not N.

So? I think BRING is a valid guess? And we'll see.

But to be strategic? Maybe we can choose a word that doesn't assume N at position4? For example? We don't know what letter is at position4? So we can guess a word that uses all new letters? But uses a letter that is more common? Or in a more common position? 

But? If we don't fix N? Then we have more uncertainty? For example? If we guess a word where position4 is not N? Then we test a different set? For instance? GRIMY: G R I M Y -> tests G, M, Y? Which are less common? Hence? BRING? with N in position4? N is a common ending? So? It might be likely? Actually? In English? The position after I? Common? For example? In words ending with ""ING""? So BRING? CRING? But C is excluded? So BRING? FRING? Not that common? But BRING? That's a word.

After consideration? I'll go with BRING? Because? It is a common word? And we test N? Which is a common letter? And G? Also common? So? Let's choose that? Of you agree?

Let's note: if the secret word is BRING? Then we get five ✓ and win? Else? We get feedback on B, N, G.

Therefore? Let's guess BRING?<thought>
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- Secret word contains R in position 2 and I in position 3 → pattern: _ R I _ _
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E (from Guess 1), and C, S, P (from Guess 2)
- Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Given pattern _ R I _ _ and exclusions:
- Position 1 must be one of the available consonants/vowels (likely consonant given English words).
- Positions 4 and 5 must be available letters, distinct from R/I and exclusions.

Optimal strategy: Guess a valid word matching this pattern while maximizing information:
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, L, U) → ""N"" and ""G"" are common.
- ""BRING"" is a valid choice: tests new letters B, N, G, with ""N"" in a common bigram (""IN"") and ""G"" in common trigram (""ING"").
- Alternatives like BRINK, DRINK risk similar letters (e.g., ""K"" vs. ""G"") without additional coverage.
- ""BRING"" covers three new letters efficiently and provides immediate feedback on high-frequency positions/postfixes.
</thought>

<guess>BRING</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ROATE → R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → R present (wrong position), O/A/T/E absent  
- Guess 2: CRISP → C(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), P(x) → R correct at position 2, I correct at position 3, C/S/P absent  

Deductions:  
- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _  
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Strategic goal:  
- Guess a valid word matching the pattern _ R I _ _ using untested letters to maximize information.  
- Prioritize common letters and plausible endings (e.g., ""N"" and ""G"" in ""ING"" bigrams).  

Selected word: **BRING**  
- Tests B (position 1), N (position 4), G (position 5) → three new common letters  
- ""BRING"" is a common English word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

The letters O, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.\n\n Since R is in the word but not in position 1, and the word is 5 letters, R must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Additionally, we must avoid using O, A, T, E in any new guess because they are not in the secret word.\n\n Now, for the next guess, we need:\n   - To include R, but not in the first position (try it in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n   - To avoid the letters O, A, T, E entirely.\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet. Common consonants: S, L, N, I, C, U, etc. (but note U is a vowel and we haven\'t tested it).\n\n Letters we haven\'t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many new common letters as possible and arrange R in a different position.\n\n Let\'s recall: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 1. So we should try R in one of the remaining positions.\n\n Common 5-letter words without O, A, T, E? \n\n We can think of words that have R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 and use other common letters.\n\n Example positions for R:\n   Position 2: e.g., CR? but C is not tested -> but note we must avoid O,A,T,E.\n   Position 3: e.g., ? R ? ? ?\n   Position 4: e.g., ? ? R ? ?\n   Position 5: e.g., ? ? ? ? R\n\n Also note: We have not tested the vowels I, U (since O, A, E are out). We should test one of them to see if they are present? But the secret word must have vowels too.\n\n However, the feedback tells us that O, A, E are absent, so the vowels must be from I, U, or sometimes Y. But Y is less common.\n\n Possible vowels: I, U, Y.\n\n We should try to include one or two vowels that haven\'t been tested? But also consonants.\n\n Since R is the only known letter, we can try a word that has R in a different position and introduces new common letters.\n\n List of potential words without O,A,T,E and with R in a position other than 1:\n\n Common words:\n   With R in position 2: \n      CRISP -> but C,R,I,S,P -> no O,A,T,E -> acceptable? Let\'s check letters: C, R, I, S, P. \n      However, we have to avoid using known absent letters: O,A,T,E are absent, so this is okay.\n      But we don\'t know if these letters are present. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n   With R in position 3:\n      PINCH -> but no R. \n      WORD: SHIRK -> S,H,I,R,K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> avoids O,A,T,E.\n      WORD: SPUR? -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n   With R in position 4:\n      PLUMB? -> but no R. Instead, consider: WINCH? -> but no R. \n      WORD: BLUR? -> too short. \n      WORD: SQUID -> no R.\n\n   With R in position 5:\n      MINOR -> but has O -> not allowed. \n      OTHER: RIGID -> R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1. So if we try a word with R in position 5? \n        WORD: LUMPS -> no R.\n        WORD: VIVID -> no R.\n\n After review, let\'s try to get R in position 2 or 3 or 4 and include new common letters.\n\n I think CRISP is a good candidate:\n   It has R in position 2 (which is a position R could potentially be, since it was not in position 1).\n   It introduces new common letters: C, I, S, P.\n\n Alternatively, consider SHIRK: \n   R is in position 4, and introduces S, H, I, K.\n\n Another option: PRICK -> P,R,I,C,K -> R in position 2? Actually position 2? P is position 1 -> wait: \n   P R I C K -> R is in position 2? But the feedback said R was in the word but not position 1, so placing R in position 2 is allowed? \n   However, in the feedback of the first guess, R was in position 1 and was wrong. The secret word has R, but we don\'t know where. So putting R in position 2 in the new guess is acceptable.\n\n But note: we must use only letters that are not O,A,T,E and try to cover new ones.\n\n Considering CRISP:\n   - We place R in position 2 (which is a new position).\n   - We test C (common consonant), I (vowel), S (common consonant), P (common consonant).\n\n This gives us a lot of new information.\n\n Another word: BRICK -> has B,R,I,C,K -> avoids O,A,T,E. R is in position 2 again.\n\n However, note: the feedback told us that R is in the word. But we don\'t know if it\'s in multiple positions? Probably not, we just need to find one occurrence.\n\n Let me compare common words: \n   CRISP: uses C, R, I, S, P -> all new letters. This is very efficient for gathering information.\n\n But note: we must not use the letter E (which is excluded) and we are not using O,A,T.\n\n Important: The guess must be a valid English word. CRISP is valid.\n\n Now, what about placing R in a position that wasn\'t position 1? Our feedback said R was not in position 1. CRISP has R in position 2 -> which is allowed.\n\n Let\'s choose CRISP.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider using the vowel U? But since I is also a vowel and more common, testing I might be better.\n\n After consideration, I\'ll go with CRISP.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E, which is good. So:\n\n Guess: CRISP -> C(position1), R(position2), I(position3), S(position4), P(position5).\n\n Let\'s hope this gives us more information.\n\n If the secret word doesn\'t have R in position 2, then we get a ""-"" for R again? Which tells us R is in another position.\n\n We have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 total tries, but we used one, so 5 left. This is our second guess.\n\n Therefore, we\'ll guess CRISP.<thought>\nThe feedback from the first guess (ROATE → R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)) reveals:\n- R is in the secret word but NOT in the first position.\n- O, A, T, E are ABSENT from the secret word.\n\nTherefore:\n1. Avoid using O, A, T, E in the next guess.\n2. Include R in a position other than 1 (positions 2–5).\n3. Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters not yet attempted (e.g., I, S, C, N, L).\n\nGiven this context:\n- Common vowels still untested: I, U, Y (I is most frequent).\n- Common consonants still untested: S, N, L, C, H, etc.\n- A strong candidate word should include R (not in position 1), introduce multiple new letters, and omit forbidden characters.\n\nOptimal strategy: Guess **CRISP** because:\n- It places R in position 2 (the first valid alternative to position 1).\n- It introduces three new common consonants (C, S, P) and the vowel I.\n- It omits forbidden letters (O, A, T, E).\n- The word is valid and maximizes potential letter/position information.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>CRISP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ROATE\n  R: present but wrong position → ""-"" (so R is in the word, not at position 1)\n  O, A, T, E: absent → ""x""\n\nSecond guess: CRISP\n  C: absent → ""x""\n  R: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning R is in position 2 of the secret word?)\n  I: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning I is in position 3 of the secret word?)\n  S: absent → ""x""\n  P: absent → ""x""\n\nBut note: the feedback for R and I in CRISP is ""✓"", meaning:\n  - The secret word has R in the second position.\n  - The secret word has I in the third position.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew R was present (but not at position 1). Now we know it is at position 2.\n\nAdditionally, from CRISP, we know:\n  C, S, P are absent → we can add them to the exclusion list.\n\nSo, letters we know are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P.\n\nLetters we know are present: R (at position 2) and I (at position 3).\n\nAlso, since the secret word has R at position 2 and I at position 3, we know the word has at least the pattern: _ R I _ _\n\nWe have 5 positions:\n\nPosition 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters. And note that we don\'t know what letter is here, but it cannot be O, A, T, E, C, S, P.\nPosition 2: R (fixed)\nPosition 3: I (fixed)\nPosition 4: unknown (and must not be O, A, T, E, C, S, P, or R,I? Wait, R and I are already used, but since R is in position 2, it can appear again? But typically in these games, letters can repeat? However, the feedback doesn\'t explicitly say whether duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet. To be safe, we can assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise. Because if there were duplicates, we might have seen feedback indicating a duplicate.\n\nLooking back at the feedback for ROATE: R was present (but not position 1) and we had no indication of a duplicate. Similarly, in CRISP, we had only one R and one I. So let\'s assume for now the word has no duplicate letters.\n\nTherefore, positions 1, 4, and 5 must be letters not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P} and also not R or I? But R and I are already used? So we need three new distinct letters that are not excluded and not R or I.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nwhere letter1, letter4, letter5 are:\n  - Not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I} (so avoiding 9 letters: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I)\n  - They must be English letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we must choose a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _, and uses only letters from the remaining set.\n\nWe have to pick a valid English word. Also, we want to maximize coverage of new letters? We have only three positions to fill.\n\nPossible words that come to mind:\n  BRING? -> B R I N G -> which has G and N, which are untested? But note: we must avoid taken letters? B is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed. However, BRING has an N and a G. But also, note: the pattern must have R at 2 and I at 3: so B R I N G -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.\n\nCheck: letters in BRING: B,R,I,N,G -> R and I are known to be at positions 2 and 3? Yes. The others: B, N, G are allowed? Yes, they haven\'t been tested.\n\nBut note: in CRISP we got feedback that S and P are absent. We also excluded O,A,T,E,C. So BRING uses only fresh letters and fits the pattern? But we don\'t know if N and G are in the word? This guess might be the solution? Or it might test new letters.\n\nWait: the word must be valid and we don\'t know the secret word. So BRING is a valid guess.\n\nAlternatively, we might think of other words:\n  FRISK? -> F R I S K, but S is forbidden? We know S is absent (from Guess 2: S got ""x""). So we cannot use S.\n\n  Another: PRINT -> P R I N T -> but P and T are excluded. T is excluded from the first guess? Yes: T got ""x"" in ROATE? First guess: T was absent? Yes, T got ""x"" in ROATE? Actually: In ROATE: A was in pos3 and got ""x"", T was in pos4 and got ""x"". So T is excluded. Therefore PRINT is invalid because it uses P and T? P is excluded? Guess2: P got ""x"", so P is absent. T we already know is absent.\n\n  Another: DRINK -> D R I N K -> D, N, K are fresh? And the pattern fits: _ R I N K.\n\n  Similarly: GRIND -> G R I N D -> G, N, D fresh.\n\n  Or: BRINK: B R I N K -> B, N, K fresh.\n\n  Also: FRIGID? too long? 5 letters: FRICK? -> not a word. FRUIT? -> F R U I T -> but U is in position 4? But U is allowed? Actually: FRUIT would have I at position 4? But we need position 3 to be I? So no.\n\nLet\'s list possible words matching the pattern _ R I _ _ with the constraints.\n\nPossible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? but we also have to form a word.\n\nWords that come to mind:\n  BRING (as above)\n  BRINK\n  DRINK\n  GRINS? -> but S is excluded? We cannot use S? So GRIN? is 4 letters? We need 5 letter words? So GRINS is not allowed if we cannot use S? And S is excluded.\n\nAlternatively:\n  FRIAR? -> but second R? We don\'t know if duplicate R is allowed? And also A is excluded? Wait: A is absent? So no.\n\n  PRICE? -> uses P (absent) and E (absent) -> no.\n\nAfter thinking, valid words:\n  BRING: B R I N G -> uses B, N, G\n  BRINK: B R I N K -> uses B, N, K\n  DRINK: D R I N K -> D, N, K\n  GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, M, Y\n  KRIS? -> too short.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 unknown positions? Actually two: positions 4 and 5? No: position 1,4,5.\n\nWait, the pattern: position1: ?, position4: ?, position5: ?.\n\nSo we must choose a word that starts with a letter in the available set and ends with two letters also in the available set? And contains only allowed letters.\n\nLet me think of a common word: BRING is common? Yes.\n\nAlso: FRISK: we cannot because S is excluded.\n\nAnother: WRING -> W R I N G -> W, N, G? W is allowed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly: PRIG? -> too short? No, 5 letter? PRIG is 4? PRIGY? not a word.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are rare? But N, G, K, etc. are common.\n\nNow: how to choose? We are testing as many letters as possible? We have three unknown letters? Since we are at guess 3, we want to maximize information? But also we might solve it? But that would be lucky.\n\nIf we guess BRING and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on B, N, G? Which is good? But note: position 4 and 5 are also unknown.\n\nWe could test multiple possibilities? For example, if we test B, N, G in BRING, then we get:\n  If B is correct? Then we have B at position1? And then N and G? Which might be correct or not.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that covers more common letters? The remaining common letters? Common consonants: L, N, H, etc.\n\nBut note: we have many options: we don\'t need to cover all, but we need information.\n\nBut since we know the pattern is ? R I ? ?, we can pick a word that uses common letters? But also we want to test possible letters.\n\nI think BRING is a solid choice? But let me see:\n\nCommon bigrams after ""I""? Often: NG, NK, ND, etc.\n\nSo we can try BRING? which tests B, N, G.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose H R I N G -> HRING? Not a valid word? Or BRINK? Then tests B, N, K.\n\nAnother word: GRIND: G R I N D -> tests G, N, D? D is less common? But valid.\n\nWait: what about U? We haven\'t tested U? But U is a vowel? Maybe the word is BRINY? B R I N Y -> N and Y? Y can be a consonant or vowel? Valid word? Yes.\n\nOr FRITZ: F R I T Z -> but T is absent? So no.\n\nAfter considering, BRING is a very common word? So I\'ll go with that? Because it\'s common and we don\'t have any clues for the other letters.\n\nBut note: we have multiple possibilities? So to avoid burning a guess? We should try to test as many new letters as possible? For example, instead of using N (which appears in many words), we might test a different set? But then we lose coverage? Actually, N is common? So testing N might be good.\n\nLet me look for a word that uses unique letters? For example, that doesn\'t reuse letters? But we must use distinct letters? But the secret word might reuse? But we have no evidence? So we guess distinct.\n\nNow: in BRING, we use three new letters: B, N, G. This is good? Because we test all three at once. If they are all correct, we win? If one is wrong, we get feedback? Then based on that, we can guess again? Since we have 4 tries left? Wait: we have 3 guesses so far? This is the third? Wait: Guess1, Guess2, now Guess3? Then we have three more left? So we can afford to test.\n\nBut we might be able to cover more if we don\'t fix N and G? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we might try a word that uses letters that appear in many possible words? For example, N appears in BRINK, BRING, etc. So if we get N present? Then we know position4?\n\nBut I think guessing BRING is reasonable? Also, note: the secret word might be BRINK? Or something else? But we don\'t know? So we test.\n\nTo be systematic, we can think of the candidate list? But without knowing? We guess.\n\nI decided to guess BRING? Because it fits and tests common letters.\n\nBut wait: the feedback from Guess2? In Guess2 CRISP? We got R(✓) and I(✓) meaning positions 2 and 3? Also, C, S, P absent? So we are safe using B, N, G? Which haven\'t been tried? And avoiding the excluded ones.\n\nSo: let\'s guess BRING? But note: BRING: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.\n\nIf the secret word were BRINK? Then we would get B? How? Position1: B -> if secret is BRINK? Then both start with B? So we get ""✓"" for B? Then position4: N vs K? So ""x"" for N? Because K is the actual letter? And position5: G vs K? So G would be absent? And K is present? But wait? We don\'t have K in BRING? So we wouldn\'t know? Actually? The secret word BRINK has one K? At position5? So in BRING? We have G at position5? Then feedback: \n  position1: B (if secret starts with B? then ✓) else? \n  position4: N (if secret has N? then feedback depends? If secret is BRINK? Then secret position4 is N? Wait: BRINK:1:B,2:R,3:I,4:N,5:K? So position4 is N? Then if we guess BRING? which has N at position4? That would match? Wait no: BRING has G at position5? So:\n  Guess: B R I N G\n  Secret: B R I N K\n\nThen feedback: \n  position1: B ✓\n  position2: R ✓\n  position3: I ✓\n  position4: N ✓? Because it\'s the correct letter? Wait: N is correct? So ✓? Then position5: G vs K -> G is not K? And K is in the secret? But we have no information? So? Actually: \n  The secret has K? And we guessed G? So G is absent? So position5: x? \n\nTherefore: feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)? But we don\'t know that K is present? Only that G is absent? And we have three correct so far? Then we would know the word ends with K? But only if we get that three ✓ and one x.\n\nBut we don\'t? Because if we get BRING guess? And the secret is BRINK? Then we have positions1-4 correct? So ✓ for B, R, I, N? and x for G? Which tells us position5 is not G? So we know the word is B R I N ??? But? Actually? The feedback does not tell us that K is in the word? Only that G is not? And we already know G is absent? Then we must try other letters? So we lose a guess? \n\nBut that\'s unavoidable.\n\nIn this case, with BRING? We risk that position4 being N? And position5 being something else? We have many possibilities? For example, if N is correct at position4? Then we need to test the last letter? If not? Then we know position4 is not N.\n\nSo? I think BRING is a valid guess? And we\'ll see.\n\nBut to be strategic? Maybe we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume N at position4? For example? We don\'t know what letter is at position4? So we can guess a word that uses all new letters? But uses a letter that is more common? Or in a more common position? \n\nBut? If we don\'t fix N? Then we have more uncertainty? For example? If we guess a word where position4 is not N? Then we test a different set? For instance? GRIMY: G R I M Y -> tests G, M, Y? Which are less common? Hence? BRING? with N in position4? N is a common ending? So? It might be likely? Actually? In English? The position after I? Common? For example? In words ending with ""ING""? So BRING? CRING? But C is excluded? So BRING? FRING? Not that common? But BRING? That\'s a word.\n\nAfter consideration? I\'ll go with BRING? Because? It is a common word? And we test N? Which is a common letter? And G? Also common? So? Let\'s choose that? Of you agree?\n\nLet\'s note: if the secret word is BRING? Then we get five ✓ and win? Else? We get feedback on B, N, G.\n\nTherefore? Let\'s guess BRING?<thought>\nThe feedback from previous guesses reveals:\n- Secret word contains R in position 2 and I in position 3 → pattern: _ R I _ _\n- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E (from Guess 1), and C, S, P (from Guess 2)\n- Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nGiven pattern _ R I _ _ and exclusions:\n- Position 1 must be one of the available consonants/vowels (likely consonant given English words).\n- Positions 4 and 5 must be available letters, distinct from R/I and exclusions.\n\nOptimal strategy: Guess a valid word matching this pattern while maximizing information:\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, L, U) → ""N"" and ""G"" are common.\n- ""BRING"" is a valid choice: tests new letters B, N, G, with ""N"" in a common bigram (""IN"") and ""G"" in common trigram (""ING"").\n- Alternatives like BRINK, DRINK risk similar letters (e.g., ""K"" vs. ""G"") without additional coverage.\n- ""BRING"" covers three new letters efficiently and provides immediate feedback on high-frequency positions/postfixes.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>BRING</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1: ROATE → R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → R present (wrong position), O/A/T/E absent  \n- Guess 2: CRISP → C(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), P(x) → R correct at position 2, I correct at position 3, C/S/P absent  \n\nDeductions:  \n- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _  \n- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P  \n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  \n\nStrategic goal:  \n- Guess a valid word matching the pattern _ R I _ _ using untested letters to maximize information.  \n- Prioritize common letters and plausible endings (e.g., ""N"" and ""G"" in ""ING"" bigrams).  \n\nSelected word: **BRING**  \n- Tests B (position 1), N (position 4), G (position 5) → three new common letters  \n- ""BRING"" is a common English word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.\n\n<guess>BRING</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: BRING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position (marked as -)
  O, A, T, E: absent (x)

Guess 2: CRISP
  C: absent (x)
  R: correct position (✓) -> so R is in position 2
  I: correct position (✓) -> so I is in position 3
  S: absent (x)
  P: absent (x)

Guess 3: BRING
  B: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) -> position 2, which we already know
  I: correct (✓) -> position 3, which we already know
  N: absent (x)
  G: present but wrong position (marked as -)

So from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ 
  (position 2 is R, position 3 is I)

- We know that the following letters are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N

- We know that G is present in the word, but not in the last position (since in BRING, G was in position 5 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at position 5).

Therefore, G must be in one of the remaining positions: position 1 or position 4? But note the pattern: positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown.

But wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  position 2: R
  position 3: I
  position 1: unknown, but cannot be any of the absent letters and cannot be R or I (since we assume no duplicates? We haven't seen duplicates so far, and G is the only duplicate candidate? But note: in BRING, we had G at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So G is in the word, but not at position 5. And we don't have G in any other position? So the secret word has G in either position 1 or position 4? Because position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So the secret word has G in position 1 or 4? But if it were in position 1, then in the guess BRING, we had B at position 1 (which was absent) and G at position 5 (which was present but wrong). So if the secret word had G at position 1, then in the guess BRING, we would have had G at position 5? But the secret has G at position 1? Then the feedback for G would be that it is present but not at position 5? And we don't get any feedback about position 1? Because we guessed B at position 1? So that's consistent? But we don't know if G is at position 1? Because we didn't guess it at position 1? We guessed B at position 1? So we don't know? Similarly, if G is at position 4? Then in BRING, we had N at position 4? Which was absent? And G at position 5? Which is present but not at 5? So it could be at 4? 

Therefore, G must be in position 1 or 4? But we don't know which? And we have to find the letter for the other position? And also position 5? 

But note: the secret word has 5 letters? And we know R and I? And G? So we have two more letters? Because the word has 5 distinct letters? We don't know about duplicates? But so far, we haven't seen any duplicate? And the feedback for G in BRING was only one '-'? So if there were two G's? We don't know? But let's assume no duplicates? Because it's common? So the secret word has exactly one G? And it is in position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have to fill position 5? And if G is in position 1? Then position 4 and 5 are two other letters? If G is in position 4? Then position 1 and 5 are two other letters? 

But we also have the constraint that the letters must be from the available set? 

Available letters: we have excluded: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N? So excluded: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? That's 9 letters? 

The alphabet has 26? So 26-9=17? But we also have R and I? Which are in the word? And G? Which is in the word? So we have 17-3=14? But we don't subtract? Because the available set is the letters not excluded? And we know R, I, G are in? But we are not excluding them? We are excluding the absent ones? 

So the available letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) are: 
  All letters except: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N (excluded) and except R,I (which are already placed) and G (which is in the word but not placed yet)? 

But note: we can use G again? But we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot use G in two positions? So for the unknown positions? We have to choose from the available set? But G is already in the word? So we cannot use it again? So the letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) must be from the set: 
  {D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}? And also, we cannot use G? Because it's already used? But we are going to place G in one of the positions? 

Actually, we have to assign G to either position 1 or 4? And then the other two positions (if G is in 1, then positions 4 and 5; if G is in 4, then positions 1 and 5) must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? 

But we don't know which? So we need to design a guess that helps us determine where G is? And what the other letters are? 

We have two unknown positions? Actually three? But one of them is G? So we have to guess a word that has the pattern _ R I _ _? And we know G is in the word? But not at position 5? So we must place G in position 1 or 4? 

But we don't know? So we can try one of the possibilities? Or we can try a word that tests both possibilities? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G in position 1? And then other letters? Or in position 4? 

But we also want to test other common letters? 

Let me list the available letters: 
  D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Common letters: H, L, M, U, D, F, K? 

We can try to form a word that has G in position 1? For example? 
  G R I ? ? 

What words? 
  GRID? -> too short? 
  GRIND? -> but N is excluded? 
  GRIFT? -> G R I F T -> but T is excluded? 
  GRIM? -> too short? 
  GRIMY? -> G R I M Y -> but Y is available? And M? 
  GRIMY: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y? 

But we don't know if G is at position 1? But we can try? 

Alternatively? If we put G at position 4? 
  ? R I G ? 

Words: 
  FRIG? -> too short? 
  FRIGS? -> S excluded? 
  BRIG? -> too short? 
  PRIG? -> too short? 
  URINE? -> but U R I N E? But N and E excluded? 
  TRIG? -> too short? 
  DRINK? -> N excluded? 
  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? 
  FRIGID? -> too long? 

Actually? It's hard to find a word with G at position 4? 

Common words: 
  ORIGIN? -> 6 letters? 
  FRIGHT? -> 6 letters? 

5-letter words with G at position 4? 
  SPRIG? -> S and P excluded? 
  THRIG? -> not a word? 
  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? 

So? Maybe G at position 1 is more likely? 

But we have GRIMY? Which is a word? 

But note: in GRIMY? We have G at position 1? And M at 4? Y at 5? 

But we don't know if G is at position 1? It might be at position 4? 

But if we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position 4? Then we would get? 
  Position1: G? But if secret has G at position4? Then we guess G at position1? So feedback for G would be '-'? Because present but wrong position? And then we have M and Y? Which might be present or not? 

But if the secret word has G at position1? Then we get G at position1 correct? 

So? We can try GRIMY? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have G at position4? And we don't have a good word for that? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G at position4? Even if it's less common? 

For example? 
  URGH? -> not 5 letters? 
  ARGON? -> A excluded? 
  ORGAN? -> O and A excluded? 
  BEGAN? -> B, E, A excluded? 

It's difficult? 

Another idea: use a word that doesn't have G? But we know G is in the word? So we must include G? Because it's present? 

So we have to include G? 

But we don't know where? 

So? We can try to put G in position1? And then test two other common letters? 

So? GRIMY: G R I M Y? 

But M and Y are common? 

Alternatively? GRIFT? But T excluded? 

GRIPE? -> P excluded? 

GRIDE? -> E excluded? 

So? GRIMY seems acceptable? 

But note: we have not tested U? Which is a vowel? But we have I? Which is a vowel? So maybe we don't need? 

But let's see? 

Another word: GRUEL? -> but U and E? E excluded? 

GRUB? -> too short? 

So? I think GRIMY is a good candidate? 

But we have to consider? If we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? 
  Position1: G? If secret has G at position4? Then we get G marked as present but wrong position? 
  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is absent? Unless the secret has M? But we don't know? 
  Position5: Y? Similarly? 

But we also get feedback on M and Y? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G in position4? But we don't know one? 

Wait? What about ""ORGAN""? -> but O and A excluded? 

""URGED""? -> U R G E D -> but E excluded? 

""ARGUE""? -> A and E excluded? 

""FRUG""? -> too short? 

So? It's hard? 

Another idea: ""GUILD""? -> G U I L D? But we have I at position3? But in GUILD? I is at position3? So it matches? But we have G at position1? And U at position2? But we know position2 is R? So we cannot? Because position2 must be R? 

We cannot change position2? It must be R? 

So? The word must be of the form: [letter] R I [letter] [letter]? And we know G is in the word? So we must place G in one of the blanks? 

So? We can try: 
  Option 1: G R I ? ? 
  Option 2: ? R I G ? 

For Option 1: G R I ? ? 
  We can try: G R I M Y? 
  Or G R I D E? -> E excluded? 
  G R I L L? -> duplicate L? 
  G R I P E? -> P excluded? 
  G R I F T? -> T excluded? 
  G R I Z Z? -> not a word? 
  G R I N D? -> N excluded? 
  So? GRIMY is one? 

For Option 2: ? R I G ? 
  We can try: D R I G S? -> S excluded? 
  F R I G S? -> S excluded? 
  W R I G S? -> not a word? 
  T R I G O? -> O excluded? 
  P R I G S? -> P and S excluded? 
  B R I G S? -> B and S excluded? 
  H R I G ? -> not found? 
  K R I G ? -> not found? 
  L R I G ? -> not found? 
  M R I G ? -> not found? 
  U R I G ? -> not found? 
  V R I G ? -> not found? 
  Z R I G ? -> not found? 

So? The only common word I can think of for Option 2 is ""WRING""? But we cannot use it because N is excluded? 

Therefore? It seems that the secret word likely has G at position1? 

So? We'll go with GRIMY? 

But let's confirm: GRIMY is a valid word? Yes? Meaning covered with grime? 

So? We guess GRIMY? 

But note: in GRIMY? We have G at position1? M at position4? Y at position5? 

If the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? 
  Position1: G? Marked as '-' (present but wrong position) 
  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is not there? So 'x'? 
  Position5: Y? 'x'? 

And we know R and I are correct? 

Then we would know that G is not at position1? So it must be at position4? And then we have to find the other two letters? 

But we have two guesses left? So it's manageable? 

If we are lucky? And G is at position1? Then we might get more feedback? 

So? Let's go with GRIMY? 

But wait? Another possibility: what if the secret word is ""GRIPS""? But S is excluded? 

Or ""GRIDS""? S excluded? 

So? I think GRIMY is a reasonable guess? 

Therefore? We guess GRIMY? 

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters? GRIMY: G, R, I, M, Y? 
  R and I are known? 
  G is known to be present? 
  M and Y are new? 

And we avoid O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? 

So? Yes? 

<thought>
The feedback indicates:
- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _
- G is present but not in position 5 (from BRING feedback: G(-))
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N
- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since G must be in position 1 or 4 (as positions 2, 3, 5 are ruled out for G), and no common words fit the pattern with G in position 4 (e.g., ? R I G ?) due to exclusions, G is likely in position 1.

Thus, the pattern becomes G R I _ _.

To test this and cover new letters:
- Guess **GRIMY** (G in position 1, M in 4, Y in 5).
- Tests G at position 1 (if correct, ✓; if not, confirms G must be in position 4).
- Also tests M and Y, two new common letters.

This maximizes information while adhering to constraints.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ROATE**  
  Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - O, A, T, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: CRISP**  
  Feedback: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is correct in position 2.  
  - I is correct in position 3.  
  - C, S, P are absent.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ R I _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed).  

- **Guess 3: BRING**  
  Feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R and I are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (no new info).  
  - B and N are absent.  
  - G is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `[pos1] R I [pos4] [pos5]`.  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - R (position 2), I (position 3), and G (present, but not in position 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N (9 letters excluded).  
4. **G's position**:  
   - G cannot be in position 5 (from BRING feedback).  
   - Since positions 2 (R) and 3 (I) are filled, G must be in **position 1 or 4**.  
5. **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters remain).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Resolve G's position (1 or 4) and test new high-frequency letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Guess a word fitting `_ R I _ _` with G in position 1 (most plausible, given common words).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., M, Y) to maximize information.  
- **Chosen word**: **GRIMY**  
  - Tests G in position 1 (if correct, ✓; if not, G must be in position 4).  
  - Tests M (position 4) and Y (position 5), both common untested letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If G is in position 1, this could solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm G is in position 4.  

<guess>GRIMY</guess>",GRIMY,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position (marked as -)
  O, A, T, E: absent (x)

Guess 2: CRISP
  C: absent (x)
  R: correct position (✓) -> so R is in position 2
  I: correct position (✓) -> so I is in position 3
  S: absent (x)
  P: absent (x)

Guess 3: BRING
  B: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) -> position 2, which we already know
  I: correct (✓) -> position 3, which we already know
  N: absent (x)
  G: present but wrong position (marked as -)

So from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ 
  (position 2 is R, position 3 is I)

- We know that the following letters are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N

- We know that G is present in the word, but not in the last position (since in BRING, G was in position 5 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at position 5).

Therefore, G must be in one of the remaining positions: position 1 or position 4? But note the pattern: positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown.

But wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  position 2: R
  position 3: I
  position 1: unknown, but cannot be any of the absent letters and cannot be R or I (since we assume no duplicates? We haven't seen duplicates so far, and G is the only duplicate candidate? But note: in BRING, we had G at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So G is in the word, but not at position 5. And we don't have G in any other position? So the secret word has G in either position 1 or position 4? Because position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So the secret word has G in position 1 or 4? But if it were in position 1, then in the guess BRING, we had B at position 1 (which was absent) and G at position 5 (which was present but wrong). So if the secret word had G at position 1, then in the guess BRING, we would have had G at position 5? But the secret has G at position 1? Then the feedback for G would be that it is present but not at position 5? And we don't get any feedback about position 1? Because we guessed B at position 1? So that's consistent? But we don't know if G is at position 1? Because we didn't guess it at position 1? We guessed B at position 1? So we don't know? Similarly, if G is at position 4? Then in BRING, we had N at position 4? Which was absent? And G at position 5? Which is present but not at 5? So it could be at 4? 

Therefore, G must be in position 1 or 4? But we don't know which? And we have to find the letter for the other position? And also position 5? 

But note: the secret word has 5 letters? And we know R and I? And G? So we have two more letters? Because the word has 5 distinct letters? We don't know about duplicates? But so far, we haven't seen any duplicate? And the feedback for G in BRING was only one '-'? So if there were two G's? We don't know? But let's assume no duplicates? Because it's common? So the secret word has exactly one G? And it is in position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have to fill position 5? And if G is in position 1? Then position 4 and 5 are two other letters? If G is in position 4? Then position 1 and 5 are two other letters? 

But we also have the constraint that the letters must be from the available set? 

Available letters: we have excluded: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N? So excluded: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? That's 9 letters? 

The alphabet has 26? So 26-9=17? But we also have R and I? Which are in the word? And G? Which is in the word? So we have 17-3=14? But we don't subtract? Because the available set is the letters not excluded? And we know R, I, G are in? But we are not excluding them? We are excluding the absent ones? 

So the available letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) are: 
  All letters except: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N (excluded) and except R,I (which are already placed) and G (which is in the word but not placed yet)? 

But note: we can use G again? But we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot use G in two positions? So for the unknown positions? We have to choose from the available set? But G is already in the word? So we cannot use it again? So the letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) must be from the set: 
  {D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}? And also, we cannot use G? Because it's already used? But we are going to place G in one of the positions? 

Actually, we have to assign G to either position 1 or 4? And then the other two positions (if G is in 1, then positions 4 and 5; if G is in 4, then positions 1 and 5) must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? 

But we don't know which? So we need to design a guess that helps us determine where G is? And what the other letters are? 

We have two unknown positions? Actually three? But one of them is G? So we have to guess a word that has the pattern _ R I _ _? And we know G is in the word? But not at position 5? So we must place G in position 1 or 4? 

But we don't know? So we can try one of the possibilities? Or we can try a word that tests both possibilities? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G in position 1? And then other letters? Or in position 4? 

But we also want to test other common letters? 

Let me list the available letters: 
  D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Common letters: H, L, M, U, D, F, K? 

We can try to form a word that has G in position 1? For example? 
  G R I ? ? 

What words? 
  GRID? -> too short? 
  GRIND? -> but N is excluded? 
  GRIFT? -> G R I F T -> but T is excluded? 
  GRIM? -> too short? 
  GRIMY? -> G R I M Y -> but Y is available? And M? 
  GRIMY: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y? 

But we don't know if G is at position 1? But we can try? 

Alternatively? If we put G at position 4? 
  ? R I G ? 

Words: 
  FRIG? -> too short? 
  FRIGS? -> S excluded? 
  BRIG? -> too short? 
  PRIG? -> too short? 
  URINE? -> but U R I N E? But N and E excluded? 
  TRIG? -> too short? 
  DRINK? -> N excluded? 
  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? 
  FRIGID? -> too long? 

Actually? It's hard to find a word with G at position 4? 

Common words: 
  ORIGIN? -> 6 letters? 
  FRIGHT? -> 6 letters? 

5-letter words with G at position 4? 
  SPRIG? -> S and P excluded? 
  THRIG? -> not a word? 
  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? 

So? Maybe G at position 1 is more likely? 

But we have GRIMY? Which is a word? 

But note: in GRIMY? We have G at position 1? And M at 4? Y at 5? 

But we don't know if G is at position 1? It might be at position 4? 

But if we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position 4? Then we would get? 
  Position1: G? But if secret has G at position4? Then we guess G at position1? So feedback for G would be '-'? Because present but wrong position? And then we have M and Y? Which might be present or not? 

But if the secret word has G at position1? Then we get G at position1 correct? 

So? We can try GRIMY? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have G at position4? And we don't have a good word for that? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G at position4? Even if it's less common? 

For example? 
  URGH? -> not 5 letters? 
  ARGON? -> A excluded? 
  ORGAN? -> O and A excluded? 
  BEGAN? -> B, E, A excluded? 

It's difficult? 

Another idea: use a word that doesn't have G? But we know G is in the word? So we must include G? Because it's present? 

So we have to include G? 

But we don't know where? 

So? We can try to put G in position1? And then test two other common letters? 

So? GRIMY: G R I M Y? 

But M and Y are common? 

Alternatively? GRIFT? But T excluded? 

GRIPE? -> P excluded? 

GRIDE? -> E excluded? 

So? GRIMY seems acceptable? 

But note: we have not tested U? Which is a vowel? But we have I? Which is a vowel? So maybe we don't need? 

But let's see? 

Another word: GRUEL? -> but U and E? E excluded? 

GRUB? -> too short? 

So? I think GRIMY is a good candidate? 

But we have to consider? If we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? 
  Position1: G? If secret has G at position4? Then we get G marked as present but wrong position? 
  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is absent? Unless the secret has M? But we don't know? 
  Position5: Y? Similarly? 

But we also get feedback on M and Y? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G in position4? But we don't know one? 

Wait? What about ""ORGAN""? -> but O and A excluded? 

""URGED""? -> U R G E D -> but E excluded? 

""ARGUE""? -> A and E excluded? 

""FRUG""? -> too short? 

So? It's hard? 

Another idea: ""GUILD""? -> G U I L D? But we have I at position3? But in GUILD? I is at position3? So it matches? But we have G at position1? And U at position2? But we know position2 is R? So we cannot? Because position2 must be R? 

We cannot change position2? It must be R? 

So? The word must be of the form: [letter] R I [letter] [letter]? And we know G is in the word? So we must place G in one of the blanks? 

So? We can try: 
  Option 1: G R I ? ? 
  Option 2: ? R I G ? 

For Option 1: G R I ? ? 
  We can try: G R I M Y? 
  Or G R I D E? -> E excluded? 
  G R I L L? -> duplicate L? 
  G R I P E? -> P excluded? 
  G R I F T? -> T excluded? 
  G R I Z Z? -> not a word? 
  G R I N D? -> N excluded? 
  So? GRIMY is one? 

For Option 2: ? R I G ? 
  We can try: D R I G S? -> S excluded? 
  F R I G S? -> S excluded? 
  W R I G S? -> not a word? 
  T R I G O? -> O excluded? 
  P R I G S? -> P and S excluded? 
  B R I G S? -> B and S excluded? 
  H R I G ? -> not found? 
  K R I G ? -> not found? 
  L R I G ? -> not found? 
  M R I G ? -> not found? 
  U R I G ? -> not found? 
  V R I G ? -> not found? 
  Z R I G ? -> not found? 

So? The only common word I can think of for Option 2 is ""WRING""? But we cannot use it because N is excluded? 

Therefore? It seems that the secret word likely has G at position1? 

So? We'll go with GRIMY? 

But let's confirm: GRIMY is a valid word? Yes? Meaning covered with grime? 

So? We guess GRIMY? 

But note: in GRIMY? We have G at position1? M at position4? Y at position5? 

If the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? 
  Position1: G? Marked as '-' (present but wrong position) 
  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is not there? So 'x'? 
  Position5: Y? 'x'? 

And we know R and I are correct? 

Then we would know that G is not at position1? So it must be at position4? And then we have to find the other two letters? 

But we have two guesses left? So it's manageable? 

If we are lucky? And G is at position1? Then we might get more feedback? 

So? Let's go with GRIMY? 

But wait? Another possibility: what if the secret word is ""GRIPS""? But S is excluded? 

Or ""GRIDS""? S excluded? 

So? I think GRIMY is a reasonable guess? 

Therefore? We guess GRIMY? 

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters? GRIMY: G, R, I, M, Y? 
  R and I are known? 
  G is known to be present? 
  M and Y are new? 

And we avoid O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? 

So? Yes? 

<thought>
The feedback indicates:
- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _
- G is present but not in position 5 (from BRING feedback: G(-))
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N
- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since G must be in position 1 or 4 (as positions 2, 3, 5 are ruled out for G), and no common words fit the pattern with G in position 4 (e.g., ? R I G ?) due to exclusions, G is likely in position 1.

Thus, the pattern becomes G R I _ _.

To test this and cover new letters:
- Guess **GRIMY** (G in position 1, M in 4, Y in 5).
- Tests G at position 1 (if correct, ✓; if not, confirms G must be in position 4).
- Also tests M and Y, two new common letters.

This maximizes information while adhering to constraints.

  Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - O, A, T, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: CRISP**  
  Feedback: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is correct in position 2.  
  - I is correct in position 3.  
  - C, S, P are absent.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ R I _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed).  

- **Guess 3: BRING**  
  Feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R and I are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (no new info).  
  - B and N are absent.  
  - G is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `[pos1] R I [pos4] [pos5]`.  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - R (position 2), I (position 3), and G (present, but not in position 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N (9 letters excluded).  
4. **G's position**:  
   - G cannot be in position 5 (from BRING feedback).  
   - Since positions 2 (R) and 3 (I) are filled, G must be in **position 1 or 4**.  
5. **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters remain).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Resolve G's position (1 or 4) and test new high-frequency letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Guess a word fitting `_ R I _ _` with G in position 1 (most plausible, given common words).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., M, Y) to maximize information.  
- **Chosen word**: **GRIMY**  
  - Tests G in position 1 (if correct, ✓; if not, G must be in position 4).  
  - Tests M (position 4) and Y (position 5), both common untested letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If G is in position 1, this could solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm G is in position 4.",Guess 4: GRIMY -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) Y(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. 
 There is no feedback yet since it's the first turn.
 A good starting word should have common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"" are often good starters.
 Let me choose a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""ROAST"":
   R, O, A, S, T -> all fairly common.

 Another is ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E -> includes A and E, and common consonants.

 Another is ""SLATE"":
   S, L, A, T, E -> has S, T, A, E which are common.

 Since we don't have any prior information, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let me ensure ""CRANE"" is a 5-letter word: yes, it is.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE<thought>
For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained. A strong starter typically uses common letters and avoids repeats to test multiple positions at once. Based on English letter frequency, vowels like A, E and consonants like R, S, T, N are ideal. 

The word ""ROATE"" is statistically effective—it contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T), covering five distinct letters. Alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also popular, but ""ROATE"" ranks highly in solving efficiency for similar games. It's a valid word (meaning a financial yield curve) that adheres to the rules.

This guess will test:
- High-frequency letters: R, A, E, T, O
- Positions of all letters simultaneously
- Quickly reveal potential vowels/consonants in the secret word
</thought>

<guess>ROATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ROATE -> R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with ""-"" meaning wrong position).
   - O, A, T, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").

 Important deductions:
 1. The secret word contains the letter R, but it is not in the first position (since our guess had R in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position, meaning R is present elsewhere).
 2. The letters O, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 1, and the word is 5 letters, R must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Additionally, we must avoid using O, A, T, E in any new guess because they are not in the secret word.

 Now, for the next guess, we need:
   - To include R, but not in the first position (try it in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - To avoid the letters O, A, T, E entirely.

 Also, we want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet. Common consonants: S, L, N, I, C, U, etc. (but note U is a vowel and we haven't tested it).

 Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new common letters as possible and arrange R in a different position.

 Let's recall: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. So we should try R in one of the remaining positions.

 Common 5-letter words without O, A, T, E? 

 We can think of words that have R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 and use other common letters.

 Example positions for R:
   Position 2: e.g., CR? but C is not tested -> but note we must avoid O,A,T,E.
   Position 3: e.g., ? R ? ? ?
   Position 4: e.g., ? ? R ? ?
   Position 5: e.g., ? ? ? ? R

 Also note: We have not tested the vowels I, U (since O, A, E are out). We should test one of them to see if they are present? But the secret word must have vowels too.

 However, the feedback tells us that O, A, E are absent, so the vowels must be from I, U, or sometimes Y. But Y is less common.

 Possible vowels: I, U, Y.

 We should try to include one or two vowels that haven't been tested? But also consonants.

 Since R is the only known letter, we can try a word that has R in a different position and introduces new common letters.

 List of potential words without O,A,T,E and with R in a position other than 1:

 Common words:
   With R in position 2: 
      CRISP -> but C,R,I,S,P -> no O,A,T,E -> acceptable? Let's check letters: C, R, I, S, P. 
      However, we have to avoid using known absent letters: O,A,T,E are absent, so this is okay.
      But we don't know if these letters are present. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

   With R in position 3:
      PINCH -> but no R. 
      WORD: SHIRK -> S,H,I,R,K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> avoids O,A,T,E.
      WORD: SPUR? -> but 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   With R in position 4:
      PLUMB? -> but no R. Instead, consider: WINCH? -> but no R. 
      WORD: BLUR? -> too short. 
      WORD: SQUID -> no R.

   With R in position 5:
      MINOR -> but has O -> not allowed. 
      OTHER: RIGID -> R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1. So if we try a word with R in position 5? 
        WORD: LUMPS -> no R.
        WORD: VIVID -> no R.

 After review, let's try to get R in position 2 or 3 or 4 and include new common letters.

 I think CRISP is a good candidate:
   It has R in position 2 (which is a position R could potentially be, since it was not in position 1).
   It introduces new common letters: C, I, S, P.

 Alternatively, consider SHIRK: 
   R is in position 4, and introduces S, H, I, K.

 Another option: PRICK -> P,R,I,C,K -> R in position 2? Actually position 2? P is position 1 -> wait: 
   P R I C K -> R is in position 2? But the feedback said R was in the word but not position 1, so placing R in position 2 is allowed? 
   However, in the feedback of the first guess, R was in position 1 and was wrong. The secret word has R, but we don't know where. So putting R in position 2 in the new guess is acceptable.

 But note: we must use only letters that are not O,A,T,E and try to cover new ones.

 Considering CRISP:
   - We place R in position 2 (which is a new position).
   - We test C (common consonant), I (vowel), S (common consonant), P (common consonant).

 This gives us a lot of new information.

 Another word: BRICK -> has B,R,I,C,K -> avoids O,A,T,E. R is in position 2 again.

 However, note: the feedback told us that R is in the word. But we don't know if it's in multiple positions? Probably not, we just need to find one occurrence.

 Let me compare common words: 
   CRISP: uses C, R, I, S, P -> all new letters. This is very efficient for gathering information.

 But note: we must not use the letter E (which is excluded) and we are not using O,A,T.

 Important: The guess must be a valid English word. CRISP is valid.

 Now, what about placing R in a position that wasn't position 1? Our feedback said R was not in position 1. CRISP has R in position 2 -> which is allowed.

 Let's choose CRISP.

 Alternatively, we might consider using the vowel U? But since I is also a vowel and more common, testing I might be better.

 After consideration, I'll go with CRISP.

 But note: we are avoiding E, which is good. So:

 Guess: CRISP -> C(position1), R(position2), I(position3), S(position4), P(position5).

 Let's hope this gives us more information.

 If the secret word doesn't have R in position 2, then we get a ""-"" for R again? Which tells us R is in another position.

 We have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 total tries, but we used one, so 5 left. This is our second guess.

 Therefore, we'll guess CRISP.<thought>
The feedback from the first guess (ROATE → R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)) reveals:
- R is in the secret word but NOT in the first position.
- O, A, T, E are ABSENT from the secret word.

Therefore:
1. Avoid using O, A, T, E in the next guess.
2. Include R in a position other than 1 (positions 2–5).
3. Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters not yet attempted (e.g., I, S, C, N, L).

Given this context:
- Common vowels still untested: I, U, Y (I is most frequent).
- Common consonants still untested: S, N, L, C, H, etc.
- A strong candidate word should include R (not in position 1), introduce multiple new letters, and omit forbidden characters.

Optimal strategy: Guess **CRISP** because:
- It places R in position 2 (the first valid alternative to position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (C, S, P) and the vowel I.
- It omits forbidden letters (O, A, T, E).
- The word is valid and maximizes potential letter/position information.

<guess>CRISP</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position → ""-"" (so R is in the word, not at position 1)
  O, A, T, E: absent → ""x""

Second guess: CRISP
  C: absent → ""x""
  R: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning R is in position 2 of the secret word?)
  I: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning I is in position 3 of the secret word?)
  S: absent → ""x""
  P: absent → ""x""

But note: the feedback for R and I in CRISP is ""✓"", meaning:
  - The secret word has R in the second position.
  - The secret word has I in the third position.

Also, from the first guess, we knew R was present (but not at position 1). Now we know it is at position 2.

Additionally, from CRISP, we know:
  C, S, P are absent → we can add them to the exclusion list.

So, letters we know are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P.

Letters we know are present: R (at position 2) and I (at position 3).

Also, since the secret word has R at position 2 and I at position 3, we know the word has at least the pattern: _ R I _ _

We have 5 positions:

Position 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters. And note that we don't know what letter is here, but it cannot be O, A, T, E, C, S, P.
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: I (fixed)
Position 4: unknown (and must not be O, A, T, E, C, S, P, or R,I? Wait, R and I are already used, but since R is in position 2, it can appear again? But typically in these games, letters can repeat? However, the feedback doesn't explicitly say whether duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven't encountered duplicates yet. To be safe, we can assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise. Because if there were duplicates, we might have seen feedback indicating a duplicate.

Looking back at the feedback for ROATE: R was present (but not position 1) and we had no indication of a duplicate. Similarly, in CRISP, we had only one R and one I. So let's assume for now the word has no duplicate letters.

Therefore, positions 1, 4, and 5 must be letters not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P} and also not R or I? But R and I are already used? So we need three new distinct letters that are not excluded and not R or I.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

where letter1, letter4, letter5 are:
  - Not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I} (so avoiding 9 letters: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I)
  - They must be English letters we haven't tried yet.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _, and uses only letters from the remaining set.

We have to pick a valid English word. Also, we want to maximize coverage of new letters? We have only three positions to fill.

Possible words that come to mind:
  BRING? -> B R I N G -> which has G and N, which are untested? But note: we must avoid taken letters? B is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed. However, BRING has an N and a G. But also, note: the pattern must have R at 2 and I at 3: so B R I N G -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

Check: letters in BRING: B,R,I,N,G -> R and I are known to be at positions 2 and 3? Yes. The others: B, N, G are allowed? Yes, they haven't been tested.

But note: in CRISP we got feedback that S and P are absent. We also excluded O,A,T,E,C. So BRING uses only fresh letters and fits the pattern? But we don't know if N and G are in the word? This guess might be the solution? Or it might test new letters.

Wait: the word must be valid and we don't know the secret word. So BRING is a valid guess.

Alternatively, we might think of other words:
  FRISK? -> F R I S K, but S is forbidden? We know S is absent (from Guess 2: S got ""x""). So we cannot use S.

  Another: PRINT -> P R I N T -> but P and T are excluded. T is excluded from the first guess? Yes: T got ""x"" in ROATE? First guess: T was absent? Yes, T got ""x"" in ROATE? Actually: In ROATE: A was in pos3 and got ""x"", T was in pos4 and got ""x"". So T is excluded. Therefore PRINT is invalid because it uses P and T? P is excluded? Guess2: P got ""x"", so P is absent. T we already know is absent.

  Another: DRINK -> D R I N K -> D, N, K are fresh? And the pattern fits: _ R I N K.

  Similarly: GRIND -> G R I N D -> G, N, D fresh.

  Or: BRINK: B R I N K -> B, N, K fresh.

  Also: FRIGID? too long? 5 letters: FRICK? -> not a word. FRUIT? -> F R U I T -> but U is in position 4? But U is allowed? Actually: FRUIT would have I at position 4? But we need position 3 to be I? So no.

Let's list possible words matching the pattern _ R I _ _ with the constraints.

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? but we also have to form a word.

Words that come to mind:
  BRING (as above)
  BRINK
  DRINK
  GRINS? -> but S is excluded? We cannot use S? So GRIN? is 4 letters? We need 5 letter words? So GRINS is not allowed if we cannot use S? And S is excluded.

Alternatively:
  FRIAR? -> but second R? We don't know if duplicate R is allowed? And also A is excluded? Wait: A is absent? So no.

  PRICE? -> uses P (absent) and E (absent) -> no.

After thinking, valid words:
  BRING: B R I N G -> uses B, N, G
  BRINK: B R I N K -> uses B, N, K
  DRINK: D R I N K -> D, N, K
  GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, M, Y
  KRIS? -> too short.

But note: we have only 3 unknown positions? Actually two: positions 4 and 5? No: position 1,4,5.

Wait, the pattern: position1: ?, position4: ?, position5: ?.

So we must choose a word that starts with a letter in the available set and ends with two letters also in the available set? And contains only allowed letters.

Let me think of a common word: BRING is common? Yes.

Also: FRISK: we cannot because S is excluded.

Another: WRING -> W R I N G -> W, N, G? W is allowed? Yes.

Similarly: PRIG? -> too short? No, 5 letter? PRIG is 4? PRIGY? not a word.

We should avoid using letters that are rare? But N, G, K, etc. are common.

Now: how to choose? We are testing as many letters as possible? We have three unknown letters? Since we are at guess 3, we want to maximize information? But also we might solve it? But that would be lucky.

If we guess BRING and it's wrong, we get feedback on B, N, G? Which is good? But note: position 4 and 5 are also unknown.

We could test multiple possibilities? For example, if we test B, N, G in BRING, then we get:
  If B is correct? Then we have B at position1? And then N and G? Which might be correct or not.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that covers more common letters? The remaining common letters? Common consonants: L, N, H, etc.

But note: we have many options: we don't need to cover all, but we need information.

But since we know the pattern is ? R I ? ?, we can pick a word that uses common letters? But also we want to test possible letters.

I think BRING is a solid choice? But let me see:

Common bigrams after ""I""? Often: NG, NK, ND, etc.

So we can try BRING? which tests B, N, G.

Alternatively, if we choose H R I N G -> HRING? Not a valid word? Or BRINK? Then tests B, N, K.

Another word: GRIND: G R I N D -> tests G, N, D? D is less common? But valid.

Wait: what about U? We haven't tested U? But U is a vowel? Maybe the word is BRINY? B R I N Y -> N and Y? Y can be a consonant or vowel? Valid word? Yes.

Or FRITZ: F R I T Z -> but T is absent? So no.

After considering, BRING is a very common word? So I'll go with that? Because it's common and we don't have any clues for the other letters.

But note: we have multiple possibilities? So to avoid burning a guess? We should try to test as many new letters as possible? For example, instead of using N (which appears in many words), we might test a different set? But then we lose coverage? Actually, N is common? So testing N might be good.

Let me look for a word that uses unique letters? For example, that doesn't reuse letters? But we must use distinct letters? But the secret word might reuse? But we have no evidence? So we guess distinct.

Now: in BRING, we use three new letters: B, N, G. This is good? Because we test all three at once. If they are all correct, we win? If one is wrong, we get feedback? Then based on that, we can guess again? Since we have 4 tries left? Wait: we have 3 guesses so far? This is the third? Wait: Guess1, Guess2, now Guess3? Then we have three more left? So we can afford to test.

But we might be able to cover more if we don't fix N and G? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might try a word that uses letters that appear in many possible words? For example, N appears in BRINK, BRING, etc. So if we get N present? Then we know position4?

But I think guessing BRING is reasonable? Also, note: the secret word might be BRINK? Or something else? But we don't know? So we test.

To be systematic, we can think of the candidate list? But without knowing? We guess.

I decided to guess BRING? Because it fits and tests common letters.

But wait: the feedback from Guess2? In Guess2 CRISP? We got R(✓) and I(✓) meaning positions 2 and 3? Also, C, S, P absent? So we are safe using B, N, G? Which haven't been tried? And avoiding the excluded ones.

So: let's guess BRING? But note: BRING: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.

If the secret word were BRINK? Then we would get B? How? Position1: B -> if secret is BRINK? Then both start with B? So we get ""✓"" for B? Then position4: N vs K? So ""x"" for N? Because K is the actual letter? And position5: G vs K? So G would be absent? And K is present? But wait? We don't have K in BRING? So we wouldn't know? Actually? The secret word BRINK has one K? At position5? So in BRING? We have G at position5? Then feedback: 
  position1: B (if secret starts with B? then ✓) else? 
  position4: N (if secret has N? then feedback depends? If secret is BRINK? Then secret position4 is N? Wait: BRINK:1:B,2:R,3:I,4:N,5:K? So position4 is N? Then if we guess BRING? which has N at position4? That would match? Wait no: BRING has G at position5? So:
  Guess: B R I N G
  Secret: B R I N K

Then feedback: 
  position1: B ✓
  position2: R ✓
  position3: I ✓
  position4: N ✓? Because it's the correct letter? Wait: N is correct? So ✓? Then position5: G vs K -> G is not K? And K is in the secret? But we have no information? So? Actually: 
  The secret has K? And we guessed G? So G is absent? So position5: x? 

Therefore: feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)? But we don't know that K is present? Only that G is absent? And we have three correct so far? Then we would know the word ends with K? But only if we get that three ✓ and one x.

But we don't? Because if we get BRING guess? And the secret is BRINK? Then we have positions1-4 correct? So ✓ for B, R, I, N? and x for G? Which tells us position5 is not G? So we know the word is B R I N ??? But? Actually? The feedback does not tell us that K is in the word? Only that G is not? And we already know G is absent? Then we must try other letters? So we lose a guess? 

But that's unavoidable.

In this case, with BRING? We risk that position4 being N? And position5 being something else? We have many possibilities? For example, if N is correct at position4? Then we need to test the last letter? If not? Then we know position4 is not N.

So? I think BRING is a valid guess? And we'll see.

But to be strategic? Maybe we can choose a word that doesn't assume N at position4? For example? We don't know what letter is at position4? So we can guess a word that uses all new letters? But uses a letter that is more common? Or in a more common position? 

But? If we don't fix N? Then we have more uncertainty? For example? If we guess a word where position4 is not N? Then we test a different set? For instance? GRIMY: G R I M Y -> tests G, M, Y? Which are less common? Hence? BRING? with N in position4? N is a common ending? So? It might be likely? Actually? In English? The position after I? Common? For example? In words ending with ""ING""? So BRING? CRING? But C is excluded? So BRING? FRING? Not that common? But BRING? That's a word.

After consideration? I'll go with BRING? Because? It is a common word? And we test N? Which is a common letter? And G? Also common? So? Let's choose that? Of you agree?

Let's note: if the secret word is BRING? Then we get five ✓ and win? Else? We get feedback on B, N, G.

Therefore? Let's guess BRING?<thought>
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- Secret word contains R in position 2 and I in position 3 → pattern: _ R I _ _
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E (from Guess 1), and C, S, P (from Guess 2)
- Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Given pattern _ R I _ _ and exclusions:
- Position 1 must be one of the available consonants/vowels (likely consonant given English words).
- Positions 4 and 5 must be available letters, distinct from R/I and exclusions.

Optimal strategy: Guess a valid word matching this pattern while maximizing information:
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, L, U) → ""N"" and ""G"" are common.
- ""BRING"" is a valid choice: tests new letters B, N, G, with ""N"" in a common bigram (""IN"") and ""G"" in common trigram (""ING"").
- Alternatives like BRINK, DRINK risk similar letters (e.g., ""K"" vs. ""G"") without additional coverage.
- ""BRING"" covers three new letters efficiently and provides immediate feedback on high-frequency positions/postfixes.

<guess>BRING</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ROATE → R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → R present (wrong position), O/A/T/E absent  
- Guess 2: CRISP → C(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), P(x) → R correct at position 2, I correct at position 3, C/S/P absent  

Deductions:  
- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _  
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P  
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Strategic goal:  
- Guess a valid word matching the pattern _ R I _ _ using untested letters to maximize information.  
- Prioritize common letters and plausible endings (e.g., ""N"" and ""G"" in ""ING"" bigrams).  

Selected word: **BRING**  
- Tests B (position 1), N (position 4), G (position 5) → three new common letters  
- ""BRING"" is a common English word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

<guess>BRING</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)
Guess 3: BRING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ROATE
  R: present but wrong position (marked as -)
  O, A, T, E: absent (x)

Guess 2: CRISP
  C: absent (x)
  R: correct position (✓) -> so R is in position 2
  I: correct position (✓) -> so I is in position 3
  S: absent (x)
  P: absent (x)

Guess 3: BRING
  B: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) -> position 2, which we already know
  I: correct (✓) -> position 3, which we already know
  N: absent (x)
  G: present but wrong position (marked as -)

So from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ 
  (position 2 is R, position 3 is I)

- We know that the following letters are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N

- We know that G is present in the word, but not in the last position (since in BRING, G was in position 5 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at position 5).

Therefore, G must be in one of the remaining positions: position 1 or position 4? But note the pattern: positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown.

But wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  position 2: R
  position 3: I
  position 1: unknown, but cannot be any of the absent letters and cannot be R or I (since we assume no duplicates? We haven't seen duplicates so far, and G is the only duplicate candidate? But note: in BRING, we had G at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So G is in the word, but not at position 5. And we don't have G in any other position? So the secret word has G in either position 1 or position 4? Because position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So the secret word has G in position 1 or 4? But if it were in position 1, then in the guess BRING, we had B at position 1 (which was absent) and G at position 5 (which was present but wrong). So if the secret word had G at position 1, then in the guess BRING, we would have had G at position 5? But the secret has G at position 1? Then the feedback for G would be that it is present but not at position 5? And we don't get any feedback about position 1? Because we guessed B at position 1? So that's consistent? But we don't know if G is at position 1? Because we didn't guess it at position 1? We guessed B at position 1? So we don't know? Similarly, if G is at position 4? Then in BRING, we had N at position 4? Which was absent? And G at position 5? Which is present but not at 5? So it could be at 4? 

Therefore, G must be in position 1 or 4? But we don't know which? And we have to find the letter for the other position? And also position 5? 

But note: the secret word has 5 letters? And we know R and I? And G? So we have two more letters? Because the word has 5 distinct letters? We don't know about duplicates? But so far, we haven't seen any duplicate? And the feedback for G in BRING was only one '-'? So if there were two G's? We don't know? But let's assume no duplicates? Because it's common? So the secret word has exactly one G? And it is in position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have to fill position 5? And if G is in position 1? Then position 4 and 5 are two other letters? If G is in position 4? Then position 1 and 5 are two other letters? 

But we also have the constraint that the letters must be from the available set? 

Available letters: we have excluded: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N? So excluded: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? That's 9 letters? 

The alphabet has 26? So 26-9=17? But we also have R and I? Which are in the word? And G? Which is in the word? So we have 17-3=14? But we don't subtract? Because the available set is the letters not excluded? And we know R, I, G are in? But we are not excluding them? We are excluding the absent ones? 

So the available letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) are: 
  All letters except: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N (excluded) and except R,I (which are already placed) and G (which is in the word but not placed yet)? 

But note: we can use G again? But we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot use G in two positions? So for the unknown positions? We have to choose from the available set? But G is already in the word? So we cannot use it again? So the letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) must be from the set: 
  {D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}? And also, we cannot use G? Because it's already used? But we are going to place G in one of the positions? 

Actually, we have to assign G to either position 1 or 4? And then the other two positions (if G is in 1, then positions 4 and 5; if G is in 4, then positions 1 and 5) must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? 

But we don't know which? So we need to design a guess that helps us determine where G is? And what the other letters are? 

We have two unknown positions? Actually three? But one of them is G? So we have to guess a word that has the pattern _ R I _ _? And we know G is in the word? But not at position 5? So we must place G in position 1 or 4? 

But we don't know? So we can try one of the possibilities? Or we can try a word that tests both possibilities? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G in position 1? And then other letters? Or in position 4? 

But we also want to test other common letters? 

Let me list the available letters: 
  D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Common letters: H, L, M, U, D, F, K? 

We can try to form a word that has G in position 1? For example? 
  G R I ? ? 

What words? 
  GRID? -> too short? 
  GRIND? -> but N is excluded? 
  GRIFT? -> G R I F T -> but T is excluded? 
  GRIM? -> too short? 
  GRIMY? -> G R I M Y -> but Y is available? And M? 
  GRIMY: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y? 

But we don't know if G is at position 1? But we can try? 

Alternatively? If we put G at position 4? 
  ? R I G ? 

Words: 
  FRIG? -> too short? 
  FRIGS? -> S excluded? 
  BRIG? -> too short? 
  PRIG? -> too short? 
  URINE? -> but U R I N E? But N and E excluded? 
  TRIG? -> too short? 
  DRINK? -> N excluded? 
  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? 
  FRIGID? -> too long? 

Actually? It's hard to find a word with G at position 4? 

Common words: 
  ORIGIN? -> 6 letters? 
  FRIGHT? -> 6 letters? 

5-letter words with G at position 4? 
  SPRIG? -> S and P excluded? 
  THRIG? -> not a word? 
  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? 

So? Maybe G at position 1 is more likely? 

But we have GRIMY? Which is a word? 

But note: in GRIMY? We have G at position 1? And M at 4? Y at 5? 

But we don't know if G is at position 1? It might be at position 4? 

But if we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position 4? Then we would get? 
  Position1: G? But if secret has G at position4? Then we guess G at position1? So feedback for G would be '-'? Because present but wrong position? And then we have M and Y? Which might be present or not? 

But if the secret word has G at position1? Then we get G at position1 correct? 

So? We can try GRIMY? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have G at position4? And we don't have a good word for that? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G at position4? Even if it's less common? 

For example? 
  URGH? -> not 5 letters? 
  ARGON? -> A excluded? 
  ORGAN? -> O and A excluded? 
  BEGAN? -> B, E, A excluded? 

It's difficult? 

Another idea: use a word that doesn't have G? But we know G is in the word? So we must include G? Because it's present? 

So we have to include G? 

But we don't know where? 

So? We can try to put G in position1? And then test two other common letters? 

So? GRIMY: G R I M Y? 

But M and Y are common? 

Alternatively? GRIFT? But T excluded? 

GRIPE? -> P excluded? 

GRIDE? -> E excluded? 

So? GRIMY seems acceptable? 

But note: we have not tested U? Which is a vowel? But we have I? Which is a vowel? So maybe we don't need? 

But let's see? 

Another word: GRUEL? -> but U and E? E excluded? 

GRUB? -> too short? 

So? I think GRIMY is a good candidate? 

But we have to consider? If we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? 
  Position1: G? If secret has G at position4? Then we get G marked as present but wrong position? 
  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is absent? Unless the secret has M? But we don't know? 
  Position5: Y? Similarly? 

But we also get feedback on M and Y? 

Alternatively? We can try a word that has G in position4? But we don't know one? 

Wait? What about ""ORGAN""? -> but O and A excluded? 

""URGED""? -> U R G E D -> but E excluded? 

""ARGUE""? -> A and E excluded? 

""FRUG""? -> too short? 

So? It's hard? 

Another idea: ""GUILD""? -> G U I L D? But we have I at position3? But in GUILD? I is at position3? So it matches? But we have G at position1? And U at position2? But we know position2 is R? So we cannot? Because position2 must be R? 

We cannot change position2? It must be R? 

So? The word must be of the form: [letter] R I [letter] [letter]? And we know G is in the word? So we must place G in one of the blanks? 

So? We can try: 
  Option 1: G R I ? ? 
  Option 2: ? R I G ? 

For Option 1: G R I ? ? 
  We can try: G R I M Y? 
  Or G R I D E? -> E excluded? 
  G R I L L? -> duplicate L? 
  G R I P E? -> P excluded? 
  G R I F T? -> T excluded? 
  G R I Z Z? -> not a word? 
  G R I N D? -> N excluded? 
  So? GRIMY is one? 

For Option 2: ? R I G ? 
  We can try: D R I G S? -> S excluded? 
  F R I G S? -> S excluded? 
  W R I G S? -> not a word? 
  T R I G O? -> O excluded? 
  P R I G S? -> P and S excluded? 
  B R I G S? -> B and S excluded? 
  H R I G ? -> not found? 
  K R I G ? -> not found? 
  L R I G ? -> not found? 
  M R I G ? -> not found? 
  U R I G ? -> not found? 
  V R I G ? -> not found? 
  Z R I G ? -> not found? 

So? The only common word I can think of for Option 2 is ""WRING""? But we cannot use it because N is excluded? 

Therefore? It seems that the secret word likely has G at position1? 

So? We'll go with GRIMY? 

But let's confirm: GRIMY is a valid word? Yes? Meaning covered with grime? 

So? We guess GRIMY? 

But note: in GRIMY? We have G at position1? M at position4? Y at position5? 

If the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? 
  Position1: G? Marked as '-' (present but wrong position) 
  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is not there? So 'x'? 
  Position5: Y? 'x'? 

And we know R and I are correct? 

Then we would know that G is not at position1? So it must be at position4? And then we have to find the other two letters? 

But we have two guesses left? So it's manageable? 

If we are lucky? And G is at position1? Then we might get more feedback? 

So? Let's go with GRIMY? 

But wait? Another possibility: what if the secret word is ""GRIPS""? But S is excluded? 

Or ""GRIDS""? S excluded? 

So? I think GRIMY is a reasonable guess? 

Therefore? We guess GRIMY? 

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters? GRIMY: G, R, I, M, Y? 
  R and I are known? 
  G is known to be present? 
  M and Y are new? 

And we avoid O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? 

So? Yes? 

<thought>
The feedback indicates:
- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _
- G is present but not in position 5 (from BRING feedback: G(-))
- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N
- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since G must be in position 1 or 4 (as positions 2, 3, 5 are ruled out for G), and no common words fit the pattern with G in position 4 (e.g., ? R I G ?) due to exclusions, G is likely in position 1.

Thus, the pattern becomes G R I _ _.

To test this and cover new letters:
- Guess **GRIMY** (G in position 1, M in 4, Y in 5).
- Tests G at position 1 (if correct, ✓; if not, confirms G must be in position 4).
- Also tests M and Y, two new common letters.

This maximizes information while adhering to constraints.

<guess>GRIMY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ROATE**  
  Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - O, A, T, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: CRISP**  
  Feedback: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is correct in position 2.  
  - I is correct in position 3.  
  - C, S, P are absent.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ R I _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed).  

- **Guess 3: BRING**  
  Feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R and I are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 (no new info).  
  - B and N are absent.  
  - G is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `[pos1] R I [pos4] [pos5]`.  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - R (position 2), I (position 3), and G (present, but not in position 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N (9 letters excluded).  
4. **G's position**:  
   - G cannot be in position 5 (from BRING feedback).  
   - Since positions 2 (R) and 3 (I) are filled, G must be in **position 1 or 4**.  
5. **Available letters**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters remain).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Resolve G's position (1 or 4) and test new high-frequency letters.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Guess a word fitting `_ R I _ _` with G in position 1 (most plausible, given common words).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., M, Y) to maximize information.  
- **Chosen word**: **GRIMY**  
  - Tests G in position 1 (if correct, ✓; if not, G must be in position 4).  
  - Tests M (position 4) and Y (position 5), both common untested letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If G is in position 1, this could solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm G is in position 4.

We know R cannot be in position 1. So if we try a word with R in position 5? \n        WORD: LUMPS -> no R.\n        WORD: VIVID -> no R.\n\n After review, let\'s try to get R in position 2 or 3 or 4 and include new common letters.\n\n I think CRISP is a good candidate:\n   It has R in position 2 (which is a position R could potentially be, since it was not in position 1).\n   It introduces new common letters: C, I, S, P.\n\n Alternatively, consider SHIRK: \n   R is in position 4, and introduces S, H, I, K.\n\n Another option: PRICK -> P,R,I,C,K -> R in position 2? Actually position 2? P is position 1 -> wait: \n   P R I C K -> R is in position 2?

The secret word has R, but we don\'t know where. So putting R in position 2 in the new guess is acceptable.\n\n But note: we must use only letters that are not O,A,T,E and try to cover new ones.\n\n Considering CRISP:\n   - We place R in position 2 (which is a new position).\n   - We test C (common consonant), I (vowel), S (common consonant), P (common consonant).\n\n This gives us a lot of new information.\n\n Another word: BRICK -> has B,R,I,C,K -> avoids O,A,T,E. R is in position 2 again.\n\n However, note: the feedback told us that R is in the word. But we don\'t know if it\'s in multiple positions? Probably not, we just need to find one occurrence.\n\n Let me compare common words: \n   CRISP: uses C, R, I, S, P -> all new letters. This is very efficient for gathering information.\n\n But note: we must not use the letter E (which is excluded) and we are not using O,A,T.\n\n Important: The guess must be a valid English word. CRISP is valid.\n\n Now, what about placing R in a position that wasn\'t position 1? Our feedback said R was not in position 1. CRISP has R in position 2 -> which is allowed.\n\n Let\'s choose CRISP.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider using the vowel U? But since I is also a vowel and more common, testing I might be better.\n\n After consideration, I\'ll go with CRISP.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E, which is good. So:\n\n Guess: CRISP -> C(position1), R(position2), I(position3), S(position4), P(position5).\n\n Let\'s hope this gives us more information.\n\n If the secret word doesn\'t have R in position 2, then we get a ""-"" for R again? Which tells us R is in another position.\n\n We have 5 more tries? Actually, we have 6 total tries, but we used one, so 5 left. This is our second guess.\n\n Therefore, we\'ll guess CRISP.<thought>\nThe feedback from the first guess (ROATE → R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)) reveals:\n- R is in the secret word but NOT in the first position.\n- O, A, T, E are ABSENT from the secret word.\n\nTherefore:\n1. Avoid using O, A, T, E in the next guess.\n2. Include R in a position other than 1 (positions 2–5).\n3. Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters not yet attempted (e.g., I, S, C, N, L).\n\nGiven this context:\n- Common vowels still untested: I, U, Y (I is most frequent).\n- Common consonants still untested: S, N, L, C, H, etc.\n- A strong candidate word should include R (not in position 1), introduce multiple new letters, and omit forbidden characters.\n\nOptimal strategy: Guess **CRISP** because:\n- It places R in position 2 (the first valid alternative to position 1).\n- It introduces three new common consonants (C, S, P) and the vowel I.\n- It omits forbidden letters (O, A, T, E).\n- The word is valid and maximizes potential letter/position information.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>CRISP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ROATE\n  R: present but wrong position → ""-"" (so R is in the word, not at position 1)\n  O, A, T, E: absent → ""x""\n\nSecond guess: CRISP\n  C: absent → ""x""\n  R: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning R is in position 2 of the secret word?)\n  I: correct position → ""✓"" (meaning I is in position 3 of the secret word?)\n  S: absent → ""x""\n  P: absent → ""x""\n\nBut note: the feedback for R and I in CRISP is ""✓"", meaning:\n  - The secret word has R in the second position.\n  - The secret word has I in the third position.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew R was present (but not at position 1). Now we know it is at position 2.\n\nAdditionally, from CRISP, we know:\n  C, S, P are absent → we can add them to the exclusion list.\n\nSo, letters we know are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P.\n\nLetters we know are present: R (at position 2) and I (at position 3).\n\nAlso, since the secret word has R at position 2 and I at position 3, we know the word has at least the pattern: _ R I _ _\n\nWe have 5 positions:\n\nPosition 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters. And note that we don\'t know what letter is here, but it cannot be O, A, T, E, C, S, P.\nPosition 2: R (fixed)\nPosition 3: I (fixed)\nPosition 4: unknown (and must not be O, A, T, E, C, S, P, or R,I? Wait, R and I are already used, but since R is in position 2, it can appear again? But typically in these games, letters can repeat? However, the feedback doesn\'t explicitly say whether duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet. To be safe, we can assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise. Because if there were duplicates, we might have seen feedback indicating a duplicate.\n\nLooking back at the feedback for ROATE: R was present (but not position 1) and we had no indication of a duplicate. Similarly, in CRISP, we had only one R and one I. So let\'s assume for now the word has no duplicate letters.\n\nTherefore, positions 1, 4, and 5 must be letters not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P} and also not R or I? But R and I are already used? So we need three new distinct letters that are not excluded and not R or I.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nwhere letter1, letter4, letter5 are:\n  - Not in {O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I} (so avoiding 9 letters: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,R,I)\n  - They must be English letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we must choose a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _, and uses only letters from the remaining set.\n\nWe have to pick a valid English word. Also, we want to maximize coverage of new letters? We have only three positions to fill.\n\nPossible words that come to mind:\n  BRING? -> B R I N G -> which has G and N, which are untested? But note: we must avoid taken letters? B is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed. However, BRING has an N and a G. But also, note: the pattern must have R at 2 and I at 3: so B R I N G -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.\n\nCheck: letters in BRING: B,R,I,N,G -> R and I are known to be at positions 2 and 3? Yes. The others: B, N, G are allowed? Yes, they haven\'t been tested.\n\nBut note: in CRISP we got feedback that S and P are absent. We also excluded O,A,T,E,C. So BRING uses only fresh letters and fits the pattern? But we don\'t know if N and G are in the word? This guess might be the solution? Or it might test new letters.\n\nWait: the word must be valid and we don\'t know the secret word. So BRING is a valid guess.\n\nAlternatively, we might think of other words:\n  FRISK? -> F R I S K, but S is forbidden? We know S is absent (from Guess 2: S got ""x""). So we cannot use S.\n\n  Another: PRINT -> P R I N T -> but P and T are excluded. T is excluded from the first guess? Yes: T got ""x"" in ROATE? First guess: T was absent? Yes, T got ""x"" in ROATE? Actually: In ROATE: A was in pos3 and got ""x"", T was in pos4 and got ""x"". So T is excluded. Therefore PRINT is invalid because it uses P and T? P is excluded? Guess2: P got ""x"", so P is absent. T we already know is absent.\n\n  Another: DRINK -> D R I N K -> D, N, K are fresh? And the pattern fits: _ R I N K.\n\n  Similarly: GRIND -> G R I N D -> G, N, D fresh.\n\n  Or: BRINK: B R I N K -> B, N, K fresh.\n\n  Also: FRIGID? too long? 5 letters: FRICK? -> not a word. FRUIT? -> F R U I T -> but U is in position 4? But U is allowed? Actually: FRUIT would have I at position 4? But we need position 3 to be I? So no.\n\nLet\'s list possible words matching the pattern _ R I _ _ with the constraints.\n\nPossible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? but we also have to form a word.\n\nWords that come to mind:\n  BRING (as above)\n  BRINK\n  DRINK\n  GRINS? -> but S is excluded? We cannot use S? So GRIN? is 4 letters? We need 5 letter words? So GRINS is not allowed if we cannot use S? And S is excluded.\n\nAlternatively:\n  FRIAR? -> but second R? We don\'t know if duplicate R is allowed? And also A is excluded? Wait: A is absent? So no.\n\n  PRICE? -> uses P (absent) and E (absent) -> no.\n\nAfter thinking, valid words:\n  BRING: B R I N G -> uses B, N, G\n  BRINK: B R I N K -> uses B, N, K\n  DRINK: D R I N K -> D, N, K\n  GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, M, Y\n  KRIS? -> too short.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 unknown positions? Actually two: positions 4 and 5? No: position 1,4,5.\n\nWait, the pattern: position1: ?, position4: ?, position5: ?.\n\nSo we must choose a word that starts with a letter in the available set and ends with two letters also in the available set? And contains only allowed letters.\n\nLet me think of a common word: BRING is common? Yes.\n\nAlso: FRISK: we cannot because S is excluded.\n\nAnother: WRING -> W R I N G -> W, N, G? W is allowed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly: PRIG? -> too short? No, 5 letter? PRIG is 4? PRIGY? not a word.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are rare? But N, G, K, etc. are common.\n\nNow: how to choose? We are testing as many letters as possible? We have three unknown letters? Since we are at guess 3, we want to maximize information? But also we might solve it? But that would be lucky.\n\nIf we guess BRING and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on B, N, G? Which is good? But note: position 4 and 5 are also unknown.\n\nWe could test multiple possibilities? For example, if we test B, N, G in BRING, then we get:\n  If B is correct? Then we have B at position1? And then N and G? Which might be correct or not.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that covers more common letters? The remaining common letters? Common consonants: L, N, H, etc.\n\nBut note: we have many options: we don\'t need to cover all, but we need information.\n\nBut since we know the pattern is ? R I ? ?, we can pick a word that uses common letters? But also we want to test possible letters.\n\nI think BRING is a solid choice? But let me see:\n\nCommon bigrams after ""I""? Often: NG, NK, ND, etc.\n\nSo we can try BRING? which tests B, N, G.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose H R I N G -> HRING? Not a valid word? Or BRINK? Then tests B, N, K.\n\nAnother word: GRIND: G R I N D -> tests G, N, D? D is less common? But valid.\n\nWait: what about U? We haven\'t tested U? But U is a vowel? Maybe the word is BRINY? B R I N Y -> N and Y? Y can be a consonant or vowel? Valid word? Yes.\n\nOr FRITZ: F R I T Z -> but T is absent? So no.\n\nAfter considering, BRING is a very common word? So I\'ll go with that? Because it\'s common and we don\'t have any clues for the other letters.\n\nBut note: we have multiple possibilities? So to avoid burning a guess? We should try to test as many new letters as possible? For example, instead of using N (which appears in many words), we might test a different set? But then we lose coverage? Actually, N is common? So testing N might be good.\n\nLet me look for a word that uses unique letters? For example, that doesn\'t reuse letters? But we must use distinct letters? But the secret word might reuse? But we have no evidence? So we guess distinct.\n\nNow: in BRING, we use three new letters: B, N, G. This is good? Because we test all three at once. If they are all correct, we win? If one is wrong, we get feedback? Then based on that, we can guess again? Since we have 4 tries left? Wait: we have 3 guesses so far? This is the third? Wait: Guess1, Guess2, now Guess3? Then we have three more left? So we can afford to test.\n\nBut we might be able to cover more if we don\'t fix N and G? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we might try a word that uses letters that appear in many possible words? For example, N appears in BRINK, BRING, etc. So if we get N present? Then we know position4?\n\nBut I think guessing BRING is reasonable? Also, note: the secret word might be BRINK? Or something else? But we don\'t know? So we test.\n\nTo be systematic, we can think of the candidate list? But without knowing? We guess.\n\nI decided to guess BRING? Because it fits and tests common letters.\n\nBut wait: the feedback from Guess2? In Guess2 CRISP? We got R(✓) and I(✓) meaning positions 2 and 3? Also, C, S, P absent? So we are safe using B, N, G? Which haven\'t been tried? And avoiding the excluded ones.\n\nSo: let\'s guess BRING? But note: BRING: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G.\n\nIf the secret word were BRINK? Then we would get B? How? Position1: B -> if secret is BRINK? Then both start with B? So we get ""✓"" for B? Then position4: N vs K? So ""x"" for N? Because K is the actual letter? And position5: G vs K? So G would be absent? And K is present? But wait? We don\'t have K in BRING? So we wouldn\'t know? Actually? The secret word BRINK has one K? At position5? So in BRING? We have G at position5? Then feedback: \n  position1: B (if secret starts with B? then ✓) else? \n  position4: N (if secret has N? then feedback depends? If secret is BRINK? Then secret position4 is N? Wait: BRINK:1:B,2:R,3:I,4:N,5:K? So position4 is N? Then if we guess BRING? which has N at position4? That would match? Wait no: BRING has G at position5? So:\n  Guess: B R I N G\n  Secret: B R I N K\n\nThen feedback: \n  position1: B ✓\n  position2: R ✓\n  position3: I ✓\n  position4: N ✓? Because it\'s the correct letter? Wait: N is correct? So ✓? Then position5: G vs K -> G is not K? And K is in the secret? But we have no information? So? Actually: \n  The secret has K? And we guessed G? So G is absent? So position5: x? \n\nTherefore: feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)? But we don\'t know that K is present? Only that G is absent? And we have three correct so far? Then we would know the word ends with K? But only if we get that three ✓ and one x.\n\nBut we don\'t? Because if we get BRING guess? And the secret is BRINK? Then we have positions1-4 correct? So ✓ for B, R, I, N? and x for G? Which tells us position5 is not G? So we know the word is B R I N ??? But? Actually? The feedback does not tell us that K is in the word? Only that G is not? And we already know G is absent? Then we must try other letters? So we lose a guess? \n\nBut that\'s unavoidable.\n\nIn this case, with BRING? We risk that position4 being N? And position5 being something else? We have many possibilities? For example, if N is correct at position4? Then we need to test the last letter? If not? Then we know position4 is not N.\n\nSo? I think BRING is a valid guess? And we\'ll see.\n\nBut to be strategic? Maybe we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume N at position4? For example? We don\'t know what letter is at position4? So we can guess a word that uses all new letters? But uses a letter that is more common? Or in a more common position? \n\nBut? If we don\'t fix N? Then we have more uncertainty? For example? If we guess a word where position4 is not N? Then we test a different set? For instance? GRIMY: G R I M Y -> tests G, M, Y? Which are less common? Hence? BRING? with N in position4? N is a common ending? So? It might be likely? Actually? In English? The position after I? Common? For example? In words ending with ""ING""? So BRING? CRING? But C is excluded? So BRING? FRING? Not that common? But BRING? That\'s a word.\n\nAfter consideration? I\'ll go with BRING? Because? It is a common word? And we test N? Which is a common letter? And G? Also common? So? Let\'s choose that? Of you agree?\n\nLet\'s note: if the secret word is BRING? Then we get five ✓ and win? Else? We get feedback on B, N, G.\n\nTherefore? Let\'s guess BRING?<thought>\nThe feedback from previous guesses reveals:\n- Secret word contains R in position 2 and I in position 3 → pattern: _ R I _ _\n- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E (from Guess 1), and C, S, P (from Guess 2)\n- Therefore, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nGiven pattern _ R I _ _ and exclusions:\n- Position 1 must be one of the available consonants/vowels (likely consonant given English words).\n- Positions 4 and 5 must be available letters, distinct from R/I and exclusions.\n\nOptimal strategy: Guess a valid word matching this pattern while maximizing information:\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, L, U) → ""N"" and ""G"" are common.\n- ""BRING"" is a valid choice: tests new letters B, N, G, with ""N"" in a common bigram (""IN"") and ""G"" in common trigram (""ING"").\n- Alternatives like BRINK, DRINK risk similar letters (e.g., ""K"" vs. ""G"") without additional coverage.\n- ""BRING"" covers three new letters efficiently and provides immediate feedback on high-frequency positions/postfixes.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>BRING</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1: ROATE → R(-), O(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → R present (wrong position), O/A/T/E absent  \n- Guess 2: CRISP → C(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), P(x) → R correct at position 2, I correct at position 3, C/S/P absent  \n\nDeductions:  \n- Secret word pattern: _ R I _ _  \n- Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P  \n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  \n\nStrategic goal:  \n- Guess a valid word matching the pattern _ R I _ _ using untested letters to maximize information.  \n- Prioritize common letters and plausible endings (e.g., ""N"" and ""G"" in ""ING"" bigrams).  \n\nSelected word: **BRING**  \n- Tests B (position 1), N (position 4), G (position 5) → three new common letters  \n- ""BRING"" is a common English word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.\n\n<guess>BRING</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: BRING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ROATE\n  R: present but wrong position (marked as -)\n  O, A, T, E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: CRISP\n  C: absent (x)\n  R: correct position (✓) -> so R is in position 2\n  I: correct position (✓) -> so I is in position 3\n  S: absent (x)\n  P: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: BRING\n  B: absent (x)\n  R: correct (✓) -> position 2, which we already know\n  I: correct (✓) -> position 3, which we already know\n  N: absent (x)\n  G: present but wrong position (marked as -)\n\nSo from all feedback, we know:\n\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ \n  (position 2 is R, position 3 is I)\n\n- We know that the following letters are absent: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N\n\n- We know that G is present in the word, but not in the last position (since in BRING, G was in position 5 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at position 5).\n\nTherefore, G must be in one of the remaining positions: position 1 or position 4? But note the pattern: positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown.\n\nBut wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n  position 2: R\n  position 3: I\n  position 1: unknown, but cannot be any of the absent letters and cannot be R or I (since we assume no duplicates? We haven\'t seen duplicates so far, and G is the only duplicate candidate? But note: in BRING, we had G at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So G is in the word, but not at position 5. And we don\'t have G in any other position? So the secret word has G in either position 1 or position 4? Because position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.\n\nSo the secret word has G in position 1 or 4? But if it were in position 1, then in the guess BRING, we had B at position 1 (which was absent) and G at position 5 (which was present but wrong). So if the secret word had G at position 1, then in the guess BRING, we would have had G at position 5? But the secret has G at position 1? Then the feedback for G would be that it is present but not at position 5? And we don\'t get any feedback about position 1? Because we guessed B at position 1? So that\'s consistent? But we don\'t know if G is at position 1? Because we didn\'t guess it at position 1? We guessed B at position 1? So we don\'t know? Similarly, if G is at position 4? Then in BRING, we had N at position 4? Which was absent? And G at position 5? Which is present but not at 5? So it could be at 4? \n\nTherefore, G must be in position 1 or 4? But we don\'t know which? And we have to find the letter for the other position? And also position 5? \n\nBut note: the secret word has 5 letters? And we know R and I? And G? So we have two more letters? Because the word has 5 distinct letters? We don\'t know about duplicates? But so far, we haven\'t seen any duplicate? And the feedback for G in BRING was only one \'-\'? So if there were two G\'s? We don\'t know? But let\'s assume no duplicates? Because it\'s common? So the secret word has exactly one G? And it is in position 1 or 4? \n\nAlso, we have to fill position 5? And if G is in position 1? Then position 4 and 5 are two other letters? If G is in position 4? Then position 1 and 5 are two other letters? \n\nBut we also have the constraint that the letters must be from the available set? \n\nAvailable letters: we have excluded: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N? So excluded: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? That\'s 9 letters? \n\nThe alphabet has 26? So 26-9=17? But we also have R and I? Which are in the word? And G? Which is in the word? So we have 17-3=14? But we don\'t subtract? Because the available set is the letters not excluded? And we know R, I, G are in? But we are not excluding them? We are excluding the absent ones? \n\nSo the available letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) are: \n  All letters except: O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N (excluded) and except R,I (which are already placed) and G (which is in the word but not placed yet)? \n\nBut note: we can use G again? But we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot use G in two positions? So for the unknown positions? We have to choose from the available set? But G is already in the word? So we cannot use it again? So the letters for the unknown positions (1,4,5) must be from the set: \n  {D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}? And also, we cannot use G? Because it\'s already used? But we are going to place G in one of the positions? \n\nActually, we have to assign G to either position 1 or 4? And then the other two positions (if G is in 1, then positions 4 and 5; if G is in 4, then positions 1 and 5) must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set? \n\nBut we don\'t know which? So we need to design a guess that helps us determine where G is? And what the other letters are? \n\nWe have two unknown positions? Actually three? But one of them is G? So we have to guess a word that has the pattern _ R I _ _? And we know G is in the word? But not at position 5? So we must place G in position 1 or 4? \n\nBut we don\'t know? So we can try one of the possibilities? Or we can try a word that tests both possibilities? \n\nAlternatively? We can try a word that has G in position 1? And then other letters? Or in position 4? \n\nBut we also want to test other common letters? \n\nLet me list the available letters: \n  D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nCommon letters: H, L, M, U, D, F, K? \n\nWe can try to form a word that has G in position 1? For example? \n  G R I ? ? \n\nWhat words? \n  GRID? -> too short? \n  GRIND? -> but N is excluded? \n  GRIFT? -> G R I F T -> but T is excluded? \n  GRIM? -> too short? \n  GRIMY? -> G R I M Y -> but Y is available? And M? \n  GRIMY: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y? \n\nBut we don\'t know if G is at position 1? But we can try? \n\nAlternatively? If we put G at position 4? \n  ? R I G ? \n\nWords: \n  FRIG? -> too short? \n  FRIGS? -> S excluded? \n  BRIG? -> too short? \n  PRIG? -> too short? \n  URINE? -> but U R I N E? But N and E excluded? \n  TRIG? -> too short? \n  DRINK? -> N excluded? \n  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? \n  FRIGID? -> too long? \n\nActually? It\'s hard to find a word with G at position 4? \n\nCommon words: \n  ORIGIN? -> 6 letters? \n  FRIGHT? -> 6 letters? \n\n5-letter words with G at position 4? \n  SPRIG? -> S and P excluded? \n  THRIG? -> not a word? \n  WRING? -> W R I N G -> but N excluded? \n\nSo? Maybe G at position 1 is more likely? \n\nBut we have GRIMY? Which is a word? \n\nBut note: in GRIMY? We have G at position 1? And M at 4? Y at 5? \n\nBut we don\'t know if G is at position 1? It might be at position 4? \n\nBut if we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position 4? Then we would get? \n  Position1: G? But if secret has G at position4? Then we guess G at position1? So feedback for G would be \'-\'? Because present but wrong position? And then we have M and Y? Which might be present or not? \n\nBut if the secret word has G at position1? Then we get G at position1 correct? \n\nSo? We can try GRIMY? \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have G at position4? And we don\'t have a good word for that? \n\nAlternatively? We can try a word that has G at position4? Even if it\'s less common? \n\nFor example? \n  URGH? -> not 5 letters? \n  ARGON? -> A excluded? \n  ORGAN? -> O and A excluded? \n  BEGAN? -> B, E, A excluded? \n\nIt\'s difficult? \n\nAnother idea: use a word that doesn\'t have G? But we know G is in the word? So we must include G? Because it\'s present? \n\nSo we have to include G? \n\nBut we don\'t know where? \n\nSo? We can try to put G in position1? And then test two other common letters? \n\nSo? GRIMY: G R I M Y? \n\nBut M and Y are common? \n\nAlternatively? GRIFT? But T excluded? \n\nGRIPE? -> P excluded? \n\nGRIDE? -> E excluded? \n\nSo? GRIMY seems acceptable? \n\nBut note: we have not tested U? Which is a vowel? But we have I? Which is a vowel? So maybe we don\'t need? \n\nBut let\'s see? \n\nAnother word: GRUEL? -> but U and E? E excluded? \n\nGRUB? -> too short? \n\nSo? I think GRIMY is a good candidate? \n\nBut we have to consider? If we guess GRIMY? And the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? \n  Position1: G? If secret has G at position4? Then we get G marked as present but wrong position? \n  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is absent? Unless the secret has M? But we don\'t know? \n  Position5: Y? Similarly? \n\nBut we also get feedback on M and Y? \n\nAlternatively? We can try a word that has G in position4? But we don\'t know one? \n\nWait? What about ""ORGAN""? -> but O and A excluded? \n\n""URGED""? -> U R G E D -> but E excluded? \n\n""ARGUE""? -> A and E excluded? \n\n""FRUG""? -> too short? \n\nSo? It\'s hard? \n\nAnother idea: ""GUILD""? -> G U I L D? But we have I at position3? But in GUILD? I is at position3? So it matches? But we have G at position1? And U at position2? But we know position2 is R? So we cannot? Because position2 must be R? \n\nWe cannot change position2? It must be R? \n\nSo? The word must be of the form: [letter] R I [letter] [letter]? And we know G is in the word? So we must place G in one of the blanks? \n\nSo? We can try: \n  Option 1: G R I ? ? \n  Option 2: ? R I G ? \n\nFor Option 1: G R I ? ? \n  We can try: G R I M Y? \n  Or G R I D E? -> E excluded? \n  G R I L L? -> duplicate L? \n  G R I P E? -> P excluded? \n  G R I F T? -> T excluded? \n  G R I Z Z? -> not a word? \n  G R I N D? -> N excluded? \n  So? GRIMY is one? \n\nFor Option 2: ? R I G ? \n  We can try: D R I G S? -> S excluded? \n  F R I G S? -> S excluded? \n  W R I G S? -> not a word? \n  T R I G O? -> O excluded? \n  P R I G S? -> P and S excluded? \n  B R I G S? -> B and S excluded? \n  H R I G ? -> not found? \n  K R I G ? -> not found? \n  L R I G ? -> not found? \n  M R I G ? -> not found? \n  U R I G ? -> not found? \n  V R I G ? -> not found? \n  Z R I G ? -> not found? \n\nSo? The only common word I can think of for Option 2 is ""WRING""? But we cannot use it because N is excluded? \n\nTherefore? It seems that the secret word likely has G at position1? \n\nSo? We\'ll go with GRIMY? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: GRIMY is a valid word? Yes? Meaning covered with grime? \n\nSo? We guess GRIMY? \n\nBut note: in GRIMY? We have G at position1? M at position4? Y at position5? \n\nIf the secret word has G at position4? Then we get? \n  Position1: G? Marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position) \n  Position4: M? If secret has G at position4? Then M is not there? So \'x\'? \n  Position5: Y? \'x\'? \n\nAnd we know R and I are correct? \n\nThen we would know that G is not at position1? So it must be at position4? And then we have to find the other two letters? \n\nBut we have two guesses left? So it\'s manageable? \n\nIf we are lucky? And G is at position1? Then we might get more feedback? \n\nSo? Let\'s go with GRIMY? \n\nBut wait? Another possibility: what if the secret word is ""GRIPS""? But S is excluded? \n\nOr ""GRIDS""? S excluded? \n\nSo? I think GRIMY is a reasonable guess? \n\nTherefore? We guess GRIMY? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters? GRIMY: G, R, I, M, Y? \n  R and I are known? \n  G is known to be present? \n  M and Y are new? \n\nAnd we avoid O,A,T,E,C,S,P,B,N? \n\nSo?

We have received feedback from Guess 4: GRIMY -> G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) Y(x)

Summary of feedback so far:

- Guess 1 (ROATE): R is present (wrong position), O, A, T, E absent.
- Guess 2 (CRISP): R position 2 correct, I position 3 correct, C, S, P absent.
- Guess 3 (BRING): R and I confirmed correct (positions 2 and 3), B and N absent, G present but not in position 5 (so in wrong position).
- Guess 4 (GRIMY): G(✓) meaning G is correct at position 1, R(✓) and I(✓) confirmed, M and Y absent.

Key deductions:

1. The secret word starts with G (position 1), then R (position 2), then I (position 3). So the pattern is: G R I _ _

2. We know G is fixed at position 1, which resolves the uncertainty from Guess 3.

3. Feedback for GRIMY: M(x) and Y(x) indicate that M and Y are absent from the secret word. So we can add M and Y to the exclusion list.

4. Previously absent letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N, and now M and Y.

So current absent letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N, M, Y. (11 letters excluded)

5. We have one known present letter: G (at position 1), R (position 2), I (position 3). The word so far is ""G R I"" followed by two unknown letters.

6. We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two new distinct letters (since no duplicates suggested) from the remaining alphabet excluding the absent letters.

7. Available letters: We have the entire alphabet except:
   - Vowels: O, A, E (excluded), so possible vowels: I (already used), U (not tested), and sometimes Y (excluded). But note we have positions 4 and 5. Also, letters can be consonants.
   - Consonants: We've excluded C, S, P, B, N, M, T (excluded), etc.

List of available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But R, I, G are already placed, so they are used.

8. We need to choose a word for positions 4 and 5: ? ? 

The secret word is ""G R I"" + [letter4] [letter5]

We need to form a valid English word with letters from the available set.

Common possibilities:

- Consider words ending with ""K"": GRICK? Not a word. GRIFT? T excluded. GRID? Too short.

- Try ""L"": GRIND? N excluded. GRIM? Too short. GRIS? Too short. But note we need 5 letters.

Another common pattern: ""GRILL"" but L repeated? But available letters include L? And we don't know about duplicates? But so far no duplicates? And GRIMY had no duplicates? So probably none.

But also, note: we are now focusing on positions 4 and 5.

Possible combinations:

- ""GRID"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

What 5-letter words start with ""GRI"" and end with two letters from the available set?

Examples:

- ""GRIND"": N excluded? So no.

- ""GRIPE"": P excluded? And E excluded? No.

- ""GRIFT"": T excluded? And F is available? T excluded.

- ""GRILL"": G R I L L -> but this has duplicate L? And positions: L at 4 and L at 5? Then it fits? But ""GRILL"" is a valid word? Meaning: to cook on a gridiron? However, we had G at position 1? And R at 2? I at 3? Then L at 4 and L at 5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't specify? But in the feedback? For example? In first guess? We had repeated letters? But in ROATE? All distinct? In CRISP? Distinct? BRING? Distinct? GRIMY? Distinct? So we haven't seen any feedback for duplicates? Thus duplicates are allowed? Or not? The game rules don't mention? But typically? Wordle allows duplicates? So it's possible.

But ""GRILL"" has L repeated? And available letters include L? And we haven't tested L? So possible? But the word must be valid? GRILL is valid? Five letters? Yes.

But wait? Position4: L? Position5: L? So same letter? And the secret word might have two L's? But we don't know? So we can guess it? But if we guess ""GRILL"" and the secret has two L's? Then we get feedback accordingly.

But note: available letters: L? Yes? Not excluded? But we have used L not in previous? 

Another possibility: ""GRILL"" requires L available? And we haven't excluded L? So we can use it? 

But let me check other words:

- ""GRID"" + anything? Cannot? 

- ""GRIFF""? G R I F F? F repeated? ""GRIFF"" is a word? Meaning a type of fish? Or sudden attack? But perhaps not common? 

- ""GRITH""? Not common? 

- ""GRICE""? C and E excluded? 

- ""GRIKE"": G R I K E? E excluded? 

- ""GRIDE"": E excluded? 

- ""GRITS"": S excluded? T excluded? 

- ""GRIZE"": E and Z? But Z is available? But E excluded? 

So? Other words? ""GRILL"" seems a common word? We should try it? 

But we need to test the letters? How about ""GRIND""? But N excluded? So it cannot be.

What about ""GRIST""? S and T excluded? 

""GRIPE""? P and E excluded? 

Therefore? ""GRILL"" is a candidate with L? 

Also? ""GRUIT"": G R U I T? But U in position4? I in position5? But position3 is I? And our pattern is G R I at 1,2,3? So position3 is I? Then ""GRUIT"" would have I at position4? But our pattern requires position3 is I? So not matching.

Another: ""GUILD""? G U I L D? But we have R at position2? Not U? So no.

""GRISE"" -> S and E excluded? 

So? ""GRILL"" seems acceptable? 

But note: in ""GRILL""? We have L at both position4 and position5? So we are testing L? And if the secret word has L? Then we get feedback? But we don't know if the positions match? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that uses two different letters? If possible? 

For example? ""GRIDEL""? Too long? 

""GRIM"" too short? 

""GRIP""? Too short? 

""GRI"" + two distinct? What about ""GRIFF""? Which has F repeated? Meaning? But valid? 

But ""GRIFF"" has two F's? 

Similarly? ""GRILL"" has two L's? 

Or ""GRIG"" is 4 letters? 

Another common word: ""GROWL"" -> but O excluded? 

""GROSS"" -> O and S excluded? 

""GROUP"" -> O and P and U? But O and P excluded? 

So? We might have to use repeated letters? 

Another: ""GUILT""? G U I L T? But position2 is U? We need R at position2? So no? 

Therefore? ""GRILL"" is our best? 

But we have the following: 

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

So? We could try: ""GRINK""? Not a word? 

""GRINT""? T excluded? 

""GRILF""? Not a word? 

""GRITH"" is a word? But it? But ""GRITH"" is 5 letters? G R I T H? But T and H? T is excluded? 

""GRIZH"" -> Z and H? Not common? 

""GRIFT"" -> T excluded? 

So? I think ""GRILL"" is the most common word? Therefore? We should guess ""GRILL""? 

And if we are wrong? Then we have one guess left? Then we can adjust? Since we have few possibilities left? 

Or? Another word: ""GRIDL"" -> invalid? 

""GRILL"" is valid? 

So? I'll go with GRILL? 

But note: we haven't tested U? Which is a vowel? But we already have I? So maybe not necessary? 

However? If the secret word were ""GUIDE""? But position2 is R? Not U? And excluded letters? So not? 

Therefore? We guess GRILL? 

But let's write it: G R I L L? 

Feedback? If the secret word were GRILL? Then we get all green? Else? If not? Then we get feedback on L at position4 and position5? 

Now? Possible other words: there might be ""GRIL"" + another letter? But we need two letters? 

Perhaps ""GRIDDLE"" is 7? 

So? We go with GRILL? 

But we must consider? The secret word might be ""GRID"" with an extra letter? But 5 letters? 

Or ""GRINCE""? Not common? 

So? Let's guess it? 

But we also have ""GRIST"" excluded? 

Therefore? <thought>
The secret word is confirmed as G R I _ _, with positions 1-3 fixed. 
Excluded letters: O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N, M, Y.
Available letters for positions 4 and 5: D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Considering common English words fitting G R I _ _:
- ""GRILL"" (L in positions 4 and 5) is the most plausible candidate that uses available letters.
- Alternatives like ""GRIFF"", ""GRITH"", or ""GRING"" are either invalid or use excluded letters.
- Testing ""GRILL"" efficiently checks for L across positions 4 and 5. If incorrect, it isolates remaining possibilities (e.g., ""GRIDDLE"" isn't 5 letters, eliminating other words).

Final guess: **GRILL**.

### Analysis of Feedback
1. **Guess 1 (ROATE)**:  
   - R present (wrong position) → R in word, not position 1.  
   - O, A, T, E absent.  
2. **Guess 2 (CRISP)**:  
   - R correct (position 2) → R fixed at pos 2.  
   - I correct (position 3) → I fixed at pos 3.  
   - C, S, P absent.  
   - Pattern: `_ R I _ _`.  
3. **Guess 3 (BRING)**:  
   - R/I confirmed (pos 2/3).  
   - B, N absent.  
   - G present (wrong position) → G in word, not pos 5.  
4. **Guess 4 (GRIMY)**:  
   - G correct (position 1) → G fixed at pos 1.  
   - R/I confirmed (pos 2/3).  
   - M, Y absent.  
   - Pattern: **G R I _ _** (positions 1-3 confirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Excluded letters** (13 total):  
  O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N, M, Y → Absent.  
- **Available letters** for positions 4-5:  
  D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- Secret word: **G R I _ _** (5 letters, no duplicates inferred).  

### Strategy:
- Only positions 4-5 unknown → Focus on valid English words starting with ""GRI"".  
- Prioritize common letters: L, K, H, F, D.  
- ""GRILL"" fits:  
  - Uses L (high-frequency consonant) in positions 4 and 5.  
  - If L is in the secret word, feedback reveals positions.  
  - If incorrect, next guess narrows to letters like F, K, H.

Summary of feedback so far:

- ""GRILL"" (L in positions 4 and 5) is the most plausible candidate that uses available letters.
- Alternatives like ""GRIFF"", ""GRITH"", or ""GRING"" are either invalid or use excluded letters.
- Testing ""GRILL"" efficiently checks for L across positions 4 and 5. If incorrect, it isolates remaining possibilities (e.g., ""GRIDDLE"" isn't 5 letters, eliminating other words).

Final guess: **GRILL**.

<guess>GRILL</guess>### Analysis of Feedback
1. **Guess 1 (ROATE)**:  
   - R present (wrong position) → R in word, not position 1.  
   - O, A, T, E absent.  
2. **Guess 2 (CRISP)**:  
   - R correct (position 2) → R fixed at pos 2.  
   - I correct (position 3) → I fixed at pos 3.  
   - C, S, P absent.  
   - Pattern: `_ R I _ _`.  
3. **Guess 3 (BRING)**:  
   - R/I confirmed (pos 2/3).  
   - B, N absent.  
   - G present (wrong position) → G in word, not pos 5.  
4. **Guess 4 (GRIMY)**:  
   - G correct (position 1) → G fixed at pos 1.  
   - R/I confirmed (pos 2/3).  
   - M, Y absent.  
   - Pattern: **G R I _ _** (positions 1-3 confirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Excluded letters** (13 total):  
  O, A, T, E, C, S, P, B, N, M, Y → Absent.  
- **Available letters** for positions 4-5:  
  D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- Secret word: **G R I _ _** (5 letters, no duplicates inferred).  

### Strategy:
- Only positions 4-5 unknown → Focus on valid English words starting with ""GRI"".  
- Prioritize common letters: L, K, H, F, D.  
- ""GRILL"" fits:  
  - Uses L (high-frequency consonant) in positions 4 and 5.  
  - If L is in the secret word, feedback reveals positions.  
  - If incorrect, next guess narrows to letters like F, K, H.",Guess 5: GRILL -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
