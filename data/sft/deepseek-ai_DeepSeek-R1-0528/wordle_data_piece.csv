We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: ✓ (E is in the secret word and in the correct position, which is the 5th position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E (since E is in the 5th position and correct).
 - The letter C is present in the secret word, but not in the first position (because in ""crane"", C is the first letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
 And it contains the letter C, but not in the first position.

 Also, since R, A, N are absent, we must avoid them in the next guess.

 We can use this information to form a new guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E (so the last letter is E).
 2. Contains the letter C (but not in the first position).
 3. Does not contain R, A, N.
 4. Uses other common letters to test more possibilities.

 Let's think of words ending with E that contain C and avoid R, A, N.

 Some possibilities: 
   spice, slice, twice, voice, etc.

 However, we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four letters.

 We must avoid R, A, N. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet minus R, A, N.

 Also note: the word must have a C, but not in the first position.

 Let's try to think of words that have C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and end with E.

 Examples:
   Position 2: like in ""scope"" -> but we don't know if S, O, P are in the word? We can try.
   However, we want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in the second position and uses new letters.

 Let's list some words:
   spice: S P I C E -> ends with E, has C in the 4th position? Actually: 
        positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> but we need to avoid using known absent letters? We don't know about S, P, I yet.

 But note: we have only ruled out R, A, N. So S, P, I are still possible.

 However, we also know that the first letter cannot be C (because in the first guess, C was in the first position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there). So the first letter must be something else.

 In ""spice"", the first letter is S. We don't know if S is in the word.

 Another idea: we can try to put C in the second position? For example, ""scope"" (S C O P E) -> but O and P are new.

 But note: we have the constraint that the word must have C and end with E.

 Let's consider: 
   We know the secret word has C and E (with E at the end). So the word must have at least these two letters.

 We can also consider that the first guess had C in the first position and it was wrong, so we can try C in the second, third, or fourth.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""voice"" (V O I C E) -> ends with E, has C in the 4th position.

 But note: we don't know about V, O, I.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position and uses common vowels and consonants.

 How about ""slice"" (S L I C E)? 
   S, L, I are new.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. ""slice"" does not contain R, A, N.

 However, we have a problem: we know that the secret word has C, but we don't know where. We want to test a different position for C.

 Since in the first guess C was in position 1 and it was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let's try to put C in position 2: words like ""scare"" but that has A and R which are absent -> invalid.

 We need a word without R, A, N and with C in position 2 and ending with E.

 Words: 
   scope (S C O P E) -> O and P are new.
   scene -> but N is absent, so invalid.
   scythe -> but that's 6 letters? No, scythe is 6? Actually, scythe is 6 letters: S-C-Y-T-H-E -> too long.

 Actually, we need 5-letter words.

 Another: ""scute"" -> not common, and we want common words.

 How about ""shice""? Not common.

 Alternatively, we can try position 3: 
   words like ""music"" -> but ends with C, not E. We need to end with E.

   ""voice"" (V O I C E) -> C is in position 4.

   ""place"" -> but has A (absent) -> invalid.

   ""price"" -> has R (absent) -> invalid.

   ""slice"" -> C in position 4? 
        S (1), L (2), I (3), C (4), E (5) -> so C is in position 4.

   ""spice"" -> C in position 4.

   ""since"" -> has N (absent) -> invalid.

   ""twice"" -> T W I C E -> C in position 4.

   ""chase"" -> has A -> invalid.

   ""chive"" -> C in position 1? But we know C is not in position 1. Also, we have to avoid having C in the first position? Actually, we can have C in the first position? No, because the feedback for the first guess said C is present but not in the first position. So we cannot put C in the first position again.

   Therefore, we must avoid putting C in the first position.

   So ""chive"" would put C in the first position -> not allowed.

   We need to avoid first position for C.

 After considering, let's choose between ""scope"", ""voice"", ""slice"", ""twice"", ""spice"".

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose ""scope"": 
   S, C, O, P, E -> 
   S is new, C we know is present (but we are testing it in position 2), O is new, P is new, E we know is at the end and correct.

   This way, we test S, O, P and also confirm the position of C (if we get a ✓ for C then it's in position 2, if we get a '-' then it's in the word but not in position 2, and if we get an 'x' then we have a contradiction because we know C is in the word).

   But note: we know C is in the word, so we won't get an 'x' for C.

   Also, we are testing the second position for C.

 Alternatively, ""slice"": tests S, L, I.

 We can also consider ""spice"": tests S, P, I.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the information.

 Another idea: we know the secret word has C and E (at the end). So the word must have at least two letters: C and E. It might have more.

 We can also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Let's go with ""scope"". It uses common letters and tests three new letters (S, O, P) and the position of C.

 So the next guess: ""scope""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""scope"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, we guess ""scope"".

<guess>scope</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with `E`).
- **C** is present but not in position 1.
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (must avoid these letters).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with `E` (position 5).
- Include `C` in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is invalid).
- Exclude `R`, `A`, and `N`.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

Selected **""scope""** because:
- Ends with `E` (position 5).
- Places `C` in position 2 (tests a new position).
- Uses new letters `S`, `O`, `P` (all untested).
- Avoids `R`, `A`, `N`.

 Let's try to put C in position 2: words like ""scare"" but that has A and R which are absent -> invalid.

 We need a word without R, A, N and with C in position 2 and ending with E.

 Words: 
   scope (S C O P E) -> O and P are new.
   scene -> but N is absent, so invalid.
   scythe -> but that's 6 letters? No, scythe is 6? Actually, scythe is 6 letters: S-C-Y-T-H-E -> too long.

 Actually, we need 5-letter words.

 Another: ""scute"" -> not common, and we want common words.

 How about ""shice""? Not common.

 Alternatively, we can try position 3: 
   words like ""music"" -> but ends with C, not E. We need to end with E.

   ""voice"" (V O I C E) -> C is in position 4.

   ""place"" -> but has A (absent) -> invalid.

   ""price"" -> has R (absent) -> invalid.

   ""slice"" -> C in position 4? 
        S (1), L (2), I (3), C (4), E (5) -> so C is in position 4.

   ""spice"" -> C in position 4.

   ""since"" -> has N (absent) -> invalid.

   ""twice"" -> T W I C E -> C in position 4.

   ""chase"" -> has A -> invalid.

   ""chive"" -> C in position 1? But we know C is not in position 1. Also, we have to avoid having C in the first position? Actually, we can have C in the first position? No, because the feedback for the first guess said C is present but not in the first position. So we cannot put C in the first position again.

   Therefore, we must avoid putting C in the first position.

   So ""chive"" would put C in the first position -> not allowed.

   We need to avoid first position for C.

 After considering, let's choose between ""scope"", ""voice"", ""slice"", ""twice"", ""spice"".

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose ""scope"": 
   S, C, O, P, E -> 
   S is new, C we know is present (but we are testing it in position 2), O is new, P is new, E we know is at the end and correct.

   This way, we test S, O, P and also confirm the position of C (if we get a ✓ for C then it's in position 2, if we get a '-' then it's in the word but not in position 2, and if we get an 'x' then we have a contradiction because we know C is in the word).

   But note: we know C is in the word, so we won't get an 'x' for C.

   Also, we are testing the second position for C.

 Alternatively, ""slice"": tests S, L, I.

 We can also consider ""spice"": tests S, P, I.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the information.

 Another idea: we know the secret word has C and E (at the end). So the word must have at least two letters: C and E. It might have more.

 We can also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Let's go with ""scope"". It uses common letters and tests three new letters (S, O, P) and the position of C.

 So the next guess: ""scope""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""scope"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, we guess ""scope"".

<guess>scope</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with `E`).
- **C** is present but not in position 1.
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (must avoid these letters).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with `E` (position 5).
- Include `C` in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is invalid).
- Exclude `R`, `A`, and `N`.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

Selected **""scope""** because:
- Ends with `E` (position 5).
- Places `C` in position 2 (tests a new position).
- Uses new letters `S`, `O`, `P` (all untested).
- Avoids `R`, `A`, `N`.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: - (present, but not in position 1)
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""scope""
- S: x (absent)
- C: - (present, but not in position 2)
- O: x (absent)
- P: - (present, but not in position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is fixed as E).
2. The letters R, A, N, S, O are absent. So we must avoid: R, A, N, S, O.
3. The letter C is present, but not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). So C must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E).
4. The letter P is present, but not in position 4 (from second guess, where P was in position 4).

Also, note that the word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

We have two known present letters: C and P (and E, but E is fixed at the end).

We need to form a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains C (in position 3 or 4) and P (not in position 4).
- Does not contain R, A, N, S, O.

Let's list the available letters (excluding R, A, N, S, O). The alphabet without these: 
B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: E is already in position 5, and we know C and P must be in the word. So we need to choose two more letters (for positions 1, 2, and one of 3 or 4 for C, and the other for P or another letter).

The word structure: 
Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C, because C can't be in position 1, and not the absent ones)
Position 2: similarly, an available letter (but note, we don't know if there are duplicates, but we haven't seen any yet so we assume no duplicates for now)
Position 3: could be C or P or another letter? But we know C must be in 3 or 4, and P must be in the word but not in 4 (so P must be in 1,2, or 3). However, if C is in 3, then P cannot be in 3 (unless duplicate, but we don't have evidence). Similarly, if C is in 4, then P must be in 1,2, or 3.

But note: in the second guess, P was in position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Now, we have two possibilities for C: position 3 or 4.

We can try to cover both possibilities in one guess? Or we can choose a word that tests one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in position 3 and P in a different position (like 1 or 2) and also tests new letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit:

- Ends with E
- Contains C and P
- Avoids R, A, N, S, O

And the positions: 
Option 1: C in position 3
  Then the word: _ _ C _ E
  And P must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4, and 3 is taken by C).

Option 2: C in position 4
  Then the word: _ _ _ C E
  And P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to form words for both.

First, Option 1: _ _ C _ E, with P in position 1 or 2.

Examples:
  With P in position 1: P _ C _ E -> words like: price (but R and I? R is absent -> invalid), place (A absent), peace (E at the end but we have E, but also A absent) -> not possible.

  How about: piece? But E is at the end and we have E in the word twice? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. But ""piece"" has two E's? P-I-E-C-E? That's 5 letters: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But we need the third letter to be C? In this case, if we put C in position 4, then it's option 2. 

  For option 1 (C in position 3): we need the third letter to be C.

  So: _ _ C _ E

  With P in position 1: P _ C _ E -> possible words: 
      pique? But Q and U: P-I-Q-U-E -> but that's 5 letters: P(1), I(2), Q(3) -> wait, we need C in position 3, so not pique.
      We need the third letter to be C: so P _ C _ E.

      Words: 
        piece -> but that's P-I-E-C-E: then position 3 is E, not C -> doesn't fit.
        pace -> only 4 letters.
        puce -> 4 letters.

  How about: pyxie? Not common.

  Let's try with P in position 2: _ P C _ E
      Words: 
        space -> but S is absent -> invalid.
        spice -> S absent -> invalid.
        twice -> T-W-I-C-E: T(1), W(2), I(3), C(4), E(5) -> but that's C in position 4, not 3.

  For _ P C _ E: 
      We can have: uPCH E? Not a word.

  This is difficult. Maybe Option 1 is less likely? 

Now, Option 2: C in position 4: _ _ _ C E, and P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to form words:

  With P in position 1: P _ _ C E
      Words: 
        peace -> has A (absent) -> invalid.
        piece -> P-I-E-C-E: but then we have E in position 3 and 5? And C in position 4. But we know E is only at the end? The feedback for the first guess had E at the end and correct, but if there is another E, we don't know. However, in ""piece"", the first E is in position 3. We haven't tested that. But we are avoiding A, R, N, S, O. ""piece"" has I and E (which are not in the absent list). So ""piece"" is a candidate? But note: we have to check if the letters are allowed. I is allowed, E is allowed (but we know E is at the end, but it might appear again?).

        However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E in position 5 and correct, but that doesn't rule out another E. Similarly, in ""scope"", E was correct at the end. So ""piece"" is possible? But let's see: 
          P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). 
          We know C is present and in position 4? We are testing that. And P is present and in position 1? We are testing that.

        But note: we have an E in position 3. We don't know if that E is in the word? We only know about the E at the end. So it's possible.

        Other words: 
          puce -> too short.
          place -> A absent.

  With P in position 2: _ P _ C E
      Words: 
        spice -> S absent -> invalid.
        twice -> T-W-I-C-E: T(1), W(2), I(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we have P? No, no P. 
        We need a word with P in position 2: so _ P _ C E.
        Examples: 
          upset? But that's 5 letters: U-P-S-E-T -> but S is absent, and doesn't end with E? No.
          apple -> A and P? A is absent.
          apply -> A absent.

        How about: ample -> A absent.

        I'm struggling. 

  With P in position 3: _ _ P C E
      Words: 
        space -> S absent.
        twice -> no P.
        price -> R absent.
        spice -> S absent.
        piece -> P is in position 1, not 3.

        How about: type -> T-Y-P-E, but that's 4 letters? T-Y-P-E is 4. We need 5: _ _ P C E -> so two letters before P.

        Words: 
          grape -> G-R-A-P-E -> R and A absent -> invalid.
          tripe -> T-R-I-P-E -> R absent -> invalid.
          swipe -> S-W-I-P-E -> S absent -> invalid.
          pipe -> too short.

        Not many common words.

Given the difficulty, let's reconsider ""piece"". It fits the pattern for Option 2: C in position 4 and P in position 1. And it uses the letters P, I, E, C, E. But note: it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E in the middle? But we don't know.

Another word for Option 2 with P in position 1: ""puces"" -> but that's 5 letters? P-U-C-E-S -> but that ends with S, not E? And we need to end with E. Also, C is in position 3? We need C in position 4.

How about ""pique""? P-I-Q-U-E -> that's P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). Then C is not in the word? But we know C must be in the word. So invalid.

Another: ""price"" -> but R is absent.

We are limited.

What about ""chime""? But C is in position 1? We cannot have C in position 1. And also, we need C in position 4? ""chime"" has C in 1.

Another idea: maybe we can try a word that has C in position 3 (Option 1) and P in position 1? We had trouble, but let's try again.

Option 1: _ _ C _ E, with P in position 1: P _ C _ E

Words: 
  pyxes? P-Y-X-E-S -> but ends with S, not E? And we need the last letter E. Also, the third letter is X, not C? We need the third letter to be C.

  How about: ""piece"" doesn't fit because the third letter is E, not C.

  ""pence"" -> P-E-N-C-E: but N is absent -> invalid.

  ""place"" -> A absent.

  ""peace"" -> A absent.

  ""puce"" -> too short.

  ""pucke""? Not a word.

  ""pique"" -> doesn't have C.

  ""poche"" -> P-O-C-H-E: but O is absent -> invalid.

  ""pice"" -> too short.

  ""pecan"" -> doesn't end with E and has A and N.

This is not working.

Perhaps we can have P in position 2 for Option 1: _ P C _ E

Words: 
  space -> S absent.
  spice -> S absent.
  twice -> T-W-I-C-E -> but that's C in position 4, not 3.
  We need the third letter to be C: so _ P C _ E.

  Examples: 
    ""upcue""? Not a word.
    ""opcue""? Not a word and O absent.
    ""apace"" -> A absent and not the pattern.

  ""epoch"" -> E-P-O-C-H -> but O absent, and doesn't end with E? It ends with H.

  ""epic"" -> too short.

  I'm not finding common words.

Given the challenge, let's consider that C might be in position 4 (Option 2) and P in position 3: _ _ P C E

We need two letters before P. And avoid R,A,N,S,O.

Possible words: 
  ""lupus"" -> not ending with E.
  ""types"" -> ends with S.
  ""typec"" -> not a word.

  How about: ""lycee""? L-Y-C-E-E -> but that has C in position 3, not 4? And two E's? 
      L(1), Y(2), C(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need C in position 4? Here it's in 3.

  ""piece"" we already considered, but P is in position 1.

  ""tapas"" -> not.

  Another idea: ""coupe"" -> C-O-U-P-E -> but O is absent, and C is in position 1 -> invalid.

  ""poupe"" -> not a word.

  ""puppy"" -> not.

  ""hippo"" -> not ending with E.

  ""tempo"" -> O absent and not ending with E.

  ""ample"" -> A absent.

  ""apple"" -> A absent.

  ""tripe"" -> R absent.

  ""gripe"" -> G-R-I-P-E -> R absent.

  ""wipe"" -> too short.

  ""pipes"" -> ends with S.

  ""piper"" -> ends with R.

  ""pipet"" -> P-I-P-E-T -> but that's P in 1 and 3, and ends with T.

  ""piped"" -> P-I-P-E-D -> ends with D.

  ""pixel"" -> P-I-X-E-L -> but that's P(1), I(2), X(3), E(4), L(5) -> then C is not in the word? But we need C.

  We must have C in the word.

  How about ""pique"" again? No C.

  ""force"" -> F-O-R-C-E -> O and R absent.

  ""dice"" -> too short.

  ""dicey"" -> not ending with E.

  ""niche"" -> N absent.

  ""vice"" -> too short.

  ""voice"" -> O absent.

  ""bicep"" -> B-I-C-E-P -> ends with P, not E.

  ""bice"" -> too short.

  ""mice"" -> too short.

  ""mice"" is 4 letters.

  ""piece"" seems to be the only common word that fits: P-I-E-C-E.

  But in ""piece"", we have:
    Position 1: P (we are testing P in position 1)
    Position 2: I (new letter)
    Position 3: E (we know E is at the end, but we don't know if it can be in position 3 too)
    Position 4: C (testing C in position 4)
    Position 5: E (known)

  We know from the first guess that E is at the end, but it might appear elsewhere. The feedback doesn't rule out an additional E.

  Also, we know P is present and not in position 4 (from guess 2), so position 1 is a valid place for P.

  And C is present and not in position 1 or 2, so position 4 is a valid place.

  So let's go with ""piece"".

  If the secret word is ""piece"", then we get:
    P: should be ✓ (if it's in position 1) or - (if it's present but not in 1) but we know P is present and we are putting it in 1, so if it's in 1 then ✓, if not then -.
    I: we don't know, could be anything.
    E: in position 3: if the secret word has E only at the end, then this E might be absent or present but wrong position? But if the secret word has two E's, then it could be present.

  But we are using ""piece"" to test.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in the middle to avoid confusion? But we don't have many options.

  Another word: ""pudge""? P-U-D-G-E -> but no C.

  ""pulse"" -> S and U? S is absent.

  ""purge"" -> R and U? R absent.

  ""pique"" -> no C.

  ""price"" -> R absent.

  So ""piece"" seems to be the best option.

  We'll guess ""piece"".

But note: in ""piece"", the letter E appears twice. We know one E is at the end. The other E in position 3 might be:
  - If the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 would be marked as absent (x) or maybe as present but wrong position? But it is in the word, but in the wrong position? However, if the secret word has only one E and it's at the end, then the E in position 3 is not present (because that instance is not in the word). But wait, the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in a different position is marked with '-', and for a letter not in the word at all, 'x'. 

  If the secret word has only one E (at position 5), then the E in position 3 of ""piece"" is not present in the word (because the only E is at the end), so it would be marked 'x'. 

  If the secret word has two E's (one at position 3 and one at 5), then the E in position 3 would be marked as correct (✓) if it is in the correct position, or '-' if it is in the word but not at position 3? But if the secret word has an E at position 3, then it would be ✓.

  But we don't know.

  However, we are trying to find the secret word, and ""piece"" might be it.

  Given the constraints, we'll try ""piece"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the secret word is, say, ""juice"" (but we don't have J in our available? J is available, but we haven't tested). But ""juice"" has C in position 4 and ends with E, and avoids R,A,N,S,O. But it doesn't have P. We know P is present, so ""juice"" wouldn't work.

Another possibility: ""truce"" -> but R is absent.

""chide"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

So ""piece"" is a strong candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""piece"".

<guess>piece</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Secret word ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
- **C is present** but not in position 1 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""scope"").
- **P is present** but not in position 4 (from ""scope"").
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, S, O (must avoid these).
- **E is confirmed at position 5**, but the word may have additional E's.

The secret word must:
- Have the form `_ _ _ _ E`.
- Contain **C** (in position 3 or 4) and **P** (in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Exclude R, A, N, S, O.

After evaluating possibilities, **""piece""** fits best:
- `P` in position 1 (tests if P is correct there).
- `I` in position 2 (new letter).
- `E` in position 3 (tests for additional E).
- `C` in position 4 (tests C in a new position).
- `E` in position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently tests:
- Placement of **C** (position 4) and **P** (position 1).
- Presence of **I** and potential additional **E**.
- Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>piece</guess>",piece,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: - (present, but not in position 1)
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""scope""
- S: x (absent)
- C: - (present, but not in position 2)
- O: x (absent)
- P: - (present, but not in position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is fixed as E).
2. The letters R, A, N, S, O are absent. So we must avoid: R, A, N, S, O.
3. The letter C is present, but not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). So C must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E).
4. The letter P is present, but not in position 4 (from second guess, where P was in position 4).

Also, note that the word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

We have two known present letters: C and P (and E, but E is fixed at the end).

We need to form a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains C (in position 3 or 4) and P (not in position 4).
- Does not contain R, A, N, S, O.

Let's list the available letters (excluding R, A, N, S, O). The alphabet without these: 
B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: E is already in position 5, and we know C and P must be in the word. So we need to choose two more letters (for positions 1, 2, and one of 3 or 4 for C, and the other for P or another letter).

The word structure: 
Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C, because C can't be in position 1, and not the absent ones)
Position 2: similarly, an available letter (but note, we don't know if there are duplicates, but we haven't seen any yet so we assume no duplicates for now)
Position 3: could be C or P or another letter? But we know C must be in 3 or 4, and P must be in the word but not in 4 (so P must be in 1,2, or 3). However, if C is in 3, then P cannot be in 3 (unless duplicate, but we don't have evidence). Similarly, if C is in 4, then P must be in 1,2, or 3.

But note: in the second guess, P was in position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Now, we have two possibilities for C: position 3 or 4.

We can try to cover both possibilities in one guess? Or we can choose a word that tests one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in position 3 and P in a different position (like 1 or 2) and also tests new letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit:

- Ends with E
- Contains C and P
- Avoids R, A, N, S, O

And the positions: 
Option 1: C in position 3
  Then the word: _ _ C _ E
  And P must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4, and 3 is taken by C).

Option 2: C in position 4
  Then the word: _ _ _ C E
  And P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to form words for both.

First, Option 1: _ _ C _ E, with P in position 1 or 2.

Examples:
  With P in position 1: P _ C _ E -> words like: price (but R and I? R is absent -> invalid), place (A absent), peace (E at the end but we have E, but also A absent) -> not possible.

  How about: piece? But E is at the end and we have E in the word twice? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. But ""piece"" has two E's? P-I-E-C-E? That's 5 letters: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But we need the third letter to be C? In this case, if we put C in position 4, then it's option 2. 

  For option 1 (C in position 3): we need the third letter to be C.

  So: _ _ C _ E

  With P in position 1: P _ C _ E -> possible words: 
      pique? But Q and U: P-I-Q-U-E -> but that's 5 letters: P(1), I(2), Q(3) -> wait, we need C in position 3, so not pique.
      We need the third letter to be C: so P _ C _ E.

      Words: 
        piece -> but that's P-I-E-C-E: then position 3 is E, not C -> doesn't fit.
        pace -> only 4 letters.
        puce -> 4 letters.

  How about: pyxie? Not common.

  Let's try with P in position 2: _ P C _ E
      Words: 
        space -> but S is absent -> invalid.
        spice -> S absent -> invalid.
        twice -> T-W-I-C-E: T(1), W(2), I(3), C(4), E(5) -> but that's C in position 4, not 3.

  For _ P C _ E: 
      We can have: uPCH E? Not a word.

  This is difficult. Maybe Option 1 is less likely? 

Now, Option 2: C in position 4: _ _ _ C E, and P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to form words:

  With P in position 1: P _ _ C E
      Words: 
        peace -> has A (absent) -> invalid.
        piece -> P-I-E-C-E: but then we have E in position 3 and 5? And C in position 4. But we know E is only at the end? The feedback for the first guess had E at the end and correct, but if there is another E, we don't know. However, in ""piece"", the first E is in position 3. We haven't tested that. But we are avoiding A, R, N, S, O. ""piece"" has I and E (which are not in the absent list). So ""piece"" is a candidate? But note: we have to check if the letters are allowed. I is allowed, E is allowed (but we know E is at the end, but it might appear again?).

        However, the feedback for ""crane"" had E in position 5 and correct, but that doesn't rule out another E. Similarly, in ""scope"", E was correct at the end. So ""piece"" is possible? But let's see: 
          P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). 
          We know C is present and in position 4? We are testing that. And P is present and in position 1? We are testing that.

        But note: we have an E in position 3. We don't know if that E is in the word? We only know about the E at the end. So it's possible.

        Other words: 
          puce -> too short.
          place -> A absent.

  With P in position 2: _ P _ C E
      Words: 
        spice -> S absent -> invalid.
        twice -> T-W-I-C-E: T(1), W(2), I(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we have P? No, no P. 
        We need a word with P in position 2: so _ P _ C E.
        Examples: 
          upset? But that's 5 letters: U-P-S-E-T -> but S is absent, and doesn't end with E? No.
          apple -> A and P? A is absent.
          apply -> A absent.

        How about: ample -> A absent.

        I'm struggling. 

  With P in position 3: _ _ P C E
      Words: 
        space -> S absent.
        twice -> no P.
        price -> R absent.
        spice -> S absent.
        piece -> P is in position 1, not 3.

        How about: type -> T-Y-P-E, but that's 4 letters? T-Y-P-E is 4. We need 5: _ _ P C E -> so two letters before P.

        Words: 
          grape -> G-R-A-P-E -> R and A absent -> invalid.
          tripe -> T-R-I-P-E -> R absent -> invalid.
          swipe -> S-W-I-P-E -> S absent -> invalid.
          pipe -> too short.

        Not many common words.

Given the difficulty, let's reconsider ""piece"". It fits the pattern for Option 2: C in position 4 and P in position 1. And it uses the letters P, I, E, C, E. But note: it has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. But it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E in the middle? But we don't know.

Another word for Option 2 with P in position 1: ""puces"" -> but that's 5 letters? P-U-C-E-S -> but that ends with S, not E? And we need to end with E. Also, C is in position 3? We need C in position 4.

How about ""pique""? P-I-Q-U-E -> that's P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). Then C is not in the word? But we know C must be in the word. So invalid.

Another: ""price"" -> but R is absent.

We are limited.

What about ""chime""? But C is in position 1? We cannot have C in position 1. And also, we need C in position 4? ""chime"" has C in 1.

Another idea: maybe we can try a word that has C in position 3 (Option 1) and P in position 1? We had trouble, but let's try again.

Option 1: _ _ C _ E, with P in position 1: P _ C _ E

Words: 
  pyxes? P-Y-X-E-S -> but ends with S, not E? And we need the last letter E. Also, the third letter is X, not C? We need the third letter to be C.

  How about: ""piece"" doesn't fit because the third letter is E, not C.

  ""pence"" -> P-E-N-C-E: but N is absent -> invalid.

  ""place"" -> A absent.

  ""peace"" -> A absent.

  ""puce"" -> too short.

  ""pucke""? Not a word.

  ""pique"" -> doesn't have C.

  ""poche"" -> P-O-C-H-E: but O is absent -> invalid.

  ""pice"" -> too short.

  ""pecan"" -> doesn't end with E and has A and N.

This is not working.

Perhaps we can have P in position 2 for Option 1: _ P C _ E

Words: 
  space -> S absent.
  spice -> S absent.
  twice -> T-W-I-C-E -> but that's C in position 4, not 3.
  We need the third letter to be C: so _ P C _ E.

  Examples: 
    ""upcue""? Not a word.
    ""opcue""? Not a word and O absent.
    ""apace"" -> A absent and not the pattern.

  ""epoch"" -> E-P-O-C-H -> but O absent, and doesn't end with E? It ends with H.

  ""epic"" -> too short.

  I'm not finding common words.

Given the challenge, let's consider that C might be in position 4 (Option 2) and P in position 3: _ _ P C E

We need two letters before P. And avoid R,A,N,S,O.

Possible words: 
  ""lupus"" -> not ending with E.
  ""types"" -> ends with S.
  ""typec"" -> not a word.

  How about: ""lycee""? L-Y-C-E-E -> but that has C in position 3, not 4? And two E's? 
      L(1), Y(2), C(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need C in position 4? Here it's in 3.

  ""piece"" we already considered, but P is in position 1.

  ""tapas"" -> not.

  Another idea: ""coupe"" -> C-O-U-P-E -> but O is absent, and C is in position 1 -> invalid.

  ""poupe"" -> not a word.

  ""puppy"" -> not.

  ""hippo"" -> not ending with E.

  ""tempo"" -> O absent and not ending with E.

  ""ample"" -> A absent.

  ""apple"" -> A absent.

  ""tripe"" -> R absent.

  ""gripe"" -> G-R-I-P-E -> R absent.

  ""wipe"" -> too short.

  ""pipes"" -> ends with S.

  ""piper"" -> ends with R.

  ""pipet"" -> P-I-P-E-T -> but that's P in 1 and 3, and ends with T.

  ""piped"" -> P-I-P-E-D -> ends with D.

  ""pixel"" -> P-I-X-E-L -> but that's P(1), I(2), X(3), E(4), L(5) -> then C is not in the word? But we need C.

  We must have C in the word.

  How about ""pique"" again? No C.

  ""force"" -> F-O-R-C-E -> O and R absent.

  ""dice"" -> too short.

  ""dicey"" -> not ending with E.

  ""niche"" -> N absent.

  ""vice"" -> too short.

  ""voice"" -> O absent.

  ""bicep"" -> B-I-C-E-P -> ends with P, not E.

  ""bice"" -> too short.

  ""mice"" -> too short.

  ""mice"" is 4 letters.

  ""piece"" seems to be the only common word that fits: P-I-E-C-E.

  But in ""piece"", we have:
    Position 1: P (we are testing P in position 1)
    Position 2: I (new letter)
    Position 3: E (we know E is at the end, but we don't know if it can be in position 3 too)
    Position 4: C (testing C in position 4)
    Position 5: E (known)

  We know from the first guess that E is at the end, but it might appear elsewhere. The feedback doesn't rule out an additional E.

  Also, we know P is present and not in position 4 (from guess 2), so position 1 is a valid place for P.

  And C is present and not in position 1 or 2, so position 4 is a valid place.

  So let's go with ""piece"".

  If the secret word is ""piece"", then we get:
    P: should be ✓ (if it's in position 1) or - (if it's present but not in 1) but we know P is present and we are putting it in 1, so if it's in 1 then ✓, if not then -.
    I: we don't know, could be anything.
    E: in position 3: if the secret word has E only at the end, then this E might be absent or present but wrong position? But if the secret word has two E's, then it could be present.

  But we are using ""piece"" to test.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in the middle to avoid confusion? But we don't have many options.

  Another word: ""pudge""? P-U-D-G-E -> but no C.

  ""pulse"" -> S and U? S is absent.

  ""purge"" -> R and U? R absent.

  ""pique"" -> no C.

  ""price"" -> R absent.

  So ""piece"" seems to be the best option.

  We'll guess ""piece"".

But note: in ""piece"", the letter E appears twice. We know one E is at the end. The other E in position 3 might be:
  - If the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 3 would be marked as absent (x) or maybe as present but wrong position? But it is in the word, but in the wrong position? However, if the secret word has only one E and it's at the end, then the E in position 3 is not present (because that instance is not in the word). But wait, the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in a different position is marked with '-', and for a letter not in the word at all, 'x'. 

  If the secret word has only one E (at position 5), then the E in position 3 of ""piece"" is not present in the word (because the only E is at the end), so it would be marked 'x'. 

  If the secret word has two E's (one at position 3 and one at 5), then the E in position 3 would be marked as correct (✓) if it is in the correct position, or '-' if it is in the word but not at position 3? But if the secret word has an E at position 3, then it would be ✓.

  But we don't know.

  However, we are trying to find the secret word, and ""piece"" might be it.

  Given the constraints, we'll try ""piece"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the secret word is, say, ""juice"" (but we don't have J in our available? J is available, but we haven't tested). But ""juice"" has C in position 4 and ends with E, and avoids R,A,N,S,O. But it doesn't have P. We know P is present, so ""juice"" wouldn't work.

Another possibility: ""truce"" -> but R is absent.

""chide"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

So ""piece"" is a strong candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""piece"".

<guess>piece</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Secret word ends with E** (position 5 is confirmed).
- **C is present** but not in position 1 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""scope"").
- **P is present** but not in position 4 (from ""scope"").
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, S, O (must avoid these).
- **E is confirmed at position 5**, but the word may have additional E's.

The secret word must:
- Have the form `_ _ _ _ E`.
- Contain **C** (in position 3 or 4) and **P** (in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Exclude R, A, N, S, O.

After evaluating possibilities, **""piece""** fits best:
- `P` in position 1 (tests if P is correct there).
- `I` in position 2 (new letter).
- `E` in position 3 (tests for additional E).
- `C` in position 4 (tests C in a new position).
- `E` in position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently tests:
- Placement of **C** (position 4) and **P** (position 1).
- Presence of **I** and potential additional **E**.
- Avoids all absent letters.",Guess 3: piece -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) E(✓) C(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
