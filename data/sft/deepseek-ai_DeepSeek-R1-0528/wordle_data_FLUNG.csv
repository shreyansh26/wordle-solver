We are starting the game. For the first guess, we have no prior information. 
 We want a word that maximizes the information we gain, meaning we can test as many common letters as possible in different positions.
 Common vowels and consonants are important. Often, starting words include a mix of vowels and common consonants.
 Some popular starting words are: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRIED"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
  R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
  A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
  N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (which is the 4th letter, because in ""crane"", N is the 4th letter).
  E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So the secret word has N in the 4th position (so it's of the form ???N?), and it does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We have used one try and have 5 left.

Constraints for the second guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- The 4th letter must be N (to confirm its position and potentially get more information).
- Must not use the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the secret word.

We need to choose a word that has N in the 4th position and uses new letters to maximize the information we gain.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many of these common letters as possible, especially vowels (since we only know about A and E being absent, but there are other vowels: I, O, U). Having a vowel might be helpful.

Consider words ending with N: ...N.

Common endings: -IN-, -ON-, -UN-, etc. But note that we need the 4th letter to be N, so the pattern is _ _ _ N _

List some candidate words (with N in 4th position, and avoiding C,R,A,E):
- Words ending with ""ND"": the last letter would be D, so _ _ N D. But then the 4th is N and 5th is D? Let's think of words: ""blend"", but then E is absent -> invalid because E is not allowed. Similarly, ""stand"" has A and S,T but A is not allowed. We cannot use A and E.

Avoid words that have C,R,A,E.

Examples of words with N in the 4th position (index 3 if 0-indexed):
- ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> but we don't know if S or D are allowed? We can use them because they haven't been tested. However, note that ""bonds"" has O as a vowel. Let's check: positions: 0:B, 1:O, 2:N -> wait, no: in ""bonds"", the letters are B O N D S. So the 3rd letter is D? I am considering indices carefully: 
  Position: 0: B, 1: O, 2: N, 3: D, 4: S -> so N is at index 2 (3rd position). But we need N at the 4th letter? Wait, our positions: the first letter is position 1, second is 2, third is 3, fourth is 4, fifth is 5.

In the word ""crane"": C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, E at 5.

So for the next word, we need the fourth position (index 3) to be N.

Therefore, we are looking for words where the 4th letter is N.

Let me list words that have N at the 4th position and do not contain C, R, A, E.

Examples:
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> fourth letter is N? Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this has the 4th letter as N? Wait, no: if we count: 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: N -> yes, N is at position 4.
But then the fifth letter is T. And it has vowels O and I.

This word ""point"": P (new), O (new vowel), I (new vowel), N (we know is in the word and at position 4), T (new).

And it does not include C, R, A, E.

Similarly, other words:
- ""joint"": J (new), O, I, N, T -> similar.
- ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> U is a vowel.
- ""paint"": has A -> not allowed because A is absent from secret word.
- ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> fourth letter N? Positions: S (1), T (2), I (3), N (4), G (5). Correct.
- ""swing"": S, W, I, N, G -> same pattern.
- ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G.

We have many options. We want to test as many new letters as possible, especially vowels.

In ""point"", we test P, O, I, T (besides the known N). Similarly, ""mount"" tests M, O, U, T.

Vowels: we know A and E are absent, so probably the word has one of I, O, U? Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

Possible words: 
- ""point"" -> P, O, I, N, T
- ""joint"" -> J, O, I, N, T (but J is less common, so perhaps not the best)
- ""mount"" -> M, O, U, N, T
- ""sting"" -> S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G (and N)
- ""thing"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> tests T, H, I, G
- ""shind"" -> not a word, so invalid.

Another option: ""prong"" -> P, R, O, N, G -> but R is forbidden? R is absent, so we cannot use R. Feedback said R is not in the word.

So we must avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A, C, E.

Therefore, ""point"" seems good: letters P, O, I, T are new.

Another candidate: ""boink""? Is that word? Not common. Let's stick to common words.

Also, ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> fourth letter N? Positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5) -> yes.

But ""downy"" tests D,O,W,Y.

We don't have a vowel in the third position? We have O which is a vowel at second position.

But in ""point"", we have vowels at positions 2 and 3 (O and I). That might be advantageous.

Alternatively, ""mince"": but has C and E -> invalid.

So I think ""point"" is a strong candidate.

Another option: ""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> wait, C is forbidden? Yes, C cannot be used because we know it's not in the word. So ""lynch"" has C -> invalid.

Similarly, avoid any word with C,R,A,E.

Therefore, let me go with ""point"".

We can also consider ""joint"", but J is less frequent.

Another: ""downt""? Not a word.

""hound"": H, O, U, N, D -> positions: H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Also avoids C,R,A,E. This tests H,O,U,D.

But ""hound"" has two vowels O and U.

Which of the two? ""point"" vs. ""hound"":

In ""point"": letters P,O,I,T,N -> we know N is in place, so we test P,O,I,T.
In ""hound"": H,O,U,D,N -> test H,O,U,D.

We want to cover high-frequency letters. P and T are common consonants, O and I are vowels. H, O, U, D: O and U are vowels, H and D are consonants.

Both are good. But note we don't know if D is present or not? Similarly for T.

Since we are in the second guess, either is fine.

I think ""point"" is a standard word and gives a good spread.

Let me choose ""point"".

So the second guess is ""point"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (marked as ""✓"").  

This means the secret word:  
- Must have N as the 4th letter.  
- Cannot contain C, R, A, or E.  

For the new guess:  
- Select a valid 5-letter word with N in the 4th position.  
- Focus on introducing new, common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, P, etc.) to maximize information gain since C, R, A, and E are eliminated.  

After evaluating options like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T), ""mount"" (tests M, O, U, T), and ""hound"" (tests H, O, U, D), I chose ""point"" because:  
- It efficiently tests two new vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T) alongside the known N.  
- Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, E), it helps probe the secret word's structure faster.  

<guess>point</guess>",point,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

In the word ""crane"": C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, E at 5.

So for the next word, we need the fourth position (index 3) to be N.

Therefore, we are looking for words where the 4th letter is N.

Let me list words that have N at the 4th position and do not contain C, R, A, E.

Examples:

So the secret word has N in the 4th position (so it's of the form ???N?), and it does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We have used one try and have 5 left.

Constraints for the second guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- The 4th letter must be N (to confirm its position and potentially get more information).
- Must not use the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the secret word.

We need to choose a word that has N in the 4th position and uses new letters to maximize the information we gain.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many of these common letters as possible, especially vowels (since we only know about A and E being absent, but there are other vowels: I, O, U). Having a vowel might be helpful.

Consider words ending with N: ...N.

Common endings: -IN-, -ON-, -UN-, etc. But note that we need the 4th letter to be N, so the pattern is _ _ _ N _

List some candidate words (with N in 4th position, and avoiding C,R,A,E):
- Words ending with ""ND"": the last letter would be D, so _ _ N D. But then the 4th is N and 5th is D? Let's think of words: ""blend"", but then E is absent -> invalid because E is not allowed. Similarly, ""stand"" has A and S,T but A is not allowed. We cannot use A and E.

Avoid words that have C,R,A,E.

Examples of words with N in the 4th position (index 3 if 0-indexed):
- ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> but we don't know if S or D are allowed? We can use them because they haven't been tested. However, note that ""bonds"" has O as a vowel. Let's check: positions: 0:B, 1:O, 2:N -> wait, no: in ""bonds"", the letters are B O N D S. So the 3rd letter is D? I am considering indices carefully: 
  Position: 0: B, 1: O, 2: N, 3: D, 4: S -> so N is at index 2 (3rd position). But we need N at the 4th letter? Wait, our positions: the first letter is position 1, second is 2, third is 3, fourth is 4, fifth is 5.

In the word ""crane"": C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, E at 5.

So for the next word, we need the fourth position (index 3) to be N.

Therefore, we are looking for words where the 4th letter is N.

Let me list words that have N at the 4th position and do not contain C, R, A, E.

Examples:
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> fourth letter is N? Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this has the 4th letter as N? Wait, no: if we count: 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: N -> yes, N is at position 4.
But then the fifth letter is T. And it has vowels O and I.

This word ""point"": P (new), O (new vowel), I (new vowel), N (we know is in the word and at position 4), T (new).

And it does not include C, R, A, E.

Similarly, other words:
- ""joint"": J (new), O, I, N, T -> similar.
- ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> U is a vowel.
- ""paint"": has A -> not allowed because A is absent from secret word.
- ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> fourth letter N? Positions: S (1), T (2), I (3), N (4), G (5). Correct.
- ""swing"": S, W, I, N, G -> same pattern.
- ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G.

We have many options. We want to test as many new letters as possible, especially vowels.

In ""point"", we test P, O, I, T (besides the known N). Similarly, ""mount"" tests M, O, U, T.

Vowels: we know A and E are absent, so probably the word has one of I, O, U? Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

Possible words: 
- ""point"" -> P, O, I, N, T
- ""joint"" -> J, O, I, N, T (but J is less common, so perhaps not the best)
- ""mount"" -> M, O, U, N, T
- ""sting"" -> S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G (and N)
- ""thing"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> tests T, H, I, G
- ""shind"" -> not a word, so invalid.

Another option: ""prong"" -> P, R, O, N, G -> but R is forbidden? R is absent, so we cannot use R. Feedback said R is not in the word.

So we must avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A, C, E.

Therefore, ""point"" seems good: letters P, O, I, T are new.

Another candidate: ""boink""? Is that word? Not common. Let's stick to common words.

Also, ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> fourth letter N? Positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5) -> yes.

But ""downy"" tests D,O,W,Y.

We don't have a vowel in the third position? We have O which is a vowel at second position.

But in ""point"", we have vowels at positions 2 and 3 (O and I). That might be advantageous.

Alternatively, ""mince"": but has C and E -> invalid.

So I think ""point"" is a strong candidate.

Another option: ""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> wait, C is forbidden? Yes, C cannot be used because we know it's not in the word. So ""lynch"" has C -> invalid.

Similarly, avoid any word with C,R,A,E.

Therefore, let me go with ""point"".

We can also consider ""joint"", but J is less frequent.

Another: ""downt""? Not a word.

""hound"": H, O, U, N, D -> positions: H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Also avoids C,R,A,E. This tests H,O,U,D.

But ""hound"" has two vowels O and U.

Which of the two? ""point"" vs. ""hound"":

In ""point"": letters P,O,I,T,N -> we know N is in place, so we test P,O,I,T.
In ""hound"": H,O,U,D,N -> test H,O,U,D.

We want to cover high-frequency letters. P and T are common consonants, O and I are vowels. H, O, U, D: O and U are vowels, H and D are consonants.

Both are good. But note we don't know if D is present or not? Similarly for T.

Since we are in the second guess, either is fine.

I think ""point"" is a standard word and gives a good spread.

Let me choose ""point"".

So the second guess is ""point"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (marked as ""✓"").  

This means the secret word:  
- Must have N as the 4th letter.  
- Cannot contain C, R, A, or E.  

For the new guess:  
- Select a valid 5-letter word with N in the 4th position.  
- Focus on introducing new, common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, P, etc.) to maximize information gain since C, R, A, and E are eliminated.  

After evaluating options like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T), ""mount"" (tests M, O, U, T), and ""hound"" (tests H, O, U, D), I chose ""point"" because:  
- It efficiently tests two new vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T) alongside the known N.  
- Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, E), it helps probe the secret word's structure faster.

We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
This means:
  - N is again in the correct position (4th letter) which we already knew.
  - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position: so the word is ???N?
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We have used 8 letters that are not in the word, and we know N is in the 4th position.

We need to make a third guess. Constraints:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- The 4th letter must be N (to keep testing the known position and to get more information about other positions).
- Must not use the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus 8 used and minus N (which is in the word but we can use it again in the same position). Actually, we can use N again because it's in the word, but we know it's in the 4th position so we can place it there.

But note: we cannot use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels: U is the only vowel left that we haven't tested? We tested A, E, O, I, so U is still possible).

Vowels: We know A, E, O, I are not in the word. So the only vowel left is U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel). So the word must have U or Y as a vowel, or possibly no vowel? But every English word has at least one vowel. So we must have U or Y.

We need to form a word of the pattern ???N? without the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and use only the available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include U or Y to test for a vowel, and also test other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""dunno"": but that is 5 letters? D U N N O -> but O is forbidden. And it has two N's? Also, O is not allowed.

- ""funny"": F U N N Y -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But the 4th letter is N, which is good. However, we have two N's? The secret word might have only one N? We don't know. But we know that N is at position 4, but it might appear elsewhere? The feedback for ""crane"" and ""point"" only showed one N (at position 4) and didn't indicate any other N. But in ""crane"", we had N at position 4 and no other N, and in ""point"", we had N at position 4 and no other N. So it's possible that there is only one N. But we cannot rule out multiple N's.

However, in ""funny"", the 4th letter is N (good) but the 3rd letter is also N. If the secret word has only one N, then the 3rd N in ""funny"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. Also, ""funny"" has O? No, it has F,U,N,N,Y. But O is not in it. But we have to avoid O? O is forbidden, and ""funny"" doesn't have O. But it has U and Y.

But ""funny"" has two N's. Let's see if it's allowed: we are allowed to use N again because we know it's in the word, but we are using it in position 3 and 4. The feedback might tell us if there is a duplicate.

But we are trying to maximize information. We might avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Also, ""funny"" uses F, U, Y (and two N's). We test F, U, Y.

Another word: ""sunny"": S U N N Y -> same issue, two N's.

We want to avoid duplicates to test more unique letters.

So let's look for words with N only in the 4th position and no other N.

Pattern: _ _ _ N _ 

With the first three letters and last letter from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we must have at least one vowel: so U or Y (since A,E,I,O are out).

Possible words:

- ""dung"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""dunce"": but has C and E -> forbidden.

- ""bunch"": B U N C H -> but C is forbidden.

- ""lunch"": L U N C H -> C forbidden.

- ""munch"": M U N C H -> C forbidden.

- ""hunch"": same.

We need to avoid C.

- ""bunds"": B U N D S -> positions: B(1), U(2), N(3)? Wait, we need N at position 4. In ""bunds"": B(1), U(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). So the 4th letter is D, not N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word must be: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:

- ""bunns"": not a word? Or ""bunn"" is not 5 letters.

- ""bunny"": B U N N Y -> again two N's.

- ""gunny"": G U N N Y -> two N's.

- ""munge"": M U N G E -> but E is forbidden.

- ""dungs"": D U N G S -> positions: D(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> 4th letter is G, not N.

I need to think of words that end with ""N"" as the 4th letter, meaning the last two are ""N?"".

So the word has the pattern: [letter][letter][letter]N[letter]

And the last letter can be any consonant or vowel (but from available letters).

Examples:

- ""downs"": D O W N S -> but O is forbidden.

- ""towns"": T O W N S -> T and O forbidden.

- ""frown"": F R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""grown"": G R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""brown"": B R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""drown"": D R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""clown"": C L O W N -> C and O forbidden.

- ""flown"": F L O W N -> O forbidden and L? L is allowed, but O is not.

We need to avoid O.

What about words with U?

- ""dunno"": not 5 letters? ""dunno"" is 5: D U N N O -> but O forbidden.

- ""tuned"": T U N E D -> T and E forbidden.

- ""runed"": R U N E D -> R and E forbidden.

- ""lung"": 4 letters.

- ""lungs"": L U N G S -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> 4th is G, not N.

- ""mung"": 4 letters.

- ""sung"": 4 letters.

- ""dung"": 4 letters.

- ""bung"": 4 letters.

- ""hung"": 4 letters.

- ""rung"": 4 letters.

- ""swung"": S W U N G -> positions: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this is good! 4th letter is N.

And it uses S, W, U, N, G.

Check the letters: S, W, U, G are all allowed (not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T are forbidden, so S,W,U,G are fine).

Also, U is a vowel we haven't tested.

So ""swung"" is a valid word: swung (past tense of swing).

Another possibility: ""stung"": S T U N G -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T(x)).

T is not allowed, so ""stung"" has T -> invalid.

Similarly, ""slung"": S L U N G -> L is allowed? L is not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T. So L is allowed.

""slung"": S L U N G -> positions: S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). Good.

But we have two options: ""swung"" and ""slung"".

Also, ""flung"": F L U N G -> F and L allowed.

""flung"" is also possible.

We can choose any of these.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""swung"": letters S, W, U, G (and N, which we know).

In ""slung"": S, L, U, G.

In ""flung"": F, L, U, G.

W is less common than L or F? But we don't know.

Since we have multiple options, we can pick one that uses letters that are common.

Another word: ""dummy"" -> D U M M Y -> but 4th letter is M, not N.

""gummy"": G U M M Y -> 4th letter M.

Not.

""jumpy"": J U M P Y -> P is forbidden.

""bumpy"": B U M P Y -> P forbidden.

""humpy"": H U M P Y -> P forbidden.

""lumpy"": L U M P Y -> P forbidden.

So back to ""swung"", ""slung"", ""flung"".

Also, ""mungy"": M U N G Y -> but that's 5 letters: M(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> 4th letter is G, not N.

""nunny"": not a word.

""punny"": P U N N Y -> P forbidden and two N's.

So the best options are the ones like ""swung"", ""slung"", ""flung"".

I think ""swung"" is a good choice because it tests W, which is less common, and if it's not in the word, we eliminate W.

Similarly, ""flung"" tests F.

But we can choose any.

Let's go with ""swung"" to test S, W, U, G.

So the third guess: ""swung"".

But note: in ""swung"", the U is at position 3. If U is in the word, it might be at a different position? But we are testing it.

We know the word must have a vowel, and U is the only vowel possibility left (besides Y). So if U is not in the word, then the word must have Y.

But in ""swung"", we are testing U at position 3.

If we get feedback that U is present but not at position 3, then we know it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if U is absent, then the word must have Y.

So ""swung"" is a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""swung"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).  
- **Guess 2 (point)**: P, O, I, and T are absent (x), and N is confirmed again in the 4th position (✓).  

### Key Insights:  
1. **N is fixed in the 4th position**: The secret word must be of the form `_ _ _ N _`.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T cannot appear anywhere in the word.  
3. **Available letters**: The remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel requirement**: Since A, E, I, O are absent, the secret word must contain U or Y (the only untested vowels).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:  
- **Reinforce the 4th position**: Keep N in the 4th slot to maintain the known correct position.  
- **Test new high-value letters**: Prioritize untested vowels (U) and common consonants (e.g., S, G, L, W) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid duplicates**: Since no duplicate N was indicated in prior feedback, use a word with only one N (in the 4th position) to test more unique letters.  

### Selected Guess: ""swung""  
- **Why ""swung""?**  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _` with N in the 4th position.  
  - Uses allowed letters: S, W, U, N, G (none are in the absent list).  
  - Tests U (critical vowel candidate) at position 3 and other common consonants (S, W, G).  
  - If U is absent, the word must contain Y (narrowing future options).  
  - High information potential: Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G) while leveraging the known N.  

<guess>swung</guess>",swung,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
This means:
  - N is again in the correct position (4th letter) which we already knew.
  - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position: so the word is ???N?
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We have used 8 letters that are not in the word, and we know N is in the 4th position.

We need to make a third guess. Constraints:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- The 4th letter must be N (to keep testing the known position and to get more information about other positions).
- Must not use the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus 8 used and minus N (which is in the word but we can use it again in the same position). Actually, we can use N again because it's in the word, but we know it's in the 4th position so we can place it there.

But note: we cannot use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels: U is the only vowel left that we haven't tested? We tested A, E, O, I, so U is still possible).

Vowels: We know A, E, O, I are not in the word. So the only vowel left is U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel). So the word must have U or Y as a vowel, or possibly no vowel? But every English word has at least one vowel. So we must have U or Y.

We need to form a word of the pattern ???N? without the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and use only the available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include U or Y to test for a vowel, and also test other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""dunno"": but that is 5 letters? D U N N O -> but O is forbidden. And it has two N's? Also, O is not allowed.

- ""funny"": F U N N Y -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But the 4th letter is N, which is good. However, we have two N's? The secret word might have only one N? We don't know. But we know that N is at position 4, but it might appear elsewhere? The feedback for ""crane"" and ""point"" only showed one N (at position 4) and didn't indicate any other N. But in ""crane"", we had N at position 4 and no other N, and in ""point"", we had N at position 4 and no other N. So it's possible that there is only one N. But we cannot rule out multiple N's.

However, in ""funny"", the 4th letter is N (good) but the 3rd letter is also N. If the secret word has only one N, then the 3rd N in ""funny"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. Also, ""funny"" has O? No, it has F,U,N,N,Y. But O is not in it. But we have to avoid O? O is forbidden, and ""funny"" doesn't have O. But it has U and Y.

But ""funny"" has two N's. Let's see if it's allowed: we are allowed to use N again because we know it's in the word, but we are using it in position 3 and 4. The feedback might tell us if there is a duplicate.

But we are trying to maximize information. We might avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Also, ""funny"" uses F, U, Y (and two N's). We test F, U, Y.

Another word: ""sunny"": S U N N Y -> same issue, two N's.

We want to avoid duplicates to test more unique letters.

So let's look for words with N only in the 4th position and no other N.

Pattern: _ _ _ N _ 

With the first three letters and last letter from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we must have at least one vowel: so U or Y (since A,E,I,O are out).

Possible words:

- ""dung"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""dunce"": but has C and E -> forbidden.

- ""bunch"": B U N C H -> but C is forbidden.

- ""lunch"": L U N C H -> C forbidden.

- ""munch"": M U N C H -> C forbidden.

- ""hunch"": same.

We need to avoid C.

- ""bunds"": B U N D S -> positions: B(1), U(2), N(3)? Wait, we need N at position 4. In ""bunds"": B(1), U(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). So the 4th letter is D, not N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word must be: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:

- ""bunns"": not a word? Or ""bunn"" is not 5 letters.

- ""bunny"": B U N N Y -> again two N's.

- ""gunny"": G U N N Y -> two N's.

- ""munge"": M U N G E -> but E is forbidden.

- ""dungs"": D U N G S -> positions: D(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> 4th letter is G, not N.

I need to think of words that end with ""N"" as the 4th letter, meaning the last two are ""N?"".

So the word has the pattern: [letter][letter][letter]N[letter]

And the last letter can be any consonant or vowel (but from available letters).

Examples:

- ""downs"": D O W N S -> but O is forbidden.

- ""towns"": T O W N S -> T and O forbidden.

- ""frown"": F R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""grown"": G R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""brown"": B R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""drown"": D R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""clown"": C L O W N -> C and O forbidden.

- ""flown"": F L O W N -> O forbidden and L? L is allowed, but O is not.

We need to avoid O.

What about words with U?

- ""dunno"": not 5 letters? ""dunno"" is 5: D U N N O -> but O forbidden.

- ""tuned"": T U N E D -> T and E forbidden.

- ""runed"": R U N E D -> R and E forbidden.

- ""lung"": 4 letters.

- ""lungs"": L U N G S -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> 4th is G, not N.

- ""mung"": 4 letters.

- ""sung"": 4 letters.

- ""dung"": 4 letters.

- ""bung"": 4 letters.

- ""hung"": 4 letters.

- ""rung"": 4 letters.

- ""swung"": S W U N G -> positions: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this is good! 4th letter is N.

And it uses S, W, U, N, G.

Check the letters: S, W, U, G are all allowed (not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T are forbidden, so S,W,U,G are fine).

Also, U is a vowel we haven't tested.

So ""swung"" is a valid word: swung (past tense of swing).

Another possibility: ""stung"": S T U N G -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T(x)).

T is not allowed, so ""stung"" has T -> invalid.

Similarly, ""slung"": S L U N G -> L is allowed? L is not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T. So L is allowed.

""slung"": S L U N G -> positions: S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). Good.

But we have two options: ""swung"" and ""slung"".

Also, ""flung"": F L U N G -> F and L allowed.

""flung"" is also possible.

We can choose any of these.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""swung"": letters S, W, U, G (and N, which we know).

In ""slung"": S, L, U, G.

In ""flung"": F, L, U, G.

W is less common than L or F? But we don't know.

Since we have multiple options, we can pick one that uses letters that are common.

Another word: ""dummy"" -> D U M M Y -> but 4th letter is M, not N.

""gummy"": G U M M Y -> 4th letter M.

Not.

""jumpy"": J U M P Y -> P is forbidden.

""bumpy"": B U M P Y -> P forbidden.

""humpy"": H U M P Y -> P forbidden.

""lumpy"": L U M P Y -> P forbidden.

So back to ""swung"", ""slung"", ""flung"".

Also, ""mungy"": M U N G Y -> but that's 5 letters: M(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> 4th letter is G, not N.

""nunny"": not a word.

""punny"": P U N N Y -> P forbidden and two N's.

So the best options are the ones like ""swung"", ""slung"", ""flung"".

I think ""swung"" is a good choice because it tests W, which is less common, and if it's not in the word, we eliminate W.

Similarly, ""flung"" tests F.

But we can choose any.

Let's go with ""swung"" to test S, W, U, G.

So the third guess: ""swung"".

But note: in ""swung"", the U is at position 3. If U is in the word, it might be at a different position? But we are testing it.

We know the word must have a vowel, and U is the only vowel possibility left (besides Y). So if U is not in the word, then the word must have Y.

But in ""swung"", we are testing U at position 3.

If we get feedback that U is present but not at position 3, then we know it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if U is absent, then the word must have Y.

So ""swung"" is a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""swung"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).  
- **Guess 2 (point)**: P, O, I, and T are absent (x), and N is confirmed again in the 4th position (✓).  

### Key Insights:  
1. **N is fixed in the 4th position**: The secret word must be of the form `_ _ _ N _`.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T cannot appear anywhere in the word.  
3. **Available letters**: The remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel requirement**: Since A, E, I, O are absent, the secret word must contain U or Y (the only untested vowels).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we have no prior information. 
 We want a word that maximizes the information we gain, meaning we can test as many common letters as possible in different positions.
 Common vowels and consonants are important. Often, starting words include a mix of vowels and common consonants.
 Some popular starting words are: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRIED"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
   C: common consonant
   R: common consonant
   A: common vowel
   N: common consonant
   E: common vowel

 This word tests five distinct letters that are common in 5-letter words.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I thought about choosing a starting word that includes common English vowels and consonants to maximize the feedback information. After considering words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ALERT,"" I chose ""CRANE"" because it contains three vowels (A and E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This provides a balanced mix of letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words, helping reveal patterns quickly in subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
  R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
  A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
  N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (which is the 4th letter, because in ""crane"", N is the 4th letter).
  E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So the secret word has N in the 4th position (so it's of the form ???N?), and it does not contain the letters C, R, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We have used one try and have 5 left.

Constraints for the second guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- The 4th letter must be N (to confirm its position and potentially get more information).
- Must not use the letters C, R, A, E because they are not in the secret word.

We need to choose a word that has N in the 4th position and uses new letters to maximize the information we gain.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many of these common letters as possible, especially vowels (since we only know about A and E being absent, but there are other vowels: I, O, U). Having a vowel might be helpful.

Consider words ending with N: ...N.

Common endings: -IN-, -ON-, -UN-, etc. But note that we need the 4th letter to be N, so the pattern is _ _ _ N _

List some candidate words (with N in 4th position, and avoiding C,R,A,E):
- Words ending with ""ND"": the last letter would be D, so _ _ N D. But then the 4th is N and 5th is D? Let's think of words: ""blend"", but then E is absent -> invalid because E is not allowed. Similarly, ""stand"" has A and S,T but A is not allowed. We cannot use A and E.

Avoid words that have C,R,A,E.

Examples of words with N in the 4th position (index 3 if 0-indexed):
- ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> but we don't know if S or D are allowed? We can use them because they haven't been tested. However, note that ""bonds"" has O as a vowel. Let's check: positions: 0:B, 1:O, 2:N -> wait, no: in ""bonds"", the letters are B O N D S. So the 3rd letter is D? I am considering indices carefully: 
  Position: 0: B, 1: O, 2: N, 3: D, 4: S -> so N is at index 2 (3rd position). But we need N at the 4th letter? Wait, our positions: the first letter is position 1, second is 2, third is 3, fourth is 4, fifth is 5.

In the word ""crane"": C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, E at 5.

So for the next word, we need the fourth position (index 3) to be N.

Therefore, we are looking for words where the 4th letter is N.

Let me list words that have N at the 4th position and do not contain C, R, A, E.

Examples:
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> fourth letter is N? Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this has the 4th letter as N? Wait, no: if we count: 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: N -> yes, N is at position 4.
But then the fifth letter is T. And it has vowels O and I.

This word ""point"": P (new), O (new vowel), I (new vowel), N (we know is in the word and at position 4), T (new).

And it does not include C, R, A, E.

Similarly, other words:
- ""joint"": J (new), O, I, N, T -> similar.
- ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> U is a vowel.
- ""paint"": has A -> not allowed because A is absent from secret word.
- ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> fourth letter N? Positions: S (1), T (2), I (3), N (4), G (5). Correct.
- ""swing"": S, W, I, N, G -> same pattern.
- ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G.

We have many options. We want to test as many new letters as possible, especially vowels.

In ""point"", we test P, O, I, T (besides the known N). Similarly, ""mount"" tests M, O, U, T.

Vowels: we know A and E are absent, so probably the word has one of I, O, U? Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

Possible words: 
- ""point"" -> P, O, I, N, T
- ""joint"" -> J, O, I, N, T (but J is less common, so perhaps not the best)
- ""mount"" -> M, O, U, N, T
- ""sting"" -> S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G (and N)
- ""thing"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> tests T, H, I, G
- ""shind"" -> not a word, so invalid.

Another option: ""prong"" -> P, R, O, N, G -> but R is forbidden? R is absent, so we cannot use R. Feedback said R is not in the word.

So we must avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A, C, E.

Therefore, ""point"" seems good: letters P, O, I, T are new.

Another candidate: ""boink""? Is that word? Not common. Let's stick to common words.

Also, ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> fourth letter N? Positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5) -> yes.

But ""downy"" tests D,O,W,Y.

We don't have a vowel in the third position? We have O which is a vowel at second position.

But in ""point"", we have vowels at positions 2 and 3 (O and I). That might be advantageous.

Alternatively, ""mince"": but has C and E -> invalid.

So I think ""point"" is a strong candidate.

Another option: ""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> wait, C is forbidden? Yes, C cannot be used because we know it's not in the word. So ""lynch"" has C -> invalid.

Similarly, avoid any word with C,R,A,E.

Therefore, let me go with ""point"".

We can also consider ""joint"", but J is less frequent.

Another: ""downt""? Not a word.

""hound"": H, O, U, N, D -> positions: H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Also avoids C,R,A,E. This tests H,O,U,D.

But ""hound"" has two vowels O and U.

Which of the two? ""point"" vs. ""hound"":

In ""point"": letters P,O,I,T,N -> we know N is in place, so we test P,O,I,T.
In ""hound"": H,O,U,D,N -> test H,O,U,D.

We want to cover high-frequency letters. P and T are common consonants, O and I are vowels. H, O, U, D: O and U are vowels, H and D are consonants.

Both are good. But note we don't know if D is present or not? Similarly for T.

Since we are in the second guess, either is fine.

I think ""point"" is a standard word and gives a good spread.

Let me choose ""point"".

So the second guess is ""point"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (marked as ""✓"").  

This means the secret word:  
- Must have N as the 4th letter.  
- Cannot contain C, R, A, or E.  

For the new guess:  
- Select a valid 5-letter word with N in the 4th position.  
- Focus on introducing new, common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, P, etc.) to maximize information gain since C, R, A, and E are eliminated.  

After evaluating options like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T), ""mount"" (tests M, O, U, T), and ""hound"" (tests H, O, U, D), I chose ""point"" because:  
- It efficiently tests two new vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T) alongside the known N.  
- Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, E), it helps probe the secret word's structure faster.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
This means:
  - N is again in the correct position (4th letter) which we already knew.
  - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position: so the word is ???N?
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We have used 8 letters that are not in the word, and we know N is in the 4th position.

We need to make a third guess. Constraints:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- The 4th letter must be N (to keep testing the known position and to get more information about other positions).
- Must not use the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus 8 used and minus N (which is in the word but we can use it again in the same position). Actually, we can use N again because it's in the word, but we know it's in the 4th position so we can place it there.

But note: we cannot use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels: U is the only vowel left that we haven't tested? We tested A, E, O, I, so U is still possible).

Vowels: We know A, E, O, I are not in the word. So the only vowel left is U (and sometimes Y, which can be a vowel). So the word must have U or Y as a vowel, or possibly no vowel? But every English word has at least one vowel. So we must have U or Y.

We need to form a word of the pattern ???N? without the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and use only the available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include U or Y to test for a vowel, and also test other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""dunno"": but that is 5 letters? D U N N O -> but O is forbidden. And it has two N's? Also, O is not allowed.

- ""funny"": F U N N Y -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). But the 4th letter is N, which is good. However, we have two N's? The secret word might have only one N? We don't know. But we know that N is at position 4, but it might appear elsewhere? The feedback for ""crane"" and ""point"" only showed one N (at position 4) and didn't indicate any other N. But in ""crane"", we had N at position 4 and no other N, and in ""point"", we had N at position 4 and no other N. So it's possible that there is only one N. But we cannot rule out multiple N's.

However, in ""funny"", the 4th letter is N (good) but the 3rd letter is also N. If the secret word has only one N, then the 3rd N in ""funny"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. Also, ""funny"" has O? No, it has F,U,N,N,Y. But O is not in it. But we have to avoid O? O is forbidden, and ""funny"" doesn't have O. But it has U and Y.

But ""funny"" has two N's. Let's see if it's allowed: we are allowed to use N again because we know it's in the word, but we are using it in position 3 and 4. The feedback might tell us if there is a duplicate.

But we are trying to maximize information. We might avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Also, ""funny"" uses F, U, Y (and two N's). We test F, U, Y.

Another word: ""sunny"": S U N N Y -> same issue, two N's.

We want to avoid duplicates to test more unique letters.

So let's look for words with N only in the 4th position and no other N.

Pattern: _ _ _ N _ 

With the first three letters and last letter from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we must have at least one vowel: so U or Y (since A,E,I,O are out).

Possible words:

- ""dung"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

- ""dunce"": but has C and E -> forbidden.

- ""bunch"": B U N C H -> but C is forbidden.

- ""lunch"": L U N C H -> C forbidden.

- ""munch"": M U N C H -> C forbidden.

- ""hunch"": same.

We need to avoid C.

- ""bunds"": B U N D S -> positions: B(1), U(2), N(3)? Wait, we need N at position 4. In ""bunds"": B(1), U(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). So the 4th letter is D, not N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word must be: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:

- ""bunns"": not a word? Or ""bunn"" is not 5 letters.

- ""bunny"": B U N N Y -> again two N's.

- ""gunny"": G U N N Y -> two N's.

- ""munge"": M U N G E -> but E is forbidden.

- ""dungs"": D U N G S -> positions: D(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> 4th letter is G, not N.

I need to think of words that end with ""N"" as the 4th letter, meaning the last two are ""N?"".

So the word has the pattern: [letter][letter][letter]N[letter]

And the last letter can be any consonant or vowel (but from available letters).

Examples:

- ""downs"": D O W N S -> but O is forbidden.

- ""towns"": T O W N S -> T and O forbidden.

- ""frown"": F R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""grown"": G R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""brown"": B R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""drown"": D R O W N -> R and O forbidden.

- ""clown"": C L O W N -> C and O forbidden.

- ""flown"": F L O W N -> O forbidden and L? L is allowed, but O is not.

We need to avoid O.

What about words with U?

- ""dunno"": not 5 letters? ""dunno"" is 5: D U N N O -> but O forbidden.

- ""tuned"": T U N E D -> T and E forbidden.

- ""runed"": R U N E D -> R and E forbidden.

- ""lung"": 4 letters.

- ""lungs"": L U N G S -> positions: L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> 4th is G, not N.

- ""mung"": 4 letters.

- ""sung"": 4 letters.

- ""dung"": 4 letters.

- ""bung"": 4 letters.

- ""hung"": 4 letters.

- ""rung"": 4 letters.

- ""swung"": S W U N G -> positions: S(1), W(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> this is good! 4th letter is N.

And it uses S, W, U, N, G.

Check the letters: S, W, U, G are all allowed (not in the forbidden list: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T are forbidden, so S,W,U,G are fine).

Also, U is a vowel we haven't tested.

So ""swung"" is a valid word: swung (past tense of swing).

Another possibility: ""stung"": S T U N G -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T(x)).

T is not allowed, so ""stung"" has T -> invalid.

Similarly, ""slung"": S L U N G -> L is allowed? L is not forbidden. Forbidden are C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T. So L is allowed.

""slung"": S L U N G -> positions: S(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). Good.

But we have two options: ""swung"" and ""slung"".

Also, ""flung"": F L U N G -> F and L allowed.

""flung"" is also possible.

We can choose any of these.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""swung"": letters S, W, U, G (and N, which we know).

In ""slung"": S, L, U, G.

In ""flung"": F, L, U, G.

W is less common than L or F? But we don't know.

Since we have multiple options, we can pick one that uses letters that are common.

Another word: ""dummy"" -> D U M M Y -> but 4th letter is M, not N.

""gummy"": G U M M Y -> 4th letter M.

Not.

""jumpy"": J U M P Y -> P is forbidden.

""bumpy"": B U M P Y -> P forbidden.

""humpy"": H U M P Y -> P forbidden.

""lumpy"": L U M P Y -> P forbidden.

So back to ""swung"", ""slung"", ""flung"".

Also, ""mungy"": M U N G Y -> but that's 5 letters: M(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> 4th letter is G, not N.

""nunny"": not a word.

""punny"": P U N N Y -> P forbidden and two N's.

So the best options are the ones like ""swung"", ""slung"", ""flung"".

I think ""swung"" is a good choice because it tests W, which is less common, and if it's not in the word, we eliminate W.

Similarly, ""flung"" tests F.

But we can choose any.

Let's go with ""swung"" to test S, W, U, G.

So the third guess: ""swung"".

But note: in ""swung"", the U is at position 3. If U is in the word, it might be at a different position? But we are testing it.

We know the word must have a vowel, and U is the only vowel possibility left (besides Y). So if U is not in the word, then the word must have Y.

But in ""swung"", we are testing U at position 3.

If we get feedback that U is present but not at position 3, then we know it's elsewhere.

Similarly, if U is absent, then the word must have Y.

So ""swung"" is a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""swung"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).  
- **Guess 2 (point)**: P, O, I, and T are absent (x), and N is confirmed again in the 4th position (✓).  

### Key Insights:  
1. **N is fixed in the 4th position**: The secret word must be of the form `_ _ _ N _`.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T cannot appear anywhere in the word.  
3. **Available letters**: The remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel requirement**: Since A, E, I, O are absent, the secret word must contain U or Y (the only untested vowels).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:  
- **Reinforce the 4th position**: Keep N in the 4th slot to maintain the known correct position.  
- **Test new high-value letters**: Prioritize untested vowels (U) and common consonants (e.g., S, G, L, W) to maximize information.  
- **Avoid duplicates**: Since no duplicate N was indicated in prior feedback, use a word with only one N (in the 4th position) to test more unique letters.  

### Selected Guess: ""swung""  
- **Why ""swung""?**  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _` with N in the 4th position.  
  - Uses allowed letters: S, W, U, N, G (none are in the absent list).  
  - Tests U (critical vowel candidate) at position 3 and other common consonants (S, W, G).  
  - If U is absent, the word must contain Y (narrowing future options).  
  - High information potential: Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G) while leveraging the known N.

So the 3rd letter is D? I am considering indices carefully: \n  Position: 0: B, 1: O, 2: N, 3: D, 4: S -> so N is at index 2 (3rd position). But we need N at the 4th letter? Wait, our positions: the first letter is position 1, second is 2, third is 3, fourth is 4, fifth is 5.\n\nIn the word ""crane"": C at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, E at 5.\n\nSo for the next word, we need the fourth position (index 3) to be N.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for words where the 4th letter is N.\n\nLet me list words that have N at the 4th position and do not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> fourth letter is N?

Positions: S (1), T (2), I (3), N (4), G (5). Correct.\n- ""swing"": S, W, I, N, G -> same pattern.\n- ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G.\n\nWe have many options. We want to test as many new letters as possible, especially vowels.\n\nIn ""point"", we test P, O, I, T (besides the known N). Similarly, ""mount"" tests M, O, U, T.\n\nVowels: we know A and E are absent, so probably the word has one of I, O, U? Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""point"" -> P, O, I, N, T\n- ""joint"" -> J, O, I, N, T (but J is less common, so perhaps not the best)\n- ""mount"" -> M, O, U, N, T\n- ""sting"" -> S, T, I, N, G -> tests S, T, I, G (and N)\n- ""thing"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> tests T, H, I, G\n- ""shind"" -> not a word, so invalid.\n\nAnother option: ""prong"" -> P, R, O, N, G -> but R is forbidden? R is absent, so we cannot use R. Feedback said R is not in the word.\n\nSo we must avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A, C, E.\n\nTherefore, ""point"" seems good: letters P, O, I, T are new.\n\nAnother candidate: ""boink""? Is that word? Not common. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAlso, ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> fourth letter N? Positions: D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5) -> yes.\n\nBut ""downy"" tests D,O,W,Y.\n\nWe don\'t have a vowel in the third position?

Yes, C cannot be used because we know it\'s not in the word. So ""lynch"" has C -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, avoid any word with C,R,A,E.\n\nTherefore, let me go with ""point"".\n\nWe can also consider ""joint"", but J is less frequent.\n\nAnother: ""downt""? Not a word.\n\n""hound"": H, O, U, N, D -> positions: H(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5). Also avoids C,R,A,E. This tests H,O,U,D.\n\nBut ""hound"" has two vowels O and U.\n\nWhich of the two? ""point"" vs. ""hound"":\n\nIn ""point"": letters P,O,I,T,N -> we know N is in place, so we test P,O,I,T.\nIn ""hound"": H,O,U,D,N -> test H,O,U,D.\n\nWe want to cover high-frequency letters. P and T are common consonants, O and I are vowels. H, O, U, D: O and U are vowels, H and D are consonants.\n\nBoth are good. But note we don\'t know if D is present or not? Similarly for T.\n\nSince we are in the second guess, either is fine.\n\nI think ""point"" is a standard word and gives a good spread.\n\nLet me choose ""point"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""point"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":  \n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").  \n- N is correct and in the 4th position (marked as ""✓"").  \n\nThis means the secret word:  \n- Must have N as the 4th letter.  \n- Cannot contain C, R, A, or E.  \n\nFor the new guess:  \n- Select a valid 5-letter word with N in the 4th position.  \n- Focus on introducing new, common consonants and vowels (like I, O, U, T, P, etc.) to maximize information gain since C, R, A, and E are eliminated.  \n\nAfter evaluating options like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T), ""mount"" (tests M, O, U, T), and ""hound"" (tests H, O, U, D), I chose ""point"" because:  \n- It efficiently tests two new vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (P and T) alongside the known N.  \n- Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, E), it helps probe the secret word\'s structure faster.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)\nThis means:\n  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).\n  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)\nThis means:\n  - N is again in the correct position (4th letter) which we already knew.\n  - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, combining the feedback:\n- The secret word has N in the 4th position: so the word is ???N?\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.\n\nWe have used 8 letters that are not in the word, and we know N is in the 4th position.\n\nWe need to make a third guess.

If U is in the word, it might be at a different position? But we are testing it.\n\nWe know the word must have a vowel, and U is the only vowel possibility left (besides Y). So if U is not in the word, then the word must have Y.\n\nBut in ""swung"", we are testing U at position 3.\n\nIf we get feedback that U is present but not at position 3, then we know it\'s elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, if U is absent, then the word must have Y.\n\nSo ""swung"" is a good test.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""swung"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  \n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).  \n- **Guess 2 (point)**: P, O, I, and T are absent (x), and N is confirmed again in the 4th position (✓).  \n\n### Key Insights:  \n1. **N is fixed in the 4th position**: The secret word must be of the form `_ _ _ N _`.  \n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T cannot appear anywhere in the word.  \n3. **Available letters**: The remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n4. **Vowel requirement**: Since A, E, I, O are absent, the secret word must contain U or Y (the only untested vowels).  \n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:  \n- **Reinforce the 4th position**: Keep N in the 4th slot to maintain the known correct position.  \n- **Test new high-value letters**: Prioritize untested vowels (U) and common consonants (e.g., S, G, L, W) to maximize information.  \n- **Avoid duplicates**: Since no duplicate N was indicated in prior feedback, use a word with only one N (in the 4th position) to test more unique letters.  \n\n### Selected Guess: ""swung""  \n- **Why ""swung""?**  \n  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _` with N in the 4th position.  \n  - Uses allowed letters: S, W, U, N, G (none are in the absent list).  \n  - Tests U (critical vowel candidate) at position 3 and other common consonants (S, W, G).  \n  - If U is absent, the word must contain Y (narrowing future options).  \n  - High information potential: Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G) while leveraging the known N.\n\n<guess>swung</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: swung -> FEEDBACK: S(x) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
Guess 3: ""swung"" -> S(x), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(✓)

Summary of what we know:

1. N is in the word and at the 4th position (known from all three guesses).
2. G is in the word and at the 5th position? From ""swung"": G is at position 5 and got ✓, so G is in the word and at the correct position.
   - Feedback for ""swung"": U(✓) at position 3, N(✓) at position 4, G(✓) at position 5.
   So we have:
     Position 3: U(✓) -> U is in the word and at position 3.
     Position 4: N(✓)
     Position 5: G(✓) -> G is at position 5.

Also, S and W are not in the word (x).

Additionally, from previous feedback, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, S, W.

2. The secret word must be: _ _ U N G  (because positions 3,4,5 are fixed: U, N, G).

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] U N G

3. We know letter1 and letter2 must be from the available letters, excluding the forbidden ones.

Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, S, W. Also, we haven't used and should avoid reusing known absent letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, V, X, Y, Z (and we know U, N, G are in the word, but they are already placed).

For positions 1 and 2, we need to choose two letters from the available list.

Also note: we don't have any duplicates because we haven't seen any indication of duplicates in the feedback? But we don't know for sure. Still, we assume no duplicates for now.

However, in the word, we have U, N, G at positions 3,4,5. Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with two new letters, which must be consonants from the available set because the only vowel we have is U (already placed) and Y might be used as a vowel.

So we are looking for words of the form: L1 L2 U N G, where L1 and L2 are consonants from B, D, F, H, K, L, M, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's think of possible English words:

- ""dung"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5: ? ? U N G.

Common words ending in ""UNG"": 

- ""blung"": not a word.
- ""clung"": but C is forbidden.
- ""flung"": F L U N G -> this is F(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). But we just got feedback from ""swung"" which has U at 3 and G at 5? Yes. And ""flung"" uses F and L.

But in the feedback for ""swung"", we tested U and G and got correct, but we also tested S and W and they were absent. We didn't say anything about F and L.

So ""flung"" is a candidate: it would test F at position 1 and L at position 2.

Similarly, other words:

- ""slung"": S is forbidden? In guess3, S(x) so S is not in the word. So ""slung"" has S -> invalid.

- ""stung"": T is forbidden.

- ""swung"": we already tried, but it had W which we now know is absent.

- ""dung"": not 5 letters.

- ""hung"": not 5 letters.

- ""lung"": not 5 letters.

- ""bunge"": not sure.

Another possibility: ""mung"" is 4 letters.

But what about: ""young"": Y O U N G -> but O is forbidden.

""young"" has O -> invalid.

""fung"": not a word? Or ""fungi"" is 5 letters? But ""fungi"" ends with I? We need U N G at positions 3,4,5: but ""fungi"" is F U N G I -> positions: F(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), I(5). But we need U at position 3? In our case, the pattern is _ _ U N G, meaning U at position 3.

So let's look for words matching [consonant][consonant] U N G.

Examples:

- ""blung"" -> not common.
- ""clung"" -> C forbidden.
- ""flung"" -> F L U N G -> valid? Yes, ""flung"" is a word (past tense of fling).
- ""glung"" -> probably not a word.
- ""klung"" -> not a word.
- ""mlung"" -> not.
- ""plung"": but P is forbidden.
- ""tung"" -> T forbidden.

So ""flung"" is a strong candidate.

But note: we don't know if F or L are in the word. But by guessing ""flung"", we test F at position 1 and L at position 2.

We know that the secret word has U,N,G at positions 3,4,5.

If we guess ""flung"" and get feedback:

- F: if present and correct, then position 1 is F.
- L: if present and correct, then position 2 is L.
- U, N, G: already known to be correct.

But if we get F or L wrong (absent or wrong position), we know they are not correct.

We only have 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

But we might be able to guess correctly now if we are confident.

Another word: ""rung"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

How about ""wrung""? W R U N G -> but W and R are forbidden.

R is from guess1, forbidden.

So not.

""brung"": not standard, ""brought"" is different.

Viable words: basically, the common one is ""flung"".

""chung"": C and H -> C forbidden.

So ""flung"" seems to be the main candidate.

But also, ""dung"": not 5 letters.

What about ""gunk"": G U N K -> positions: G(1), U(2), N(3), K(4). But we need U at 3? No, pattern is ? ? U N G, so U at position 3, G at 5.

Not matching.

Another word: ""fudge"": F U D G E -> but E is forbidden, and positions don't match (we need G at 5? Here G is at 4).

No.

So I think the only common English word that fits the pattern without forbidden letters is ""flung"": F L U N G.

We have not tested F and L before. So we must test them.

We could guess ""flung"" now.

But let's confirm: the secret word is ? ? U N G. We hope it is ""flung"", but it might not be? Are there any other words?

There is ""blung"", but it's not common? Or ""klung"", no.

Also, ""hmung"" ? No.

But what about ""mungy"", but earlier I saw it doesn't fit the pattern.

""vyung""? Not a word.

Therefore, ""flung"" is the most plausible.

Also, ""slung"" would have S at position 1, but S is forbidden? From ""swung"": S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""slung"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""stung"" has T, forbidden.

""swung"" we tried.

So I think ""flung"" is the only option.

Alternatively, perhaps ""bunge"" not a word? ""bungalow"" is longer.

Therefore, we guess ""flung"".

But note: we also have Y as a possible vowel, but in this pattern, U is already fixed at position 3, so the word has U as the vowel. So perhaps no need for Y in the word.

But we need to confirm with the guess.

So the guess is ""flung"".

But let's see: if the word is ""flung"", then positions 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G -> would be all correct.

If not, we will know about F and L.

But since we don't have alternatives, we proceed.

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (point)**: N is confirmed again at position 4. P, O, I, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (swung)**: U(✓) at position 3, N(✓) at position 4, G(✓) at position 5. S and W are absent.

### Inferences:
1. **Fixed positions**: The secret word is `_ _ U N G` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as U, N, G).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, S, W cannot appear anywhere.
3. **Unknown positions**: Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with untested, non-forbidden letters from the alphabet (available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, V, X, Y, Z).
4. **Vowel constraint**: With A, E, I, O absent, U is confirmed as the vowel. Y remains a possibility for words, but here U is already fixed at position 3.
5. **Possible words**: Words fitting `_ _ U N G` are limited due to absent letters. Common options like ""blung"" (invalid), ""clung"" (C forbidden), or ""slung"" (S forbidden) are eliminated. The only valid English word remaining is **""flung""** (past tense of ""fling""), which tests Letters F and L for positions 1 and 2.

### Guess Strategy:
- **Test F and L**: These are high-frequency consonants from the available set. ""Flung"" addresses both:
  - If F or L is correct, it narrows to final letters.
  - If absent, positions 1-2 must be other consonants like B, D, H, M, etc.
- **Efficiency**: Guessing ""flung"" maximizes information with two new letters (F, L) while locking confirmed U, N, G. With 3 tries left, this quickly converges toward a solution.
