We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
  R: x (R is not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
  N: x (N is not in the word)
  E: x (E is not in the word)

So, we know:
  First letter: C
  Third letter: A
  R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word is of the form: C _ A _ _

And we know that R, N, E are absent.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should avoid using the letters R, N, E.

Also, we want to try to find other common letters and positions.

Possible starting letters: Since first letter is C, and third is A, we can focus on the second, fourth, and fifth positions.

We know the word doesn't have R, N, E so we can exclude them.

We can list some candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we want common ones.

The word pattern: C ? A ? ?

We should try a word that has:
  - A C in the first position (but we know it's fixed, so we can use it to test other positions)
  - An A in the third position (fixed)
  - And we want to test other possible letters in the second, fourth, and fifth positions.

Also, since we have two positions to uncover (second, fourth, fifth), we can choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels for those.

But note: the word must contain the letters that are present besides C and A. We don't know what else is there because only C and A were correct in position and the others were absent.

Wait, the feedback showed R, N, E as absent. So we avoid those.

Possible word: we can try ""CHALK"" but wait, H and L and K might be options. However, we don't know if they are present.

Alternatively, let's choose a word that has different letters to test multiple possibilities.

Considering the pattern: C _ A _ _

We can try ""CHAOS"", which has S, but note: S might be common.

But ""CHAOS"": C H A O S.

But we have to avoid R, N, E. So CHAOS doesn't contain those, so it's okay.

However, maybe we can get more coverage.

Another common word: ""CAPES"" but E is forbidden? E is absent, so we cannot use E. Similarly, CAPES contains E which is not allowed.

So CAPES is invalid.

We can use ""CLASS"" but S repeats and we don't test multiple letters? CLASS has C and A in the wrong positions? Wait, no:

We know the first letter is C and third is A, so in CLASS:
  C is first? That matches. A is third? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S. So:
  Position: 1: C (good), 2: L, 3: A (good), but then 4: S, 5: S.
However, we are avoiding E, N, R, which are absent? So S is okay.

But we have repeated letters? It might not be ideal because we get less information. But if there are two S's, it would show.

Alternatively, let me pick a word without repeated letters and common letters.

Possible: ""CHAOS"" - C H A O S -> no duplicate, and uses O, S, H.

But we don't know if H, O, S are in the word.

So I think ""CHAOS"" is a good candidate because it tests H in second, O in fourth, S in fifth.

Also, note that we can use vowels: only A is fixed. We know E is out, so O might be a good candidate to test.

Similarly, we can try ""CLAMP"" but L, M, P? Also, avoids E,N,R.

Another option: ""CACTI"" but has two C's? And C is already known? But that might happen. But it's better to have distinct letters for testing.

But ""CACTI"": C A C T I? Positions: 1: C (good), but third is supposed to be A, which in ""CACTI"", the third letter is C, not A? Correction: C-A-C-T-I? So:
  1: C (correct), 2: A, 3:C (which should be A? Wait, no: the word is C-A-C-T-I. So:
  Position 1: C -> matches
  Position 2: A -> but in our pattern the second position is unknown, and third should be A. This word has A in second and C in third? So it doesn't match the required pattern? Because third must be A.

So we cannot use ""CACTI"" because the third letter must be A? But in ""CACTI"", the third letter is C, not A. So we need a word with third letter A.

Therefore, the guess must be a valid word that has:
  First letter: C
  Third letter: A
  And the other letters must not be R, N, E.

We have two blanks: second, fourth, fifth.

So the word must be C x A y z, where x,y,z are letters except R,N,E.

Possible words include: 
  CHAIR, CHASE, CHASM, CHAMP, CHILD, CHILL, CHINA? But CHINA has N? N is forbidden. So avoid CHINA.
Similarly, words without R,N,E.

Let me list some:
  CHAMP (M and P), but CHAMP is C H A M P -> H,M,P
  CHASM (H,S,M): C H A S M
  CHILD (H,I,L,D): C H I L D
  CLASP (L,S,P): C L A S P
  CLASH (L,S,H): C L A S H
  CLAIM (L,I,M): C L A I M -> but we cannot use M? Not forbidden? M is allowed because not R,N,E.
But we can use any letter except R,N,E.

Now, we want maximum information: so choose letters that are high frequency and distinct.

Consider ""CHAOS"": letters H, O, S - three distinct letters.

""CLOAK"": letters L, O, K? But O and K. C L O A K -> wait, third letter O? No, it must be A. So: C L O A K? Then positions: 
  first: C, second: L, third: O? but we need third to be A. So O is in third? That's wrong because third must be A.

We must have third letter as A. So the word must have A at position 3.

Therefore, ""CLOAK"" is C-L-O-A-K? That would be position: 
  1:C, 2:L, 3:O -> but we need the third to be A? So wait, ""CLOAK"" has A at position 4? Because C-L-O-A-K? Positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:A, 5:K. 
But in our pattern, we need position 3 to be A? But in ""CLOAK"", A is at position 4? So that doesn't fix the third letter as A? So if we guess that, the third letter is O? Then we might get feedback for O? But we know position 3 must be A? No, wait: we are the one forming the guess. Our guess must be a valid word. But we know that only position 1 and 3 are known? For our guess, we can put A in position 3 and then test other positions.

But in the word ""CLOAK"", if we write it as C-L-O-A-K, that doesn't put A in position 3. We must have a word with A in the third position.

So words like CHAMP, CHASM, etc., have A in third position.

Moreover, we want to test letters that might be in the word.

Another idea: we have eliminated R, N, E. So remaining vowels? A is already used, E is out. So vowels to test: I, O, U? But U is less common.

So we might test O and I? Also consonants.

But let's avoid using letters that are less common.

I think ""CHAOS"" is good: C H A O S -> letters: H, O, S.

So we can try ""CHAOS"":

  If H is correct? We get ✓ for H? Or maybe wrong position? Similarly for O and S.

Let me check: the current pattern is C _ A _ _. So if we guess ""CHAOS"":
  Position 1: C -> we know it's correct, so we expect ✓.
  Position 2: H -> we don't know, so feedback will tell if it's present and whether in position.
  Position 3: A -> we know it's correct, ✓.
  Position 4: O -> ?
  Position 5: S?

We might get information about H, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CLASS"" but has double S? But we don't know if S is in the word? It might be inefficient.

""PLACE"" but E is absent? Not allowed.

""TRACE"" but T and E? E is absent? Forbidden.

So let's stick to ""CHAOS"".

But we have to avoid R, N, E? Yes, CHAOS does not contain R, N, E.

So I'll guess ""CHAOS"".

However, wait: we already know the first letter C is correct? And third A is correct? And R, N, E are absent? So CHAOS is okay.

But note: in CHAOS, the fourth letter O and fifth S? We are testing these.

Alternatively, we might use ""CLASH"" which has L, S, H? That might test L? But CHAOS is also fine.

I'll choose ""CHAOS"" for now.

But let's think: we might also test L? Because L is a common consonant.

So ""CLASP"" is C L A S P -> tests L, S, P.

But we don't know if S is there? Similarly.

But both are fine.

I think ""CLASP"" might be slightly better? Because L is more common than O? Or we can choose ""CHASM""? Let's see.

The word ""CHAOS"": O is vowel, S and H common? But H is often in the second position? Maybe.

But since we have limited information, we pick one.

I'll go with ""CHAOS"".

So guess: CHAOS.

But note: CHAOS is a valid English word? Yes.

So step-by-step:
  Based on feedback: 
    C is first letter: ✓
    R: absent
    A: third letter: ✓
    N: absent
    E: absent

  So word is C _ A _ _ and without R,N,E.

  We guess CHAOS to test H, O, S.

Therefore, our next guess: CHAOS.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(✓)R(x)A(✓)N(x)E(x)), I deduced:
- The first letter is **C**.
- The third letter is **A**.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are **absent** from the secret word.
- The word pattern is **C _ A _ _**, excluding R, N, and E.

For the second guess, I selected a word that:
- Starts with C and has A in the third position.
- Uses common letters to test possible positions (second, fourth, fifth).
- Avoids letters confirmed as absent (R, N, E).
- Maximizes information gain with distinct, high-frequency letters like H, O, and S.

I chose **""chaos""** because it fits these criteria:
- C is in position 1 → expected ✓.
- H is tested in position 2.
- A is in position 3 → expected ✓.
- O is tested in position 4.
- S is tested in position 5.
- All letters are valid and distinct (no duplicates).

This guess will provide feedback on H, O, and S, helping to narrow down the possibilities for the second, fourth, and fifth positions.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CHASM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
  R: x (R is not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
  N: x (N is not in the word)
  E: x (E is not in the word)

So, we know:
  First letter: C
  Third letter: A
  R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word is of the form: C _ A _ _

And we know that R, N, E are absent.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should avoid using the letters R, N, E.

Also, we want to try to find other common letters and positions.

Possible starting letters: Since first letter is C, and third is A, we can focus on the second, fourth, and fifth positions.

We know the word doesn't have R, N, E so we can exclude them.

We can list some candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we want common ones.

The word pattern: C ? A ? ?

We should try a word that has:
  - A C in the first position (but we know it's fixed, so we can use it to test other positions)
  - An A in the third position (fixed)
  - And we want to test other possible letters in the second, fourth, and fifth positions.

Also, since we have two positions to uncover (second, fourth, fifth), we can choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels for those.

But note: the word must contain the letters that are present besides C and A. We don't know what else is there because only C and A were correct in position and the others were absent.

Wait, the feedback showed R, N, E as absent. So we avoid those.

Possible word: we can try ""CHALK"" but wait, H and L and K might be options. However, we don't know if they are present.

Alternatively, let's choose a word that has different letters to test multiple possibilities.

Considering the pattern: C _ A _ _

We can try ""CHAOS"", which has S, but note: S might be common.

But ""CHAOS"": C H A O S.

But we have to avoid R, N, E. So CHAOS doesn't contain those, so it's okay.

However, maybe we can get more coverage.

Another common word: ""CAPES"" but E is forbidden? E is absent, so we cannot use E. Similarly, CAPES contains E which is not allowed.

So CAPES is invalid.

We can use ""CLASS"" but S repeats and we don't test multiple letters? CLASS has C and A in the wrong positions? Wait, no:

We know the first letter is C and third is A, so in CLASS:
  C is first? That matches. A is third? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S. So:
  Position: 1: C (good), 2: L, 3: A (good), but then 4: S, 5: S.
However, we are avoiding E, N, R, which are absent? So S is okay.

But we have repeated letters? It might not be ideal because we get less information. But if there are two S's, it would show.

Alternatively, let me pick a word without repeated letters and common letters.

Possible: ""CHAOS"" - C H A O S -> no duplicate, and uses O, S, H.

But we don't know if H, O, S are in the word.

So I think ""CHAOS"" is a good candidate because it tests H in second, O in fourth, S in fifth.

Also, note that we can use vowels: only A is fixed. We know E is out, so O might be a good candidate to test.

Similarly, we can try ""CLAMP"" but L, M, P? Also, avoids E,N,R.

Another option: ""CACTI"" but has two C's? And C is already known? But that might happen. But it's better to have distinct letters for testing.

But ""CACTI"": C A C T I? Positions: 1: C (good), but third is supposed to be A, which in ""CACTI"", the third letter is C, not A? Correction: C-A-C-T-I? So:
  1: C (correct), 2: A, 3:C (which should be A? Wait, no: the word is C-A-C-T-I. So:
  Position 1: C -> matches
  Position 2: A -> but in our pattern the second position is unknown, and third should be A. This word has A in second and C in third? So it doesn't match the required pattern? Because third must be A.

So we cannot use ""CACTI"" because the third letter must be A? But in ""CACTI"", the third letter is C, not A. So we need a word with third letter A.

Therefore, the guess must be a valid word that has:
  First letter: C
  Third letter: A
  And the other letters must not be R, N, E.

We have two blanks: second, fourth, fifth.

So the word must be C x A y z, where x,y,z are letters except R,N,E.

Possible words include: 
  CHAIR, CHASE, CHASM, CHAMP, CHILD, CHILL, CHINA? But CHINA has N? N is forbidden. So avoid CHINA.
Similarly, words without R,N,E.

Let me list some:
  CHAMP (M and P), but CHAMP is C H A M P -> H,M,P
  CHASM (H,S,M): C H A S M
  CHILD (H,I,L,D): C H I L D
  CLASP (L,S,P): C L A S P
  CLASH (L,S,H): C L A S H
  CLAIM (L,I,M): C L A I M -> but we cannot use M? Not forbidden? M is allowed because not R,N,E.
But we can use any letter except R,N,E.

Now, we want maximum information: so choose letters that are high frequency and distinct.

Consider ""CHAOS"": letters H, O, S - three distinct letters.

""CLOAK"": letters L, O, K? But O and K. C L O A K -> wait, third letter O? No, it must be A. So: C L O A K? Then positions: 
  first: C, second: L, third: O? but we need third to be A. So O is in third? That's wrong because third must be A.

We must have third letter as A. So the word must have A at position 3.

Therefore, ""CLOAK"" is C-L-O-A-K? That would be position: 
  1:C, 2:L, 3:O -> but we need the third to be A? So wait, ""CLOAK"" has A at position 4? Because C-L-O-A-K? Positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:A, 5:K. 
But in our pattern, we need position 3 to be A? But in ""CLOAK"", A is at position 4? So that doesn't fix the third letter as A? So if we guess that, the third letter is O? Then we might get feedback for O? But we know position 3 must be A? No, wait: we are the one forming the guess. Our guess must be a valid word. But we know that only position 1 and 3 are known? For our guess, we can put A in position 3 and then test other positions.

But in the word ""CLOAK"", if we write it as C-L-O-A-K, that doesn't put A in position 3. We must have a word with A in the third position.

So words like CHAMP, CHASM, etc., have A in third position.

Moreover, we want to test letters that might be in the word.

Another idea: we have eliminated R, N, E. So remaining vowels? A is already used, E is out. So vowels to test: I, O, U? But U is less common.

So we might test O and I? Also consonants.

But let's avoid using letters that are less common.

I think ""CHAOS"" is good: C H A O S -> letters: H, O, S.

So we can try ""CHAOS"":

  If H is correct? We get ✓ for H? Or maybe wrong position? Similarly for O and S.

Let me check: the current pattern is C _ A _ _. So if we guess ""CHAOS"":
  Position 1: C -> we know it's correct, so we expect ✓.
  Position 2: H -> we don't know, so feedback will tell if it's present and whether in position.
  Position 3: A -> we know it's correct, ✓.
  Position 4: O -> ?
  Position 5: S?

We might get information about H, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CLASS"" but has double S? But we don't know if S is in the word? It might be inefficient.

""PLACE"" but E is absent? Not allowed.

""TRACE"" but T and E? E is absent? Forbidden.

So let's stick to ""CHAOS"".

But we have to avoid R, N, E? Yes, CHAOS does not contain R, N, E.

So I'll guess ""CHAOS"".

However, wait: we already know the first letter C is correct? And third A is correct? And R, N, E are absent? So CHAOS is okay.

But note: in CHAOS, the fourth letter O and fifth S? We are testing these.

Alternatively, we might use ""CLASH"" which has L, S, H? That might test L? But CHAOS is also fine.

I'll choose ""CHAOS"" for now.

But let's think: we might also test L? Because L is a common consonant.

So ""CLASP"" is C L A S P -> tests L, S, P.

But we don't know if S is there? Similarly.

But both are fine.

I think ""CLASP"" might be slightly better? Because L is more common than O? Or we can choose ""CHASM""? Let's see.

The word ""CHAOS"": O is vowel, S and H common? But H is often in the second position? Maybe.

But since we have limited information, we pick one.

I'll go with ""CHAOS"".

So guess: CHAOS.

But note: CHAOS is a valid English word? Yes.

So step-by-step:
  Based on feedback: 
    C is first letter: ✓
    R: absent
    A: third letter: ✓
    N: absent
    E: absent

  So word is C _ A _ _ and without R,N,E.

  We guess CHAOS to test H, O, S.

Therefore, our next guess: CHAOS.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(✓)R(x)A(✓)N(x)E(x)), I deduced:
- The first letter is **C**.
- The third letter is **A**.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are **absent** from the secret word.
- The word pattern is **C _ A _ _**, excluding R, N, and E.

For the second guess, I selected a word that:
- Starts with C and has A in the third position.
- Uses common letters to test possible positions (second, fourth, fifth).
- Avoids letters confirmed as absent (R, N, E).
- Maximizes information gain with distinct, high-frequency letters like H, O, and S.

I chose **""chaos""** because it fits these criteria:
- C is in position 1 → expected ✓.
- H is tested in position 2.
- A is in position 3 → expected ✓.
- O is tested in position 4.
- S is tested in position 5.
- All letters are valid and distinct (no duplicates).

This guess will provide feedback on H, O, and S, helping to narrow down the possibilities for the second, fourth, and fifth positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- 1st letter: C (correct and in position)
- 3rd letter: A (correct and in position)
- R, N, E are absent from the word.

So the secret word pattern: C _ A _ _

Guess 2: chaos -> C(✓), H(✓), A(✓), O(x), S(-)
Meaning:
- C (position 1) is correct → expected (we knew it)
- H (position 2) is correct and in position! So the second letter is H.
- A (position 3) is correct → expected.
- O (position 4) is absent → not in the word.
- S (position 5) is in the word but not in the fifth position? Wait: S(-) meaning S is in the wrong position? But we have a pattern.

Let me parse the feedback for each letter:

- C: ✓ at position 1 → already known.
- H: ✓ at position 2 → so now we know the second letter is H? Yes! Because it's marked as correct in the position.
- A: ✓ at position 3 → known.
- O: x → so O is not in the word at all? Therefore, O is absent? But wait, symbol x means the letter is not in the word? Yes, per rules: x → letter not in the word.
- S: - → meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.

Therefore, combining:
- Second letter is H: so pattern becomes C H A _ _
- S is present in the word but not at position 5 → so must be in position 4? Because the other positions? But positions: 1=C,2=H,3=A, so the only possibilities are 4 or... wait, only positions 4 and 5 left? But S is in the fifth position? Then feedback says S(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position → so since it was guessed in position 5 but it's wrong position, so S must be in position 4? Or wait, it could be elsewhere? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed? Position 3 is A, which we know? And we have S in position 5? So the secret word must have an S? And it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in position 4? Because there is only position 4 left? Positions are:

1. C (fixed)
2. H (now fixed)
3. A (fixed)
4. ? 
5. ?

So S is somewhere? It cannot be in 1,2,3 because those are filled? But S is not C, not H, not A? So S must be in position 4? Or 5? But the feedback: S(-) meaning in this guess at position 5, it is present but not there? So it must be in position 4? Therefore, the word is C H A S something? But wait, not necessarily? Because S might not be only one? But we got S(-) meaning there is at least one S? And it's not at position 5? So the S must be at position 4? Because positions 1,2,3 are taken? Unless there's a duplicate? But currently, we have no evidence of duplicates? Moreover, in ""chaos"", we guessed S at position 5? And it's marked wrong position? So the secret word has an S, but not at position 5? Therefore, it must be at position 4? Since positions 1,2,3 are C,H,A? And we cannot change? So unless the secret word has two S? But let's assume for now? The pattern:

So far, we have:
- Positions: 1: C, 2: H, 3: A
- S is in the word but not at position 5 → and since position 4 is the only other position? So position 4 must be S? Yes, because what else? Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, 5-letter word? So the secret word has S at position 4? Because position 5 is where we guessed S and it's wrong? And positions 1,2,3 are fixed? Therefore, S must be at position 4? Then what about position 5?

But wait: the feedback S(-) is for position 5? Meaning: in the guess ""chaos"", at position 5, we had S? And that S is present in the secret word but not at position 5? So yes, the secret word has an S, but not at position 5? Since positions 1,2,3 cannot be S (they are C,H,A), then it must be at position 4? Therefore, we conclude the secret word must have S at position 4?

Not necessarily? The secret word could have two S? For example, if the secret word is ""CLASS"", then S at position 5? But wait, we guessed S at position 5? Then if the secret word has S at position 5? Then feedback would be ✓? But here it's -, meaning present but not at that position? So secret word has S? But not at position 5? And it might be at another position? But the other positions? Position 1 is C? Secret word position 1 is C? Cannot have S? Position 2 is H? Cannot have S? Position 3 is A? Cannot have S? And position 4 is open? But we haven't guessed position 4? So yes, S must be in position 4? Because that's the only position left? Unless there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word has S at position 4 and 5? Then when we guess S at position 5? It might be marked as wrong position? Or if there are two, it could be marked as ""-"" for one? But let's see: for simplicity, since we have no indication of duplicate? So we infer:

The secret word is C H A S ??? but wait: position 4 is S? Then pattern: C H A S ?

Now, what about the fifth letter?

Additionally, we have:
- O is absent? From guess ""chaos"": O(x) → O is not in the word? So we eliminate O? Also, from first guess, we know R,N,E are absent? And O is also absent? So letters absent: E, N, O, R.

Now, the fifth letter: it cannot be E,N,O,R? and also, we know it must be something else? But S is now in position 4? And we have fifth letter unknown? And the word ends with?

Moreover, we haven't tested other letters? For example, we have only used: from two guesses: C,R,A,N,E and C,H,A,O,S? So letters used: C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S? And absent: R,N,E,O? And known present: C,A,H,S? But C,A,H,S are confirmed? And S is at position 4? Position 2 is H? Position 1 is C? Position 3 A? Position 4 must be S? So:

Secret word: C H A S ?

Fifth letter: must be a letter that:
- Not E,N,O,R (absent)
- And the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: CHASM? But wait, fifth letter M? If the word is CHASM? But M? Is M allowed? We haven't eliminated M? So CHASM? But let's check the feedback? In guess 2, we guessed S at position 5? Which was marked as -, meaning S is present but not at position 5? In CHASM? CHASM: C-H-A-S-M → so S at position 4? So if we guess CHAOS: positions: C H A O S → feedback: S at position 5? But in reality, secret word CHASM has S at position 4? Therefore, our S at position 5 should be marked as present but wrong position? Because it exists only at position 4? So yes.

Fifth letter possibilities? Common and we need to test? We don't know? Also, we must avoid using O? Etc.

But wait: are there any other letters we haven't tested? Yes, many? For example, B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? We know that I or etc? But we can try to use a word that fits and tests?

Now, we have pattern C H A S ? and fifth letter unknown? Possible words:

CHASM, CHASE? But CHASE has E? E is absent? So CHASE invalid. Similarly, CHASM is C H A S M → M?

CHAPS? But CHAPS is C H A P S → but then S at both? But we have no duplication? Unless? But let's see:

Common words: CHASM, CHASM is one.

Also, CHAIN? But N is absent? And I?

CHAIN: has I and N? N absent? Not allowed? So invalid.

Other? CHAMP? M? But CHAMP: P?

CHALM? Not a word?

I think CHASM or CHASH? Not word.

CHASM is common? Also, CHASE not possible? CHARM? But R is absent? And M? CHARM: C H A R M? R absent? Not eligible.

Therefore, seems CHASM is a candidate? But we need to confirm? Or perhaps there are other words? CHAFF? But F repeated? CHAMF? Not word.

So perhaps CHASM is possible? But fifth letter has to be tested? We can guess CHASM? And win? Because we have 6 tries? But we are on guess 3? So we can guess CHASM? But wait, we need to confirm S? We are sure? Position 4 must be S? Let me double.

What if the secret word has S at position 4? Yes? But could there be another word? For example, with another letter? Like in fifth position? But we don't know? Also, from feedback we also got O missing? So O is absent? Therefore, only possibility is S at position 4? Then fifth can be? Letters: M? P? T? Etc.

If we guess CHASM? Then a pattern? But let me:

Alternatively, we may not be sure? So we should test letters? Because we need to find the fifth letter? And we have letters to test? But we know S is present? And it must be at 4? So the word is C H A S ? and fifth is whatever valid? So we can list common: CHASM, CHASS? Not word? CHAPL? Not? CHOPS? O is absent? Why not be CHAFT? Not word? CHAIS? But S? And I? CHAIS: is C H A I S → that? But in our pattern: C H A I S? But position 4 is I? And fifth S? Then in our earlier guess: we guessed CHAOS: which had O but also S at the end? Secret word CHAIS: C H A I S? Then:

Feedback for CHAOS: positions: C→✓ (position1), H→✓ (position2), A→✓ (position3), O→x (not in word), S→ ? position5? S is in secret at position5? So we expected ✓ for S at position5? But feedback was S(-)? Meaning present but wrong position? Therefore, in CHAIS, S is at position5? So if we guess S at position5 and it's correct? Then feedback would be S(✓)? But we got S(-)? So that doesn't match? Therefore, secret word cannot have S at position5? So CHAIS is not possible? Because then S at position5 should be correct? But we got S(-) meaning not at position5? Therefore, S must be at position4? Thus, the secret word must be C H A S ? with ? at fifth position? And fifth position not being a letter that causes duplication? 

Now, fifth letter possibilities: 
The secret word must be a valid English word? 
So: CHASM (meaning a gap), CHESS? But CHESS: C H E S S → but E is absent? And positions: E is at position 3? But position 3 must be A? So CHESS: 1:C, 2:H? Wait, no: CHESS has H at second? E at third? But we require A at third? So CHESS: C-H-E-S-S → third is E? But we know third is A? So not.

Therefore, CHASM seems the most common? There's also CHATS? But T? Then CHATS: C H A T S → so fourth T, fifth S? But we got that S is present? But in CHATS, S is at position5? Then as above? If we put S at position5? Feedback should be ✓? But we got S(-) meaning not at position5? So cannot have S at position5? Therefore, CHATS is impossible? Similarly, CHAPS: C H A P S → fifth S? Same issue.

Therefore, the only possibility? Is S at position4? Then fifth cannot be E,N,O,R? So what words are there? 
CHASM? Fifth is M? 
CHAST? Not word? 
CHASV? Not.

CHASM seems the only common one? Or perhaps CHASL? Not word? 

Another? CHAS? Not 5-letter?

What about CHAMBER? Too long? Only 5-letter? So CHASM must be it? 

But we need confirmation? Or are there other words? Let's think: 
CLASH? But CLASH: C L A S H → positions: 1:C, 2:L? But CLASH: position 2 is L? But we know from feedback that H is at position 2? Because guess 2: chaos: H(✓) → so second letter is H? Therefore, no? Secret word must have second letter H? So CLASH has L at second? Not matching.

Similarly, CRASH? But first letter C? Third A? But fourth S, fifth H? But N? We have R absent? Crash has R? R absent? Not allowed? So CRASH not possible.

Therefore, pattern: C H A S ? → the ? must be a letter? And word CHASM? 

Also, CHASM is the only? CHASM: fifth letter M?

So we can try CHASM? But wait, we have to avoid any absent letters? We know E,N,O,R absent? M is not absent? So possible? 

But let me check: in guess 2, we got S(-) for position5? Which fits CHASM? Because CHASM has S at position4? So when we guessed position5=S? It is present (position4) but not at position5? So marking - is correct? 

Therefore, we deduce the secret word is CHASM? 

So we can guess CHASM? And if correct? We get all ✓? 

Since we have only one possibility? 

But are there others? Less common? Like CHAS etc? But not 5-letter? 

Sometimes CHAS ID? But not one word? So CHASM seems the only? 

Therefore, I think we found it? So guess CHASM? 

But step-by-step? We have used two guesses? This is guess 3? 

So let's summarize:
- Secret word pattern from guess1: C _ A _ _ with absent R,N,E?
- From guess2: discovered H at position2? And S present? But not at position5? And O absent? 
Also, since position4 must be S? Pattern: C H A S _?
And fifth letter? Only CHASM is common? Others don't exist? So we are confident? 

Thus, our next guess: CHASM.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
  - The secret word has **C** as the first letter and **A** as the third letter.
  - **R**, **N**, and **E** are absent from the word.
  - Pattern: **C _ A _ _**

- **Guess 2: chaos → C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) O(x) S(-)**  
  - **H** is confirmed as the second letter and is in the correct position (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked ✓).
  - **O** is absent.
  - **S** is present in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked with -, meaning wrong position).

### Deductions:
1. The secret word pattern is now **C H A S _** (because positions 1–3 are fixed as per feedback, and **S** must be in position 4—the only remaining spot, given that it cannot be in position 5).
2. **Absent letters**: R, N, E, O (excluded from future guesses).
3. The fifth letter must be a valid English letter that forms a real word with **C H A S**, and cannot be R, N, E, O.
4. Common possibilities like ""CHASE"" (invalid due to E) or ""CHATS"" (invalid as it places S in position 5) are ruled out. ""CHASM"" is the most common solution fitting the pattern:  
   - Position 4: S (confirmed by feedback)  
   - Position 5: M (not absent and forms a valid word).

Therefore, ""CHASM"" is the only logical guess that aligns with all feedback. If correct, it will resolve the puzzle.

<guess>chasm</guess>",chasm,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- 1st letter: C (correct and in position)
- 3rd letter: A (correct and in position)
- R, N, E are absent from the word.

So the secret word pattern: C _ A _ _

Guess 2: chaos -> C(✓), H(✓), A(✓), O(x), S(-)
Meaning:
- C (position 1) is correct → expected (we knew it)
- H (position 2) is correct and in position! So the second letter is H.
- A (position 3) is correct → expected.
- O (position 4) is absent → not in the word.
- S (position 5) is in the word but not in the fifth position? Wait: S(-) meaning S is in the wrong position? But we have a pattern.

Let me parse the feedback for each letter:

- C: ✓ at position 1 → already known.
- H: ✓ at position 2 → so now we know the second letter is H? Yes! Because it's marked as correct in the position.
- A: ✓ at position 3 → known.
- O: x → so O is not in the word at all? Therefore, O is absent? But wait, symbol x means the letter is not in the word? Yes, per rules: x → letter not in the word.
- S: - → meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.

Therefore, combining:
- Second letter is H: so pattern becomes C H A _ _
- S is present in the word but not at position 5 → so must be in position 4? Because the other positions? But positions: 1=C,2=H,3=A, so the only possibilities are 4 or... wait, only positions 4 and 5 left? But S is in the fifth position? Then feedback says S(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position → so since it was guessed in position 5 but it's wrong position, so S must be in position 4? Or wait, it could be elsewhere? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed? Position 3 is A, which we know? And we have S in position 5? So the secret word must have an S? And it cannot be in position 5? Therefore, it must be in position 4? Because there is only position 4 left? Positions are:

1. C (fixed)
2. H (now fixed)
3. A (fixed)
4. ? 
5. ?

So S is somewhere? It cannot be in 1,2,3 because those are filled? But S is not C, not H, not A? So S must be in position 4? Or 5? But the feedback: S(-) meaning in this guess at position 5, it is present but not there? So it must be in position 4? Therefore, the word is C H A S something? But wait, not necessarily? Because S might not be only one? But we got S(-) meaning there is at least one S? And it's not at position 5? So the S must be at position 4? Because positions 1,2,3 are taken? Unless there's a duplicate? But currently, we have no evidence of duplicates? Moreover, in ""chaos"", we guessed S at position 5? And it's marked wrong position? So the secret word has an S, but not at position 5? Therefore, it must be at position 4? Since positions 1,2,3 are C,H,A? And we cannot change? So unless the secret word has two S? But let's assume for now? The pattern:

So far, we have:
- Positions: 1: C, 2: H, 3: A
- S is in the word but not at position 5 → and since position 4 is the only other position? So position 4 must be S? Yes, because what else? Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, 5-letter word? So the secret word has S at position 4? Because position 5 is where we guessed S and it's wrong? And positions 1,2,3 are fixed? Therefore, S must be at position 4? Then what about position 5?

But wait: the feedback S(-) is for position 5? Meaning: in the guess ""chaos"", at position 5, we had S? And that S is present in the secret word but not at position 5? So yes, the secret word has an S, but not at position 5? Since positions 1,2,3 cannot be S (they are C,H,A), then it must be at position 4? Therefore, we conclude the secret word must have S at position 4?

Not necessarily? The secret word could have two S? For example, if the secret word is ""CLASS"", then S at position 5? But wait, we guessed S at position 5? Then if the secret word has S at position 5? Then feedback would be ✓? But here it's -, meaning present but not at that position? So secret word has S? But not at position 5? And it might be at another position? But the other positions? Position 1 is C? Secret word position 1 is C? Cannot have S? Position 2 is H? Cannot have S? Position 3 is A? Cannot have S? And position 4 is open? But we haven't guessed position 4? So yes, S must be in position 4? Because that's the only position left? Unless there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word has S at position 4 and 5? Then when we guess S at position 5? It might be marked as wrong position? Or if there are two, it could be marked as ""-"" for one? But let's see: for simplicity, since we have no indication of duplicate? So we infer:

The secret word is C H A S ??? but wait: position 4 is S? Then pattern: C H A S ?

Now, what about the fifth letter?

Additionally, we have:
- O is absent? From guess ""chaos"": O(x) → O is not in the word? So we eliminate O? Also, from first guess, we know R,N,E are absent? And O is also absent? So letters absent: E, N, O, R.

Now, the fifth letter: it cannot be E,N,O,R? and also, we know it must be something else? But S is now in position 4? And we have fifth letter unknown? And the word ends with?

Moreover, we haven't tested other letters? For example, we have only used: from two guesses: C,R,A,N,E and C,H,A,O,S? So letters used: C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S? And absent: R,N,E,O? And known present: C,A,H,S? But C,A,H,S are confirmed? And S is at position 4? Position 2 is H? Position 1 is C? Position 3 A? Position 4 must be S? So:

Secret word: C H A S ?

Fifth letter: must be a letter that:
- Not E,N,O,R (absent)
- And the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: CHASM? But wait, fifth letter M? If the word is CHASM? But M? Is M allowed? We haven't eliminated M? So CHASM? But let's check the feedback? In guess 2, we guessed S at position 5? Which was marked as -, meaning S is present but not at position 5? In CHASM? CHASM: C-H-A-S-M → so S at position 4? So if we guess CHAOS: positions: C H A O S → feedback: S at position 5? But in reality, secret word CHASM has S at position 4? Therefore, our S at position 5 should be marked as present but wrong position? Because it exists only at position 4? So yes.

Fifth letter possibilities? Common and we need to test? We don't know? Also, we must avoid using O? Etc.

But wait: are there any other letters we haven't tested? Yes, many? For example, B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? We know that I or etc? But we can try to use a word that fits and tests?

Now, we have pattern C H A S ? and fifth letter unknown? Possible words:

CHASM, CHASE? But CHASE has E? E is absent? So CHASE invalid. Similarly, CHASM is C H A S M → M?

CHAPS? But CHAPS is C H A P S → but then S at both? But we have no duplication? Unless? But let's see:

Common words: CHASM, CHASM is one.

Also, CHAIN? But N is absent? And I?

CHAIN: has I and N? N absent? Not allowed? So invalid.

Other? CHAMP? M? But CHAMP: P?

CHALM? Not a word?

I think CHASM or CHASH? Not word.

CHASM is common? Also, CHASE not possible? CHARM? But R is absent? And M? CHARM: C H A R M? R absent? Not eligible.

Therefore, seems CHASM is a candidate? But we need to confirm? Or perhaps there are other words? CHAFF? But F repeated? CHAMF? Not word.

So perhaps CHASM is possible? But fifth letter has to be tested? We can guess CHASM? And win? Because we have 6 tries? But we are on guess 3? So we can guess CHASM? But wait, we need to confirm S? We are sure? Position 4 must be S? Let me double.

What if the secret word has S at position 4? Yes? But could there be another word? For example, with another letter? Like in fifth position? But we don't know? Also, from feedback we also got O missing? So O is absent? Therefore, only possibility is S at position 4? Then fifth can be? Letters: M? P? T? Etc.

If we guess CHASM? Then a pattern? But let me:

Alternatively, we may not be sure? So we should test letters? Because we need to find the fifth letter? And we have letters to test? But we know S is present? And it must be at 4? So the word is C H A S ? and fifth is whatever valid? So we can list common: CHASM, CHASS? Not word? CHAPL? Not? CHOPS? O is absent? Why not be CHAFT? Not word? CHAIS? But S? And I? CHAIS: is C H A I S → that? But in our pattern: C H A I S? But position 4 is I? And fifth S? Then in our earlier guess: we guessed CHAOS: which had O but also S at the end? Secret word CHAIS: C H A I S? Then:

Feedback for CHAOS: positions: C→✓ (position1), H→✓ (position2), A→✓ (position3), O→x (not in word), S→ ? position5? S is in secret at position5? So we expected ✓ for S at position5? But feedback was S(-)? Meaning present but wrong position? Therefore, in CHAIS, S is at position5? So if we guess S at position5 and it's correct? Then feedback would be S(✓)? But we got S(-)? So that doesn't match? Therefore, secret word cannot have S at position5? So CHAIS is not possible? Because then S at position5 should be correct? But we got S(-) meaning not at position5? Therefore, S must be at position4? Thus, the secret word must be C H A S ? with ? at fifth position? And fifth position not being a letter that causes duplication? 

Now, fifth letter possibilities: 
The secret word must be a valid English word? 
So: CHASM (meaning a gap), CHESS? But CHESS: C H E S S → but E is absent? And positions: E is at position 3? But position 3 must be A? So CHESS: 1:C, 2:H? Wait, no: CHESS has H at second? E at third? But we require A at third? So CHESS: C-H-E-S-S → third is E? But we know third is A? So not.

Therefore, CHASM seems the most common? There's also CHATS? But T? Then CHATS: C H A T S → so fourth T, fifth S? But we got that S is present? But in CHATS, S is at position5? Then as above? If we put S at position5? Feedback should be ✓? But we got S(-) meaning not at position5? So cannot have S at position5? Therefore, CHATS is impossible? Similarly, CHAPS: C H A P S → fifth S? Same issue.

Therefore, the only possibility? Is S at position4? Then fifth cannot be E,N,O,R? So what words are there? 
CHASM? Fifth is M? 
CHAST? Not word? 
CHASV? Not.

CHASM seems the only common one? Or perhaps CHASL? Not word? 

Another? CHAS? Not 5-letter?

What about CHAMBER? Too long? Only 5-letter? So CHASM must be it? 

But we need confirmation? Or are there other words? Let's think: 
CLASH? But CLASH: C L A S H → positions: 1:C, 2:L? But CLASH: position 2 is L? But we know from feedback that H is at position 2? Because guess 2: chaos: H(✓) → so second letter is H? Therefore, no? Secret word must have second letter H? So CLASH has L at second? Not matching.

Similarly, CRASH? But first letter C? Third A? But fourth S, fifth H? But N? We have R absent? Crash has R? R absent? Not allowed? So CRASH not possible.

Therefore, pattern: C H A S ? → the ? must be a letter? And word CHASM? 

Also, CHASM is the only? CHASM: fifth letter M?

So we can try CHASM? But wait, we have to avoid any absent letters? We know E,N,O,R absent? M is not absent? So possible? 

But let me check: in guess 2, we got S(-) for position5? Which fits CHASM? Because CHASM has S at position4? So when we guessed position5=S? It is present (position4) but not at position5? So marking - is correct? 

Therefore, we deduce the secret word is CHASM? 

So we can guess CHASM? And if correct? We get all ✓? 

Since we have only one possibility? 

But are there others? Less common? Like CHAS etc? But not 5-letter? 

Sometimes CHAS ID? But not one word? So CHASM seems the only? 

Therefore, I think we found it? So guess CHASM? 

But step-by-step? We have used two guesses? This is guess 3? 

So let's summarize:
- Secret word pattern from guess1: C _ A _ _ with absent R,N,E?
- From guess2: discovered H at position2? And S present? But not at position5? And O absent? 
Also, since position4 must be S? Pattern: C H A S _?
And fifth letter? Only CHASM is common? Others don't exist? So we are confident? 

Thus, our next guess: CHASM.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
  - The secret word has **C** as the first letter and **A** as the third letter.

  - **O** is absent.
  - **S** is present in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked with -, meaning wrong position).

### Deductions:
