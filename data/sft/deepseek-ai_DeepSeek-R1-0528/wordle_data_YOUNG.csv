We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word and is in the correct position (the 4th letter).
 - The letters 'C', 'R', 'A', and 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 Since 'N' is at the 4th position and is correct, we know the 4th letter of the secret word is 'N'.

 We must avoid using the letters 'C', 'R', 'A', and 'E' because they are not in the word.

 Let's think of a new word:
 - It must be a 5-letter word.
 - The 4th letter must be 'N'.
 - It cannot contain 'C', 'R', 'A', or 'E'.
 - We should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in English include: T, S, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has the 4th letter 'N' and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we don't have any vowels from the first guess (A and E are out, but we can use others: I, O, U), we should include some vowels.

 Possibilities: 
 - The word must have a vowel or two unless it's an unusual word.

 Let me think of words ending with 'N' at the 4th position? Actually, the 4th letter is 'N', but note the word has 5 letters.

 So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _

 We need to avoid C, R, A, E.

 Example words: 
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note the 4th letter is N? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> valid.

 But let's check if it avoids forbidden letters: P, O, I, N, T. None of these are C, R, A, E. So that's okay.

 Another possibility: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"", etc.

 However, note we want to maximize information. Since we have no correct letters other than N, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Let's choose ""POINT"" because it uses P, O, I, T which are common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. But note the 4th letter must be 'N', so we cannot use ""MOIST"" because it would be M O I S T -> the 4th letter is S, not N.

 So let me stick with ""POINT"".

 But wait: what about the position of N? In ""POINT"", the 4th letter is indeed N? Yes: 
 P O I N T -> 
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: O
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: T

 So that matches.

 Therefore, I will guess ""POINT"".

 However, note: the word must be valid and we are avoiding the letters from the first guess that are absent.

 Let me double-check: 
 - The absent letters are C, R, A, E. 
 - ""POINT"" contains P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in {C, R, A, E}.

 So it's acceptable.

 Other options might be ""BLUNT"", but B and L are also good to test, but ""POINT"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which is helpful.

 I'll go with ""POINT"".

 But note: we know the 4th letter is N, so we lock that in.

 Let's output:

- N is in the correct position (4th letter)

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Meaning:
- Only N is correct and in the right position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are absent.

Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is correct and in the right position: so the second letter is O.
- N is correct and in the right position: fourth letter is N (we knew that).
- P, I, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: ? O ? N ?
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Present letters: O (in position 2), N (in position 4)

We must avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

We need to think of a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter
- Has N as the fourth letter
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T
- The other letters: first, third, and fifth positions are unknown.

We know the letters in the word so far: O and N, but there are three more letters.

We should use common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters include: S, L, B, D, U, M, H, etc.

Let's think about possible words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _

Examples:
- BOUND: B O U N D -> but we don't know about U and D, and T is absent, but D is not absent? However, note T is absent, but D is okay. But wait, let's check: B O U N D. Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D. The word ""bound"" is valid. But we must check if any letter is forbidden? We are avoiding C,R,A,E,P,I,T. B, U, N, D are all not in that list? But N is allowed and we have it. However, U and D haven't been tested. But note: E is absent, so no E. But D is okay.

But wait, ""BOUND"" uses D, which we haven't tested. Similarly, U is a vowel not tested.

Other words:
- FOUND: F O U N D -> similarly, F, U, D.
- MOUND: M O U N D -> M, U, D.
- SOUND: S O U N D -> S, U, D.

We could also consider words without U, for example:
- GOWN: but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So not.
- BROWN: but B R O W N -> R is absent (from first guess), so we can't use R.
- SHOWN: S H O W N -> S, H, O, W, N. Positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:H, 4:O? Wait, no: SHOWN has O at position 2 and N at position 5? We need N at position 4. Actually:
  SHOWN: S (1), H (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> not matching pattern. We need second letter O and fourth letter N, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:N, 5:?

Another example: ""JOINT"" but we already guessed ""point"" and I is absent, so J O I N T -> I is absent, so invalid.

Or ""DOING"": D O I N G -> but I is absent, so we can't use I.

Words without I: 
- ""MORON"": M O R O N -> but R is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
- ""BLOOD"": B L O O D -> but O is at position 3? Actually: B(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), D(5) -> not matching pattern (we need O at 2 and N at 4).

So words that exactly follow the pattern: second letter O, fourth letter N.

Let me list possible words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND is not possible because P is absent.

Also, some without U:
- BONUS: B O N U S -> but then N is at position 3? We need N at position 4: B O N U S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N? No, not matching.

Another: ""JOINS"" is not 5 letters? JOINS is 5: J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but I is absent, so invalid.

""COINS"" -> C is absent.

""LOINS"" -> L O I N S -> I is absent.

So, perhaps words like BOUND, FOUND, etc., are candidates.

But note: we haven't tested U and D (or S, F, etc.). We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

We should also note that from the feedback, we know that O and N are present and correctly placed.

Now, let me think of letters that are common and not tested: S, L, D, U, M, H, G, W, etc.

I have a chance to test multiple new letters.

For example, if I guess ""BOUND"", I test B, U, D.

If I guess ""SOUND"", I test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""MOUND"": M, U, D.

Since U is appearing in many of these, perhaps we should test U. And also test another consonant.

Another idea: what about ""HOUND""? H is a common letter, and U and D.

We have to pick one.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have used 2 already, so we need to be efficient.

We know the word has O at 2, N at 4, and the letters in positions 1, 3, 5 are unknown and from the remaining letters.

Since we don't know if U is present, we should try to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we might avoid U if we can find an alternative word.

Another pattern: _ O _ N _ without U.

What about ""TOKEN""? But T is absent (from second guess ""point"" feedback: T(x)).

""NOISY"": N O I S Y -> I absent and N at position 1? No, pattern must be position 2: O, 4: N.

""BOSOM"": B O S O M -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:S, 4:O, 5:M -> but fourth letter is O, not N; and we need fourth to be N, so no.

""GONAD"": G O N A D -> but A is absent (first guess) and also fourth letter? Wait, G O N A D: positions 1:G, 2:O, 3:N? then fourth is A? So pattern: _ O ? N _ -> we have G O N A D: N is at position 3? No, we need position 4.

How about ""CONCH"" but C absent and pattern mismatch.

It seems hard to find without U.

Perhaps ""BOWNS"" is not a word.

So U is common in these words.

Therefore, I think we have to try a word like ""SOUND"" or ""MOUND"".

Let me choose ""SOUND"" because S is a very common letter.

Also, S can be at the beginning or end, so let's test S.

Thus, guess: SOUND

Checking: S O U N D

Positions:
1: S (new)
2: O (known correct)
3: U (new)
4: N (known correct)
5: D (new)

And no absent letters: S, O, U, N, D -> none of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,E,P,I,T).

So it's a valid guess.

If we get feedback that S, U, or D are correct or absent, we'll know more.

Therefore, I guess ""SOUND"".

Thought process summary:
- Pattern: ? O ? N ?
- Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T
- Present: O (pos2), N (pos4)
- Try to cover new common letters: S, U, D
- Word: SOUND fits

<guess>sound</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": N is correct and in the correct position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are absent.
- From ""point"": O is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). N remains correct in the 4th position. P, I, T are absent.

Summary of known information:
- Secret word format: `_ O _ N _`
- Confirmed correct positions: 2nd = O, 4th = N
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Letters not tested: Many including B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, W, Y, etc.

Strategy for next guess:
- Must use only untested letters (no C,R,A,E,P,I,T)
- Must retain O in 2nd position and N in 4th position
- Should test new high-frequency letters to gather more information
- Common letters like S, U, D are good candidates
- Possible words: ""sound"" (S O U N D), ""bound"" (B O U N D), ""mound"" (M O U N D), ""hound"" (H O U N D)

Selected guess: ""sound""
- Why? Tests S (common starting letter), U (common vowel), and D (common ending)
- Avoids reused/non-viable letters
- Maximizes new letter coverage for efficient deduction
- Valid 5-letter English word adhering to the pattern `_ O _ N _`

<guess>sound</guess>",sound,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Meaning:
- Only N is correct and in the right position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are absent.

Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is correct and in the right position: so the second letter is O.
- N is correct and in the right position: fourth letter is N (we knew that).
- P, I, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: ? O ? N ?
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Present letters: O (in position 2), N (in position 4)

We must avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

We need to think of a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter
- Has N as the fourth letter
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T
- The other letters: first, third, and fifth positions are unknown.

We know the letters in the word so far: O and N, but there are three more letters.

We should use common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters include: S, L, B, D, U, M, H, etc.

Let's think about possible words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _

Examples:
- BOUND: B O U N D -> but we don't know about U and D, and T is absent, but D is not absent? However, note T is absent, but D is okay. But wait, let's check: B O U N D. Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D. The word ""bound"" is valid. But we must check if any letter is forbidden? We are avoiding C,R,A,E,P,I,T. B, U, N, D are all not in that list? But N is allowed and we have it. However, U and D haven't been tested. But note: E is absent, so no E. But D is okay.

But wait, ""BOUND"" uses D, which we haven't tested. Similarly, U is a vowel not tested.

Other words:
- FOUND: F O U N D -> similarly, F, U, D.
- MOUND: M O U N D -> M, U, D.
- SOUND: S O U N D -> S, U, D.

We could also consider words without U, for example:
- GOWN: but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So not.
- BROWN: but B R O W N -> R is absent (from first guess), so we can't use R.
- SHOWN: S H O W N -> S, H, O, W, N. Positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:H, 4:O? Wait, no: SHOWN has O at position 2 and N at position 5? We need N at position 4. Actually:
  SHOWN: S (1), H (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> not matching pattern. We need second letter O and fourth letter N, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:N, 5:?

Another example: ""JOINT"" but we already guessed ""point"" and I is absent, so J O I N T -> I is absent, so invalid.

Or ""DOING"": D O I N G -> but I is absent, so we can't use I.

Words without I: 
- ""MORON"": M O R O N -> but R is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
- ""BLOOD"": B L O O D -> but O is at position 3? Actually: B(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), D(5) -> not matching pattern (we need O at 2 and N at 4).

So words that exactly follow the pattern: second letter O, fourth letter N.

Let me list possible words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND is not possible because P is absent.

Also, some without U:
- BONUS: B O N U S -> but then N is at position 3? We need N at position 4: B O N U S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N? No, not matching.

Another: ""JOINS"" is not 5 letters? JOINS is 5: J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but I is absent, so invalid.

""COINS"" -> C is absent.

""LOINS"" -> L O I N S -> I is absent.

So, perhaps words like BOUND, FOUND, etc., are candidates.

But note: we haven't tested U and D (or S, F, etc.). We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

We should also note that from the feedback, we know that O and N are present and correctly placed.

Now, let me think of letters that are common and not tested: S, L, D, U, M, H, G, W, etc.

I have a chance to test multiple new letters.

For example, if I guess ""BOUND"", I test B, U, D.

If I guess ""SOUND"", I test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""MOUND"": M, U, D.

""NOISY"": N O I S Y -> I absent and N at position 1? No, pattern must be position 2: O, 4: N.

""BOSOM"": B O S O M -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:S, 4:O, 5:M -> but fourth letter is O, not N; and we need fourth to be N, so no.

""GONAD"": G O N A D -> but A is absent (first guess) and also fourth letter? Wait, G O N A D: positions 1:G, 2:O, 3:N? then fourth is A? So pattern: _ O ? N _ -> we have G O N A D: N is at position 3? No, we need position 4.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word and is in the correct position (the 4th letter).
 - The letters 'C', 'R', 'A', and 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 Since 'N' is at the 4th position and is correct, we know the 4th letter of the secret word is 'N'.

 We must avoid using the letters 'C', 'R', 'A', and 'E' because they are not in the word.

 Let's think of a new word:
 - It must be a 5-letter word.
 - The 4th letter must be 'N'.
 - It cannot contain 'C', 'R', 'A', or 'E'.
 - We should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in English include: T, S, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has the 4th letter 'N' and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we don't have any vowels from the first guess (A and E are out, but we can use others: I, O, U), we should include some vowels.

 Possibilities: 
 - The word must have a vowel or two unless it's an unusual word.

 Let me think of words ending with 'N' at the 4th position? Actually, the 4th letter is 'N', but note the word has 5 letters.

 So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _

 We need to avoid C, R, A, E.

 Example words: 
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note the 4th letter is N? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> valid.

 But let's check if it avoids forbidden letters: P, O, I, N, T. None of these are C, R, A, E. So that's okay.

 Another possibility: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"", etc.

 However, note we want to maximize information. Since we have no correct letters other than N, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Let's choose ""POINT"" because it uses P, O, I, T which are common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. But note the 4th letter must be 'N', so we cannot use ""MOIST"" because it would be M O I S T -> the 4th letter is S, not N.

 So let me stick with ""POINT"".

 But wait: what about the position of N? In ""POINT"", the 4th letter is indeed N? Yes: 
 P O I N T -> 
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: O
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: T

 So that matches.

 Therefore, I will guess ""POINT"".

 However, note: the word must be valid and we are avoiding the letters from the first guess that are absent.

 Let me double-check: 
 - The absent letters are C, R, A, E. 
 - ""POINT"" contains P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in {C, R, A, E}.

 So it's acceptable.

 Other options might be ""BLUNT"", but B and L are also good to test, but ""POINT"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which is helpful.

 I'll go with ""POINT"".

 But note: we know the 4th letter is N, so we lock that in.

 Let's output:

<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"":
- N is in the correct position (4th letter)
- C, R, A, E are not in the word

For the next guess:
- Must have 'N' in the 4th position
- Avoid using C, R, A, E
- Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., O, I, P, T) to maximize information

I chose ""point"" because it:
- Has 'N' in the 4th position
- Uses new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T)
- Follows Wordle best practices for letter diversity

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Meaning:
- Only N is correct and in the right position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are absent.

Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is correct and in the right position: so the second letter is O.
- N is correct and in the right position: fourth letter is N (we knew that).
- P, I, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: ? O ? N ?
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Present letters: O (in position 2), N (in position 4)

We must avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

We need to think of a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter
- Has N as the fourth letter
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T
- The other letters: first, third, and fifth positions are unknown.

We know the letters in the word so far: O and N, but there are three more letters.

We should use common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters include: S, L, B, D, U, M, H, etc.

Let's think about possible words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _

Examples:
- BOUND: B O U N D -> but we don't know about U and D, and T is absent, but D is not absent? However, note T is absent, but D is okay. But wait, let's check: B O U N D. Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D. The word ""bound"" is valid. But we must check if any letter is forbidden? We are avoiding C,R,A,E,P,I,T. B, U, N, D are all not in that list? But N is allowed and we have it. However, U and D haven't been tested. But note: E is absent, so no E. But D is okay.

But wait, ""BOUND"" uses D, which we haven't tested. Similarly, U is a vowel not tested.

Other words:
- FOUND: F O U N D -> similarly, F, U, D.
- MOUND: M O U N D -> M, U, D.
- SOUND: S O U N D -> S, U, D.

We could also consider words without U, for example:
- GOWN: but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So not.
- BROWN: but B R O W N -> R is absent (from first guess), so we can't use R.
- SHOWN: S H O W N -> S, H, O, W, N. Positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:H, 4:O? Wait, no: SHOWN has O at position 2 and N at position 5? We need N at position 4. Actually:
  SHOWN: S (1), H (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> not matching pattern. We need second letter O and fourth letter N, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:N, 5:?

Another example: ""JOINT"" but we already guessed ""point"" and I is absent, so J O I N T -> I is absent, so invalid.

Or ""DOING"": D O I N G -> but I is absent, so we can't use I.

Words without I: 
- ""MORON"": M O R O N -> but R is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
- ""BLOOD"": B L O O D -> but O is at position 3? Actually: B(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), D(5) -> not matching pattern (we need O at 2 and N at 4).

So words that exactly follow the pattern: second letter O, fourth letter N.

Let me list possible words:
- BOUND (B O U N D)
- FOUND (F O U N D)
- MOUND (M O U N D)
- SOUND (S O U N D)
- WOUND (W O U N D)
- HOUND (H O U N D)
- POUND is not possible because P is absent.

Also, some without U:
- BONUS: B O N U S -> but then N is at position 3? We need N at position 4: B O N U S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N? No, not matching.

Another: ""JOINS"" is not 5 letters? JOINS is 5: J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but I is absent, so invalid.

""COINS"" -> C is absent.

""LOINS"" -> L O I N S -> I is absent.

So, perhaps words like BOUND, FOUND, etc., are candidates.

But note: we haven't tested U and D (or S, F, etc.). We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

We should also note that from the feedback, we know that O and N are present and correctly placed.

Now, let me think of letters that are common and not tested: S, L, D, U, M, H, G, W, etc.

I have a chance to test multiple new letters.

For example, if I guess ""BOUND"", I test B, U, D.

If I guess ""SOUND"", I test S, U, D.

Similarly, ""MOUND"": M, U, D.

Since U is appearing in many of these, perhaps we should test U. And also test another consonant.

Another idea: what about ""HOUND""? H is a common letter, and U and D.

We have to pick one.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have used 2 already, so we need to be efficient.

We know the word has O at 2, N at 4, and the letters in positions 1, 3, 5 are unknown and from the remaining letters.

Since we don't know if U is present, we should try to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we might avoid U if we can find an alternative word.

Another pattern: _ O _ N _ without U.

What about ""TOKEN""? But T is absent (from second guess ""point"" feedback: T(x)).

""NOISY"": N O I S Y -> I absent and N at position 1? No, pattern must be position 2: O, 4: N.

""BOSOM"": B O S O M -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:S, 4:O, 5:M -> but fourth letter is O, not N; and we need fourth to be N, so no.

""GONAD"": G O N A D -> but A is absent (first guess) and also fourth letter? Wait, G O N A D: positions 1:G, 2:O, 3:N? then fourth is A? So pattern: _ O ? N _ -> we have G O N A D: N is at position 3? No, we need position 4.

How about ""CONCH"" but C absent and pattern mismatch.

It seems hard to find without U.

Perhaps ""BOWNS"" is not a word.

So U is common in these words.

Therefore, I think we have to try a word like ""SOUND"" or ""MOUND"".

Let me choose ""SOUND"" because S is a very common letter.

Also, S can be at the beginning or end, so let's test S.

Thus, guess: SOUND

Checking: S O U N D

Positions:
1: S (new)
2: O (known correct)
3: U (new)
4: N (known correct)
5: D (new)

And no absent letters: S, O, U, N, D -> none of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,E,P,I,T).

So it's a valid guess.

If we get feedback that S, U, or D are correct or absent, we'll know more.

Therefore, I guess ""SOUND"".

- Try to cover new common letters: S, U, D
- Word: SOUND fits

<guess>sound</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": N is correct and in the correct position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are absent.
- From ""point"": O is correct and in the correct position (2nd letter). N remains correct in the 4th position. P, I, T are absent.

Summary of known information:
- Secret word format: `_ O _ N _`
- Confirmed correct positions: 2nd = O, 4th = N
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T
- Letters not tested: Many including B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, W, Y, etc.

Strategy for next guess:
- Must use only untested letters (no C,R,A,E,P,I,T)
- Must retain O in 2nd position and N in 4th position
- Should test new high-frequency letters to gather more information
- Common letters like S, U, D are good candidates
- Possible words: ""sound"" (S O U N D), ""bound"" (B O U N D), ""mound"" (M O U N D), ""hound"" (H O U N D)

Selected guess: ""sound""
- Why? Tests S (common starting letter), U (common vowel), and D (common ending)
- Avoids reused/non-viable letters
- Maximizes new letter coverage for efficient deduction
- Valid 5-letter English word adhering to the pattern `_ O _ N _`

Actually, the 4th letter is \'N\', but note the word has 5 letters.\n\n So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _\n\n We need to avoid C, R, A, E.\n\n Example words: \n - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note the 4th letter is N? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> valid.\n\n But let\'s check if it avoids forbidden letters: P, O, I, N, T. None of these are C, R, A, E. So that\'s okay.\n\n Another possibility: ""JOINT"", ""MOIST"", etc.\n\n However, note we want to maximize information. Since we have no correct letters other than N, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s choose ""POINT"" because it uses P, O, I, T which are common.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. But note the 4th letter must be \'N\', so we cannot use ""MOIST"" because it would be M O I S T -> the 4th letter is S, not N.\n\n So let me stick with ""POINT"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of N? In ""POINT"", the 4th letter is indeed N? Yes: \n P O I N T -> \n Position 1: P\n Position 2: O\n Position 3: I\n Position 4: N\n Position 5: T\n\n So that matches.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""POINT"".\n\n However, note: the word must be valid and we are avoiding the letters from the first guess that are absent.\n\n Let me double-check: \n - The absent letters are C, R, A, E. \n - ""POINT"" contains P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in {C, R, A, E}.\n\n So it\'s acceptable.\n\n Other options might be ""BLUNT"", but B and L are also good to test, but ""POINT"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which is helpful.\n\n I\'ll go with ""POINT"".\n\n But note: we know the 4th letter is N, so we lock that in.\n\n Let\'s output:\n\n<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"":\n- N is in the correct position (4th letter)\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have \'N\' in the 4th position\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E\n- Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., O, I, P, T) to maximize information\n\nI chose ""point"" because it:\n- Has \'N\' in the 4th position\n- Uses new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T)\n- Follows Wordle best practices for letter diversity\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- Only N is correct and in the right position (4th letter).

O ? N ?\n- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T\n- Present letters: O (in position 2), N (in position 4)\n\nWe must avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.\n\nWe need to think of a valid 5-letter word that:\n- Has O as the second letter\n- Has N as the fourth letter\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T\n- The other letters: first, third, and fifth positions are unknown.\n\nWe know the letters in the word so far: O and N, but there are three more letters.\n\nWe should use common letters that haven\'t been tested yet. Common letters include: S, L, B, D, U, M, H, etc.\n\nLet\'s think about possible words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _\n\nExamples:\n- BOUND: B O U N D -> but we don\'t know about U and D, and T is absent, but D is not absent? However, note T is absent, but D is okay. But wait, let\'s check: B O U N D. Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D. The word ""bound"" is valid. But we must check if any letter is forbidden? We are avoiding C,R,A,E,P,I,T. B, U, N, D are all not in that list? But N is allowed and we have it. However, U and D haven\'t been tested. But note: E is absent, so no E. But D is okay.\n\nBut wait, ""BOUND"" uses D, which we haven\'t tested. Similarly, U is a vowel not tested.\n\nOther words:\n- FOUND: F O U N D -> similarly, F, U, D.\n- MOUND: M O U N D -> M, U, D.\n- SOUND: S O U N D -> S, U, D.\n\nWe could also consider words without U, for example:\n- GOWN: but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5. So not.\n- BROWN: but B R O W N -> R is absent (from first guess), so we can\'t use R.\n- SHOWN: S H O W N -> S, H, O, W, N. Positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:H, 4:O? Wait, no: SHOWN has O at position 2 and N at position 5? We need N at position 4. Actually:\n  SHOWN: S (1), H (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> not matching pattern. We need second letter O and fourth letter N, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:N, 5:?\n\nAnother example: ""JOINT"" but we already guessed ""point"" and I is absent, so J O I N T -> I is absent, so invalid.\n\nOr ""DOING"": D O I N G -> but I is absent, so we can\'t use I.\n\nWords without I: \n- ""MORON"": M O R O N -> but R is absent (from first guess), so invalid.\n- ""BLOOD"": B L O O D -> but O is at position 3? Actually: B(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), D(5) -> not matching pattern (we need O at 2 and N at 4).\n\nSo words that exactly follow the pattern: second letter O, fourth letter N.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- BOUND (B O U N D)\n- FOUND (F O U N D)\n- MOUND (M O U N D)\n- SOUND (S O U N D)\n- WOUND (W O U N D)\n- HOUND (H O U N D)\n- POUND is not possible because P is absent.\n\nAlso, some without U:\n- BONUS: B O N U S -> but then N is at position 3? We need N at position 4: B O N U S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N? No, not matching.\n\nAnother: ""JOINS"" is not 5 letters? JOINS is 5: J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but I is absent, so invalid.\n\n""COINS"" -> C is absent.\n\n""LOINS"" -> L O I N S -> I is absent.\n\nSo, perhaps words like BOUND, FOUND, etc., are candidates.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested U and D (or S, F, etc.). We need to choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nWe should also note that from the feedback, we know that O and N are present and correctly placed.\n\nNow, let me think of letters that are common and not tested: S, L, D, U, M, H, G, W, etc.\n\nI have a chance to test multiple new letters.\n\nFor example, if I guess ""BOUND"", I test B, U, D.\n\nIf I guess ""SOUND"", I test S, U, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOUND"": M, U, D.\n\nSince U is appearing in many of these, perhaps we should test U. And also test another consonant.\n\nAnother idea: what about ""HOUND""? H is a common letter, and U and D.\n\nWe have to pick one.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we have used 2 already, so we need to be efficient.\n\nWe know the word has O at 2, N at 4, and the letters in positions 1, 3, 5 are unknown and from the remaining letters.\n\nSince we don\'t know if U is present, we should try to cover possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid U if we can find an alternative word.\n\nAnother pattern: _ O _ N _ without U.\n\nWhat about ""TOKEN""? But T is absent (from second guess ""point"" feedback: T(x)).\n\n""NOISY"": N O I S Y -> I absent and N at position 1? No, pattern must be position 2: O, 4: N.\n\n""BOSOM"": B O S O M -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:S, 4:O, 5:M -> but fourth letter is O, not N; and we need fourth to be N, so no.\n\n""GONAD"": G O N A D -> but A is absent (first guess) and also fourth letter? Wait, G O N A D: positions 1:G, 2:O, 3:N? then fourth is A? So pattern: _ O ? N _ -> we have G O N A D: N is at position 3? No, we need position 4.\n\nHow about ""CONCH"" but C absent and pattern mismatch.\n\nIt seems hard to find without U.\n\nPerhaps ""BOWNS"" is not a word.\n\nSo U is common in these words.\n\nTherefore, I think we have to try a word like ""SOUND"" or ""MOUND"".\n\nLet me choose ""SOUND"" because S is a very common letter.\n\nAlso, S can be at the beginning or end, so let\'s test S.\n\nThus, guess: SOUND\n\nChecking: S O U N D\n\nPositions:\n1: S (new)\n2: O (known correct)\n3: U (new)\n4: N (known correct)\n5: D (new)\n\nAnd no absent letters: S, O, U, N, D -> none of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,E,P,I,T).\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nIf we get feedback that S, U, or D are correct or absent, we\'ll know more.\n\nTherefore, I guess ""SOUND"".\n\nThought process summary:\n- Pattern: ?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
- Meaning: N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
- Meaning: O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter). N is correct (4th). P, I, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(x)
- Meaning: O (2nd) and N (4th) are correct. Additionally, U is in the word but not in the correct position? 
  Actually, the feedback says: O(✓) meaning correct position, N(✓) correct position, U(✓) - but wait, the feedback format: 
  For ""sound"": 
    S (position1): x (not in word)
    O (position2): ✓ (correct and right position)
    U (position3): ✓ ? That's unexpected because we thought U was in the word but wrong position? 
  But the feedback says: U(✓) which means it's in the word and in the CORRECT position.

So:
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- O(✓): O is in word and correct position (2nd).
- U(✓): U is in word and correct position? But it was at position 3? So the third letter is U.
- N(✓): N correct position (4th).
- D(x): D is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is: ? O U N ? 

We now know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Positions 1 and 5 unknown.

So pattern: [1] O U N [5]

Also, from feedback, we know the following letters are absent: 
- From guess1: C, R, A, E
- From guess2: P, I, T
- From guess3: S, D

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, D

The word is: [1] O U N [5]

We know the letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern.

The only known letters are O in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th. So the word is ? O U N ?

Common letters for position 1: consonants like B, G, H, K, L, M, W, Y, etc.

Position 5: could be a consonant or vowel (but note we have U as a vowel).

We should try words with common beginning and ending.

Possibilities:
- BOUND: We considered earlier, but D is absent? Guess3 says D(x), so D is absent. And ""bound"" ends with D, so invalid.
- FOUND: F O U N D -> ends with D? But D is absent, so impossible.
- Similarly, MOUND, SOUND, HOUND, WOUND all end with D? Actually:
  BOUND -> D absent -> invalid.
  FOUND -> D absent -> invalid.
  MOUND -> ends with D? M O U N D -> same, D absent -> invalid.
  HOUND -> same issue.

But earlier we guessed ""sound"" and got D(x). So indeed, D is absent.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with something other than D and without the absent letters.

Possible words:
- The word ""YOUNG"": Y O U N G -> but wait, positions: Y(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). 
  But ""young"" has Y and G. Are they allowed? We haven't tested Y and G yet? And absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,D.

  So Y and G are still possible.

  Also, ""YOUNG"" is a valid word.

- ""MOURN"": M O U R N -> but R is absent? From first guess ""crane"" -> R(x). So R is absent. And ""mourn"" has R -> invalid.

- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> but C is absent? Also, T is absent (from guess2: T(x)), so invalid.

- Other possibilities: 
  - ""LOUNGE"": 6 letters? Too long.

- ""BOUNS"" not a word.

- ""JOULE"" -> but positions: J(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), E(5) -> but E is absent? And position 4 is L? Not N? Pattern requires N at 4.

- We need exactly 5 letters and pattern ? O U N ?

Another word: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn't have N at 4? Positions: T(absent), O, U, C(absent), H.

Not matching.

""FLOUR"" -> F L O U R -> but no N? And R absent.

We must have O U N as the middle, so ""YOUNG"" seems a good candidate.

Another: ""NOUNS"" -> N O U N S? Positions: N(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), S(5)? 
But S is absent (from guess3: S(x)), so S cannot be in the word. Also, N at position1: we don't know if that's allowed? 
But the word has two N's? 
We know from guess1: N is in position4, and we don't have information about duplicate N? The feedback didn't indicate about other N.
But in ""crane"", N was at position4. In ""sound"" we also had N at 4 and no other N tested elsewhere.

We have N only at position4 so far.

But if we guess ""NOUNS"":
- Position1: N -> perhaps correct? But we don't know. However, S is absent? And the word would be N O U N S -> but S is absent? In guess3, S(x) so S is not in the word.

But wait: if ""NOUNS"" were the word, then in guess3 (""sound""), we had S at position1 which would be wrong? But also at position5? However, feedback for ""sound"" said S(x) meaning S not in word at all? So if ""NOUNS"" has S, then contradiction? 

Therefore, since S is absent, ""NOUNS"" cannot be the word.

Similarly, ""YOUNG"" has no S or D? And uses Y and G.

We know G hasn't been tested? But absent letters don't include G.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" ends with D? Which is absent? So not.

Another word: ""MOUNT""? M O U N T -> positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> T is absent (from guess2). So T absent? Thus invalid.

""COUNT"" has C and T absent? Invalid.

""ROUND"" has R? Absent? Invalid.

So ""YOUNG"" is a candidate: Y O U N G.

But note: G at the end? Have we tested G? No, so it's possible.

But is it the only candidate? We can think of others.

""BOUNCY"" -> too long? 6 letters.

""YOURN"" not a common word? I think not valid.

""YOUNG"" seems valid.

Another: ""WOUND"" -> W O U N D -> D is absent? So invalid.

""FOUND"" -> F O U N D -> D absent.

Therefore, ""YOUNG"" is the top candidate.

But note: we don't know if Y and G are in the word? We need to test? But we have to make a guess.

We have two positions: first and last? So we need guesses that cover possibilities.

Another possibility: ""YOUSE"" -> but E absent? And it ends with E? And no N at 4? Not matching pattern.

Or ""GOURD"" -> G O U R D -> but R and D are absent? Invalid.

Thus, we proceed with ""YOUNG"".

Therefore, guess ""YOUNG"".

Thought process summary:
- Secret word: [1] O U N [5]
- Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,D
- Remaining common letters include B, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
- ""YOUNG"" (Y O U N G) fits:
  - Position 1: Y (untested letter)
  - Position 5: G (untested letter)
  - Valid English word
  - Avoids all absent letters

If incorrect, feedback will help determine the correct letters.

We are on guess 4, so we have two more tries after this.

So let's guess ""YOUNG"".

<guess>young</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Known correct positions:**
  - 2nd letter = O
  - 3rd letter = U (newly confirmed from ""sound"")
  - 4th letter = N
  - Pattern: `[?] O U N [?]`

- **Absent letters (not in the word):**  
  C, R, A, E (from ""crane"")  
  P, I, T (from ""point"")  
  S, D (from ""sound"")  

- **Remaining possibilities:**  
  The first and fifth letters must be filled with untested letters (avoiding absent letters) and form a valid English word.  

**Analysis:**  
- Valid words fitting `? O U N ?` and excluding absent letters:  
  - Common options include ""YOUNG"" (Y and G untested), ""MOURN"" (but R is absent), ""COUNT"" (but C and T absent), ""WOUND"" (D absent).  
  - ""YOUNG"" (Y O U N G) is a strong candidate because:  
    - Y (position 1) and G (position 5) are common, untested letters.  
    - Adheres to the pattern and avoids all absent letters.  
    - Tests two new letters efficiently.  

**Guess strategy:**  
- Prioritize testing ""YOUNG"" to confirm unknown positions (1st and 5th).  
- If incorrect, feedback on Y/G will narrow possibilities further.  

**Final decision:**  
<guess>young</guess>",young,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
- Meaning: N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter). C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: point -> P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
- Meaning: O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter). N is correct (4th). P, I, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: sound -> S(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(x)
- Meaning: O (2nd) and N (4th) are correct. Additionally, U is in the word but not in the correct position? 
  Actually, the feedback says: O(✓) meaning correct position, N(✓) correct position, U(✓) - but wait, the feedback format: 
  For ""sound"": 
    S (position1): x (not in word)
    O (position2): ✓ (correct and right position)
    U (position3): ✓ ? That's unexpected because we thought U was in the word but wrong position? 
  But the feedback says: U(✓) which means it's in the word and in the CORRECT position.

So:
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- O(✓): O is in word and correct position (2nd).
- U(✓): U is in word and correct position? But it was at position 3? So the third letter is U.
- N(✓): N correct position (4th).
- D(x): D is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is: ? O U N ? 

We now know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Positions 1 and 5 unknown.

So pattern: [1] O U N [5]

Also, from feedback, we know the following letters are absent: 
- From guess1: C, R, A, E
- From guess2: P, I, T
- From guess3: S, D

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, D

The word is: [1] O U N [5]

We know the letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern.

The only known letters are O in 2nd, U in 3rd, N in 4th. So the word is ? O U N ?

Common letters for position 1: consonants like B, G, H, K, L, M, W, Y, etc.

Position 5: could be a consonant or vowel (but note we have U as a vowel).

We should try words with common beginning and ending.

Possibilities:
- BOUND: We considered earlier, but D is absent? Guess3 says D(x), so D is absent. And ""bound"" ends with D, so invalid.
- FOUND: F O U N D -> ends with D? But D is absent, so impossible.
- Similarly, MOUND, SOUND, HOUND, WOUND all end with D? Actually:
  BOUND -> D absent -> invalid.
  FOUND -> D absent -> invalid.
  MOUND -> ends with D? M O U N D -> same, D absent -> invalid.
  HOUND -> same issue.

But earlier we guessed ""sound"" and got D(x). So indeed, D is absent.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with something other than D and without the absent letters.

Possible words:
- The word ""YOUNG"": Y O U N G -> but wait, positions: Y(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). 
  But ""young"" has Y and G. Are they allowed? We haven't tested Y and G yet? And absent letters are C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,D.

  So Y and G are still possible.

  Also, ""YOUNG"" is a valid word.

- ""MOURN"": M O U R N -> but R is absent? From first guess ""crane"" -> R(x). So R is absent. And ""mourn"" has R -> invalid.

- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> but C is absent? Also, T is absent (from guess2: T(x)), so invalid.

- Other possibilities: 
  - ""LOUNGE"": 6 letters? Too long.

- ""BOUNS"" not a word.

- ""JOULE"" -> but positions: J(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), E(5) -> but E is absent? And position 4 is L? Not N? Pattern requires N at 4.

- We need exactly 5 letters and pattern ? O U N ?

Another word: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn't have N at 4? Positions: T(absent), O, U, C(absent), H.

Not matching.

""FLOUR"" -> F L O U R -> but no N? And R absent.

We must have O U N as the middle, so ""YOUNG"" seems a good candidate.

Another: ""NOUNS"" -> N O U N S? Positions: N(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), S(5)? 
But S is absent (from guess3: S(x)), so S cannot be in the word. Also, N at position1: we don't know if that's allowed? 
But the word has two N's? 
We know from guess1: N is in position4, and we don't have information about duplicate N? The feedback didn't indicate about other N.
But in ""crane"", N was at position4. In ""sound"" we also had N at 4 and no other N tested elsewhere.

We have N only at position4 so far.

But if we guess ""NOUNS"":
- Position1: N -> perhaps correct? But we don't know. However, S is absent? And the word would be N O U N S -> but S is absent? In guess3, S(x) so S is not in the word.

But wait: if ""NOUNS"" were the word, then in guess3 (""sound""), we had S at position1 which would be wrong? But also at position5? However, feedback for ""sound"" said S(x) meaning S not in word at all? So if ""NOUNS"" has S, then contradiction? 

Therefore, since S is absent, ""NOUNS"" cannot be the word.

Similarly, ""YOUNG"" has no S or D? And uses Y and G.

We know G hasn't been tested? But absent letters don't include G.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" ends with D? Which is absent? So not.

Another word: ""MOUNT""? M O U N T -> positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> T is absent (from guess2). So T absent? Thus invalid.

""COUNT"" has C and T absent? Invalid.

""ROUND"" has R? Absent? Invalid.

So ""YOUNG"" is a candidate: Y O U N G.

But note: G at the end? Have we tested G? No, so it's possible.

But is it the only candidate? We can think of others.

""BOUNCY"" -> too long? 6 letters.

""YOURN"" not a common word? I think not valid.

""YOUNG"" seems valid.

Another: ""WOUND"" -> W O U N D -> D is absent? So invalid.

""FOUND"" -> F O U N D -> D absent.

Therefore, ""YOUNG"" is the top candidate.

But note: we don't know if Y and G are in the word? We need to test? But we have to make a guess.

We have two positions: first and last? So we need guesses that cover possibilities.

Another possibility: ""YOUSE"" -> but E absent? And it ends with E? And no N at 4? Not matching pattern.

Or ""GOURD"" -> G O U R D -> but R and D are absent? Invalid.

Thus, we proceed with ""YOUNG"".

Therefore, guess ""YOUNG"".

Thought process summary:
- Secret word: [1] O U N [5]
- Absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,D
- Remaining common letters include B, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
- ""YOUNG"" (Y O U N G) fits:
  - Position 1: Y (untested letter)
  - Position 5: G (untested letter)
  - Valid English word
  - Avoids all absent letters

If incorrect, feedback will help determine the correct letters.

We are on guess 4, so we have two more tries after this.

So let's guess ""YOUNG"".

<guess>young</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Known correct positions:**
  - 2nd letter = O
  - 3rd letter = U (newly confirmed from ""sound"")
  - 4th letter = N
  - Pattern: `[?] O U N [?]`

- **Absent letters (not in the word):**  
  C, R, A, E (from ""crane"")  
  P, I, T (from ""point"")  
  S, D (from ""sound"")  

- **Remaining possibilities:**  
  The first and fifth letters must be filled with untested letters (avoiding absent letters) and form a valid English word.  

**Analysis:**  
- Valid words fitting `? O U N ?` and excluding absent letters:  
  - Common options include ""YOUNG"" (Y and G untested), ""MOURN"" (but R is absent), ""COUNT"" (but C and T absent), ""WOUND"" (D absent).  
  - ""YOUNG"" (Y O U N G) is a strong candidate because:  
    - Y (position 1) and G (position 5) are common, untested letters.  
    - Adheres to the pattern and avoids all absent letters.  
    - Tests two new letters efficiently.  

**Guess strategy:**  
- Prioritize testing ""YOUNG"" to confirm unknown positions (1st and 5th).  
- If incorrect, feedback on Y/G will narrow possibilities further.  

**Final decision:**",Guess 4: young -> FEEDBACK: Y(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
