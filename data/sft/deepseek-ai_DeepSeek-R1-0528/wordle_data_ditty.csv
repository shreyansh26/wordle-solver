We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"" with all letters marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We must choose a new guess that avoids these letters. We should pick a word with common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, U (since A and E are eliminated, and sometimes Y but let's focus on the main ones)
Common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

We want to maximize the information we get, so we should use a word with as many new common letters as possible.

Some good candidates: 
- ""MOIST"" (contains M, O, I, S, T) - these are common letters.
- ""POUCH"" (but C is already excluded, so avoid that) -> ""crane"" had C and we know C is excluded so we avoid C.

Since C, R, A, N, E are excluded, we must avoid them in the next guess.

Let me think of a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words:
- ""GHOUL"" but has 5 letters? G, H, O, U, L -> 5 letters. But U is less common.
- ""SLIPT"" - not a common word, better to stick with common words.
- ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S.

Alternatively, ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D -> all common.

Another option: ""PILOT"" - P, I, L, O, T.

But let me check: we have eliminated 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Aim for high frequency letters: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, etc.

I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T.

Other good words: ""BLIMP"" (but B and M and P, but limited vowels), ""SHOUT"" (S, H, O, U, T) but U is less common.

Since the secret word has none of the letters in ""crane"", we have a lot of possibilities.

I'll go with ""MOIST"".

So the next guess is ""moist"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as ""x""), we know the secret word contains none of the letters: **C, R, A, N, E**. 

For the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested to maximize information gain (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, M, P, D**).
- Choose a word with diverse vowels/consonants to cover new ground.

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""**, which uses new common letters: M, O, I, S, T. This covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), providing broad coverage to refine future guesses.

We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all x: C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(-)

Feedback interpretation for ""moist"":
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked as '-'). So 'I' is present, but not at the 3rd position.
- T is in the word but not at the 5th position (marked as '-'). So 'T' is present, but not at the end.
- M, O, S are not in the word. So we also add M, O, S to the exclusion list.

So, excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

And we know the word contains:
- I (but not in position 3)
- T (but not in position 5)

Also, since I and T are present, we must include them in the next guess.

Reminder: We have 6 tries, so we are on our third try.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Must include both I and T (since they are in the word).
- Must not use any excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- The position of I cannot be position 3 (since in ""moist"", I was at position 3 but was wrong position).
- Similarly, position of T cannot be position 5.

Let's list remaining possible letters. 
Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, but we'll consider only U for now as vowel, unless needed).
Consonants: We have B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, W, Y, etc.

We need to choose a word that has I and T, and three other letters from the available pool.

Possible positions for I: It cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But note, position 5 is marked for T, which is also not allowed. Similarly T cannot be at position 5.

But wait, the feedback says the letter I is present but not at position 3. Similarly, T is present but not at position 5.

So I can be at other positions: 1,2,4, or 5? However, note the word must have exactly the letters; we don't know the count. But since I is only marked once, we assume at least one I.

Similarly for T.

However, we must avoid positions that are known to be incorrect for these letters.

But for I: it cannot be placed at position 3. For T: it cannot be placed at position 5.

We have to place I and T in the next word at other positions.

We need to think of words that contain I and T, without using excluded letters.

Excluded: C R A N E M O S

So allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I is already included).

But we don't have many vowels: U is the main vowel available? We also have Y which can be a vowel.

Common words with I and T: e.g., ""TIGHT"", ""LIGHT"", ""PITHY"", ""BIDET"", ""GUILT"", etc.

Let's list:

- ""GUILT"" -> G, U, I, L, T. Allowed? G, U, I, L, T. None excluded, but we have to check positions.

But we don't know about positions for I and T? We only know I cannot be at position 3? In ""GUILT"", let's see positions: 
Position 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: T.

We tried I at position 3, which was wrong position. But in ""GUILT"", I is also at position 3. So according to feedback, the secret word does not have I at position 3. So we cannot place I in position 3 again.

Therefore, ""GUILT"" is invalid because it has I at position 3.

Similarly, words with I at position 3: avoid.

We need a word with I not at position 3 and T not at position 5.

Example: Think of ""TIGER""? But E is excluded -> No.

""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> positions:1:B,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T. I at position 2? That's fine. T at position 5? But feedback says T is not at position 5? Yes, because in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong position. So we must avoid T at position 5.

Therefore, in ""BIGHT"", T is at position 5, which we cannot use.

So avoid words with T at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have T at the end.

Now, another word: ""PILOT""? But O is excluded, and S not in, but O is excluded -> invalid.

""DELTA""? D E L T A -> but E and A are excluded? A and E excluded -> invalid.

We need to form words without E,A, etc.

Another one: ""TWIXT""? Not common, and might not be valid.

""THICK"": T H I C K -> C excluded.

""LITHO"": L I T H O -> O excluded.

""WIGHT"": W I G H T -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.

""WITHY"": W I T H Y -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> T at position 3? That is acceptable because feedback only restricts T from position 5, not position 3.

Similarly, I at position 2: acceptable because I cannot be at position 3? Position 2 is allowed for I.

So ""WITHY"" is: W-I-T-H-Y -> letters: W, I, T, H, Y -> all allowed? W, I, T, H, Y: no exclusions? Excluded: C R A N E M O S. Yes, none of these. And Y is allowed.

Also, positions: 
- I is at position 2 (not position 3, so ok)
- T is at position 3 (not position 5, so ok)

So ""WITHY"" is a word? Meaning is a type of willow, but it might be accepted in word games. We can check if it's acceptable.

Another option: ""PITHY"": P I T H Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> again, I at 2, T at 3? T at position 3? Not position 5, so ok. ""PITHY"" means concise and meaningful.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" uses P, I, T, H, Y -> allowed letters.

But we don't know if H or Y are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

Another word: ""BITTY""? B I T T Y -> but this has two T's? Feedback from ""moist"" showed T was present once, but we don't know if multiple? Actually, in ""moist"" we guessed one T and it was present, but if it can be multiple? We don't know. But ""BITTY"" has two T's, which might be acceptable.

Positions: B at1, I at2, T at3, T at4, Y at5 -> I at position 2 (ok), but T at positions 3 and 4? But feedback only said T not in position 5? So T can be in any position except 5? Yes.

But we have T at 3 and 4? Allowed? However, if the word has only one T, then one T might be wrong? But we don't know the count. So it's safer to use one T until we know.

But ""BITTY"" has two T's. We can consider.

Alternatively, a simpler word: ""LIGHT""? L I G H T -> positions:1:L,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed, because T was at position 5 in ""moist"" and was wrong position. So avoid T at position 5.

Therefore, ""LIGHT"" is invalid.

Let's think of words where T isn't at the end and I isn't at position 3.

Perhaps ""THUMB""? T H U M B -> M is excluded? M from ""moist"" -> M is excluded? Yes, feedback M(x) so excluded. So no.

""QUILT""? Q U I L T -> Q and U? But Q is not very common. But positions: Q at1, U at2, I at3? But I at position 3, which we cannot. And also, we avoid.

""BUILT""? B U I L T -> U is allowed? B U I L T -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:T -> I at position 3? Not allowed. And T at position 5? Not allowed.

Again violates.

""TIGER"": E excluded.

""TIDAL"": T I D A L -> A excluded? A is excluded (""crane"" A(x)).

Think differently: Place I at position 1, or 4, and T at position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

For example: ""INPUT""? I N P U T -> N excluded? N from ""crane"" -> excluded.

Must avoid N.

Another one: ""PIVOT""? P I V O T -> O excluded? Yes.

""BUDGE""? No I or T.

Focus on words containing I and T.

List: 
- Position I: avoid 3. Position T: avoid 5.

Example word: ""KITTY""? K I T T Y -> positions:1:K,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> I at position 2 (ok), T at position 3 and 4? T not at 5, so ok.

Letters: K, I, T, T, Y. Excluded? K not excluded? Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S. K is allowed.

But ""KITTY"" might be acceptable? Meaning is familiar.

Another: ""DITTY"": D I T T Y -> similar: D, I, T, T, Y -> positions:1:D,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> same as above.

Also, avoid repeating T? But it might be necessary.

But we don't know if two Ts are allowed? We might find out.

Another word: ""WIDTH"": W I D T H -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H -> There! I at position 2 (not 3), T at position 4 (not 5). Perfect.

And letters: W, I, D, T, H -> all allowed? W not excluded? I and T must be in the word? D and H not excluded.

So ""WIDTH"" seems a valid choice.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" also: P, I, T, H, Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> I at position 2 (good), T at position 3 (any position except 5? So position 3 is new and untested, so ok? Yes, because feedback only restricts position 5 for T.

In ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong. But T could be correct at position 3 or 4? We don't know.

But in ""PITHY"", T is at position 3: which might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know, so it's safe to try.

However, in ""WIDTH"", T is at position 4, which is also new.

But we also get information about H and Y? Or D.

I think both are fine, but ""WIDTH"" places T at position 4, which is closer to the beginning? Doesn't matter.

Other option: ""HITCH"": H I T C H -> C excluded? Yes, C from ""crane"" excluded -> invalid.

""FIGHT"": F I G H T -> positions:1:F,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.

Invalid.

""BIGHT"": B I G H T -> T at 5: invalid.

So ""WIDTH"" seems strong: 
- Uses W, D, T, H (with I and T included). 
- Avoids forbidden letters. 
- Positions: I at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (not 5, allowed).

Similarly, ""PITHY"" is also: I at position 2, T at position 3 (not 5, allowed).

Which one to choose? Both introduce new letters: ""WIDTH"" has W,D,H; ""PITHY"" has P,H,Y.

We might also consider ""DUTY"" - but that's 4 letters.

Another word: ""TILDE"": T I L D E -> E excluded? From ""crane"" E(x), excluded.

""UTILE"": U T I L E -> E excluded.

Not valid.

So between ""WIDTH"" and ""PITHY"", both valid.

I think ""WIDTH"" is slightly better? Because it tests T at position 4, while ""PITHY"" tests T at position 3? But both positions are new.

Perhaps choose one arbitrarily.

Another candidate: ""KITHE""? Not common.

I think ""WIDTH"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm ""WIDTH"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning is the extent from side to side.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" is also valid.

I can pick ""WIDTH"" for variety? Or ""PITHY"" uses Y which is less common? Maybe ""WIDTH"" is better.

Remember that there are not many vowel options: U is available. In ""WIDTH"", the only vowel is I? I is considered a vowel. Similarly, in ""PITHY"", vowel is I? And Y acts as vowel sometimes.

But safe.

Alternatively, we might use U: let me see if there is a word with U, I, T.

For example, ""QUIET""? But E excluded? And Q? Not common.

""BUILD"": B U I L D -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:D -> I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3? So invalid because it would place I where we know it's wrong.

""GUILD"": same, I at position 3? Invalid.

So difficult to include U without placing I at position 3? But if we place U elsewhere? 

""TUBAL""? No I.

""TULIP"": T U L I P -> positions:1:T,5:P? I at position 4? that's position 4: T at1, U at2, L at3, I at4, P at5 -> T at position 1 (unrestricted), I at position 4 (not 3, so ok). And P at5? We haven't tested T at position1 or I at position4? Or P? U? L.

But letters: T U L I P -> no excluded letters? Excluded: C R A N E M O S? None are in TULIP? L and P are allowed? U is allowed.

So ""TULIP"" is: positions: T at1 (new), U at2, L at3, I at4 (allowed, since not position3), P at5.

And T at position1: we don't know if it's correct? Feedback only restricted T from position5? So T can be at position1.

Similarly, I at position4: should be fine.

Also, introduces U.

But T is in the word? Yes, we know T is in the word? But in ""TULIP"", T is at position1? We don't know if that's correct? But we test that way.

Compare to ""WIDTH"": 
- ""WIDTH"": positions T at4.
- ""TULIP"": positions T at1.

Which is better? We might get more information? Note that the feedback from ""moist"" said I is in wrong position? So when we place I at position4? Maybe it could be correct? Or we test a new spot.

Similarly, T at position1 or4.

But we have one more constraint: T is not at position5? But that's it.

I think either is fine.

But I recall that initial feedback had I? So we have I to place.

To save tries, perhaps ""WIDTH""? Let's proceed.

So I choose ""WIDTH"" as the next guess.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded from the word).
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** showed that:
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with '-') 
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with '-') 
  - M, O, S are not in the word (excluded).

Therefore:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- **Included letters**: I and T must be in the word, but:
  - I cannot be placed in position 3.
  - T cannot be placed in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include I and T.
- Avoid positions known to be incorrect (I not position 3, T not position 5).
- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, H, W, G, L, U, P).
- Avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, as there's no evidence of duplicates.

A strong candidate is **""WIDTH""**:
- Positions: 
  - W (unknown) at position 1
  - I (in word, not position 3) at position 2 
  - D (unknown) at position 3
  - T (in word, not position 5) at position 4 
  - H (unknown) at position 5
- This tests I at position 2 (a new and safe position) and T at position 4 (safe per feedback).
- Replaces vowels/testing new consonant patterns.

<guess>width</guess>",width,"We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all x: C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(-)

Feedback interpretation for ""moist"":
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked as '-'). So 'I' is present, but not at the 3rd position.
- T is in the word but not at the 5th position (marked as '-'). So 'T' is present, but not at the end.
- M, O, S are not in the word. So we also add M, O, S to the exclusion list.

So, excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

And we know the word contains:
- I (but not in position 3)
- T (but not in position 5)

Also, since I and T are present, we must include them in the next guess.

Reminder: We have 6 tries, so we are on our third try.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Must include both I and T (since they are in the word).
- Must not use any excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- The position of I cannot be position 3 (since in ""moist"", I was at position 3 but was wrong position).
- Similarly, position of T cannot be position 5.

Let's list remaining possible letters. 
Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, but we'll consider only U for now as vowel, unless needed).
Consonants: We have B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, W, Y, etc.

We need to choose a word that has I and T, and three other letters from the available pool.

Possible positions for I: It cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But note, position 5 is marked for T, which is also not allowed. Similarly T cannot be at position 5.

But wait, the feedback says the letter I is present but not at position 3. Similarly, T is present but not at position 5.

So I can be at other positions: 1,2,4, or 5? However, note the word must have exactly the letters; we don't know the count. But since I is only marked once, we assume at least one I.

Similarly for T.

However, we must avoid positions that are known to be incorrect for these letters.

But for I: it cannot be placed at position 3. For T: it cannot be placed at position 5.

We have to place I and T in the next word at other positions.

We need to think of words that contain I and T, without using excluded letters.

Excluded: C R A N E M O S

So allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I is already included).

But we don't have many vowels: U is the main vowel available? We also have Y which can be a vowel.

Common words with I and T: e.g., ""TIGHT"", ""LIGHT"", ""PITHY"", ""BIDET"", ""GUILT"", etc.

Let's list:

- ""GUILT"" -> G, U, I, L, T. Allowed? G, U, I, L, T. None excluded, but we have to check positions.

But we don't know about positions for I and T? We only know I cannot be at position 3? In ""GUILT"", let's see positions: 
Position 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: T.

We tried I at position 3, which was wrong position. But in ""GUILT"", I is also at position 3. So according to feedback, the secret word does not have I at position 3. So we cannot place I in position 3 again.

Therefore, ""GUILT"" is invalid because it has I at position 3.

Similarly, words with I at position 3: avoid.

We need a word with I not at position 3 and T not at position 5.

Example: Think of ""TIGER""? But E is excluded -> No.

""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> positions:1:B,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T. I at position 2? That's fine. T at position 5? But feedback says T is not at position 5? Yes, because in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong position. So we must avoid T at position 5.

Therefore, in ""BIGHT"", T is at position 5, which we cannot use.

So avoid words with T at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have T at the end.

Now, another word: ""PILOT""? But O is excluded, and S not in, but O is excluded -> invalid.

""DELTA""? D E L T A -> but E and A are excluded? A and E excluded -> invalid.

We need to form words without E,A, etc.

Another one: ""TWIXT""? Not common, and might not be valid.

""THICK"": T H I C K -> C excluded.

""LITHO"": L I T H O -> O excluded.

""WIGHT"": W I G H T -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.

""WITHY"": W I T H Y -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> T at position 3? That is acceptable because feedback only restricts T from position 5, not position 3.

Similarly, I at position 2: acceptable because I cannot be at position 3? Position 2 is allowed for I.

So ""WITHY"" is: W-I-T-H-Y -> letters: W, I, T, H, Y -> all allowed? W, I, T, H, Y: no exclusions? Excluded: C R A N E M O S. Yes, none of these. And Y is allowed.

Also, positions: 
- I is at position 2 (not position 3, so ok)
- T is at position 3 (not position 5, so ok)

So ""WITHY"" is a word? Meaning is a type of willow, but it might be accepted in word games. We can check if it's acceptable.

Another option: ""PITHY"": P I T H Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> again, I at 2, T at 3? T at position 3? Not position 5, so ok. ""PITHY"" means concise and meaningful.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" uses P, I, T, H, Y -> allowed letters.

But we don't know if H or Y are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

Another word: ""BITTY""? B I T T Y -> but this has two T's? Feedback from ""moist"" showed T was present once, but we don't know if multiple? Actually, in ""moist"" we guessed one T and it was present, but if it can be multiple? We don't know. But ""BITTY"" has two T's, which might be acceptable.

Positions: B at1, I at2, T at3, T at4, Y at5 -> I at position 2 (ok), but T at positions 3 and 4? But feedback only said T not in position 5? So T can be in any position except 5? Yes.

But we have T at 3 and 4? Allowed? However, if the word has only one T, then one T might be wrong? But we don't know the count. So it's safer to use one T until we know.

But ""BITTY"" has two T's. We can consider.

Alternatively, a simpler word: ""LIGHT""? L I G H T -> positions:1:L,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed, because T was at position 5 in ""moist"" and was wrong position. So avoid T at position 5.

Therefore, ""LIGHT"" is invalid.

Let's think of words where T isn't at the end and I isn't at position 3.

Perhaps ""THUMB""? T H U M B -> M is excluded? M from ""moist"" -> M is excluded? Yes, feedback M(x) so excluded. So no.

""QUILT""? Q U I L T -> Q and U? But Q is not very common. But positions: Q at1, U at2, I at3? But I at position 3, which we cannot. And also, we avoid.

""BUILT""? B U I L T -> U is allowed? B U I L T -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:T -> I at position 3? Not allowed. And T at position 5? Not allowed.

Again violates.

""TIGER"": E excluded.

""TIDAL"": T I D A L -> A excluded? A is excluded (""crane"" A(x)).

Think differently: Place I at position 1, or 4, and T at position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

For example: ""INPUT""? I N P U T -> N excluded? N from ""crane"" -> excluded.

Must avoid N.

Another one: ""PIVOT""? P I V O T -> O excluded? Yes.

""BUDGE""? No I or T.

Focus on words containing I and T.

List: 
- Position I: avoid 3. Position T: avoid 5.

Example word: ""KITTY""? K I T T Y -> positions:1:K,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> I at position 2 (ok), T at position 3 and 4? T not at 5, so ok.

Letters: K, I, T, T, Y. Excluded? K not excluded? Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S. K is allowed.

But ""KITTY"" might be acceptable? Meaning is familiar.

Another: ""DITTY"": D I T T Y -> similar: D, I, T, T, Y -> positions:1:D,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> same as above.

Also, avoid repeating T? But it might be necessary.

But we don't know if two Ts are allowed? We might find out.

Another word: ""WIDTH"": W I D T H -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H -> There! I at position 2 (not 3), T at position 4 (not 5). Perfect.

And letters: W, I, D, T, H -> all allowed? W not excluded? I and T must be in the word? D and H not excluded.

So ""WIDTH"" seems a valid choice.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" also: P, I, T, H, Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> I at position 2 (good), T at position 3 (any position except 5? So position 3 is new and untested, so ok? Yes, because feedback only restricts position 5 for T.

In ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong. But T could be correct at position 3 or 4? We don't know.

But in ""PITHY"", T is at position 3: which might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know, so it's safe to try.

However, in ""WIDTH"", T is at position 4, which is also new.

But we also get information about H and Y? Or D.

I think both are fine, but ""WIDTH"" places T at position 4, which is closer to the beginning? Doesn't matter.

Other option: ""HITCH"": H I T C H -> C excluded? Yes, C from ""crane"" excluded -> invalid.

""FIGHT"": F I G H T -> positions:1:F,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.

Invalid.

""BIGHT"": B I G H T -> T at 5: invalid.

So ""WIDTH"" seems strong: 
- Uses W, D, T, H (with I and T included). 
- Avoids forbidden letters. 
- Positions: I at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (not 5, allowed).

Similarly, ""PITHY"" is also: I at position 2, T at position 3 (not 5, allowed).

Which one to choose? Both introduce new letters: ""WIDTH"" has W,D,H; ""PITHY"" has P,H,Y.

We might also consider ""DUTY"" - but that's 4 letters.

Another word: ""TILDE"": T I L D E -> E excluded? From ""crane"" E(x), excluded.

""UTILE"": U T I L E -> E excluded.

Not valid.

So between ""WIDTH"" and ""PITHY"", both valid.

I think ""WIDTH"" is slightly better? Because it tests T at position 4, while ""PITHY"" tests T at position 3? But both positions are new.

Perhaps choose one arbitrarily.

Another candidate: ""KITHE""? Not common.

I think ""WIDTH"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm ""WIDTH"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning is the extent from side to side.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" is also valid.

I can pick ""WIDTH"" for variety? Or ""PITHY"" uses Y which is less common? Maybe ""WIDTH"" is better.

Remember that there are not many vowel options: U is available. In ""WIDTH"", the only vowel is I? I is considered a vowel. Similarly, in ""PITHY"", vowel is I? And Y acts as vowel sometimes.

But safe.

Alternatively, we might use U: let me see if there is a word with U, I, T.

For example, ""QUIET""? But E excluded? And Q? Not common.

""BUILD"": B U I L D -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:D -> I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3? So invalid because it would place I where we know it's wrong.

""GUILD"": same, I at position 3? Invalid.

So difficult to include U without placing I at position 3? But if we place U elsewhere? 

""TUBAL""? No I.

""TULIP"": T U L I P -> positions:1:T,5:P? I at position 4? that's position 4: T at1, U at2, L at3, I at4, P at5 -> T at position 1 (unrestricted), I at position 4 (not 3, so ok). And P at5? We haven't tested T at position1 or I at position4? Or P? U? L.

But letters: T U L I P -> no excluded letters? Excluded: C R A N E M O S? None are in TULIP? L and P are allowed? U is allowed.

So ""TULIP"" is: positions: T at1 (new), U at2, L at3, I at4 (allowed, since not position3), P at5.

And T at position1: we don't know if it's correct? Feedback only restricted T from position5? So T can be at position1.

Similarly, I at position4: should be fine.

Also, introduces U.

But T is in the word? Yes, we know T is in the word? But in ""TULIP"", T is at position1? We don't know if that's correct? But we test that way.

Compare to ""WIDTH"": 
- ""WIDTH"": positions T at4.
- ""TULIP"": positions T at1.

Which is better? We might get more information? Note that the feedback from ""moist"" said I is in wrong position? So when we place I at position4? Maybe it could be correct? Or we test a new spot.

Similarly, T at position1 or4.

But we have one more constraint: T is not at position5? But that's it.

I think either is fine.

But I recall that initial feedback had I? So we have I to place.

To save tries, perhaps ""WIDTH""? Let's proceed.

So I choose ""WIDTH"" as the next guess.Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded from the word).
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** showed that:
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with '-') 
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with '-') 
  - M, O, S are not in the word (excluded).

Therefore:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- **Included letters**: I and T must be in the word, but:
  - I cannot be placed in position 3.
  - T cannot be placed in position 5.

For the next guess:

- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, H, W, G, L, U, P).
- Avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, as there's no evidence of duplicates.

A strong candidate is **""WIDTH""**:

  - I (in word, not position 3) at position 2 
  - D (unknown) at position 3
  - T (in word, not position 5) at position 4

- This tests I at position 2 (a new and safe position) and T at position 4 (safe per feedback).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ditty,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"" with all letters marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We must choose a new guess that avoids these letters. We should pick a word with common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, U (since A and E are eliminated, and sometimes Y but let's focus on the main ones)
Common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

We want to maximize the information we get, so we should use a word with as many new common letters as possible.

Some good candidates: 
- ""MOIST"" (contains M, O, I, S, T) - these are common letters.
- ""POUCH"" (but C is already excluded, so avoid that) -> ""crane"" had C and we know C is excluded so we avoid C.

Since C, R, A, N, E are excluded, we must avoid them in the next guess.

Let me think of a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words:
- ""GHOUL"" but has 5 letters? G, H, O, U, L -> 5 letters. But U is less common.
- ""SLIPT"" - not a common word, better to stick with common words.
- ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S.

Alternatively, ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D -> all common.

Another option: ""PILOT"" - P, I, L, O, T.

But let me check: we have eliminated 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Aim for high frequency letters: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, etc.

I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T.

Other good words: ""BLIMP"" (but B and M and P, but limited vowels), ""SHOUT"" (S, H, O, U, T) but U is less common.

Since the secret word has none of the letters in ""crane"", we have a lot of possibilities.

I'll go with ""MOIST"".

So the next guess is ""moist"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as ""x""), we know the secret word contains none of the letters: **C, R, A, N, E**. 

For the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested to maximize information gain (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, M, P, D**).
- Choose a word with diverse vowels/consonants to cover new ground.

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""**, which uses new common letters: M, O, I, S, T. This covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), providing broad coverage to refine future guesses.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all x: C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(-)

Feedback interpretation for ""moist"":
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked as '-'). So 'I' is present, but not at the 3rd position.
- T is in the word but not at the 5th position (marked as '-'). So 'T' is present, but not at the end.
- M, O, S are not in the word. So we also add M, O, S to the exclusion list.

So, excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

And we know the word contains:
- I (but not in position 3)
- T (but not in position 5)

Also, since I and T are present, we must include them in the next guess.

Reminder: We have 6 tries, so we are on our third try.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Must include both I and T (since they are in the word).
- Must not use any excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- The position of I cannot be position 3 (since in ""moist"", I was at position 3 but was wrong position).
- Similarly, position of T cannot be position 5.

Let's list remaining possible letters. 
Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, but we'll consider only U for now as vowel, unless needed).
Consonants: We have B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, W, Y, etc.

We need to choose a word that has I and T, and three other letters from the available pool.

Possible positions for I: It cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But note, position 5 is marked for T, which is also not allowed. Similarly T cannot be at position 5.

But wait, the feedback says the letter I is present but not at position 3. Similarly, T is present but not at position 5.

So I can be at other positions: 1,2,4, or 5? However, note the word must have exactly the letters; we don't know the count. But since I is only marked once, we assume at least one I.

Similarly for T.

However, we must avoid positions that are known to be incorrect for these letters.

But for I: it cannot be placed at position 3. For T: it cannot be placed at position 5.

We have to place I and T in the next word at other positions.

We need to think of words that contain I and T, without using excluded letters.

Excluded: C R A N E M O S

So allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I is already included).

But we don't have many vowels: U is the main vowel available? We also have Y which can be a vowel.

Common words with I and T: e.g., ""TIGHT"", ""LIGHT"", ""PITHY"", ""BIDET"", ""GUILT"", etc.

Let's list:

- ""GUILT"" -> G, U, I, L, T. Allowed? G, U, I, L, T. None excluded, but we have to check positions.

But we don't know about positions for I and T? We only know I cannot be at position 3? In ""GUILT"", let's see positions: 
Position 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: T.

We tried I at position 3, which was wrong position. But in ""GUILT"", I is also at position 3. So according to feedback, the secret word does not have I at position 3. So we cannot place I in position 3 again.

Therefore, ""GUILT"" is invalid because it has I at position 3.

Similarly, words with I at position 3: avoid.

We need a word with I not at position 3 and T not at position 5.

Example: Think of ""TIGER""? But E is excluded -> No.

""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> positions:1:B,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T. I at position 2? That's fine. T at position 5? But feedback says T is not at position 5? Yes, because in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong position. So we must avoid T at position 5.

Therefore, in ""BIGHT"", T is at position 5, which we cannot use.

So avoid words with T at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot have T at the end.

Now, another word: ""PILOT""? But O is excluded, and S not in, but O is excluded -> invalid.

""DELTA""? D E L T A -> but E and A are excluded? A and E excluded -> invalid.

We need to form words without E,A, etc.

Another one: ""TWIXT""? Not common, and might not be valid.

""THICK"": T H I C K -> C excluded.

""LITHO"": L I T H O -> O excluded.

""WIGHT"": W I G H T -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.

""WITHY"": W I T H Y -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> T at position 3? That is acceptable because feedback only restricts T from position 5, not position 3.

Similarly, I at position 2: acceptable because I cannot be at position 3? Position 2 is allowed for I.

So ""WITHY"" is: W-I-T-H-Y -> letters: W, I, T, H, Y -> all allowed? W, I, T, H, Y: no exclusions? Excluded: C R A N E M O S. Yes, none of these. And Y is allowed.

Also, positions: 
- I is at position 2 (not position 3, so ok)
- T is at position 3 (not position 5, so ok)

So ""WITHY"" is a word? Meaning is a type of willow, but it might be accepted in word games. We can check if it's acceptable.

Another option: ""PITHY"": P I T H Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> again, I at 2, T at 3? T at position 3? Not position 5, so ok. ""PITHY"" means concise and meaningful.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" uses P, I, T, H, Y -> allowed letters.

But we don't know if H or Y are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

Another word: ""BITTY""? B I T T Y -> but this has two T's? Feedback from ""moist"" showed T was present once, but we don't know if multiple? Actually, in ""moist"" we guessed one T and it was present, but if it can be multiple? We don't know. But ""BITTY"" has two T's, which might be acceptable.

Positions: B at1, I at2, T at3, T at4, Y at5 -> I at position 2 (ok), but T at positions 3 and 4? But feedback only said T not in position 5? So T can be in any position except 5? Yes.

But we have T at 3 and 4? Allowed? However, if the word has only one T, then one T might be wrong? But we don't know the count. So it's safer to use one T until we know.

But ""BITTY"" has two T's. We can consider.

Alternatively, a simpler word: ""LIGHT""? L I G H T -> positions:1:L,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed, because T was at position 5 in ""moist"" and was wrong position. So avoid T at position 5.

Therefore, ""LIGHT"" is invalid.

Let's think of words where T isn't at the end and I isn't at position 3.

Perhaps ""THUMB""? T H U M B -> M is excluded? M from ""moist"" -> M is excluded? Yes, feedback M(x) so excluded. So no.

""QUILT""? Q U I L T -> Q and U? But Q is not very common. But positions: Q at1, U at2, I at3? But I at position 3, which we cannot. And also, we avoid.

""BUILT""? B U I L T -> U is allowed? B U I L T -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:T -> I at position 3? Not allowed. And T at position 5? Not allowed.

Again violates.

""TIGER"": E excluded.

""TIDAL"": T I D A L -> A excluded? A is excluded (""crane"" A(x)).

Think differently: Place I at position 1, or 4, and T at position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

For example: ""INPUT""? I N P U T -> N excluded? N from ""crane"" -> excluded.

Must avoid N.

Another one: ""PIVOT""? P I V O T -> O excluded? Yes.

""BUDGE""? No I or T.

Focus on words containing I and T.

List: 
- Position I: avoid 3. Position T: avoid 5.

Example word: ""KITTY""? K I T T Y -> positions:1:K,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> I at position 2 (ok), T at position 3 and 4? T not at 5, so ok.

Letters: K, I, T, T, Y. Excluded? K not excluded? Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S. K is allowed.

But ""KITTY"" might be acceptable? Meaning is familiar.

Another: ""DITTY"": D I T T Y -> similar: D, I, T, T, Y -> positions:1:D,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> same as above.

Also, avoid repeating T? But it might be necessary.

But we don't know if two Ts are allowed? We might find out.

Another word: ""WIDTH"": W I D T H -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H -> There! I at position 2 (not 3), T at position 4 (not 5). Perfect.

And letters: W, I, D, T, H -> all allowed? W not excluded? I and T must be in the word? D and H not excluded.

So ""WIDTH"" seems a valid choice.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" also: P, I, T, H, Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> I at position 2 (good), T at position 3 (any position except 5? So position 3 is new and untested, so ok? Yes, because feedback only restricts position 5 for T.

In ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong. But T could be correct at position 3 or 4? We don't know.

But in ""PITHY"", T is at position 3: which might be correct? Or wrong? We don't know, so it's safe to try.

However, in ""WIDTH"", T is at position 4, which is also new.

But we also get information about H and Y? Or D.

I think both are fine, but ""WIDTH"" places T at position 4, which is closer to the beginning? Doesn't matter.

Other option: ""HITCH"": H I T C H -> C excluded? Yes, C from ""crane"" excluded -> invalid.

""FIGHT"": F I G H T -> positions:1:F,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.

Invalid.

""BIGHT"": B I G H T -> T at 5: invalid.

So ""WIDTH"" seems strong: 
- Uses W, D, T, H (with I and T included). 
- Avoids forbidden letters. 
- Positions: I at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (not 5, allowed).

Similarly, ""PITHY"" is also: I at position 2, T at position 3 (not 5, allowed).

Which one to choose? Both introduce new letters: ""WIDTH"" has W,D,H; ""PITHY"" has P,H,Y.

We might also consider ""DUTY"" - but that's 4 letters.

Another word: ""TILDE"": T I L D E -> E excluded? From ""crane"" E(x), excluded.

""UTILE"": U T I L E -> E excluded.

Not valid.

So between ""WIDTH"" and ""PITHY"", both valid.

I think ""WIDTH"" is slightly better? Because it tests T at position 4, while ""PITHY"" tests T at position 3? But both positions are new.

Perhaps choose one arbitrarily.

Another candidate: ""KITHE""? Not common.

I think ""WIDTH"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm ""WIDTH"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning is the extent from side to side.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" is also valid.

I can pick ""WIDTH"" for variety? Or ""PITHY"" uses Y which is less common? Maybe ""WIDTH"" is better.

Remember that there are not many vowel options: U is available. In ""WIDTH"", the only vowel is I? I is considered a vowel. Similarly, in ""PITHY"", vowel is I? And Y acts as vowel sometimes.

But safe.

Alternatively, we might use U: let me see if there is a word with U, I, T.

For example, ""QUIET""? But E excluded? And Q? Not common.

""BUILD"": B U I L D -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:D -> I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3? So invalid because it would place I where we know it's wrong.

""GUILD"": same, I at position 3? Invalid.

So difficult to include U without placing I at position 3? But if we place U elsewhere? 

""TUBAL""? No I.

""TULIP"": T U L I P -> positions:1:T,5:P? I at position 4? that's position 4: T at1, U at2, L at3, I at4, P at5 -> T at position 1 (unrestricted), I at position 4 (not 3, so ok). And P at5? We haven't tested T at position1 or I at position4? Or P? U? L.

But letters: T U L I P -> no excluded letters? Excluded: C R A N E M O S? None are in TULIP? L and P are allowed? U is allowed.

So ""TULIP"" is: positions: T at1 (new), U at2, L at3, I at4 (allowed, since not position3), P at5.

And T at position1: we don't know if it's correct? Feedback only restricted T from position5? So T can be at position1.

Similarly, I at position4: should be fine.

Also, introduces U.

But T is in the word? Yes, we know T is in the word? But in ""TULIP"", T is at position1? We don't know if that's correct? But we test that way.

Compare to ""WIDTH"": 
- ""WIDTH"": positions T at4.
- ""TULIP"": positions T at1.

Which is better? We might get more information? Note that the feedback from ""moist"" said I is in wrong position? So when we place I at position4? Maybe it could be correct? Or we test a new spot.

Similarly, T at position1 or4.

But we have one more constraint: T is not at position5? But that's it.

I think either is fine.

But I recall that initial feedback had I? So we have I to place.

To save tries, perhaps ""WIDTH""? Let's proceed.

So I choose ""WIDTH"" as the next guess.Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded from the word).
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** showed that:
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with '-') 
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with '-') 
  - M, O, S are not in the word (excluded).

Therefore:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- **Included letters**: I and T must be in the word, but:
  - I cannot be placed in position 3.
  - T cannot be placed in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include I and T.
- Avoid positions known to be incorrect (I not position 3, T not position 5).
- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, H, W, G, L, U, P).
- Avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, as there's no evidence of duplicates.

A strong candidate is **""WIDTH""**:
- Positions: 
  - W (unknown) at position 1
  - I (in word, not position 3) at position 2 
  - D (unknown) at position 3
  - T (in word, not position 5) at position 4 
  - H (unknown) at position 5
- This tests I at position 2 (a new and safe position) and T at position 4 (safe per feedback).
- Replaces vowels/testing new consonant patterns.

""PITHY"" means concise and meaningful.\n\nSimilarly, ""PITHY"" uses P, I, T, H, Y -> allowed letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H or Y are in the word, but that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAnother word: ""BITTY""? B I T T Y -> but this has two T\'s? Feedback from ""moist"" showed T was present once, but we don\'t know if multiple? Actually, in ""moist"" we guessed one T and it was present, but if it can be multiple? We don\'t know. But ""BITTY"" has two T\'s, which might be acceptable.\n\nPositions: B at1, I at2, T at3, T at4, Y at5 -> I at position 2 (ok), but T at positions 3 and 4? But feedback only said T not in position 5? So T can be in any position except 5? Yes.\n\nBut we have T at 3 and 4? Allowed? However, if the word has only one T, then one T might be wrong? But we don\'t know the count. So it\'s safer to use one T until we know.\n\nBut ""BITTY"" has two T\'s. We can consider.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler word: ""LIGHT""? L I G H T -> positions:1:L,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed, because T was at position 5 in ""moist"" and was wrong position. So avoid T at position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""LIGHT"" is invalid.\n\nLet\'s think of words where T isn\'t at the end and I isn\'t at position 3.\n\nPerhaps ""THUMB""? T H U M B -> M is excluded? M from ""moist"" -> M is excluded? Yes, feedback M(x) so excluded. So no.\n\n""QUILT""? Q U I L T -> Q and U? But Q is not very common. But positions: Q at1, U at2, I at3? But I at position 3, which we cannot. And also, we avoid.\n\n""BUILT""? B U I L T -> U is allowed? B U I L T -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:T -> I at position 3? Not allowed. And T at position 5? Not allowed.\n\nAgain violates.\n\n""TIGER"": E excluded.\n\n""TIDAL"": T I D A L -> A excluded? A is excluded (""crane"" A(x)).\n\nThink differently: Place I at position 1, or 4, and T at position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\nFor example: ""INPUT""? I N P U T -> N excluded? N from ""crane"" -> excluded.\n\nMust avoid N.\n\nAnother one: ""PIVOT""? P I V O T -> O excluded? Yes.\n\n""BUDGE""? No I or T.\n\nFocus on words containing I and T.\n\nList: \n- Position I: avoid 3. Position T: avoid 5.\n\nExample word: ""KITTY""? K I T T Y -> positions:1:K,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> I at position 2 (ok), T at position 3 and 4? T not at 5, so ok.\n\nLetters: K, I, T, T, Y. Excluded? K not excluded? Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S. K is allowed.\n\nBut ""KITTY"" might be acceptable? Meaning is familiar.\n\nAnother: ""DITTY"": D I T T Y -> similar: D, I, T, T, Y -> positions:1:D,2:I,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> same as above.\n\nAlso, avoid repeating T? But it might be necessary.\n\nBut we don\'t know if two Ts are allowed? We might find out.\n\nAnother word: ""WIDTH"": W I D T H -> positions:1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H -> There! I at position 2 (not 3), T at position 4 (not 5). Perfect.\n\nAnd letters: W, I, D, T, H -> all allowed? W not excluded? I and T must be in the word? D and H not excluded.\n\nSo ""WIDTH"" seems a valid choice.\n\nSimilarly, ""PITHY"" also: P, I, T, H, Y -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:T,4:H,5:Y -> I at position 2 (good), T at position 3 (any position except 5? So position 3 is new and untested, so ok? Yes, because feedback only restricts position 5 for T.\n\nIn ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was wrong. But T could be correct at position 3 or 4? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""PITHY"", T is at position 3: which might be correct? Or wrong? We don\'t know, so it\'s safe to try.\n\nHowever, in ""WIDTH"", T is at position 4, which is also new.\n\nBut we also get information about H and Y? Or D.\n\nI think both are fine, but ""WIDTH"" places T at position 4, which is closer to the beginning? Doesn\'t matter.\n\nOther option: ""HITCH"": H I T C H -> C excluded? Yes, C from ""crane"" excluded -> invalid.\n\n""FIGHT"": F I G H T -> positions:1:F,2:I,3:G,4:H,5:T -> T at position 5? Not allowed.\n\nInvalid.\n\n""BIGHT"": B I G H T -> T at 5: invalid.\n\nSo ""WIDTH"" seems strong: \n- Uses W, D, T, H (with I and T included). \n- Avoids forbidden letters. \n- Positions: I at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (not 5, allowed).\n\nSimilarly, ""PITHY"" is also: I at position 2, T at position 3 (not 5, allowed).\n\nWhich one to choose? Both introduce new letters: ""WIDTH"" has W,D,H; ""PITHY"" has P,H,Y.\n\nWe might also consider ""DUTY"" - but that\'s 4 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TILDE"": T I L D E -> E excluded? From ""crane"" E(x), excluded.\n\n""UTILE"": U T I L E -> E excluded.\n\nNot valid.\n\nSo between ""WIDTH"" and ""PITHY"", both valid.\n\nI think ""WIDTH"" is slightly better? Because it tests T at position 4, while ""PITHY"" tests T at position 3? But both positions are new.\n\nPerhaps choose one arbitrarily.\n\nAnother candidate: ""KITHE""? Not common.\n\nI think ""WIDTH"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm ""WIDTH"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning is the extent from side to side.\n\nSimilarly, ""PITHY"" is also valid.\n\nI can pick ""WIDTH"" for variety? Or ""PITHY"" uses Y which is less common? Maybe ""WIDTH"" is better.\n\nRemember that there are not many vowel options: U is available. In ""WIDTH"", the only vowel is I? I is considered a vowel. Similarly, in ""PITHY"", vowel is I? And Y acts as vowel sometimes.\n\nBut safe.\n\nAlternatively, we might use U: let me see if there is a word with U, I, T.\n\nFor example, ""QUIET""? But E excluded? And Q? Not common.\n\n""BUILD"": B U I L D -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:D -> I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3? So invalid because it would place I where we know it\'s wrong.\n\n""GUILD"": same, I at position 3? Invalid.\n\nSo difficult to include U without placing I at position 3? But if we place U elsewhere? \n\n""TUBAL""? No I.\n\n""TULIP"": T U L I P -> positions:1:T,5:P? I at position 4? that\'s position 4: T at1, U at2, L at3, I at4, P at5 -> T at position 1 (unrestricted), I at position 4 (not 3, so ok). And P at5? We haven\'t tested T at position1 or I at position4? Or P? U? L.\n\nBut letters: T U L I P -> no excluded letters? Excluded: C R A N E M O S? None are in TULIP? L and P are allowed? U is allowed.\n\nSo ""TULIP"" is: positions: T at1 (new), U at2, L at3, I at4 (allowed, since not position3), P at5.\n\nAnd T at position1: we don\'t know if it\'s correct? Feedback only restricted T from position5? So T can be at position1.\n\nSimilarly, I at position4: should be fine.\n\nAlso, introduces U.\n\nBut T is in the word? Yes, we know T is in the word? But in ""TULIP"", T is at position1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? But we test that way.\n\nCompare to ""WIDTH"": \n- ""WIDTH"": positions T at4.\n- ""TULIP"": positions T at1.\n\nWhich is better? We might get more information? Note that the feedback from ""moist"" said I is in wrong position? So when we place I at position4? Maybe it could be correct? Or we test a new spot.\n\nSimilarly, T at position1 or4.\n\nBut we have one more constraint: T is not at position5? But that\'s it.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut I recall that initial feedback had I? So we have I to place.\n\nTo save tries, perhaps ""WIDTH""? Let\'s proceed.\n\nSo I choose ""WIDTH"" as the next guess.Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded from the word).\n- **Guess 2: ""moist""** showed that:\n  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with \'-\') \n  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with \'-\') \n  - M, O, S are not in the word (excluded).\n\nTherefore:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.\n- **Included letters**: I and T must be in the word, but:\n  - I cannot be placed in position 3.\n  - T cannot be placed in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include I and T.\n- Avoid positions known to be incorrect (I not position 3, T not position 5).\n- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, H, W, G, L, U, P).\n- Avoid repeating letters unnecessarily, as there\'s no evidence of duplicates.\n\nA strong candidate is **""WIDTH""**:\n- Positions: \n  - W (unknown) at position 1\n  - I (in word, not position 3) at position 2 \n  - D (unknown) at position 3\n  - T (in word, not position 5) at position 4 \n  - H (unknown) at position 5\n- This tests I at position 2 (a new and safe position) and T at position 4 (safe per feedback).\n- Replaces vowels/testing new consonant patterns.\n\n<guess>width</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: width -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) D(-) T(✓) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""width"":
- W(x): W is not in the word.
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- D(-): D is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(✓): T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- H(x): H is not in the word.

So, from this:
- We know the word has I at position 2 and T at position 4.
- D is in the word, but not at position 3.
- W and H are not in the word, so we add them to the exclusion list.

Now, let's update our information:

**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, W, H.  
**Included letters**:
- I is at position 2 (fixed).
- T is at position 4 (fixed).
- D is in the word, but not at position 3.

The word pattern so far: _ I _ T _

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.

Constraints:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not excluded and not D (because D is in the word but not at position 3, so it could be at 1 or 5? But note: D is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1 or 5? However, we have position 3 is not D, but it could be at 1 or 5? But we have to consider that D is present and must be placed in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5? But position 3 is already known to not be D (from feedback of ""width"", D at position 3 was wrong). So D must be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is also available? However, we have three positions: 1, 3, and 5. But D cannot be at position 3, so it must be at position 1 or 5.

Additionally, we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Available letters: We have to use D somewhere (at position 1 or 5), and the other two positions must be filled with letters not excluded and not I, T (which are already placed).

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, W, H.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, and possibly others, but we must include D.

But note: D is already in the word, so we must use it exactly once? We don't know if there are duplicates, but since it wasn't indicated, we assume one occurrence.

So the word must have D at either position 1 or position 5.

Now, position 3 must be filled with a letter that is not D and not excluded.

Possible words:

Case 1: D at position 1
- Then the word is: D I _ T _
- Position 3: must be a letter not excluded and not D (since D is at 1, and we assume one D? But if D is at 1, then position 3 cannot be D anyway). So position 3: B, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Position 5: must be a letter not excluded and not D? But D is at 1, so position 5 is a different letter? But we have to use D only once? So position 5 is a new letter.

But wait, we don't have to use D again? D is already placed at position 1? Then position 5 is free? But we know D is in the word, and if it's at position 1, then we don't need to put it again? So position 5 is a different letter.

Similarly, if D is at position 5, then the word is: _ I _ T D, and position 1 and 3 are other letters.

But we also have the constraint that D is not at position 3, which is already satisfied.

Now, we need to think of actual words that fit.

First, if D is at position 1: words like ""DI?T?"" 
- Examples: ""DITTO"" -> but O is excluded? O from ""moist"" is excluded -> invalid.
- ""DITTY"": D I T T Y -> but we have T at position 4? In ""DITTY"", positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we need T at position 4? Here position 4 is T, which is correct? But position 3 is also T? And we have I at position 2? So it matches the pattern? But we have two T's? And D at position 1? But the feedback from ""width"" had T at position 4 correct? And I at position 2 correct? And D present? But in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? And T at position 4? But also T at position 3? 

But let's check the feedback: in ""width"", we had T at position 4 marked correct? So in the secret word, position 4 is T. So in ""DITTY"", position 4 is T, which is correct? But position 3 is also T? That might be possible? But we don't know if the word has two T's? The feedback from ""moist"" had T at position 5 marked as wrong? But that doesn't tell about other positions? And in ""width"", T at position 4 is correct? So if the word has two T's, it's possible? But we haven't seen evidence? However, ""DITTY"" has Y at position 5? And we have to check if Y is allowed? Yes, not excluded.

But in ""DITTY"", the pattern is: D I T T Y -> positions: 
1: D (which we are considering for D at position 1)
2: I (correct)
3: T (but we don't know if T is at position 3? But we know T is at position 4? So if T is at position 3, that would be an additional T? But the secret word might have two T's? And position 4 is T? So position 3 could be T? But we have no feedback against T at position 3? Only that T is not at position 5? So it's possible? But in ""width"", we didn't test position 3? We tested D at position 3? But not T? So T at position 3 could be possible? 

But in ""DITTY"", we have T at position 3 and 4? And position 4 is fixed as T? So if we guess ""DITTY"", it might be valid? But we have to see if it fits the D constraint? D is at position 1? And we know D is in the word? So that's fine? But the feedback from ""width"" said D is in the word but not at position 3? So in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? Not 3? So that's consistent? And position 3 is T? Which is not D? So D is at 1? So it should be okay? But we have to check if the word is valid? ""DITTY"" is a word? Yes.

But let's see the fifth letter: Y? Not excluded? So it's possible.

But we have another case: D at position 5? Then the word is: _ I _ T D

Examples: ""LIT?D"" -> but we need a letter at position 3? ""LITHD""? Not a word? ""BITED""? But E excluded? ""PITHD""? Not a word? ""GIT?D"" -> ""GIVED""? E excluded? ""KITED""? E excluded? ""FIT?D"" -> ""FITUD""? Not a word? ""MIT?D"" -> M excluded? ""WITHD""? But W and H excluded? 

It's hard to find words ending with ""TD""? Not common? 

""BIT?D"" -> ""BITED"" E excluded? ""CITED"" C and E excluded? 

So probably D at position 5 is not common? 

Another possibility: ""DUTY"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

So perhaps D at position 1 is more likely? 

But we have the pattern: _ I _ T _

With D at position 1: D I ? T ?

We need to fill position 3 and 5? Position 3 cannot be D? And must be a letter not excluded? And position 5 must be a letter not excluded? And we don't have to use D again? 

So words: D I ? T ?

Possible: 
- ""DITTO"" -> O excluded? No.
- ""DITTY"" -> as above: D I T T Y -> but T at position 3? And T at position 4? So two T's? And Y at position 5? 
- ""DITAL"" -> A excluded? No.
- ""DITAS"" -> S excluded? No.
- ""DITES"" -> E excluded? No.
- ""DITSY"" -> D I T S Y -> S excluded? S from ""moist"" is excluded? So invalid? 
- ""DITCH"" -> C and H excluded? C and H? H is excluded? From ""width"" H(x)? So H excluded? 
- ""DITTO"" and ""DITTY"" are the main ones? But ""DITTO"" has O excluded? So only ""DITTY"" seems possible? 

But ""DITTY"" has S? No, ""DITTY"" is D-I-T-T-Y? No S? 

But we have to check: in ""DITTY"", the letters are D, I, T, T, Y? So no S? So it should be allowed? 

But we have excluded S? Yes, S is excluded? But ""DITTY"" doesn't have S? So it's fine? 

But is there another word? 

What about ""DIGHT""? D I G H T -> but H excluded? H is excluded? From ""width"" H(x)? So H not in word? So ""DIGHT"" has H? Invalid? 

""DIKED""? E excluded? 

""DIALS""? A and S excluded? 

So ""DITTY"" seems a candidate? 

But we have another possibility: D at position 5? 

If D at position 5: ? I ? T D

Words: 
- ""LITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""MITED"" -> M excluded? 
- ""BITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""VIT?D"" -> ""VITAD""? Not a word? 
- ""PIT?D"" -> ""PITAD""? No? 
- ""KITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""FITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""WITED"" -> W excluded? 
- ""GITED"" -> not a word? 

""GUITD""? Not a word? 

""QUITD""? Not a word? 

So it seems difficult? 

Another idea: ""DIVOT""? But O excluded? 

Perhaps ""DIGIT""? D I G I T -> but we have I at position 2? And position 4 is T? But in ""DIGIT"", positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:G, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need position 4 to be T? But in ""DIGIT"", position 4 is I? And position 5 is T? So it doesn't match? Because we need position 4 to be T? 

So not? 

Therefore, the only candidate seems to be ""DITTY""? 

But in ""DITTY"", we have:
- Position 1: D -> which is in the word? And we are placing it at position 1? 
- Position 2: I -> correct? 
- Position 3: T -> but we know T is at position 4? So if the word has two T's? Then position 3 can be T? 
- Position 4: T -> correct? 
- Position 5: Y? 

But we have feedback that D is in the word? But not at position 3? So if we place D at position 1? That's fine? 

But we also have to consider that in ""width"", we had D at position 3? Which was wrong? But in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? So it's a different position? 

But the issue is: does the secret word have two T's? We don't know? But it's possible? 

Another candidate: what if D is at position 5? And we have a word like ""LIGHT""? But H excluded? 

""BIGHT""? But H? Excluded? 

""FIGHT""? F I G H T -> H excluded? 

""TIGHT""? T I G H T -> but position 1 is T? But we have position 4 is T? And position 1 would be T? So two T's? But also H excluded? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""PILOT""? But O excluded? 

I think ""DITTY"" is the only common word that fits? 

But let's think of words with D at position 1 and the pattern D I ? T ? 

With ? at position 3 and 5? 

Position 3: must be a letter? We have T at position 3 in ""DITTY""? But we can have other letters? 

For example, ""DILT""? Not 5 letters? 

""DIOTA""? O and A excluded? 

""DICTA""? C and A excluded? 

""DIVOT""? O excluded? 

So really, ""DITTY"" seems the only option? 

But we have to consider that position 3 might not be T? 

What about ""DIZZY""? D I Z Z Y -> but Z? Not common? And we don't know? 

""DIFFY""? Not a word? 

""DIKEY""? E? Excluded? 

So I think ""DITTY"" is the best guess? 

But we have to check the feedback: in ""width"", we had D marked as present but wrong position? So if we place D at position 1? That might be the correct position? 

Similarly, in ""DITTY"", we are placing D at position 1? So if it's correct? Then we get a ✓? 

But also, we are testing T at position 3? Which might be present? 

But we know T is at position 4? So if T is also at position 3? Then it's a duplicate? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""DITTO"" is not possible? O excluded? 

So I think we should go with ""DITTY"". 

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,W,H? 

In ""DITTY"": D, I, T, T, Y? None of these are excluded? I and T are already known? D is known to be present? Y is not excluded? 

So it should be valid? 

Perhaps ""DUTTY""? But U? D U T T Y? But positions: 1:D, 2:U? But we need position 2 to be I? So not? 

No, position 2 must be I? 

So only ""DITTY"" fits? 

Therefore, I guess ""DITTY"". 

But we have to make sure about the position of D? In ""width"", D was at position 3? And it was wrong? So in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? Which is different? So it could be correct? 

Similarly, the T at position 3? We haven't tested that position for T? So it might be correct? 

So let's go with that.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are excluded.  
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S excluded; I and T are in the word but not in positions 3 or 5, respectively.  
- **Guess 3: ""width""** → 
  - W and H excluded.  
  - I is correct at position 2 (✓).  
  - T is correct at position 4 (✓).  
  - D is in the word but not at position 3 (-).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Excluded letters (not in word)**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, W, H.  
- **Included letters**:  
  - I is fixed at position 2.  
  - T is fixed at position 4.  
  - D is present but cannot be at position 3.  
- **Word pattern**: `_ I _ T _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).  
- D must appear in position 1 or 5 (since it cannot be in position 3 and is not placed elsewhere).  
- Available letters (not excluded): B, D, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.  

### Deductions:
- Position 1 must be D or another letter (if D is at position 5).  
- Position 3 cannot be D and must be a new letter.  
- Position 5 must be D (if not at position 1) or another letter.  
- After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""DITTY"", ""DITTO"", ""DIGHT"", ""TILED""), only **""DITTY""** fits all constraints:  
  - Pattern: `D I T T Y` → Matches `_ I _ T _` with D at position 1 and Y at position 5.  
  - D is placed at position 1 (consistent with feedback: D not at position 3).  
  - T at position 3 is allowed (no prior feedback on T at position 3; only position 5 was invalid).  
  - All letters (D, I, T, T, Y) are not excluded.  
- ""DITTY"" tests:  
  - D at position 1 (could be correct or reveal new info).  
  - T at position 3 (new position, may be correct if word has two T's).  
  - Y at position 5 (new letter).  

<guess>ditty</guess>",ditty,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""width"":
- W(x): W is not in the word.
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- D(-): D is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(✓): T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- H(x): H is not in the word.

So, from this:
- We know the word has I at position 2 and T at position 4.
- D is in the word, but not at position 3.
- W and H are not in the word, so we add them to the exclusion list.

Now, let's update our information:

**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, W, H.  
**Included letters**:
- I is at position 2 (fixed).
- T is at position 4 (fixed).
- D is in the word, but not at position 3.

The word pattern so far: _ I _ T _

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.

Constraints:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not excluded and not D (because D is in the word but not at position 3, so it could be at 1 or 5? But note: D is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1 or 5? However, we have position 3 is not D, but it could be at 1 or 5? But we have to consider that D is present and must be placed in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5? But position 3 is already known to not be D (from feedback of ""width"", D at position 3 was wrong). So D must be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is also available? However, we have three positions: 1, 3, and 5. But D cannot be at position 3, so it must be at position 1 or 5.

Additionally, we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Available letters: We have to use D somewhere (at position 1 or 5), and the other two positions must be filled with letters not excluded and not I, T (which are already placed).

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, W, H.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, and possibly others, but we must include D.

But note: D is already in the word, so we must use it exactly once? We don't know if there are duplicates, but since it wasn't indicated, we assume one occurrence.

So the word must have D at either position 1 or position 5.

Now, position 3 must be filled with a letter that is not D and not excluded.

Possible words:

Case 1: D at position 1
- Then the word is: D I _ T _
- Position 3: must be a letter not excluded and not D (since D is at 1, and we assume one D? But if D is at 1, then position 3 cannot be D anyway). So position 3: B, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Position 5: must be a letter not excluded and not D? But D is at 1, so position 5 is a different letter? But we have to use D only once? So position 5 is a new letter.

But wait, we don't have to use D again? D is already placed at position 1? Then position 5 is free? But we know D is in the word, and if it's at position 1, then we don't need to put it again? So position 5 is a different letter.

Similarly, if D is at position 5, then the word is: _ I _ T D, and position 1 and 3 are other letters.

But we also have the constraint that D is not at position 3, which is already satisfied.

Now, we need to think of actual words that fit.

First, if D is at position 1: words like ""DI?T?"" 
- Examples: ""DITTO"" -> but O is excluded? O from ""moist"" is excluded -> invalid.
- ""DITTY"": D I T T Y -> but we have T at position 4? In ""DITTY"", positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we need T at position 4? Here position 4 is T, which is correct? But position 3 is also T? And we have I at position 2? So it matches the pattern? But we have two T's? And D at position 1? But the feedback from ""width"" had T at position 4 correct? And I at position 2 correct? And D present? But in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? And T at position 4? But also T at position 3? 

But let's check the feedback: in ""width"", we had T at position 4 marked correct? So in the secret word, position 4 is T. So in ""DITTY"", position 4 is T, which is correct? But position 3 is also T? That might be possible? But we don't know if the word has two T's? The feedback from ""moist"" had T at position 5 marked as wrong? But that doesn't tell about other positions? And in ""width"", T at position 4 is correct? So if the word has two T's, it's possible? But we haven't seen evidence? However, ""DITTY"" has Y at position 5? And we have to check if Y is allowed? Yes, not excluded.

But in ""DITTY"", the pattern is: D I T T Y -> positions: 
1: D (which we are considering for D at position 1)
2: I (correct)
3: T (but we don't know if T is at position 3? But we know T is at position 4? So if T is at position 3, that would be an additional T? But the secret word might have two T's? And position 4 is T? So position 3 could be T? But we have no feedback against T at position 3? Only that T is not at position 5? So it's possible? But in ""width"", we didn't test position 3? We tested D at position 3? But not T? So T at position 3 could be possible? 

But in ""DITTY"", we have T at position 3 and 4? And position 4 is fixed as T? So if we guess ""DITTY"", it might be valid? But we have to see if it fits the D constraint? D is at position 1? And we know D is in the word? So that's fine? But the feedback from ""width"" said D is in the word but not at position 3? So in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? Not 3? So that's consistent? And position 3 is T? Which is not D? So D is at 1? So it should be okay? But we have to check if the word is valid? ""DITTY"" is a word? Yes.

But let's see the fifth letter: Y? Not excluded? So it's possible.

But we have another case: D at position 5? Then the word is: _ I _ T D

Examples: ""LIT?D"" -> but we need a letter at position 3? ""LITHD""? Not a word? ""BITED""? But E excluded? ""PITHD""? Not a word? ""GIT?D"" -> ""GIVED""? E excluded? ""KITED""? E excluded? ""FIT?D"" -> ""FITUD""? Not a word? ""MIT?D"" -> M excluded? ""WITHD""? But W and H excluded? 

It's hard to find words ending with ""TD""? Not common? 

""BIT?D"" -> ""BITED"" E excluded? ""CITED"" C and E excluded? 

So probably D at position 5 is not common? 

Another possibility: ""DUTY"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

So perhaps D at position 1 is more likely? 

But we have the pattern: _ I _ T _

With D at position 1: D I ? T ?

We need to fill position 3 and 5? Position 3 cannot be D? And must be a letter not excluded? And position 5 must be a letter not excluded? And we don't have to use D again? 

So words: D I ? T ?

Possible: 
- ""DITTO"" -> O excluded? No.
- ""DITTY"" -> as above: D I T T Y -> but T at position 3? And T at position 4? So two T's? And Y at position 5? 
- ""DITAL"" -> A excluded? No.
- ""DITAS"" -> S excluded? No.
- ""DITES"" -> E excluded? No.
- ""DITSY"" -> D I T S Y -> S excluded? S from ""moist"" is excluded? So invalid? 
- ""DITCH"" -> C and H excluded? C and H? H is excluded? From ""width"" H(x)? So H excluded? 
- ""DITTO"" and ""DITTY"" are the main ones? But ""DITTO"" has O excluded? So only ""DITTY"" seems possible? 

But ""DITTY"" has S? No, ""DITTY"" is D-I-T-T-Y? No S? 

But we have to check: in ""DITTY"", the letters are D, I, T, T, Y? So no S? So it should be allowed? 

But we have excluded S? Yes, S is excluded? But ""DITTY"" doesn't have S? So it's fine? 

But is there another word? 

What about ""DIGHT""? D I G H T -> but H excluded? H is excluded? From ""width"" H(x)? So H not in word? So ""DIGHT"" has H? Invalid? 

""DIKED""? E excluded? 

""DIALS""? A and S excluded? 

So ""DITTY"" seems a candidate? 

But we have another possibility: D at position 5? 

If D at position 5: ? I ? T D

Words: 
- ""LITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""MITED"" -> M excluded? 
- ""BITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""VIT?D"" -> ""VITAD""? Not a word? 
- ""PIT?D"" -> ""PITAD""? No? 
- ""KITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""FITED"" -> E excluded? 
- ""WITED"" -> W excluded? 
- ""GITED"" -> not a word? 

""GUITD""? Not a word? 

""QUITD""? Not a word? 

So it seems difficult? 

Another idea: ""DIVOT""? But O excluded? 

Perhaps ""DIGIT""? D I G I T -> but we have I at position 2? And position 4 is T? But in ""DIGIT"", positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:G, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need position 4 to be T? But in ""DIGIT"", position 4 is I? And position 5 is T? So it doesn't match? Because we need position 4 to be T? 

So not? 

Therefore, the only candidate seems to be ""DITTY""? 

But in ""DITTY"", we have:
- Position 1: D -> which is in the word? And we are placing it at position 1? 
- Position 2: I -> correct? 
- Position 3: T -> but we know T is at position 4? So if the word has two T's? Then position 3 can be T? 
- Position 4: T -> correct? 
- Position 5: Y? 

But we have feedback that D is in the word? But not at position 3? So if we place D at position 1? That's fine? 

But we also have to consider that in ""width"", we had D at position 3? Which was wrong? But in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? So it's a different position? 

But the issue is: does the secret word have two T's? We don't know? But it's possible? 

Another candidate: what if D is at position 5? And we have a word like ""LIGHT""? But H excluded? 

""BIGHT""? But H? Excluded? 

""FIGHT""? F I G H T -> H excluded? 

""TIGHT""? T I G H T -> but position 1 is T? But we have position 4 is T? And position 1 would be T? So two T's? But also H excluded? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""PILOT""? But O excluded? 

I think ""DITTY"" is the only common word that fits? 

But let's think of words with D at position 1 and the pattern D I ? T ? 

With ? at position 3 and 5? 

Position 3: must be a letter? We have T at position 3 in ""DITTY""? But we can have other letters? 

For example, ""DILT""? Not 5 letters? 

""DIOTA""? O and A excluded? 

""DICTA""? C and A excluded? 

""DIVOT""? O excluded? 

So really, ""DITTY"" seems the only option? 

But we have to consider that position 3 might not be T? 

What about ""DIZZY""? D I Z Z Y -> but Z? Not common? And we don't know? 

""DIFFY""? Not a word? 

""DIKEY""? E? Excluded? 

So I think ""DITTY"" is the best guess? 

But we have to check the feedback: in ""width"", we had D marked as present but wrong position? So if we place D at position 1? That might be the correct position? 

Similarly, in ""DITTY"", we are placing D at position 1? So if it's correct? Then we get a ✓? 

But also, we are testing T at position 3? Which might be present? 

But we know T is at position 4? So if T is also at position 3? Then it's a duplicate? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""DITTO"" is not possible? O excluded? 

So I think we should go with ""DITTY"". 

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,W,H? 

In ""DITTY"": D, I, T, T, Y? None of these are excluded? I and T are already known? D is known to be present? Y is not excluded? 

So it should be valid? 

Perhaps ""DUTTY""? But U? D U T T Y? But positions: 1:D, 2:U? But we need position 2 to be I? So not? 

No, position 2 must be I? 

So only ""DITTY"" fits? 

Therefore, I guess ""DITTY"". 

But we have to make sure about the position of D? In ""width"", D was at position 3? And it was wrong? So in ""DITTY"", D is at position 1? Which is different? So it could be correct? 

Similarly, the T at position 3? We haven't tested that position for T? So it might be correct? 

So let's go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are excluded.  
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → M, O, S excluded; I and T are in the word but not in positions 3 or 5, respectively.  
- **Guess 3: ""width""** → 
  - W and H excluded.  
  - I is correct at position 2 (✓).  
  - T is correct at position 4 (✓).  
  - D is in the word but not at position 3 (-).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Excluded letters (not in word)**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, W, H.  
- **Included letters**:  
  - I is fixed at position 2.  
  - T is fixed at position 4.  
  - D is present but cannot be at position 3.  
- **Word pattern**: `_ I _ T _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).  
- D must appear in position 1 or 5 (since it cannot be in position 3 and is not placed elsewhere).  
- Available letters (not excluded): B, D, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, Y, etc.  

### Deductions:
- Position 1 must be D or another letter (if D is at position 5).  
- Position 3 cannot be D and must be a new letter.  
- Position 5 must be D (if not at position 1) or another letter.  
- After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""DITTY"", ""DITTO"", ""DIGHT"", ""TILED""), only **""DITTY""** fits all constraints:  
  - Pattern: `D I T T Y` → Matches `_ I _ T _` with D at position 1 and Y at position 5.  
  - D is placed at position 1 (consistent with feedback: D not at position 3).  
  - T at position 3 is allowed (no prior feedback on T at position 3; only position 5 was invalid).  
  - All letters (D, I, T, T, Y) are not excluded.  
- ""DITTY"" tests:  
  - D at position 1 (could be correct or reveal new info).  
  - T at position 3 (new position, may be correct if word has two T's).  
  - Y at position 5 (new letter).",Guess 4: ditty -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
