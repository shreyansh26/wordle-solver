We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"" (which were positions 2 and 3? Let's clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Additionally, we don't know the positions of R and A yet.

 We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.

 We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.

 Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

 The vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.

 Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.

 How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?

 Example: Let's try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don't know.

 We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.

 Consider the word ""PARTY"":
 - P, A, R, T, Y
 Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.

 But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":
   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.

 However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:

 In ""crane"": 
   Position 1: C -> x (not present)
   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> x

 So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.

 Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.

 Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".

 Alternatively, we can think of words that don't put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That's different.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn't forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.

 So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.

 However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.

 Actually, we have:
 - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got '-', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.

 Now, let's see in the word ""party"":
   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don't know.
   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that's allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.
   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that's allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:
   R at position 1? That's allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn't there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that 'S' and 'T' haven't been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven't tried S? So that's good? Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters? 

 But in ""ROAST"": 
   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that's good? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? 
   Position 2: O -> New letter?
   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it's the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That's invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that's a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That's why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":
   A is at position 2? Which hasn't been tested? 
   R is at position 3? Which hasn't been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don't have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? 

 Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don't know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? 
   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that's invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? 

 Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? 
   P, A, R, I, S? 
   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? 
   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that's allowed? 
   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? 
   We test new letters: P, I, S.

 However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? 

 But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it's a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? 

 Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? 

 But same issue? 

 How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? 
   But wait: R at position 1? That's not position 2? So allowed? 
   A at position 2? That's not position 3? So allowed? 
   Also, letters we haven't tried: I, L, S.

 But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? So that's a new position? 

 However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? 

 But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? 

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? 

 Let me list a few candidates: 
1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? 
   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? 

2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? 
   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? 
   A at 2: not position 3? Good? 

3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? 
   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)

 However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? 
 Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? 

 Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? 

 Let's see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? 

 Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? 

 So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? 

 Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? 

 But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don't know the positions? So which word to pick? 

 Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? 

 How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? 
   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that's bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it's wrong? So we shouldn't do that? 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? 

 So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? 

 Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That's fine? 

 However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? 

 Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""raspy"": 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? 
   R at 1? Not 2? Good? 
   A at 2? Not 3? Good? 
   But also tests S, P, Y? 

 However, we don't know about S? 

 But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? 

 Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? 

 But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? 

 Alternatively, we might get lucky? 

 So I will guess ""party"".

 Therefore, next guess: ""party""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).
- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.

For my next guess, I want to:
1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).
2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).
3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)
- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)
- Tests new letters: P, T, Y

<guess>party</guess>",party,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"" (which were positions 2 and 3? Let's clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Additionally, we don't know the positions of R and A yet.

 We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.

 We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.

 Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

 The vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.

 Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.

 How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?

 Example: Let's try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don't know.

 We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.

 Consider the word ""PARTY"":
 - P, A, R, T, Y
 Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.

 But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":
   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.

 However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:

 In ""crane"": 
   Position 1: C -> x (not present)
   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> x

 So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.

 Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.

 Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".

 Alternatively, we can think of words that don't put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That's different.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn't forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.

 So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.

 However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.

 Actually, we have:
 - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got '-', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.

 Now, let's see in the word ""party"":
   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don't know.
   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that's allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.
   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that's allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:
   R at position 1? That's allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn't there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that 'S' and 'T' haven't been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven't tried S? So that's good? Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters? 

 But in ""ROAST"": 
   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that's good? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? 
   Position 2: O -> New letter?
   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it's the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That's invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓?

Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that's a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That's why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":
   A is at position 2? Which hasn't been tested? 
   R is at position 3? Which hasn't been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don't have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? 

 Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don't know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? 
   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that's invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? 

 Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? 
   P, A, R, I, S? 
   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? 
   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that's allowed? 
   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? 
   We test new letters: P, I, S.

 However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? 

 But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it's a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? 

 Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? 

 But same issue? 

 How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? 
   But wait: R at position 1? That's not position 2? So allowed? 
   A at position 2? That's not position 3? So allowed? 
   Also, letters we haven't tried: I, L, S.

 But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? So that's a new position? 

 However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? 

 But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? 

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? 

 Let me list a few candidates: 
1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? 
   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? 

2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? 
   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? 
   A at 2: not position 3? Good? 

3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? 
   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)

 However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? 
 Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? 

 Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? 

 Let's see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? 

 Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? 

 So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? 

 Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? 

 But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don't know the positions? So which word to pick? 

 Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? 

 How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? 
   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that's bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it's wrong? So we shouldn't do that? 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? 

 So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? 

 Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That's fine? 

 However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? 

 Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""raspy"": 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? 
   R at 1? Not 2? Good? 
   A at 2? Not 3? Good? 
   But also tests S, P, Y? 

 However, we don't know about S? 

 But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? 

 Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? 

 But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? 

 Alternatively, we might get lucky? 

 So I will guess ""party"".

 Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).
- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.

For my next guess, I want to:
1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).
2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).
3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)
- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)
- Tests new letters: P, T, Y",Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"" (which were positions 2 and 3? Let's clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Additionally, we don't know the positions of R and A yet.

 We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.

 We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.

 Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

 The vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.

 Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.

 How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?

 Example: Let's try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don't know.

 We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.

 Consider the word ""PARTY"":
 - P, A, R, T, Y
 Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.

 But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":
   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.

 However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:

 In ""crane"": 
   Position 1: C -> x (not present)
   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> x

 So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.

 Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.

 Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".

 Alternatively, we can think of words that don't put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That's different.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn't forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.

 So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.

 However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.

 Actually, we have:
 - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got '-', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.

 Now, let's see in the word ""party"":
   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don't know.
   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that's allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.
   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that's allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:
   R at position 1? That's allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn't there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that 'S' and 'T' haven't been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven't tried S? So that's good? Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters? 

 But in ""ROAST"": 
   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that's good? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? 
   Position 2: O -> New letter?
   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it's the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That's invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that's a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That's why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":
   A is at position 2? Which hasn't been tested? 
   R is at position 3? Which hasn't been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don't have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? 

 Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don't know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? 
   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that's invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? 

 Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? 
   P, A, R, I, S? 
   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? 
   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that's allowed? 
   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? 
   We test new letters: P, I, S.

 However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? 

 But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it's a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? 

 Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? 

 But same issue? 

 How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? 
   But wait: R at position 1? That's not position 2? So allowed? 
   A at position 2? That's not position 3? So allowed? 
   Also, letters we haven't tried: I, L, S.

 But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? So that's a new position? 

 However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? 

 But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? 

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? 

 Let me list a few candidates: 
1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? 
   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? 

2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? 
   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? 
   A at 2: not position 3? Good? 

3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? 
   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)

 However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? 
 Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? 

 Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? 

 Let's see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? 

 Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? 

 So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? 

 Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? 

 But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don't know the positions? So which word to pick? 

 Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? 

 How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? 
   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that's bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it's wrong? So we shouldn't do that? 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? 

 So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? 

 Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That's fine? 

 However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? 

 Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""raspy"": 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? 
   R at 1? Not 2? Good? 
   A at 2? Not 3? Good? 
   But also tests S, P, Y? 

 However, we don't know about S? 

 But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? 

 Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? 

 But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? 

 Alternatively, we might get lucky? 

 So I will guess ""party"".

 Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).
- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.

For my next guess, I want to:
1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).
2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).
3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)
- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)
- Tests new letters: P, T, Y

Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got \'-\', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.\n\n Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.\n\n Now, let\'s see in the word ""party"":\n   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don\'t know.\n   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that\'s allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.\n   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that\'s allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.\n\n Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:\n   R at position 1? That\'s allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn\'t there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that \'S\' and \'T\' haven\'t been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven\'t tried S? So that\'s good? Actually, we haven\'t tested any of these letters? \n\n But in ""ROAST"": \n   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that\'s good? But we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? \n   Position 2: O -> New letter?\n   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it\'s the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That\'s invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that\'s a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That\'s why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":\n   A is at position 2? Which hasn\'t been tested? \n   R is at position 3? Which hasn\'t been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don\'t have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? \n\n Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don\'t know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? \n   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that\'s invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? \n\n Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? \n   P, A, R, I, S? \n   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? \n   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that\'s allowed? \n   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? \n   We test new letters: P, I, S.\n\n However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? \n\n But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it\'s a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? \n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? \n\n But same issue? \n\n How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? \n   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? \n   But wait: R at position 1? That\'s not position 2? So allowed? \n   A at position 2? That\'s not position 3? So allowed? \n   Also, letters we haven\'t tried: I, L, S.\n\n But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? So that\'s a new position? \n\n However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? \n\n But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? \n\n Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? \n\n Let me list a few candidates: \n1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? \n   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? \n\n2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? \n   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? \n   A at 2: not position 3? Good? \n\n3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? \n   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)\n\n However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? \n Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? \n\n Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? \n\n Let\'s see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? \n\n Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? \n\n So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? \n\n Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? \n\n But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don\'t know the positions? So which word to pick? \n\n Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? \n\n How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? \n   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that\'s bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it\'s wrong? So we shouldn\'t do that? \n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? \n\n So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? \n\n Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven\'t tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven\'t tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That\'s fine? \n\n However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? \n\n Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""raspy"": \n   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? \n   R at 1? Not 2? Good? \n   A at 2? Not 3? Good? \n   But also tests S, P, Y? \n\n However, we don\'t know about S? \n\n But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? \n\n Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? \n\n But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? \n\n Alternatively, we might get lucky? \n\n So I will guess ""party"".\n\n Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).\n- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.\n\nFor my next guess, I want to:\n1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).\n2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).\n3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""party"" fits these criteria:\n- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)\n- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)\n- Tests new letters: P, T, Y\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
  - C, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.

**Guess 2: party**
- Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(✓)
This means:
  - P and T are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""party"" A is the second letter).
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because feedback shows R(-)).
  - Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since in ""party"" Y is the fifth letter).

So, what we know now:
1. The secret word has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
   - Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ Y
2. We also know R is present but not in position 3 (since we have feedback R(-) at position 3). Moreover, we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2.
   - Since position 2 is A and position 5 is Y, R must be in either position 1 or position 4? Because positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? 
   - But note: position 2 is A? and position 5 is Y? So available positions for R are 1, 3, 4? But wait: we tried R at position 3 in ""party"" and got '-', meaning it is not at position 3? So R cannot be at position 3? 
   - Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 4? 
   - But also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2? and we know position 2 is now A? So R cannot be at position 2? That's already covered? and now we also know R not at position 3? 
   - So R must be at position 1 or position 4? 
3. We know the secret word contains R? Yes? 
4. Additionally, the secret word must not contain: C, P, T, N, E? And we have the letters known?

Also, we must consider: are there any other constraints? We have feedback only.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: could be R or something else? 
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: ??? (but cannot be R? because we tried R at position 3? So R not at 3? But what about other letters? 
  Position 4: Could be R? Or something else?
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the word pattern: [position1] A [position3] [position4] Y

And R must be either at position1 or position4? 

But note: what about other letters that might be present? We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are present? But already accounted? And others absent? 
- In guess2: P, A, R, T, Y -> A and Y present? And A and Y confirmed? R present? But P and T absent? 

Therefore, absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? 

So the letters we are avoiding: C, E, N, P, T? 

Now, we must form a word that: 
- has the format _ A _ _ Y
- contains R? which must be at position1 or position4? 
- and two more letters? at position3 and position4? OR if R is at position1? then position3 and position4? If R is at position4? then position1 and position3? 

Also, we don't know what other letters? But we must avoid the absent letters? 

So, we need to find a valid English word that matches: _ A _ _ Y? 

Moreover, since we have limited tries? we can guess a word that helps us narrow down? 

But note: we have 4 more tries? But let's try to guess one that covers the possibilities? 

Possibilities: 

Case 1: R at position1? Then word: R A _ _ Y? 
   Then we must choose letters for position3 and position4? Which are different? and not the absent ones? 

Case 2: R at position4? Then word: _ A _ R Y? 

Now, we have to choose a word? But note: the word must be 5 letters? 

Also, we don't have information about position3? So we need to guess a word that includes R in either position1 or position4? and also tests other letters? 

List possible words:

First, words with R at position1? 
   Format: R A _ _ Y? 
   Possible words: 
      RAINY? But N is absent? Not allowed? Because N was guessed and absent? 
      RALLY? But L at position3? and L at position4? And Y at end? Also, note 'A' at position2? 
      RALLY: letters R, A, L, L, Y? But duplicate L? But note: in the feedback? We haven't encountered duplicates? So possible? 

But we must check the absent letters: N, E, P, T? So RALLY? 
   Letters: R, A, L, L, Y -> none of C,E,N,P? But wait, absent are C, E, N, P, T? So L is okay? 
   But the word ""rally"" exists? 

Similarly, other words: 
   RABBY? Not a word? 
   RADLY? Not a word? 
   RAMMY? Not common? 
   How about ""RASPY""? But we know P is absent? So not? 
   ""RARLY""? Not a word? 
   ""RAVEL""? But E is absent? 
   So common words: RALLY, RABID? But B and D? ""RABID"" has B and D? Which we haven't tested? But D? 
   But wait: ""RABID"" has I at position4? and D at position5? But our pattern requires position5=Y? So it must end with Y? So no? 

Therefore, RALLY seems a candidate? 

Alternatively, words with R at position4? 
   Format: _ A _ R Y? 
   Possible words: 
      WARY? Not 5 letters? 
      CHARM? But C and H? C is absent? 
      CARVY? Not a word? 
      DAIRY? D, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, FAIRY? F, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, HAIRY? H, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, LAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, MAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, WAIRY? Not common? 
      So possible: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have two sets:
- RALLY: meaning R at position1? And L at position3 and4? 
- Or words like FAIRY, which have F at position1? I at position3? R at position4? 

But note: in FAIRY: position1=F, position2=A, position3=I, position4=R, position5=Y? 

But we must avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? So F, I, are okay? Because we haven't tested them? 

Therefore, we have multiple possibilities? 

But we need to choose a word that: 
   Is a candidate? Or we choose a word that can cover? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple letters? 

But note: we know A at 2 and Y at 5? So we must generate words accordingly? 

But we don't have to choose a candidate? We can choose any word? 

Also, we are limited by the absent letters? So we avoid using absent letters? 

We also want to test letters? 

But note: we have R that must be placed? 

Moreover, we already know R is somewhere? So if we put R at position1? Then we can test new letters? 

Similarly, if we put R at position4? We test the other? 

But we don't know which? 

Therefore, perhaps create a word that tests both? How? 

But we cannot? Because the pattern forces either R at1 or4? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that does not have R? But wait? no? because we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Because if we don't, we will get x for R? which would be confusing? But we know R is present? 

But we can? Actually, we are forced to include R? Because we know it must be in the word? 

But guess validation: the word must be valid? 

So, let's think: we can choose a word that has R? 

We can also choose a word that tests new letters? 

But we have tried: 
  Guess1: C, R, A, N, E? 
  Guess2: P, A, R, T, Y? 
So letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, Y? 

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But in the word? we know A and Y? So we are to fill positions1,3,4? 

And R? must be at position1 or position4? 

So: 
  If position1 is R? Then word: R A _ _ Y? Then we need two letters at position3 and position4? 
  If position4 is R? Then word: _ A _ R Y? Then we need positions1 and position3? 

Now, for the guess? we want to maximize information? So ideally choose a word that covers letters we haven't tested? 

But we have two distinct cases? 

So, how to resolve? 

We could choose a word like ""FAIRY"" if we think R is at position4? Or ""RALLY"" if we think R is at position1? 

But what if none? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't commit? But we have to include R? 

But let me see what common words exist? 

Pattern: R A _ _ Y -> possibilities? 
   RALLY? (L,L) -> duplicate? Note that feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? But possible? 
   RADII? But not ending with Y? 
   RADIO? Not ending with Y? 
   RANDY? But N and D? But N is absent? So no? 
   RAVIOLI? Too long? 
   So common: RALLY? 

Pattern: _ A _ R Y -> 
   Letters: ? A ? R Y? Then ? must be letters? 
   First letter: must be a consonant? Or vowel? 
   Common words: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have candidate words: FAIRY, HAIRY, DAIRY? RALLY? 

Note: in RALLY? There is double L? So it uses L? and we haven't tested L? 

In FAIRY? F and I? We haven't tested? 

Since we have no information? perhaps choose one? 

But we can also think of a word that doesn't fit either pattern? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A and Y at positions? 

So we must respect the pattern? 

Moreover, note: we have to avoid absent letters? 

Therefore, I propose to choose ""FAIRY"":

If we choose ""FAIRY"":
   Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
   Then, this would test:
      F: if present? But if we get F with ✓? Then we know? If F with - or x? 
      I: at position3? 
      R: at position4? We expect R at position4? so should be ✓? because we put R at a position that might be correct? 

But note: we are not sure? 

If the secret word is ""fairy""? Then we win? 

If not? Then we get feedback? 

Alternative: choose ""rally""?

If we choose ""RALLY"":
   Positions: R(1) A(2) L(3) L(4) Y(5)
   Then R at position1? We don't know if that's correct? 
   But also duplicate L? 

But the word ""rally"" is a word? 

However, we can choose a word that includes more new letters? 

Another candidate: ""MARVY""? But M, A, R, V, Y? Position: M(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5)? But wait: in feedback for party? R was at position3? And we got '-', meaning R is not at position3? So in ""MARVY"", R is at position3? Which we already know is incorrect? So it would get '-' for R? That doesn't add? 

Therefore, avoid putting R at position3? But in ""MARVY""? it would be at position3? So we know? don't? 

So, back? 

We have two possibilities: 
- If R is at position1: then words like RALLY? 
- If R is at position4: words like FAIRY? 

Now to decide? 

We can choose FAIRY? Because it uses F and I? which are common? 

Alternatively, choose ""HAIRY"" or ""DAIRY""? Same? 

But let me choose FAIRY? That way we test F and I? 

But if the word turns out to be RALLY? Then we get feedback? 

But we don't have more information? 

So yes? 

But we must include R? 

So FAIRY: includes R? 

Therefore, I will guess ""fairy"".

But note: in FAIRY? we are putting R at position4? which might be correct? If the secret word is fairy? Then done? 

If not? we get feedback? 

Therefore, guess: ""fairy""
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- From Guess 2 (""party""): P and T are absent. A is confirmed at position 2, and Y is confirmed at position 5. R is present but not at position 3.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word must have the format: `[?] A [?] [?] Y` (position 2 is A, position 5 is Y).
- R must be present and can only be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is occupied by A, and positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T (to be avoided in the new guess).
- Valid words must include R and fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters not yet tested or ruled out.

**Reasoning for this guess:**
To resolve the position of R (position 1 or 4) efficiently, we target common words fitting the pattern `[?] A [?] [?] Y`. Strong candidates include:
- **fairy**: Positional fit: `F A I R Y`. Tests F at position 1, I at position 3, and R at position 4. These are new letters, and R at position 4 could confirm a plausible candidate.
- Alternatives like ""dairy"", ""hairy"", ""rally"" were considered, but ""fairy"" uses common consonants (F, I) and maximizes new information.

If ""fairy"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on F, I, and R’s position will reduce possibilities significantly.

<guess>fairy</guess>",fairy,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
  - C, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.

**Guess 2: party**
- Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(✓)
This means:
  - P and T are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""party"" A is the second letter).
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because feedback shows R(-)).
  - Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since in ""party"" Y is the fifth letter).

So, what we know now:
1. The secret word has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
   - Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ Y
2. We also know R is present but not in position 3 (since we have feedback R(-) at position 3). Moreover, we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2.
   - Since position 2 is A and position 5 is Y, R must be in either position 1 or position 4? Because positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? 
   - But note: position 2 is A? and position 5 is Y? So available positions for R are 1, 3, 4? But wait: we tried R at position 3 in ""party"" and got '-', meaning it is not at position 3? So R cannot be at position 3? 
   - Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 4? 
   - But also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2? and we know position 2 is now A? So R cannot be at position 2? That's already covered? and now we also know R not at position 3? 
   - So R must be at position 1 or position 4? 
3. We know the secret word contains R? Yes? 
4. Additionally, the secret word must not contain: C, P, T, N, E? And we have the letters known?

Also, we must consider: are there any other constraints? We have feedback only.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: could be R or something else? 
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: ??? (but cannot be R? because we tried R at position 3? So R not at 3? But what about other letters? 
  Position 4: Could be R? Or something else?
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the word pattern: [position1] A [position3] [position4] Y

And R must be either at position1 or position4? 

But note: what about other letters that might be present? We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are present? But already accounted? And others absent? 
- In guess2: P, A, R, T, Y -> A and Y present? And A and Y confirmed? R present? But P and T absent? 

Therefore, absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? 

So the letters we are avoiding: C, E, N, P, T? 

Now, we must form a word that: 
- has the format _ A _ _ Y
- contains R? which must be at position1 or position4? 
- and two more letters? at position3 and position4? OR if R is at position1? then position3 and position4? If R is at position4? then position1 and position3? 

Also, we don't know what other letters? But we must avoid the absent letters? 

So, we need to find a valid English word that matches: _ A _ _ Y? 

Moreover, since we have limited tries? we can guess a word that helps us narrow down? 

But note: we have 4 more tries? But let's try to guess one that covers the possibilities? 

Possibilities: 

Case 1: R at position1? Then word: R A _ _ Y? 
   Then we must choose letters for position3 and position4? Which are different? and not the absent ones? 

Case 2: R at position4? Then word: _ A _ R Y? 

Now, we have to choose a word? But note: the word must be 5 letters? 

Also, we don't have information about position3? So we need to guess a word that includes R in either position1 or position4? and also tests other letters? 

List possible words:

First, words with R at position1? 
   Format: R A _ _ Y? 
   Possible words: 
      RAINY? But N is absent? Not allowed? Because N was guessed and absent? 
      RALLY? But L at position3? and L at position4? And Y at end? Also, note 'A' at position2? 
      RALLY: letters R, A, L, L, Y? But duplicate L? But note: in the feedback? We haven't encountered duplicates? So possible? 

But we must check the absent letters: N, E, P, T? So RALLY? 
   Letters: R, A, L, L, Y -> none of C,E,N,P? But wait, absent are C, E, N, P, T? So L is okay? 
   But the word ""rally"" exists? 

Similarly, other words: 
   RABBY? Not a word? 
   RADLY? Not a word? 
   RAMMY? Not common? 
   How about ""RASPY""? But we know P is absent? So not? 
   ""RARLY""? Not a word? 
   ""RAVEL""? But E is absent? 
   So common words: RALLY, RABID? But B and D? ""RABID"" has B and D? Which we haven't tested? But D? 
   But wait: ""RABID"" has I at position4? and D at position5? But our pattern requires position5=Y? So it must end with Y? So no? 

Therefore, RALLY seems a candidate? 

Alternatively, words with R at position4? 
   Format: _ A _ R Y? 
   Possible words: 
      WARY? Not 5 letters? 
      CHARM? But C and H? C is absent? 
      CARVY? Not a word? 
      DAIRY? D, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, FAIRY? F, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, HAIRY? H, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, LAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, MAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, WAIRY? Not common? 
      So possible: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have two sets:
- RALLY: meaning R at position1? And L at position3 and4? 
- Or words like FAIRY, which have F at position1? I at position3? R at position4? 

But note: in FAIRY: position1=F, position2=A, position3=I, position4=R, position5=Y? 

But we must avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? So F, I, are okay? Because we haven't tested them? 

Therefore, we have multiple possibilities? 

But we need to choose a word that: 
   Is a candidate? Or we choose a word that can cover? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple letters? 

But note: we know A at 2 and Y at 5? So we must generate words accordingly? 

But we don't have to choose a candidate? We can choose any word? 

Also, we are limited by the absent letters? So we avoid using absent letters? 

We also want to test letters? 

But note: we have R that must be placed? 

Moreover, we already know R is somewhere? So if we put R at position1? Then we can test new letters? 

Similarly, if we put R at position4? We test the other? 

But we don't know which? 

Therefore, perhaps create a word that tests both? How? 

But we cannot? Because the pattern forces either R at1 or4? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that does not have R? But wait? no? because we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Because if we don't, we will get x for R? which would be confusing? But we know R is present? 

But we can? Actually, we are forced to include R? Because we know it must be in the word? 

But guess validation: the word must be valid? 

So, let's think: we can choose a word that has R? 

We can also choose a word that tests new letters? 

But we have tried: 
  Guess1: C, R, A, N, E? 
  Guess2: P, A, R, T, Y? 
So letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, Y? 

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But in the word? we know A and Y? So we are to fill positions1,3,4? 

And R? must be at position1 or position4? 

So: 
  If position1 is R? Then word: R A _ _ Y? Then we need two letters at position3 and position4? 
  If position4 is R? Then word: _ A _ R Y? Then we need positions1 and position3? 

Now, for the guess? we want to maximize information? So ideally choose a word that covers letters we haven't tested? 

But we have two distinct cases? 

So, how to resolve? 

We could choose a word like ""FAIRY"" if we think R is at position4? Or ""RALLY"" if we think R is at position1? 

But what if none? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't commit? But we have to include R? 

But let me see what common words exist? 

Pattern: R A _ _ Y -> possibilities? 
   RALLY? (L,L) -> duplicate? Note that feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? But possible? 
   RADII? But not ending with Y? 
   RADIO? Not ending with Y? 
   RANDY? But N and D? But N is absent? So no? 
   RAVIOLI? Too long? 
   So common: RALLY? 

Pattern: _ A _ R Y -> 
   Letters: ? A ? R Y? Then ? must be letters? 
   First letter: must be a consonant? Or vowel? 
   Common words: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have candidate words: FAIRY, HAIRY, DAIRY? RALLY? 

Note: in RALLY? There is double L? So it uses L? and we haven't tested L? 

In FAIRY? F and I? We haven't tested? 

Since we have no information? perhaps choose one? 

But we can also think of a word that doesn't fit either pattern? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A and Y at positions? 

So we must respect the pattern? 

Moreover, note: we have to avoid absent letters? 

Therefore, I propose to choose ""FAIRY"":

If we choose ""FAIRY"":
   Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
   Then, this would test:
      F: if present? But if we get F with ✓? Then we know? If F with - or x? 
      I: at position3? 
      R: at position4? We expect R at position4? so should be ✓? because we put R at a position that might be correct? 

But note: we are not sure? 

If the secret word is ""fairy""? Then we win? 

If not? Then we get feedback? 

Alternative: choose ""rally""?

If we choose ""RALLY"":
   Positions: R(1) A(2) L(3) L(4) Y(5)
   Then R at position1? We don't know if that's correct? 
   But also duplicate L? 

But the word ""rally"" is a word? 

However, we can choose a word that includes more new letters? 

Another candidate: ""MARVY""? But M, A, R, V, Y? Position: M(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5)? But wait: in feedback for party? R was at position3? And we got '-', meaning R is not at position3? So in ""MARVY"", R is at position3? Which we already know is incorrect? So it would get '-' for R? That doesn't add? 

Therefore, avoid putting R at position3? But in ""MARVY""? it would be at position3? So we know? don't? 

So, back? 

We have two possibilities: 
- If R is at position1: then words like RALLY? 
- If R is at position4: words like FAIRY? 

Now to decide? 

We can choose FAIRY? Because it uses F and I? which are common? 

Alternatively, choose ""HAIRY"" or ""DAIRY""? Same? 

But let me choose FAIRY? That way we test F and I? 

But if the word turns out to be RALLY? Then we get feedback? 

But we don't have more information? 

So yes? 

But we must include R? 

So FAIRY: includes R? 

Therefore, I will guess ""fairy"".

But note: in FAIRY? we are putting R at position4? which might be correct? If the secret word is fairy? Then done? 

If not? we get feedback? 

Therefore, guess: ""fairy""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- From Guess 2 (""party""): P and T are absent. A is confirmed at position 2, and Y is confirmed at position 5. R is present but not at position 3.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word must have the format: `[?] A [?] [?] Y` (position 2 is A, position 5 is Y).
- R must be present and can only be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is occupied by A, and positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T (to be avoided in the new guess).
- Valid words must include R and fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters not yet tested or ruled out.

**Reasoning for this guess:**
To resolve the position of R (position 1 or 4) efficiently, we target common words fitting the pattern `[?] A [?] [?] Y`. Strong candidates include:
- **fairy**: Positional fit: `F A I R Y`. Tests F at position 1, I at position 3, and R at position 4. These are new letters, and R at position 4 could confirm a plausible candidate.
- Alternatives like ""dairy"", ""hairy"", ""rally"" were considered, but ""fairy"" uses common consonants (F, I) and maximizes new information.

If ""fairy"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on F, I, and R’s position will reduce possibilities significantly.",Guess 3: fairy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"" (which were positions 2 and 3? Let's clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Additionally, we don't know the positions of R and A yet.

 We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.

 We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.

 Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

 The vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.

 Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.

 How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?

 Example: Let's try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don't know.

 We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.

 Consider the word ""PARTY"":
 - P, A, R, T, Y
 Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.

 But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":
   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.

 However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:

 In ""crane"": 
   Position 1: C -> x (not present)
   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> x

 So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.

 Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.

 Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".

 Alternatively, we can think of words that don't put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That's different.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn't forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.

 So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.

 However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.

 Actually, we have:
 - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got '-', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.

 Now, let's see in the word ""party"":
   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don't know.
   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that's allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.
   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that's allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:
   R at position 1? That's allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn't there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that 'S' and 'T' haven't been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven't tried S? So that's good? Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters? 

 But in ""ROAST"": 
   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that's good? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? 
   Position 2: O -> New letter?
   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it's the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That's invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that's a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That's why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":
   A is at position 2? Which hasn't been tested? 
   R is at position 3? Which hasn't been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don't have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? 

 Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don't know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? 
   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that's invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? 

 Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? 
   P, A, R, I, S? 
   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? 
   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that's allowed? 
   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? 
   We test new letters: P, I, S.

 However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? 

 But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it's a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? 

 Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? 

 But same issue? 

 How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? 
   But wait: R at position 1? That's not position 2? So allowed? 
   A at position 2? That's not position 3? So allowed? 
   Also, letters we haven't tried: I, L, S.

 But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? So that's a new position? 

 However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? 

 But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? 

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? 

 Let me list a few candidates: 
1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? 
   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? 

2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? 
   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? 
   A at 2: not position 3? Good? 

3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? 
   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)

 However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? 
 Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? 

 Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? 

 Let's see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? 

 Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? 

 So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? 

 Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? 

 But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don't know the positions? So which word to pick? 

 Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? 

 How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? 
   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that's bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it's wrong? So we shouldn't do that? 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? 

 So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? 

 Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That's fine? 

 However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? 

 Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""raspy"": 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? 
   R at 1? Not 2? Good? 
   A at 2? Not 3? Good? 
   But also tests S, P, Y? 

 However, we don't know about S? 

 But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? 

 Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? 

 But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? 

 Alternatively, we might get lucky? 

 So I will guess ""party"".

 Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).
- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.

For my next guess, I want to:
1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).
2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).
3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)
- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)
- Tests new letters: P, T, Y

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
  - C, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.

**Guess 2: party**
- Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(✓)
This means:
  - P and T are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""party"" A is the second letter).
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because feedback shows R(-)).
  - Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since in ""party"" Y is the fifth letter).

So, what we know now:
1. The secret word has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
   - Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ Y
2. We also know R is present but not in position 3 (since we have feedback R(-) at position 3). Moreover, we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2.
   - Since position 2 is A and position 5 is Y, R must be in either position 1 or position 4? Because positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? 
   - But note: position 2 is A? and position 5 is Y? So available positions for R are 1, 3, 4? But wait: we tried R at position 3 in ""party"" and got '-', meaning it is not at position 3? So R cannot be at position 3? 
   - Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 4? 
   - But also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2? and we know position 2 is now A? So R cannot be at position 2? That's already covered? and now we also know R not at position 3? 
   - So R must be at position 1 or position 4? 
3. We know the secret word contains R? Yes? 
4. Additionally, the secret word must not contain: C, P, T, N, E? And we have the letters known?

Also, we must consider: are there any other constraints? We have feedback only.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: could be R or something else? 
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: ??? (but cannot be R? because we tried R at position 3? So R not at 3? But what about other letters? 
  Position 4: Could be R? Or something else?
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the word pattern: [position1] A [position3] [position4] Y

And R must be either at position1 or position4? 

But note: what about other letters that might be present? We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are present? But already accounted? And others absent? 
- In guess2: P, A, R, T, Y -> A and Y present? And A and Y confirmed? R present? But P and T absent? 

Therefore, absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? 

So the letters we are avoiding: C, E, N, P, T? 

Now, we must form a word that: 
- has the format _ A _ _ Y
- contains R? which must be at position1 or position4? 
- and two more letters? at position3 and position4? OR if R is at position1? then position3 and position4? If R is at position4? then position1 and position3? 

Also, we don't know what other letters? But we must avoid the absent letters? 

So, we need to find a valid English word that matches: _ A _ _ Y? 

Moreover, since we have limited tries? we can guess a word that helps us narrow down? 

But note: we have 4 more tries? But let's try to guess one that covers the possibilities? 

Possibilities: 

Case 1: R at position1? Then word: R A _ _ Y? 
   Then we must choose letters for position3 and position4? Which are different? and not the absent ones? 

Case 2: R at position4? Then word: _ A _ R Y? 

Now, we have to choose a word? But note: the word must be 5 letters? 

Also, we don't have information about position3? So we need to guess a word that includes R in either position1 or position4? and also tests other letters? 

List possible words:

First, words with R at position1? 
   Format: R A _ _ Y? 
   Possible words: 
      RAINY? But N is absent? Not allowed? Because N was guessed and absent? 
      RALLY? But L at position3? and L at position4? And Y at end? Also, note 'A' at position2? 
      RALLY: letters R, A, L, L, Y? But duplicate L? But note: in the feedback? We haven't encountered duplicates? So possible? 

But we must check the absent letters: N, E, P, T? So RALLY? 
   Letters: R, A, L, L, Y -> none of C,E,N,P? But wait, absent are C, E, N, P, T? So L is okay? 
   But the word ""rally"" exists? 

Similarly, other words: 
   RABBY? Not a word? 
   RADLY? Not a word? 
   RAMMY? Not common? 
   How about ""RASPY""? But we know P is absent? So not? 
   ""RARLY""? Not a word? 
   ""RAVEL""? But E is absent? 
   So common words: RALLY, RABID? But B and D? ""RABID"" has B and D? Which we haven't tested? But D? 
   But wait: ""RABID"" has I at position4? and D at position5? But our pattern requires position5=Y? So it must end with Y? So no? 

Therefore, RALLY seems a candidate? 

Alternatively, words with R at position4? 
   Format: _ A _ R Y? 
   Possible words: 
      WARY? Not 5 letters? 
      CHARM? But C and H? C is absent? 
      CARVY? Not a word? 
      DAIRY? D, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, FAIRY? F, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, HAIRY? H, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, LAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, MAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, WAIRY? Not common? 
      So possible: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have two sets:
- RALLY: meaning R at position1? And L at position3 and4? 
- Or words like FAIRY, which have F at position1? I at position3? R at position4? 

But note: in FAIRY: position1=F, position2=A, position3=I, position4=R, position5=Y? 

But we must avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? So F, I, are okay? Because we haven't tested them? 

Therefore, we have multiple possibilities? 

But we need to choose a word that: 
   Is a candidate? Or we choose a word that can cover? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple letters? 

But note: we know A at 2 and Y at 5? So we must generate words accordingly? 

But we don't have to choose a candidate? We can choose any word? 

Also, we are limited by the absent letters? So we avoid using absent letters? 

We also want to test letters? 

But note: we have R that must be placed? 

Moreover, we already know R is somewhere? So if we put R at position1? Then we can test new letters? 

Similarly, if we put R at position4? We test the other? 

But we don't know which? 

Therefore, perhaps create a word that tests both? How? 

But we cannot? Because the pattern forces either R at1 or4? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that does not have R? But wait? no? because we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Because if we don't, we will get x for R? which would be confusing? But we know R is present? 

But we can? Actually, we are forced to include R? Because we know it must be in the word? 

But guess validation: the word must be valid? 

So, let's think: we can choose a word that has R? 

We can also choose a word that tests new letters? 

But we have tried: 
  Guess1: C, R, A, N, E? 
  Guess2: P, A, R, T, Y? 
So letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, Y? 

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But in the word? we know A and Y? So we are to fill positions1,3,4? 

And R? must be at position1 or position4? 

So: 
  If position1 is R? Then word: R A _ _ Y? Then we need two letters at position3 and position4? 
  If position4 is R? Then word: _ A _ R Y? Then we need positions1 and position3? 

Now, for the guess? we want to maximize information? So ideally choose a word that covers letters we haven't tested? 

But we have two distinct cases? 

So, how to resolve? 

We could choose a word like ""FAIRY"" if we think R is at position4? Or ""RALLY"" if we think R is at position1? 

But what if none? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't commit? But we have to include R? 

But let me see what common words exist? 

Pattern: R A _ _ Y -> possibilities? 
   RALLY? (L,L) -> duplicate? Note that feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? But possible? 
   RADII? But not ending with Y? 
   RADIO? Not ending with Y? 
   RANDY? But N and D? But N is absent? So no? 
   RAVIOLI? Too long? 
   So common: RALLY? 

Pattern: _ A _ R Y -> 
   Letters: ? A ? R Y? Then ? must be letters? 
   First letter: must be a consonant? Or vowel? 
   Common words: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have candidate words: FAIRY, HAIRY, DAIRY? RALLY? 

Note: in RALLY? There is double L? So it uses L? and we haven't tested L? 

In FAIRY? F and I? We haven't tested? 

Since we have no information? perhaps choose one? 

But we can also think of a word that doesn't fit either pattern? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A and Y at positions? 

So we must respect the pattern? 

Moreover, note: we have to avoid absent letters? 

Therefore, I propose to choose ""FAIRY"":

If we choose ""FAIRY"":
   Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
   Then, this would test:
      F: if present? But if we get F with ✓? Then we know? If F with - or x? 
      I: at position3? 
      R: at position4? We expect R at position4? so should be ✓? because we put R at a position that might be correct? 

But note: we are not sure? 

If the secret word is ""fairy""? Then we win? 

If not? Then we get feedback? 

Alternative: choose ""rally""?

If we choose ""RALLY"":
   Positions: R(1) A(2) L(3) L(4) Y(5)
   Then R at position1? We don't know if that's correct? 
   But also duplicate L? 

But the word ""rally"" is a word? 

However, we can choose a word that includes more new letters? 

Another candidate: ""MARVY""? But M, A, R, V, Y? Position: M(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5)? But wait: in feedback for party? R was at position3? And we got '-', meaning R is not at position3? So in ""MARVY"", R is at position3? Which we already know is incorrect? So it would get '-' for R? That doesn't add? 

Therefore, avoid putting R at position3? But in ""MARVY""? it would be at position3? So we know? don't? 

So, back? 

We have two possibilities: 
- If R is at position1: then words like RALLY? 
- If R is at position4: words like FAIRY? 

Now to decide? 

We can choose FAIRY? Because it uses F and I? which are common? 

Alternatively, choose ""HAIRY"" or ""DAIRY""? Same? 

But let me choose FAIRY? That way we test F and I? 

But if the word turns out to be RALLY? Then we get feedback? 

But we don't have more information? 

So yes? 

But we must include R? 

So FAIRY: includes R? 

Therefore, I will guess ""fairy"".

But note: in FAIRY? we are putting R at position4? which might be correct? If the secret word is fairy? Then done? 

If not? we get feedback? 

Therefore, guess: ""fairy""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- From Guess 2 (""party""): P and T are absent. A is confirmed at position 2, and Y is confirmed at position 5. R is present but not at position 3.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word must have the format: `[?] A [?] [?] Y` (position 2 is A, position 5 is Y).
- R must be present and can only be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is occupied by A, and positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T (to be avoided in the new guess).
- Valid words must include R and fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters not yet tested or ruled out.

**Reasoning for this guess:**
To resolve the position of R (position 1 or 4) efficiently, we target common words fitting the pattern `[?] A [?] [?] Y`. Strong candidates include:
- **fairy**: Positional fit: `F A I R Y`. Tests F at position 1, I at position 3, and R at position 4. These are new letters, and R at position 4 could confirm a plausible candidate.
- Alternatives like ""dairy"", ""hairy"", ""rally"" were considered, but ""fairy"" uses common consonants (F, I) and maximizes new information.

If ""fairy"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on F, I, and R’s position will reduce possibilities significantly.

Let\'s clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).\n   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.\n\n - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\n Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Additionally, we don\'t know the positions of R and A yet.\n\n We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.\n\n We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).\n\n Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.\n\n Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven\'t been tested.\n\n The vowels we haven\'t tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. \n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.\n\n Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.\n\n How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?\n\n Example: Let\'s try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don\'t know.\n\n We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.\n\n Consider the word ""PARTY"":\n - P, A, R, T, Y\n Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.\n\n But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":\n   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.\n\n However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:\n\n In ""crane"": \n   Position 1: C -> x (not present)\n   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)\n   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)\n   Position 4: N -> x\n   Position 5: E -> x\n\n So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.\n\n Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".\n\n Alternatively, we can think of words that don\'t put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That\'s different.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn\'t forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.\n\n So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.\n\n However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.\n\n Actually, we have:\n - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got \'-\', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.\n\n Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.\n\n Now, let\'s see in the word ""party"":\n   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don\'t know.\n   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that\'s allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.\n   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that\'s allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.\n\n Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:\n   R at position 1? That\'s allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn\'t there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that \'S\' and \'T\' haven\'t been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven\'t tried S? So that\'s good? Actually, we haven\'t tested any of these letters? \n\n But in ""ROAST"": \n   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that\'s good? But we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? \n   Position 2: O -> New letter?\n   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it\'s the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That\'s invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that\'s a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That\'s why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":\n   A is at position 2? Which hasn\'t been tested? \n   R is at position 3? Which hasn\'t been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don\'t have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? \n\n Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don\'t know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? \n   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that\'s invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? \n\n Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? \n   P, A, R, I, S? \n   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? \n   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that\'s allowed? \n   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? \n   We test new letters: P, I, S.\n\n However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? \n\n But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it\'s a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? \n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? \n\n But same issue? \n\n How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? \n   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? \n   But wait: R at position 1? That\'s not position 2? So allowed? \n   A at position 2? That\'s not position 3? So allowed? \n   Also, letters we haven\'t tried: I, L, S.\n\n But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? So that\'s a new position? \n\n However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? \n\n But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? \n\n Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? \n\n Let me list a few candidates: \n1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? \n   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? \n\n2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? \n   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? \n   A at 2: not position 3? Good? \n\n3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? \n   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)\n\n However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? \n Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? \n\n Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? \n\n Let\'s see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? \n\n Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? \n\n So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? \n\n Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? \n\n But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don\'t know the positions? So which word to pick? \n\n Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? \n\n How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? \n   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that\'s bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it\'s wrong? So we shouldn\'t do that? \n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? \n\n So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? \n\n Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven\'t tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven\'t tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That\'s fine? \n\n However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? \n\n Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""raspy"": \n   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? \n   R at 1? Not 2? Good? \n   A at 2? Not 3? Good? \n   But also tests S, P, Y? \n\n However, we don\'t know about S? \n\n But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? \n\n Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? \n\n But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? \n\n Alternatively, we might get lucky? \n\n So I will guess ""party"".\n\n Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).\n- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.\n\nFor my next guess, I want to:\n1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).\n2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).\n3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""party"" fits these criteria:\n- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)\n- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)\n- Tests new letters: P, T, Y\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: crane**\n- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nThis means:\n  - C, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n\n**Guess 2: party**\n- Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(✓)\nThis means:\n  - P and T are not in the secret word.\n  - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""party"" A is the second letter).\n  - R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because feedback shows R(-)).\n  - Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since in ""party"" Y is the fifth letter).\n\nSo, what we know now:\n1. The secret word has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.\n   - Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ Y\n2. We also know R is present but not in position 3 (since we have feedback R(-) at position 3). Moreover, we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2.\n   - Since position 2 is A and position 5 is Y, R must be in either position 1 or position 4? Because positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? \n   - But note: position 2 is A? and position 5 is Y? So available positions for R are 1, 3, 4? But wait: we tried R at position 3 in ""party"" and got \'-\', meaning it is not at position 3? So R cannot be at position 3? \n   - Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 4? \n   - But also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2? and we know position 2 is now A? So R cannot be at position 2? That\'s already covered? and now we also know R not at position 3? \n   - So R must be at position 1 or position 4? \n3. We know the secret word contains R? Yes? \n4. Additionally, the secret word must not contain: C, P, T, N, E? And we have the letters known?\n\nAlso, we must consider: are there any other constraints? We have feedback only.\n\nTherefore, the secret word pattern is: \n  Position 1: could be R or something else? \n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: ??? (but cannot be R? because we tried R at position 3? So R not at 3? But what about other letters? \n  Position 4: Could be R? Or something else?\n  Position 5: Y (fixed)\n\nSo the word pattern: [position1] A [position3] [position4] Y\n\nAnd R must be either at position1 or position4? \n\nBut note: what about other letters that might be present? We have tested:\n- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are present? But already accounted? And others absent? \n- In guess2: P, A, R, T, Y -> A and Y present? And A and Y confirmed? R present? But P and T absent? \n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? \n\nSo the letters we are avoiding: C, E, N, P, T? \n\nNow, we must form a word that: \n- has the format _ A _ _ Y\n- contains R? which must be at position1 or position4? \n- and two more letters? at position3 and position4? OR if R is at position1? then position3 and position4? If R is at position4? then position1 and position3? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know what other letters? But we must avoid the absent letters? \n\nSo, we need to find a valid English word that matches: _ A _ _ Y? \n\nMoreover, since we have limited tries? we can guess a word that helps us narrow down? \n\nBut note: we have 4 more tries? But let\'s try to guess one that covers the possibilities? \n\nPossibilities: \n\nCase 1: R at position1? Then word: R A _ _ Y? \n   Then we must choose letters for position3 and position4? Which are different? and not the absent ones? \n\nCase 2: R at position4? Then word: _ A _ R Y? \n\nNow, we have to choose a word? But note: the word must be 5 letters? \n\nAlso, we don\'t have information about position3? So we need to guess a word that includes R in either position1 or position4? and also tests other letters? \n\nList possible words:\n\nFirst, words with R at position1? \n   Format: R A _ _ Y? \n   Possible words: \n      RAINY? But N is absent? Not allowed? Because N was guessed and absent? \n      RALLY? But L at position3? and L at position4? And Y at end? Also, note \'A\' at position2? \n      RALLY: letters R, A, L, L, Y? But duplicate L? But note: in the feedback? We haven\'t encountered duplicates? So possible? \n\nBut we must check the absent letters: N, E, P, T? So RALLY? \n   Letters: R, A, L, L, Y -> none of C,E,N,P? But wait, absent are C, E, N, P, T? So L is okay? \n   But the word ""rally"" exists? \n\nSimilarly, other words: \n   RABBY? Not a word? \n   RADLY? Not a word? \n   RAMMY? Not common? \n   How about ""RASPY""? But we know P is absent? So not? \n   ""RARLY""? Not a word? \n   ""RAVEL""? But E is absent? \n   So common words: RALLY, RABID? But B and D? ""RABID"" has B and D? Which we haven\'t tested? But D? \n   But wait: ""RABID"" has I at position4? and D at position5? But our pattern requires position5=Y? So it must end with Y? So no? \n\nTherefore, RALLY seems a candidate? \n\nAlternatively, words with R at position4? \n   Format: _ A _ R Y? \n   Possible words: \n      WARY? Not 5 letters? \n      CHARM? But C and H? C is absent? \n      CARVY? Not a word? \n      DAIRY? D, A, I, R, Y? \n      Also, FAIRY? F, A, I, R, Y? \n      Also, HAIRY? H, A, I, R, Y? \n      Also, LAIRY? Not common? \n      Also, MAIRY? Not common? \n      Also, WAIRY? Not common? \n      So possible: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nTherefore, we have two sets:\n- RALLY: meaning R at position1? And L at position3 and4? \n- Or words like FAIRY, which have F at position1? I at position3? R at position4? \n\nBut note: in FAIRY: position1=F, position2=A, position3=I, position4=R, position5=Y? \n\nBut we must avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? So F, I, are okay? Because we haven\'t tested them? \n\nTherefore, we have multiple possibilities? \n\nBut we need to choose a word that: \n   Is a candidate? Or we choose a word that can cover? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple letters? \n\nBut note: we know A at 2 and Y at 5? So we must generate words accordingly? \n\nBut we don\'t have to choose a candidate? We can choose any word? \n\nAlso, we are limited by the absent letters? So we avoid using absent letters? \n\nWe also want to test letters? \n\nBut note: we have R that must be placed? \n\nMoreover, we already know R is somewhere? So if we put R at position1? Then we can test new letters? \n\nSimilarly, if we put R at position4? We test the other? \n\nBut we don\'t know which? \n\nTherefore, perhaps create a word that tests both? How? \n\nBut we cannot? Because the pattern forces either R at1 or4? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that does not have R? But wait? no? because we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Because if we don\'t, we will get x for R? which would be confusing? But we know R is present? \n\nBut we can? Actually, we are forced to include R? Because we know it must be in the word? \n\nBut guess validation: the word must be valid? \n\nSo, let\'s think: we can choose a word that has R? \n\nWe can also choose a word that tests new letters? \n\nBut we have tried: \n  Guess1: C, R, A, N, E? \n  Guess2: P, A, R, T, Y? \nSo letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, Y? \n\nAvailable common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? \n\nBut in the word? we know A and Y? So we are to fill positions1,3,4? \n\nAnd R? must be at position1 or position4? \n\nSo: \n  If position1 is R? Then word: R A _ _ Y? Then we need two letters at position3 and position4? \n  If position4 is R? Then word: _ A _ R Y? Then we need positions1 and position3? \n\nNow, for the guess? we want to maximize information? So ideally choose a word that covers letters we haven\'t tested? \n\nBut we have two distinct cases? \n\nSo, how to resolve? \n\nWe could choose a word like ""FAIRY"" if we think R is at position4? Or ""RALLY"" if we think R is at position1? \n\nBut what if none? \n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t commit? But we have to include R? \n\nBut let me see what common words exist? \n\nPattern: R A _ _ Y -> possibilities? \n   RALLY? (L,L) -> duplicate? Note that feedback hasn\'t indicated duplicates? But possible? \n   RADII? But not ending with Y? \n   RADIO? Not ending with Y? \n   RANDY? But N and D? But N is absent? So no? \n   RAVIOLI? Too long? \n   So common: RALLY? \n\nPattern: _ A _ R Y -> \n   Letters: ? A ? R Y? Then ? must be letters? \n   First letter: must be a consonant? Or vowel? \n   Common words: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nTherefore, we have candidate words: FAIRY, HAIRY, DAIRY? RALLY? \n\nNote: in RALLY? There is double L? So it uses L? and we haven\'t tested L? \n\nIn FAIRY? F and I? We haven\'t tested? \n\nSince we have no information? perhaps choose one? \n\nBut we can also think of a word that doesn\'t fit either pattern? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A and Y at positions? \n\nSo we must respect the pattern? \n\nMoreover, note: we have to avoid absent letters? \n\nTherefore, I propose to choose ""FAIRY"":\n\nIf we choose ""FAIRY"":\n   Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5)? \n   Then, this would test:\n      F: if present? But if we get F with ✓? Then we know? If F with - or x? \n      I: at position3? \n      R: at position4? We expect R at position4? so should be ✓? because we put R at a position that might be correct? \n\nBut note: we are not sure? \n\nIf the secret word is ""fairy""? Then we win? \n\nIf not? Then we get feedback? \n\nAlternative: choose ""rally""?\n\nIf we choose ""RALLY"":\n   Positions: R(1) A(2) L(3) L(4) Y(5)\n   Then R at position1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n   But also duplicate L? \n\nBut the word ""rally"" is a word? \n\nHowever, we can choose a word that includes more new letters? \n\nAnother candidate: ""MARVY""? But M, A, R, V, Y? Position: M(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5)? But wait: in feedback for party? R was at position3? And we got \'-\', meaning R is not at position3? So in ""MARVY"", R is at position3? Which we already know is incorrect? So it would get \'-\' for R? That doesn\'t add? \n\nTherefore, avoid putting R at position3? But in ""MARVY""? it would be at position3? So we know? don\'t? \n\nSo, back? \n\nWe have two possibilities: \n- If R is at position1: then words like RALLY? \n- If R is at position4: words like FAIRY? \n\nNow to decide? \n\nWe can choose FAIRY? Because it uses F and I? which are common? \n\nAlternatively, choose ""HAIRY"" or ""DAIRY""? Same? \n\nBut let me choose FAIRY? That way we test F and I? \n\nBut if the word turns out to be RALLY? Then we get feedback? \n\nBut we don\'t have more information? \n\nSo yes? \n\nBut we must include R? \n\nSo FAIRY: includes R? \n\nTherefore, I will guess ""fairy"".\n\nBut note: in FAIRY? we are putting R at position4? which might be correct? If the secret word is fairy? Then done? \n\nIf not? we get feedback? \n\nTherefore, guess: ""fairy""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).\n- From Guess 2 (""party""): P and T are absent. A is confirmed at position 2, and Y is confirmed at position 5. R is present but not at position 3.\n\n**Key insights:**\n- The secret word must have the format: `[?] A [?] [?] Y` (position 2 is A, position 5 is Y).\n- R must be present and can only be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is occupied by A, and positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R).\n- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T (to be avoided in the new guess).\n- Valid words must include R and fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters not yet tested or ruled out.\n\n**Reasoning for this guess:**\nTo resolve the position of R (position 1 or 4) efficiently, we target common words fitting the pattern `[?] A [?] [?] Y`. Strong candidates include:\n- **fairy**: Positional fit: `F A I R Y`. Tests F at position 1, I at position 3, and R at position 4. These are new letters, and R at position 4 could confirm a plausible candidate.\n- Alternatives like ""dairy"", ""hairy"", ""rally"" were considered, but ""fairy"" uses common consonants (F, I) and maximizes new information.\n\nIf ""fairy"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on F, I, and R’s position will reduce possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>fairy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: fairy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the third guess ""fairy"": F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- F is not in the secret word.
- A, I, R, Y are all in the correct positions.

So, the feedback for ""fairy"" is:
  Position 1: F (x) -> not present
  Position 2: A (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 3: I (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 4: R (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct and in position

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: Y

And position 1 is not F, and F is absent.

Also, from the pattern, the secret word is: _ A I R Y

We only need to determine the first letter.

What can the first letter be?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""AIRY"".
- It cannot be any of the letters we know are absent: C, E, N, P, T, F (from previous feedback).

From guess1: absent: C, N, E
From guess2: absent: P, T
From guess3: absent: F

So absent letters: C, E, F, N, P, T

We need to find a letter for the first position that is not in the absent list and that makes a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words that end with ""AIRY"":
- DAIRY: D is not in the absent list? D hasn't been tested? So D is possible.
- HAIRY: H is not in the absent list? H is possible.
- LAIRY: L is possible? But ""lairy"" is a word? (meaning gaudy or flashy) - but might be accepted?
- MAIRY: Not common? 
- WAIRY: Not common?
- RAIRY: Not a word?
- So common ones: DAIRY, HAIRY.

But note: we also have ""AIRY"" as a root? So the word must be one of these.

But we know the secret word has 5 letters? And we have A,I,R,Y fixed? So the first letter must be a consonant? 

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Therefore, the candidate letters for position1: 
  Any letter except: A, I, R, Y (because they are already in the word? but wait, the word is _ A I R Y, so the first letter can be any letter? but we know it's not F? and not the absent ones? 

But note: the word must be a valid English word? 

So, let's list possible words:
- DAIRY: D at position1? 
- HAIRY: H at position1?
- Also, ""NAIRY""? But N is absent? So no.
- ""PAIRY""? But P is absent? So no.
- ""TAIRY""? T is absent? So no.
- ""FAIRY"" we tried? and F is absent? 
- ""CAIRY""? C is absent? 
- ""EAIRY""? E is absent? 
- ""GAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""JAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""KAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""LAIRY"": L at position1? The word ""lairy"" is in some dictionaries? (British informal) meaning talkative or cheeky? But might be accepted? 
- ""MAIRY"": Not common? 
- ""RAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""SAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""VAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""WAIRY"": Not common? 
- ""YAIRY"": Not a word? 

So the most common words are DAIRY and HAIRY? And possibly LAIRY? 

But we have to choose one? 

We have not tested D, H, or L? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on guess 4? And we have 6 tries? So we can try one? 

But if we guess one? and it's wrong? we get feedback? 

But we have two or three possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we cannot? because the last four letters are fixed? 

So we must guess one? 

But we can choose a word that is not one of these? But no? because the pattern is fixed? 

Therefore, we choose between DAIRY, HAIRY, and LAIRY? 

But note: in the feedback from guess1, we had R at position2? and now we have R at position4? So no conflict? 

Similarly, A at position2? 

So, which one to pick? 

We can pick ""dairy"" because D is a common letter? 

Or ""hairy"" because H is common? 

But we don't have information? 

Alternatively, we can look at the frequency? 

But let me pick ""dairy"" first? 

But we are to make one guess? 

So I will guess ""dairy"". 

But note: if we guess ""dairy"", and it's correct? we win? 

If not? then we get feedback? 

But if it's wrong? then we know it must be ""hairy"" or ""lairy""? 

But we have two more guesses? 

So it's safe? 

Therefore, I will guess ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  Secret word pattern: _ A I R Y? 
  ""dairy"": D A I R Y? 
  Positions: D at1, A at2, I at3, R at4, Y at5? 

So it fits? 

Similarly, ""hairy"": H A I R Y? 

And ""lairy"": L A I R Y? 

So, I choose ""dairy"" as the next guess. 

But note: we have not tested D? So we don't know? 

So, <guess>dairy</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `C`, `N`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `R` and `A` are **present** but in the wrong positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

- **Guess 2: ""party""**  
  Feedback: `P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `P` and `T` are **absent**.  
  - `A` is **correct** at position 2.  
  - `Y` is **correct** at position 5.  
  - `R` is **present** but not in position 3.  

- **Guess 3: ""fairy""**  
  Feedback: `F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `F` is **absent**.  
  - `A`, `I`, `R`, `Y` are **correct** at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Structure**:  
   The feedback confirms:  
   - Position 2: `A`  
   - Position 3: `I`  
   - Position 4: `R`  
   - Position 5: `Y`  
   - **Only position 1 is unknown**.  
   - The secret word pattern is: `? A I R Y`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   `C`, `E`, `F`, `N`, `P`, `T` are ruled out.  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   The first letter must:  
   - Form a valid English word ending in `AIRY`.  
   - Not be an absent letter.  
   - Common options:  
     - `DAIRY` (D at position 1)  
     - `HAIRY` (H at position 1)  
     - Less common but valid: `LAIRY` (L at position 1, meaning ""cheeky"" or ""flashy"" in British English).  

4. **Strategy**:  
   - `DAIRY` is chosen as the next guess because:  
     - `D` is a common consonant not yet tested.  
     - It efficiently tests a high-frequency candidate (e.g., ""dairy"" is more common than ""lairy"").  
     - If incorrect, feedback on `D` will confirm if the secret word is `HAIRY` or `LAIRY` in subsequent guesses.  

<guess>dairy</guess>",dairy,"We are given feedback from the third guess ""fairy"": F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- F is not in the secret word.
- A, I, R, Y are all in the correct positions.

So, the feedback for ""fairy"" is:
  Position 1: F (x) -> not present
  Position 2: A (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 3: I (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 4: R (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct and in position

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: Y

And position 1 is not F, and F is absent.

Also, from the pattern, the secret word is: _ A I R Y

We only need to determine the first letter.

What can the first letter be?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""AIRY"".
- It cannot be any of the letters we know are absent: C, E, N, P, T, F (from previous feedback).

From guess1: absent: C, N, E
From guess2: absent: P, T
From guess3: absent: F

So absent letters: C, E, F, N, P, T

We need to find a letter for the first position that is not in the absent list and that makes a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words that end with ""AIRY"":
- DAIRY: D is not in the absent list? D hasn't been tested? So D is possible.
- HAIRY: H is not in the absent list? H is possible.
- LAIRY: L is possible? But ""lairy"" is a word? (meaning gaudy or flashy) - but might be accepted?
- MAIRY: Not common? 
- WAIRY: Not common?
- RAIRY: Not a word?
- So common ones: DAIRY, HAIRY.

But note: we also have ""AIRY"" as a root? So the word must be one of these.

But we know the secret word has 5 letters? And we have A,I,R,Y fixed? So the first letter must be a consonant? 

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Therefore, the candidate letters for position1: 
  Any letter except: A, I, R, Y (because they are already in the word? but wait, the word is _ A I R Y, so the first letter can be any letter? but we know it's not F? and not the absent ones? 

But note: the word must be a valid English word? 

So, let's list possible words:
- DAIRY: D at position1? 
- HAIRY: H at position1?
- Also, ""NAIRY""? But N is absent? So no.
- ""PAIRY""? But P is absent? So no.
- ""TAIRY""? T is absent? So no.
- ""FAIRY"" we tried? and F is absent? 
- ""CAIRY""? C is absent? 
- ""EAIRY""? E is absent? 
- ""GAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""JAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""KAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""LAIRY"": L at position1? The word ""lairy"" is in some dictionaries? (British informal) meaning talkative or cheeky? But might be accepted? 
- ""MAIRY"": Not common? 
- ""RAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""SAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""VAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""WAIRY"": Not common? 
- ""YAIRY"": Not a word? 

So the most common words are DAIRY and HAIRY? And possibly LAIRY? 

But we have to choose one? 

We have not tested D, H, or L? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on guess 4? And we have 6 tries? So we can try one? 

But if we guess one? and it's wrong? we get feedback? 

But we have two or three possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we cannot? because the last four letters are fixed? 

So we must guess one? 

But we can choose a word that is not one of these? But no? because the pattern is fixed? 

Therefore, we choose between DAIRY, HAIRY, and LAIRY? 

But note: in the feedback from guess1, we had R at position2? and now we have R at position4? So no conflict? 

Similarly, A at position2? 

So, which one to pick? 

We can pick ""dairy"" because D is a common letter? 

Or ""hairy"" because H is common? 

But we don't have information? 

Alternatively, we can look at the frequency? 

But let me pick ""dairy"" first? 

But we are to make one guess? 

So I will guess ""dairy"". 

But note: if we guess ""dairy"", and it's correct? we win? 

If not? then we get feedback? 

But if it's wrong? then we know it must be ""hairy"" or ""lairy""? 

But we have two more guesses? 

So it's safe? 

Therefore, I will guess ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  Secret word pattern: _ A I R Y? 
  ""dairy"": D A I R Y? 
  Positions: D at1, A at2, I at3, R at4, Y at5? 

So it fits? 

Similarly, ""hairy"": H A I R Y? 

And ""lairy"": L A I R Y? 

So, I choose ""dairy"" as the next guess. 

But note: we have not tested D? So we don't know? 

So, <guess>dairy</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `C`, `N`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `R` and `A` are **present** but in the wrong positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

- **Guess 2: ""party""**  
  Feedback: `P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `P` and `T` are **absent**.  
  - `A` is **correct** at position 2.  
  - `Y` is **correct** at position 5.  
  - `R` is **present** but not in position 3.  

- **Guess 3: ""fairy""**  
  Feedback: `F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `F` is **absent**.  
  - `A`, `I`, `R`, `Y` are **correct** at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Structure**:  
   The feedback confirms:  
   - Position 2: `A`  
   - Position 3: `I`  
   - Position 4: `R`  
   - Position 5: `Y`  
   - **Only position 1 is unknown**.  
   - The secret word pattern is: `? A I R Y`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   `C`, `E`, `F`, `N`, `P`, `T` are ruled out.  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   The first letter must:  
   - Form a valid English word ending in `AIRY`.  
   - Not be an absent letter.  
   - Common options:  
     - `DAIRY` (D at position 1)  
     - `HAIRY` (H at position 1)  
     - Less common but valid: `LAIRY` (L at position 1, meaning ""cheeky"" or ""flashy"" in British English).  

4. **Strategy**:  
   - `DAIRY` is chosen as the next guess because:  
     - `D` is a common consonant not yet tested.  
     - It efficiently tests a high-frequency candidate (e.g., ""dairy"" is more common than ""lairy"").  
     - If incorrect, feedback on `D` will confirm if the secret word is `HAIRY` or `LAIRY` in subsequent guesses.",Guess 4: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"" (which were positions 2 and 3? Let's clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Additionally, we don't know the positions of R and A yet.

 We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.

 We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.

 Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven't been tested.

 The vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.

 Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.

 How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?

 Example: Let's try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don't know.

 We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.

 Consider the word ""PARTY"":
 - P, A, R, T, Y
 Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.

 But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":
   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.

 However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:

 In ""crane"": 
   Position 1: C -> x (not present)
   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 4: N -> x
   Position 5: E -> x

 So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.

 Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.

 Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".

 Alternatively, we can think of words that don't put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That's different.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn't forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.

 So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.

 However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.

 Actually, we have:
 - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got '-', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.

 Now, let's see in the word ""party"":
   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don't know.
   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that's allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.
   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that's allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:
   R at position 1? That's allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn't there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that 'S' and 'T' haven't been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven't tried S? So that's good? Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters? 

 But in ""ROAST"": 
   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that's good? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? 
   Position 2: O -> New letter?
   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it's the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That's invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that's a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That's why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":
   A is at position 2? Which hasn't been tested? 
   R is at position 3? Which hasn't been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don't have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? 

 Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don't know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? 
   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that's invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? 

 Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? 
   P, A, R, I, S? 
   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? 
   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that's allowed? 
   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? 
   We test new letters: P, I, S.

 However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? 

 But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it's a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? 

 Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? 

 But same issue? 

 How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? 
   But wait: R at position 1? That's not position 2? So allowed? 
   A at position 2? That's not position 3? So allowed? 
   Also, letters we haven't tried: I, L, S.

 But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don't know if R can be at position 1? So that's a new position? 

 However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? 

 But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? 

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? 

 Let me list a few candidates: 
1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? 
   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? 

2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? 
   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? 
   A at 2: not position 3? Good? 

3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? 
   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)

 However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? 
 Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? 

 Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? 

 Let's see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? 

 Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? 

 So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? 

 Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? 

 But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don't know the positions? So which word to pick? 

 Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? 

 How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? 
   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that's bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it's wrong? So we shouldn't do that? 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? 

 So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? 

 Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That's fine? 

 However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? 

 Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""raspy"": 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? 
   R at 1? Not 2? Good? 
   A at 2? Not 3? Good? 
   But also tests S, P, Y? 

 However, we don't know about S? 

 But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? 

 Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? 

 But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? 

 Alternatively, we might get lucky? 

 So I will guess ""party"".

 Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).
- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.

For my next guess, I want to:
1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).
2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).
3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)
- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)
- Tests new letters: P, T, Y

<guess>party</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
  - C, N, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.

**Guess 2: party**
- Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(✓)
This means:
  - P and T are not in the secret word.
  - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""party"" A is the second letter).
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because feedback shows R(-)).
  - Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since in ""party"" Y is the fifth letter).

So, what we know now:
1. The secret word has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
   - Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ Y
2. We also know R is present but not in position 3 (since we have feedback R(-) at position 3). Moreover, we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2.
   - Since position 2 is A and position 5 is Y, R must be in either position 1 or position 4? Because positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? 
   - But note: position 2 is A? and position 5 is Y? So available positions for R are 1, 3, 4? But wait: we tried R at position 3 in ""party"" and got '-', meaning it is not at position 3? So R cannot be at position 3? 
   - Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 4? 
   - But also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2? and we know position 2 is now A? So R cannot be at position 2? That's already covered? and now we also know R not at position 3? 
   - So R must be at position 1 or position 4? 
3. We know the secret word contains R? Yes? 
4. Additionally, the secret word must not contain: C, P, T, N, E? And we have the letters known?

Also, we must consider: are there any other constraints? We have feedback only.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: could be R or something else? 
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: ??? (but cannot be R? because we tried R at position 3? So R not at 3? But what about other letters? 
  Position 4: Could be R? Or something else?
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the word pattern: [position1] A [position3] [position4] Y

And R must be either at position1 or position4? 

But note: what about other letters that might be present? We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are present? But already accounted? And others absent? 
- In guess2: P, A, R, T, Y -> A and Y present? And A and Y confirmed? R present? But P and T absent? 

Therefore, absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? 

So the letters we are avoiding: C, E, N, P, T? 

Now, we must form a word that: 
- has the format _ A _ _ Y
- contains R? which must be at position1 or position4? 
- and two more letters? at position3 and position4? OR if R is at position1? then position3 and position4? If R is at position4? then position1 and position3? 

Also, we don't know what other letters? But we must avoid the absent letters? 

So, we need to find a valid English word that matches: _ A _ _ Y? 

Moreover, since we have limited tries? we can guess a word that helps us narrow down? 

But note: we have 4 more tries? But let's try to guess one that covers the possibilities? 

Possibilities: 

Case 1: R at position1? Then word: R A _ _ Y? 
   Then we must choose letters for position3 and position4? Which are different? and not the absent ones? 

Case 2: R at position4? Then word: _ A _ R Y? 

Now, we have to choose a word? But note: the word must be 5 letters? 

Also, we don't have information about position3? So we need to guess a word that includes R in either position1 or position4? and also tests other letters? 

List possible words:

First, words with R at position1? 
   Format: R A _ _ Y? 
   Possible words: 
      RAINY? But N is absent? Not allowed? Because N was guessed and absent? 
      RALLY? But L at position3? and L at position4? And Y at end? Also, note 'A' at position2? 
      RALLY: letters R, A, L, L, Y? But duplicate L? But note: in the feedback? We haven't encountered duplicates? So possible? 

But we must check the absent letters: N, E, P, T? So RALLY? 
   Letters: R, A, L, L, Y -> none of C,E,N,P? But wait, absent are C, E, N, P, T? So L is okay? 
   But the word ""rally"" exists? 

Similarly, other words: 
   RABBY? Not a word? 
   RADLY? Not a word? 
   RAMMY? Not common? 
   How about ""RASPY""? But we know P is absent? So not? 
   ""RARLY""? Not a word? 
   ""RAVEL""? But E is absent? 
   So common words: RALLY, RABID? But B and D? ""RABID"" has B and D? Which we haven't tested? But D? 
   But wait: ""RABID"" has I at position4? and D at position5? But our pattern requires position5=Y? So it must end with Y? So no? 

Therefore, RALLY seems a candidate? 

Alternatively, words with R at position4? 
   Format: _ A _ R Y? 
   Possible words: 
      WARY? Not 5 letters? 
      CHARM? But C and H? C is absent? 
      CARVY? Not a word? 
      DAIRY? D, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, FAIRY? F, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, HAIRY? H, A, I, R, Y? 
      Also, LAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, MAIRY? Not common? 
      Also, WAIRY? Not common? 
      So possible: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have two sets:
- RALLY: meaning R at position1? And L at position3 and4? 
- Or words like FAIRY, which have F at position1? I at position3? R at position4? 

But note: in FAIRY: position1=F, position2=A, position3=I, position4=R, position5=Y? 

But we must avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? So F, I, are okay? Because we haven't tested them? 

Therefore, we have multiple possibilities? 

But we need to choose a word that: 
   Is a candidate? Or we choose a word that can cover? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple letters? 

But note: we know A at 2 and Y at 5? So we must generate words accordingly? 

But we don't have to choose a candidate? We can choose any word? 

Also, we are limited by the absent letters? So we avoid using absent letters? 

We also want to test letters? 

But note: we have R that must be placed? 

Moreover, we already know R is somewhere? So if we put R at position1? Then we can test new letters? 

Similarly, if we put R at position4? We test the other? 

But we don't know which? 

Therefore, perhaps create a word that tests both? How? 

But we cannot? Because the pattern forces either R at1 or4? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that does not have R? But wait? no? because we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Because if we don't, we will get x for R? which would be confusing? But we know R is present? 

But we can? Actually, we are forced to include R? Because we know it must be in the word? 

But guess validation: the word must be valid? 

So, let's think: we can choose a word that has R? 

We can also choose a word that tests new letters? 

But we have tried: 
  Guess1: C, R, A, N, E? 
  Guess2: P, A, R, T, Y? 
So letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, Y? 

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But in the word? we know A and Y? So we are to fill positions1,3,4? 

And R? must be at position1 or position4? 

So: 
  If position1 is R? Then word: R A _ _ Y? Then we need two letters at position3 and position4? 
  If position4 is R? Then word: _ A _ R Y? Then we need positions1 and position3? 

Now, for the guess? we want to maximize information? So ideally choose a word that covers letters we haven't tested? 

But we have two distinct cases? 

So, how to resolve? 

We could choose a word like ""FAIRY"" if we think R is at position4? Or ""RALLY"" if we think R is at position1? 

But what if none? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't commit? But we have to include R? 

But let me see what common words exist? 

Pattern: R A _ _ Y -> possibilities? 
   RALLY? (L,L) -> duplicate? Note that feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? But possible? 
   RADII? But not ending with Y? 
   RADIO? Not ending with Y? 
   RANDY? But N and D? But N is absent? So no? 
   RAVIOLI? Too long? 
   So common: RALLY? 

Pattern: _ A _ R Y -> 
   Letters: ? A ? R Y? Then ? must be letters? 
   First letter: must be a consonant? Or vowel? 
   Common words: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

Therefore, we have candidate words: FAIRY, HAIRY, DAIRY? RALLY? 

Note: in RALLY? There is double L? So it uses L? and we haven't tested L? 

In FAIRY? F and I? We haven't tested? 

Since we have no information? perhaps choose one? 

But we can also think of a word that doesn't fit either pattern? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A and Y at positions? 

So we must respect the pattern? 

Moreover, note: we have to avoid absent letters? 

Therefore, I propose to choose ""FAIRY"":

If we choose ""FAIRY"":
   Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5)? 
   Then, this would test:
      F: if present? But if we get F with ✓? Then we know? If F with - or x? 
      I: at position3? 
      R: at position4? We expect R at position4? so should be ✓? because we put R at a position that might be correct? 

But note: we are not sure? 

If the secret word is ""fairy""? Then we win? 

If not? Then we get feedback? 

Alternative: choose ""rally""?

If we choose ""RALLY"":
   Positions: R(1) A(2) L(3) L(4) Y(5)
   Then R at position1? We don't know if that's correct? 
   But also duplicate L? 

But the word ""rally"" is a word? 

However, we can choose a word that includes more new letters? 

Another candidate: ""MARVY""? But M, A, R, V, Y? Position: M(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5)? But wait: in feedback for party? R was at position3? And we got '-', meaning R is not at position3? So in ""MARVY"", R is at position3? Which we already know is incorrect? So it would get '-' for R? That doesn't add? 

Therefore, avoid putting R at position3? But in ""MARVY""? it would be at position3? So we know? don't? 

So, back? 

We have two possibilities: 
- If R is at position1: then words like RALLY? 
- If R is at position4: words like FAIRY? 

Now to decide? 

We can choose FAIRY? Because it uses F and I? which are common? 

Alternatively, choose ""HAIRY"" or ""DAIRY""? Same? 

But let me choose FAIRY? That way we test F and I? 

But if the word turns out to be RALLY? Then we get feedback? 

But we don't have more information? 

So yes? 

But we must include R? 

So FAIRY: includes R? 

Therefore, I will guess ""fairy"".

But note: in FAIRY? we are putting R at position4? which might be correct? If the secret word is fairy? Then done? 

If not? we get feedback? 

Therefore, guess: ""fairy""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- From Guess 2 (""party""): P and T are absent. A is confirmed at position 2, and Y is confirmed at position 5. R is present but not at position 3.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word must have the format: `[?] A [?] [?] Y` (position 2 is A, position 5 is Y).
- R must be present and can only be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is occupied by A, and positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T (to be avoided in the new guess).
- Valid words must include R and fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters not yet tested or ruled out.

**Reasoning for this guess:**
To resolve the position of R (position 1 or 4) efficiently, we target common words fitting the pattern `[?] A [?] [?] Y`. Strong candidates include:
- **fairy**: Positional fit: `F A I R Y`. Tests F at position 1, I at position 3, and R at position 4. These are new letters, and R at position 4 could confirm a plausible candidate.
- Alternatives like ""dairy"", ""hairy"", ""rally"" were considered, but ""fairy"" uses common consonants (F, I) and maximizes new information.

If ""fairy"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on F, I, and R’s position will reduce possibilities significantly.

<guess>fairy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)
Guess 3: fairy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess ""fairy"": F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- F is not in the secret word.
- A, I, R, Y are all in the correct positions.

So, the feedback for ""fairy"" is:
  Position 1: F (x) -> not present
  Position 2: A (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 3: I (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 4: R (✓) -> correct and in position
  Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct and in position

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: Y

And position 1 is not F, and F is absent.

Also, from the pattern, the secret word is: _ A I R Y

We only need to determine the first letter.

What can the first letter be?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""AIRY"".
- It cannot be any of the letters we know are absent: C, E, N, P, T, F (from previous feedback).

From guess1: absent: C, N, E
From guess2: absent: P, T
From guess3: absent: F

So absent letters: C, E, F, N, P, T

We need to find a letter for the first position that is not in the absent list and that makes a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words that end with ""AIRY"":
- DAIRY: D is not in the absent list? D hasn't been tested? So D is possible.
- HAIRY: H is not in the absent list? H is possible.
- LAIRY: L is possible? But ""lairy"" is a word? (meaning gaudy or flashy) - but might be accepted?
- MAIRY: Not common? 
- WAIRY: Not common?
- RAIRY: Not a word?
- So common ones: DAIRY, HAIRY.

But note: we also have ""AIRY"" as a root? So the word must be one of these.

But we know the secret word has 5 letters? And we have A,I,R,Y fixed? So the first letter must be a consonant? 

Also, we must avoid the absent letters.

Therefore, the candidate letters for position1: 
  Any letter except: A, I, R, Y (because they are already in the word? but wait, the word is _ A I R Y, so the first letter can be any letter? but we know it's not F? and not the absent ones? 

But note: the word must be a valid English word? 

So, let's list possible words:
- DAIRY: D at position1? 
- HAIRY: H at position1?
- Also, ""NAIRY""? But N is absent? So no.
- ""PAIRY""? But P is absent? So no.
- ""TAIRY""? T is absent? So no.
- ""FAIRY"" we tried? and F is absent? 
- ""CAIRY""? C is absent? 
- ""EAIRY""? E is absent? 
- ""GAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""JAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""KAIRY""? Not a word? 
- ""LAIRY"": L at position1? The word ""lairy"" is in some dictionaries? (British informal) meaning talkative or cheeky? But might be accepted? 
- ""MAIRY"": Not common? 
- ""RAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""SAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""VAIRY"": Not a word? 
- ""WAIRY"": Not common? 
- ""YAIRY"": Not a word? 

So the most common words are DAIRY and HAIRY? And possibly LAIRY? 

But we have to choose one? 

We have not tested D, H, or L? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on guess 4? And we have 6 tries? So we can try one? 

But if we guess one? and it's wrong? we get feedback? 

But we have two or three possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we cannot? because the last four letters are fixed? 

So we must guess one? 

But we can choose a word that is not one of these? But no? because the pattern is fixed? 

Therefore, we choose between DAIRY, HAIRY, and LAIRY? 

But note: in the feedback from guess1, we had R at position2? and now we have R at position4? So no conflict? 

Similarly, A at position2? 

So, which one to pick? 

We can pick ""dairy"" because D is a common letter? 

Or ""hairy"" because H is common? 

But we don't have information? 

Alternatively, we can look at the frequency? 

But let me pick ""dairy"" first? 

But we are to make one guess? 

So I will guess ""dairy"". 

But note: if we guess ""dairy"", and it's correct? we win? 

If not? then we get feedback? 

But if it's wrong? then we know it must be ""hairy"" or ""lairy""? 

But we have two more guesses? 

So it's safe? 

Therefore, I will guess ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  Secret word pattern: _ A I R Y? 
  ""dairy"": D A I R Y? 
  Positions: D at1, A at2, I at3, R at4, Y at5? 

So it fits? 

Similarly, ""hairy"": H A I R Y? 

And ""lairy"": L A I R Y? 

So, I choose ""dairy"" as the next guess. 

But note: we have not tested D? So we don't know? 

So, <guess>dairy</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `C`, `N`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `R` and `A` are **present** but in the wrong positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  

- **Guess 2: ""party""**  
  Feedback: `P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `P` and `T` are **absent**.  
  - `A` is **correct** at position 2.  
  - `Y` is **correct** at position 5.  
  - `R` is **present** but not in position 3.  

- **Guess 3: ""fairy""**  
  Feedback: `F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `F` is **absent**.  
  - `A`, `I`, `R`, `Y` are **correct** at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Structure**:  
   The feedback confirms:  
   - Position 2: `A`  
   - Position 3: `I`  
   - Position 4: `R`  
   - Position 5: `Y`  
   - **Only position 1 is unknown**.  
   - The secret word pattern is: `? A I R Y`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   `C`, `E`, `F`, `N`, `P`, `T` are ruled out.  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   The first letter must:  
   - Form a valid English word ending in `AIRY`.  
   - Not be an absent letter.  
   - Common options:  
     - `DAIRY` (D at position 1)  
     - `HAIRY` (H at position 1)  
     - Less common but valid: `LAIRY` (L at position 1, meaning ""cheeky"" or ""flashy"" in British English).  

4. **Strategy**:  
   - `DAIRY` is chosen as the next guess because:  
     - `D` is a common consonant not yet tested.  
     - It efficiently tests a high-frequency candidate (e.g., ""dairy"" is more common than ""lairy"").  
     - If incorrect, feedback on `D` will confirm if the secret word is `HAIRY` or `LAIRY` in subsequent guesses.

Let\'s clarify: in ""crane"", positions are: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).\n   Therefore, R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.\n\n - The letters C, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\n Since we have two letters that are present (R and A) and they are not in their respective positions, we need to form a new 5-letter word that includes R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Additionally, we don\'t know the positions of R and A yet.\n\n We should also consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes R and A, and uses other common letters that have not been ruled out.\n\n We must avoid: C, N, E (and also we know C, N, E are not present at all).\n\n Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters.\n\n Possibilities: We can include other vowels or consonants that haven\'t been tested.\n\n The vowels we haven\'t tried: O, U, I (but note: E is already ruled out) and sometimes Y is used. \n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n However, we should avoid letters we know are absent: C, N, E.\n\n Since R is present, but not in position 2, and A is present, but not in position 3, we can try placing R and A in different positions.\n\n How about trying a word with R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3?\n\n Example: Let\'s try to put R at the beginning? But note: position 1 was C (which is absent). So position 1 could be R? But wait, we don\'t know.\n\n We could try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position.\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters to gather more information.\n\n Consider the word ""PARTY"":\n - P, A, R, T, Y\n Benefits: Contains A and R, avoids C, N, E. Also, it tests P, T, Y.\n\n But note: In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and A at position 3. In ""party"":\n   P at pos1, A at pos2, R at pos3, T at pos4, Y at pos5.\n\n However, the feedback told us that A is not in position 3? Actually, feedback for A in ""crane"" was position 3? But wait, recall:\n\n In ""crane"": \n   Position 1: C -> x (not present)\n   Position 2: R -> - (present but wrong position)\n   Position 3: A -> - (present but wrong position)\n   Position 4: N -> x\n   Position 5: E -> x\n\n So the secret word has R, but not at position 2. Similarly, it has A but not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, in ""party"", putting A at position 2 and R at position 3 is allowed? Because the rules say that the same letter can be placed in a different position? Yes.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? However, since feedback did not mention duplicates, we assume at least for now that letters are unique.\n\n Therefore, let us try ""PARTY"".\n\n Alternatively, we can think of words that don\'t put R at position 2 and A at position 3? Wait, actually, in ""party"" we are putting R at position 3 and A at position 2. That\'s different.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only tells us that the secret word has R and A but not in the positions we guessed. It doesn\'t forbid R from being in position 3 or A in position 2? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t specify which positions are forbidden for A and R? The symbols are per letter independently? No, the symbol applies to the letter at that specific position.\n\n So R was not in position 2? Yes, because it was marked as \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are not allowed for R and A respectively? Yes.\n\n However, note that we can try R at position 1, and A at position 2? That would be allowed because position 2 is now allowed for R? Wait: no. We know R is not in position 2? Yes. Similarly A cannot be in position 3? But position 2 and 3 are different.\n\n Actually, we have:\n - R: cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for R was at the second position and got \'-\', meaning that the secret word has R but not at position 2? Correct.\n\n Similarly, A cannot be at position 3? Correct.\n\n Now, let\'s see in the word ""party"":\n   Position 1: P -> New letter? We don\'t know.\n   Position 2: A -> But we know A cannot be at position 3? But position 2 is not position 3? So that\'s allowed? Yes, because the constraint for A is only on position 3? It can be elsewhere? Yes.\n   Position 3: R -> But we know R cannot be at position 2? Position 3 is different? So that\'s allowed? Actually, wait: the constraint for R is only on position 2? So R can be at position 3? Yes.\n\n Therefore, ""party"" is a valid candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROAST"", but note:\n   R at position 1? That\'s allowed because previously R was tried at position 2 and wasn\'t there? So R at position 1 is a new position? Also, we have O and S and T? But what about A: in ""roast"", A is at position 4? And we also have S and T? However, note that \'S\' and \'T\' haven\'t been tested? But wait, in our feedback, no S? We haven\'t tried S? So that\'s good? Actually, we haven\'t tested any of these letters? \n\n But in ""ROAST"": \n   Position 1: R -> We know R is in the word? So that\'s good? But we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at position 2? So position 1 is a new position? \n   Position 2: O -> New letter?\n   Position 3: A -> But wait, A was marked as present but not at position 3? Exactly: so we cannot put A at position 3? Therefore, putting A at position 3 in ""roast"" would be invalid? Because it\'s the same position as before? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is not at position 3? So position 3 is bad? So we must avoid putting A at position 3? Therefore, ""roast"" has A at position 3? Which is forbidden? Because the feedback from ""crane"" says A is not at position 3? So ""roast"" would have A at position 3? That\'s invalid? Wait, no: the feedback says that in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3? So if I guess ""roast"", and the secret word has A at position 3? Then it would get a ✓? But we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, guessing ""roast"" would be inefficient? Because at position 3 I put A? Which we already know is not in that position? So that guess would not be optimal? Because we already know that A cannot be at position 3? Therefore, why test that? We want to test new positions? So avoid putting A at position 3? Similarly, avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""roast"" puts A at position 3? So that\'s a position we know is wrong? Therefore, we should avoid that? So choose words that avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2? That\'s why ""party"" is better? Because in ""party"":\n   A is at position 2? Which hasn\'t been tested? \n   R is at position 3? Which hasn\'t been tested? Actually, position 3 for R? We don\'t have any feedback? Previously we only know that position 2 is bad? So we can test position 3? \n\n Alternative word: ""TRADE""? But wait, T? We don\'t know? But note: letters we know absent are C, N, E? So T is allowed? However, in ""TRADE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5? \n   But E is absent? So we cannot use E? So ""trade"" has E? Which is absent? So that\'s invalid because we know E is absent? So we must avoid E? Therefore, ""trade"" is not possible? \n\n Another word: ""PARIS""? But note: it has S? And avoids C, N, E? \n   P, A, R, I, S? \n   Positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5)? \n   But A is at 2? Which is not position 3? So that\'s allowed? \n   R is at 3? Which is not position 2? So allowed? \n   We test new letters: P, I, S.\n\n However, ""PARIS"" is 5 letters? Yes? \n\n But note: the word must be in English? ""Paris"" is a valid word? Although it\'s a proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed? Well, typically Wordle uses only common nouns? So maybe not? \n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PARTS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)? \n\n But same issue? \n\n How about ""RAISE""? But E is absent? So avoid words with E? Or ""RAILS""? Has L? But avoids E? And has A and R? \n   R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5)? \n   But wait: R at position 1? That\'s not position 2? So allowed? \n   A at position 2? That\'s not position 3? So allowed? \n   Also, letters we haven\'t tried: I, L, S.\n\n But note: the word ""rails""? But R at position 1? Previously we had R at position 2? But we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? So that\'s a new position? \n\n However, we must avoid E? So ""rails"" is fine? \n\n But also, we know that C, N, E are absent? So avoid those? \n\n Alternatively, ""PARTY"" seems good? \n\n Let me list a few candidates: \n1. party: letters P, A, R, T, Y -> avoids C,N,E? Good? \n   Positions: A at 2? R at 3? We avoid putting A at 3? So A at 2? Which is new? R at 3? Which is new? \n\n2. rails: R at 1? Then A at 2? Then I,L,S? \n   But R at 1: not position 2? Good? \n   A at 2: not position 3? Good? \n\n3. april: but A at 1? And P, R, I, L? But wait: ""april"" is 5 letters? \n   Positions: A(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)\n\n However, we have to consider: we want to maximize the chance of hitting more letters? \n Currently, we only know R and A are present? So we want to include them both? And try to place them in possible positions? \n\n Also, we want to test more letters to eliminate? \n\n Let\'s see: In the first guess, we tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E? We got two hits? \n\n Now, in the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? And preserve the two known letters? \n\n So, ""party"": uses P, A, R, T, Y -> new letters: P, T, Y? And retains A and R? That uses 3 new letters? Good? \n\n Similarly, ""rails"": uses R, A, I, L, S? New letters: I, L, S? Also 3 new letters? \n\n But note: we also have to consider the position? Because we don\'t know the positions? So which word to pick? \n\n Perhaps pick one that has A and R in positions that are likely? For example, avoiding positions that were bad? \n\n How about ""tramp""? T, R, A, M, P? \n   Positions: T(1), R(2)? But wait: position 2 for R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? So that\'s bad? Because if we put R at position 2? Then we already know it\'s wrong? So we shouldn\'t do that? \n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2? And avoid putting A at position 3? \n\n So, ""tramp"": R at 2? Bad? Avoid? \n\n Similarly, ""party"": R is at position 3? Which we haven\'t tested? And A is at position 2? Which we haven\'t tested? But wait: we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? And A at position 3 was wrong? But positions 2 and 3 are different? We can test A at position 2? That\'s fine? \n\n However, note: in ""party"", R is at position 3? We have no constraints on position 3? So we can test? \n\n Therefore, I think ""party"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""raspy"": \n   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5)? \n   R at 1? Not 2? Good? \n   A at 2? Not 3? Good? \n   But also tests S, P, Y? \n\n However, we don\'t know about S? \n\n But note: we want to cover common letters? P, T, S? Let me decide? \n\n Since we already thought of ""party"", let me go with that? \n\n But wait, the word ""party"" has R at position 3? We should also remember that position 3 was previously where A was? And we know A is present? So it could be that R is at a different position? \n\n Alternatively, we might get lucky? \n\n So I will guess ""party"".\n\n Therefore, next guess: ""party""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 (respectively).\n- The secret word contains R and A, with positions to be determined.\n\nFor my next guess, I want to:\n1. Include both R and A in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 3 for A).\n2. Avoid letters C, N, and E (ruled out).\n3. Test new common letters like P, T, Y to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""party"" fits these criteria:\n- Positions: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n- A is at position 2 (new position, avoids position 3)\n- R is at position 3 (new position, avoids position 2)\n- Tests new letters: P, T, Y\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: crane**\n- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nThis means:\n  - C, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n\n**Guess 2: party**\n- Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(✓)\nThis means:\n  - P and T are not in the secret word.\n  - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""party"" A is the second letter).\n  - R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because feedback shows R(-)).\n  - Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since in ""party"" Y is the fifth letter).\n\nSo, what we know now:\n1. The secret word has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.\n   - Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ Y\n2. We also know R is present but not in position 3 (since we have feedback R(-) at position 3). Moreover, we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2.\n   - Since position 2 is A and position 5 is Y, R must be in either position 1 or position 4? Because positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? \n   - But note: position 2 is A? and position 5 is Y? So available positions for R are 1, 3, 4? But wait: we tried R at position 3 in ""party"" and got \'-\', meaning it is not at position 3? So R cannot be at position 3? \n   - Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 4? \n   - But also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2? and we know position 2 is now A? So R cannot be at position 2? That\'s already covered? and now we also know R not at position 3? \n   - So R must be at position 1 or position 4? \n3. We know the secret word contains R? Yes? \n4. Additionally, the secret word must not contain: C, P, T, N, E? And we have the letters known?\n\nAlso, we must consider: are there any other constraints? We have feedback only.\n\nTherefore, the secret word pattern is: \n  Position 1: could be R or something else? \n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: ??? (but cannot be R? because we tried R at position 3? So R not at 3? But what about other letters? \n  Position 4: Could be R? Or something else?\n  Position 5: Y (fixed)\n\nSo the word pattern: [position1] A [position3] [position4] Y\n\nAnd R must be either at position1 or position4? \n\nBut note: what about other letters that might be present? We have tested:\n- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are present? But already accounted? And others absent? \n- In guess2: P, A, R, T, Y -> A and Y present? And A and Y confirmed? R present? But P and T absent? \n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? \n\nSo the letters we are avoiding: C, E, N, P, T? \n\nNow, we must form a word that: \n- has the format _ A _ _ Y\n- contains R? which must be at position1 or position4? \n- and two more letters? at position3 and position4? OR if R is at position1? then position3 and position4? If R is at position4? then position1 and position3? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know what other letters? But we must avoid the absent letters? \n\nSo, we need to find a valid English word that matches: _ A _ _ Y? \n\nMoreover, since we have limited tries? we can guess a word that helps us narrow down? \n\nBut note: we have 4 more tries? But let\'s try to guess one that covers the possibilities? \n\nPossibilities: \n\nCase 1: R at position1? Then word: R A _ _ Y? \n   Then we must choose letters for position3 and position4? Which are different? and not the absent ones? \n\nCase 2: R at position4? Then word: _ A _ R Y? \n\nNow, we have to choose a word? But note: the word must be 5 letters? \n\nAlso, we don\'t have information about position3? So we need to guess a word that includes R in either position1 or position4? and also tests other letters? \n\nList possible words:\n\nFirst, words with R at position1? \n   Format: R A _ _ Y? \n   Possible words: \n      RAINY? But N is absent? Not allowed? Because N was guessed and absent? \n      RALLY? But L at position3? and L at position4? And Y at end? Also, note \'A\' at position2? \n      RALLY: letters R, A, L, L, Y? But duplicate L? But note: in the feedback? We haven\'t encountered duplicates? So possible? \n\nBut we must check the absent letters: N, E, P, T? So RALLY? \n   Letters: R, A, L, L, Y -> none of C,E,N,P? But wait, absent are C, E, N, P, T? So L is okay? \n   But the word ""rally"" exists? \n\nSimilarly, other words: \n   RABBY? Not a word? \n   RADLY? Not a word? \n   RAMMY? Not common? \n   How about ""RASPY""? But we know P is absent? So not? \n   ""RARLY""? Not a word? \n   ""RAVEL""? But E is absent? \n   So common words: RALLY, RABID? But B and D? ""RABID"" has B and D? Which we haven\'t tested? But D? \n   But wait: ""RABID"" has I at position4? and D at position5? But our pattern requires position5=Y? So it must end with Y? So no? \n\nTherefore, RALLY seems a candidate? \n\nAlternatively, words with R at position4? \n   Format: _ A _ R Y? \n   Possible words: \n      WARY? Not 5 letters? \n      CHARM? But C and H? C is absent? \n      CARVY? Not a word? \n      DAIRY? D, A, I, R, Y? \n      Also, FAIRY? F, A, I, R, Y? \n      Also, HAIRY? H, A, I, R, Y? \n      Also, LAIRY? Not common? \n      Also, MAIRY? Not common? \n      Also, WAIRY? Not common? \n      So possible: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nTherefore, we have two sets:\n- RALLY: meaning R at position1? And L at position3 and4? \n- Or words like FAIRY, which have F at position1? I at position3? R at position4? \n\nBut note: in FAIRY: position1=F, position2=A, position3=I, position4=R, position5=Y? \n\nBut we must avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T? So F, I, are okay? Because we haven\'t tested them? \n\nTherefore, we have multiple possibilities? \n\nBut we need to choose a word that: \n   Is a candidate? Or we choose a word that can cover? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple letters? \n\nBut note: we know A at 2 and Y at 5? So we must generate words accordingly? \n\nBut we don\'t have to choose a candidate? We can choose any word? \n\nAlso, we are limited by the absent letters? So we avoid using absent letters? \n\nWe also want to test letters? \n\nBut note: we have R that must be placed? \n\nMoreover, we already know R is somewhere? So if we put R at position1? Then we can test new letters? \n\nSimilarly, if we put R at position4? We test the other? \n\nBut we don\'t know which? \n\nTherefore, perhaps create a word that tests both? How? \n\nBut we cannot? Because the pattern forces either R at1 or4? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that does not have R? But wait? no? because we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Because if we don\'t, we will get x for R? which would be confusing? But we know R is present? \n\nBut we can? Actually, we are forced to include R? Because we know it must be in the word? \n\nBut guess validation: the word must be valid? \n\nSo, let\'s think: we can choose a word that has R? \n\nWe can also choose a word that tests new letters? \n\nBut we have tried: \n  Guess1: C, R, A, N, E? \n  Guess2: P, A, R, T, Y? \nSo letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, T, Y? \n\nAvailable common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? \n\nBut in the word? we know A and Y? So we are to fill positions1,3,4? \n\nAnd R? must be at position1 or position4? \n\nSo: \n  If position1 is R? Then word: R A _ _ Y? Then we need two letters at position3 and position4? \n  If position4 is R? Then word: _ A _ R Y? Then we need positions1 and position3? \n\nNow, for the guess? we want to maximize information? So ideally choose a word that covers letters we haven\'t tested? \n\nBut we have two distinct cases? \n\nSo, how to resolve? \n\nWe could choose a word like ""FAIRY"" if we think R is at position4? Or ""RALLY"" if we think R is at position1? \n\nBut what if none? \n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t commit? But we have to include R? \n\nBut let me see what common words exist? \n\nPattern: R A _ _ Y -> possibilities? \n   RALLY? (L,L) -> duplicate? Note that feedback hasn\'t indicated duplicates? But possible? \n   RADII? But not ending with Y? \n   RADIO? Not ending with Y? \n   RANDY? But N and D? But N is absent? So no? \n   RAVIOLI? Too long? \n   So common: RALLY? \n\nPattern: _ A _ R Y -> \n   Letters: ? A ? R Y? Then ? must be letters? \n   First letter: must be a consonant? Or vowel? \n   Common words: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nTherefore, we have candidate words: FAIRY, HAIRY, DAIRY? RALLY? \n\nNote: in RALLY? There is double L? So it uses L? and we haven\'t tested L? \n\nIn FAIRY? F and I? We haven\'t tested? \n\nSince we have no information? perhaps choose one? \n\nBut we can also think of a word that doesn\'t fit either pattern? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A and Y at positions? \n\nSo we must respect the pattern? \n\nMoreover, note: we have to avoid absent letters? \n\nTherefore, I propose to choose ""FAIRY"":\n\nIf we choose ""FAIRY"":\n   Positions: F(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5)? \n   Then, this would test:\n      F: if present? But if we get F with ✓? Then we know? If F with - or x? \n      I: at position3? \n      R: at position4? We expect R at position4? so should be ✓? because we put R at a position that might be correct? \n\nBut note: we are not sure? \n\nIf the secret word is ""fairy""? Then we win? \n\nIf not? Then we get feedback? \n\nAlternative: choose ""rally""?\n\nIf we choose ""RALLY"":\n   Positions: R(1) A(2) L(3) L(4) Y(5)\n   Then R at position1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n   But also duplicate L? \n\nBut the word ""rally"" is a word? \n\nHowever, we can choose a word that includes more new letters? \n\nAnother candidate: ""MARVY""? But M, A, R, V, Y? Position: M(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5)? But wait: in feedback for party? R was at position3? And we got \'-\', meaning R is not at position3? So in ""MARVY"", R is at position3? Which we already know is incorrect? So it would get \'-\' for R? That doesn\'t add? \n\nTherefore, avoid putting R at position3? But in ""MARVY""? it would be at position3? So we know? don\'t? \n\nSo, back? \n\nWe have two possibilities: \n- If R is at position1: then words like RALLY? \n- If R is at position4: words like FAIRY? \n\nNow to decide? \n\nWe can choose FAIRY? Because it uses F and I? which are common? \n\nAlternatively, choose ""HAIRY"" or ""DAIRY""? Same? \n\nBut let me choose FAIRY? That way we test F and I? \n\nBut if the word turns out to be RALLY? Then we get feedback? \n\nBut we don\'t have more information? \n\nSo yes? \n\nBut we must include R? \n\nSo FAIRY: includes R? \n\nTherefore, I will guess ""fairy"".\n\nBut note: in FAIRY? we are putting R at position4? which might be correct? If the secret word is fairy? Then done? \n\nIf not? we get feedback? \n\nTherefore, guess: ""fairy""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, N, and E are absent. R and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3 (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).\n- From Guess 2 (""party""): P and T are absent. A is confirmed at position 2, and Y is confirmed at position 5. R is present but not at position 3.\n\n**Key insights:**\n- The secret word must have the format: `[?] A [?] [?] Y` (position 2 is A, position 5 is Y).\n- R must be present and can only be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is occupied by A, and positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for R).\n- Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T (to be avoided in the new guess).\n- Valid words must include R and fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters not yet tested or ruled out.\n\n**Reasoning for this guess:**\nTo resolve the position of R (position 1 or 4) efficiently, we target common words fitting the pattern `[?] A [?] [?] Y`. Strong candidates include:\n- **fairy**: Positional fit: `F A I R Y`. Tests F at position 1, I at position 3, and R at position 4. These are new letters, and R at position 4 could confirm a plausible candidate.\n- Alternatives like ""dairy"", ""hairy"", ""rally"" were considered, but ""fairy"" uses common consonants (F, I) and maximizes new information.\n\nIf ""fairy"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on F, I, and R’s position will reduce possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>fairy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: fairy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess ""fairy"": F(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- F is not in the secret word.\n- A, I, R, Y are all in the correct positions.\n\nSo, the feedback for ""fairy"" is:\n  Position 1: F (x) -> not present\n  Position 2: A (✓) -> correct and in position\n  Position 3: I (✓) -> correct and in position\n  Position 4: R (✓) -> correct and in position\n  Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct and in position\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: R\n  Position 5: Y\n\nAnd position 1 is not F, and F is absent.\n\nAlso, from the pattern, the secret word is: _ A I R Y\n\nWe only need to determine the first letter.\n\nWhat can the first letter be?\n- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""AIRY"".\n- It cannot be any of the letters we know are absent: C, E, N, P, T, F (from previous feedback).\n\nFrom guess1: absent: C, N, E\nFrom guess2: absent: P, T\nFrom guess3: absent: F\n\nSo absent letters: C, E, F, N, P, T\n\nWe need to find a letter for the first position that is not in the absent list and that makes a valid 5-letter word.\n\nPossible words that end with ""AIRY"":\n- DAIRY: D is not in the absent list?

We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""dairy"": D(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- D is not in the secret word (and since it's the only new letter, we know D is absent).
- A, I, R, Y are still in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).

So the secret word is: ? A I R Y

And we know D is absent.

Now, we have only one unknown: the letter at position 1.

We know the absent letters so far: C, E, N, P, T, F, D (from guesses).

We need to find a letter for position 1 such that the entire word is a valid English word.

Possible words:
- HAIRY: H at position 1? 
- Also, LAIRY? L at position 1?
- Other rare words? 

But note: we have not tested H or L? 

Therefore, the candidates are:
- HAIRY
- LAIRY

We must choose between these two? 

We can choose ""hairy"" because H is a common letter? 

But we have no frequency? 

Or to maximize information? But we already have the pattern? So we can try ""hairy"" and if correct? Done? If not? Then must be ""lairy""? 

So I will guess ""hairy"".

But note: we have two possibilities? But we are on the fifth guess? We have one more after this? 

So we can guess one? 

Therefore, <guess>hairy</guess> 

Rationale: After ""dairy"" is ruled out (D absent), the two remaining candidates are ""hairy"" and ""lairy"". ""Hairy"" is more common and thus prioritized.

  - `D` is **absent**.  
  - `A`, `I`, `R`, `Y` remain **correct** at positions 2, 3, 4, 5.  
  - Confirms secret word is `? A I R Y` (position 1 ≠ D).  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Structure**:  
   - The word must be of the form `? A I R Y`.  
   - Only position 1 remains unknown.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `N`, `P`, `T` are ruled out.  

3. **Possible Candidates**:  
   The first letter must:  
   - Form a valid English word ending in `AIRY`.  
   - Not be an absent letter.  
   - **Valid options**:  
     - `HAIRY` (H at position 1)  
     - `LAIRY` (L at position 1, British English slang for ""cheeky"" or ""flashy"").  

4. **Strategy**:  
   - `HAIRY` is prioritized over `LAIRY` due to higher frequency in common English usage.  
   - If incorrect, the solution must be `LAIRY` (to be tested in the next guess).  

<guess>hairy</guess>",hairy,"We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""dairy"": D(x) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- D is not in the secret word (and since it's the only new letter, we know D is absent).
- A, I, R, Y are still in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).

So the secret word is: ? A I R Y

And we know D is absent.

Now, we have only one unknown: the letter at position 1.

We know the absent letters so far: C, E, N, P, T, F, D (from guesses).

We need to find a letter for position 1 such that the entire word is a valid English word.

Possible words:
- HAIRY: H at position 1? 
- Also, LAIRY? L at position 1?
- Other rare words? 

But note: we have not tested H or L? 

Therefore, the candidates are:
- HAIRY
- LAIRY

We must choose between these two? 

We can choose ""hairy"" because H is a common letter? 

But we have no frequency? 

Or to maximize information? But we already have the pattern? So we can try ""hairy"" and if correct? Done? If not? Then must be ""lairy""? 

So I will guess ""hairy"".

But note: we have two possibilities? But we are on the fifth guess? We have one more after this? 

So we can guess one? 

Therefore, <guess>hairy</guess> 

Rationale: After ""dairy"" is ruled out (D absent), the two remaining candidates are ""hairy"" and ""lairy"". ""Hairy"" is more common and thus prioritized.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
