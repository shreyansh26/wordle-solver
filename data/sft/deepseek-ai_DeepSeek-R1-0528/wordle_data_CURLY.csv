We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-', meaning wrong position).
 - A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 So, the secret word:
 - Starts with C.
 - Contains the letter R, but not in position 2.
 - Does not contain A, N, or E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints:
 - The word must start with C (from the ✓ on C).
 - The word must contain R, but R cannot be in the second position (because in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).

 Also, we know the word does not have A, N, or E.

 We need to think of words that start with C and contain R, avoiding A, N, E.

 Possible letters: Since A, N, E are out, we focus on other vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: O, I, U (but note: Y is sometimes a vowel, but also consonant).
 Consonants: Many others like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z, etc.

 We also know R must appear somewhere from position 3 to 5 (since position 2 is excluded for R).

 Let's list some possibilities:
 - Words starting with C and having R: e.g., ""crisp"", ""crisp""? But note we don't know about I or S or P yet.

 But note: in the first guess, we used C,R,A,N,E so we must avoid A,N,E.

 Some candidate words: 
   ""curry"" -> but has double R? 
   ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> not necessarily, but we don't know about H,O,D.
   ""crypt"" -> C R Y P T -> R is in position 2? But we got '-' for R in position 2 meaning it shouldn't be in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that would be bad? Actually, the feedback told us R is not in position 2, so in the new guess we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, our next guess should try to have R in a different position (i.e., not second).

 Since the word starts with C, and R is present but not in second position, possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 We should avoid repeating the letters that were already guessed and found absent: A, N, E.

 Let's think of words that start with C, have R in positions 3,4, or 5, and use new letters.

 Examples:
 - Position 3: e.g., ""co_ _ _"", but what? We don't know. How about ""charm""? Wait, but A is not allowed? A was absent, so we cannot use A. Since A is out, ""charm"" is invalid because it has A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word. So we cannot include A in the guess.

 Similarly, avoid N and E.

 Possible words:
 - R at position 3: ""c_ R _ _"", e.g., ""curry"" -> C U R R Y -> but note we don't know about U and Y. Also, it has double R? But we don't know if R is repeated? The feedback only said there is an R, but possibly more? We don't know. But we can use such words.

 - R at position 4: ""c_ _ R _"", e.g., ""court"" -> C O U R T -> but O, U, T are new.

 - R at position 5: ""c_ _ _ R"", e.g., ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> but second letter H? We don't know.

 We also want to cover common letters to get more information.

 Another idea: since we know position 1 is C, and R is present somewhere else, we can try a word that puts R in position 3,4 or 5 and uses other common letters.

 Let me list common letters that we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.

 We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence yet.

 Since we don't have E or A, common vowels left are O, I, U.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C, avoids positions 1 and 2 for R (but position 1 is fixed as C so R won't go there) and R not in position 2.

 Candidate: ""curbs"" -> C U R B S -> R in position 3? Checks: no A,N,E, and R is in position 3 (so not 2). But is it a valid word? Yes, curbs is a word.

 Another: ""crisp"" -> but R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. So ""crisp"" is not okay because R is in position 2.

 What about ""crops""? C R O P S -> again, R is in position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2.

 So we must not put R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that start with C and have R in positions 3,4,5.

 Let me think of words:
 - With R in position 3: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> letters U, L, Y are new.
 - ""curvy"" -> C U R V Y -> V and Y new.
 - ""curds"" -> C U R D S -> D and S new.

 - With R in position 4: ""court"" -> C O U R T -> O, U, T new.
 - ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> H, O, D new.
 - ""churn"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So invalid because N is not allowed? But the word ""churn"" has N? So avoid it.

 - With R in position 5: ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> H, O, I new.
 - ""cedar"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So avoid.

 We need a word without A, E, N. 

 I think ""court"" is a good candidate because it introduces O, U, R, T and R is in position 4 (so we test the position). Also, position 2 is O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" is good because it tests D and S.

 But let me see which letters cover more common? S is a very common letter.

 Also note: we must not reuse the absent letters (A, E, N).

 Another word: ""curio"" -> C U R I O -> R in position 3? But it is 5 letters? ""curio"" is 5 letters: C U R I O -> R is in position 3? Wait, positions: 
  1: C
  2: U
  3: R
  4: I
  5: O
 So it is valid? Yes.

 But perhaps ""crypt"" is more common? ""crypt"": C R Y P T -> but R is in position 2 -> avoid! So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

 So back to words without R in second.

 Another word: ""crowd"" -> C R O W D -> again, R in position 2 -> avoid.

 So we must only consider words with R in positions 3,4,5.

 Let me choose ""curly"": 
  C U R L Y
  This introduces U (vowel), L, Y (can be vowel or consonant).

 Or ""curbs"": 
  C U R B S
  Introduces U, B, S.

 Since S is more common, maybe ""curbs"" is better? But we want to cover letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 5? 

 Word: ""civic"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word? Wait, the word must include R.

 So the word must have R somewhere from 3 to 5.

 So how about ""comic""? That doesn't have R. So we must include R.

 So what about ""circa""? But C is already in position 1? And it has A? A is absent, so avoid.

 Okay, let's choose ""curbs"": 
   C - position 1: we know it's correct and we'll get ✓ for that.
   We put U at position 2: we don't know about U? It could be present or absent? but we haven't tested U before.
   R at position 3: we hope to check if R is at position 3? 
   B at position 4: new letter.
   S at position 5: new letter.

 But also, we can consider testing multiple letters? 

 Another word: ""chirp"" -> C H I R P -> but R is in position 4? However, we don't know about H,I,P. And it doesn't have A,E,N. But also, note that the word starts with C, so H is at position 2? 

 But we have never tested position 2? So we might get information about H? 

 Similarly, in ""curbs"", U is at position 2? 

 So both are options.

 However, ""chirp"" avoids using U, but we don't know if U is in the word? We might want to test U? 

 But note, the secret word might have other vowels? Since A,E are absent, the vowel must be O,I,U, or Y? 

 We should prioritize checking vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, we can use ""proxy"" but not starting with C? We must start with C? So no.

 Another word: ""crypt"" but we can't because of R in position 2.

 What about ""crock""? But it has two C's? And we already know C is at the start? But the word has C at both start and end? But the secret word has C at position 1, and we don't know about other positions? However, we haven't tested C in other positions? But the feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was in position 1. However, it's possible the word has more than one C? The feedback didn't indicate that. But we don't know.

 Actually, the feedback only marked the C in position 1 as correct. If there were another C, we would have seen another ✓ or - for the other occurrence? But we didn't? But we didn't have any other C? So we don't know.

 So we can consider words with repeated C? But we don't have evidence, so let's avoid for now.

 Considering the options, I think ""court"" is a strong candidate:
   C O U R T
   Positions: 
     1: C (will be ✓)
     2: O (new letter, vowel)
     3: U (new letter, vowel)
     4: R (testing R in position 4? Since we know it's not in position 2, and we haven't tried position 4)
     5: T (new letter, common consonant)

 But note: we have already ruled out A,E,N. So O,U,T are all new.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" uses D and S? 

 But ""court"" uses two vowels (O and U) which might be helpful? And T is common.

 Another candidate: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> L and Y.

 Let's pick ""court"" for now? 

 But we must also avoid using letters we know are absent? And we are only avoiding A,E,N.

 So, I choose ""court"": 
   C O U R T

 But let me double-check: 
   - It has R in position 4? Yes, which is not position 2? Correct.
   - No A,E,N? Correct.

 Also, it's a common word.

 Alternatively, ""curbs"" is another good candidate? 

 To make a decision: I think trying a word that covers more vowels might be good? ""court"" has two vowels: O and U? But O is in position 2 and U in position 3? 

 But ""curbs"" has U at position 2 and that's the only vowel? 

 So ""court"" might give us more information about vowels.

 However, note the first guess had R at position 2 (in ""crane"") which was misplaced, so R is in the word but not at pos2? That doesn't prevent the word from having a vowel at pos2? So position2 might be a vowel? 

 Also, the secret word: since it starts with C, and we don't have E, then the second letter might be O, U, I? Or even H? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""court"".

 But wait: the word ""court"" has O at position2? We haven't tested position2 at all? So we can get information about position2? And U at position3? 

 Also, we should note that we are testing T at the end? 

 So let's guess ""court"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓ for C: Correct letter in correct position (position 1)
- - for R: R is in the word but not in position 2
- x for A, N, E: None of these letters are in the word

For the second guess:
- Must start with C (position 1 confirmed)
- Must include R, but **not** in position 2
- Cannot use A, N, or E
- Ideal to test new common letters for positions 2-5

Best strategy:  
- Select a word starting with C that places R in positions 3–5 to test new locations  
- Include vowels not yet tested (O, U, I) and common consonants  
- Avoid reused letters (A, N, E) and R in position 2  

Chosen word: **COURT**  
- C in position 1 (verifies existing known)  
- O in position 2 (tests a new vowel)  
- U in position 3 (tests another vowel)  
- R in position 4 (tests R away from position 2)  
- T in position 5 (tests a common consonant)

 Actually, the feedback only marked the C in position 1 as correct. If there were another C, we would have seen another ✓ or - for the other occurrence? But we didn't? But we didn't have any other C? So we don't know.

 So we can consider words with repeated C? But we don't have evidence, so let's avoid for now.

 Considering the options, I think ""court"" is a strong candidate:
   C O U R T
   Positions: 
     1: C (will be ✓)
     2: O (new letter, vowel)
     3: U (new letter, vowel)
     4: R (testing R in position 4? Since we know it's not in position 2, and we haven't tried position 4)
     5: T (new letter, common consonant)

 But note: we have already ruled out A,E,N. So O,U,T are all new.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" uses D and S? 

 But ""court"" uses two vowels (O and U) which might be helpful? And T is common.

 Another candidate: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> L and Y.

 Let's pick ""court"" for now? 

 But we must also avoid using letters we know are absent? And we are only avoiding A,E,N.

 So, I choose ""court"": 
   C O U R T

 But let me double-check: 
   - It has R in position 4? Yes, which is not position 2? Correct.
   - No A,E,N? Correct.

 Also, it's a common word.

 Alternatively, ""curbs"" is another good candidate? 

 To make a decision: I think trying a word that covers more vowels might be good? ""court"" has two vowels: O and U? But O is in position 2 and U in position 3? 

 But ""curbs"" has U at position 2 and that's the only vowel? 

 So ""court"" might give us more information about vowels.

 However, note the first guess had R at position 2 (in ""crane"") which was misplaced, so R is in the word but not at pos2? That doesn't prevent the word from having a vowel at pos2? So position2 might be a vowel? 

 Also, the secret word: since it starts with C, and we don't have E, then the second letter might be O, U, I? Or even H? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""court"".

 But wait: the word ""court"" has O at position2? We haven't tested position2 at all? So we can get information about position2? And U at position3? 

 Also, we should note that we are testing T at the end? 

 So let's guess ""court"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓ for C: Correct letter in correct position (position 1)
- - for R: R is in the word but not in position 2
- x for A, N, E: None of these letters are in the word

For the second guess:
- Must start with C (position 1 confirmed)
- Must include R, but **not** in position 2
- Cannot use A, N, or E
- Ideal to test new common letters for positions 2-5

Best strategy:  
- Select a word starting with C that places R in positions 3–5 to test new locations  
- Include vowels not yet tested (O, U, I) and common consonants  
- Avoid reused letters (A, N, E) and R in position 2  

Chosen word: **COURT**  
- C in position 1 (verifies existing known)  
- O in position 2 (tests a new vowel)  
- U in position 3 (tests another vowel)  
- R in position 4 (tests R away from position 2)  
- T in position 5 (tests a common consonant)",Guess 2: court -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(-) R(-) T(x),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-', meaning wrong position).
 - A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 So, the secret word:
 - Starts with C.
 - Contains the letter R, but not in position 2.
 - Does not contain A, N, or E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints:
 - The word must start with C (from the ✓ on C).
 - The word must contain R, but R cannot be in the second position (because in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).

 Also, we know the word does not have A, N, or E.

 We need to think of words that start with C and contain R, avoiding A, N, E.

 Possible letters: Since A, N, E are out, we focus on other vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: O, I, U (but note: Y is sometimes a vowel, but also consonant).
 Consonants: Many others like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z, etc.

 We also know R must appear somewhere from position 3 to 5 (since position 2 is excluded for R).

 Let's list some possibilities:
 - Words starting with C and having R: e.g., ""crisp"", ""crisp""? But note we don't know about I or S or P yet.

 But note: in the first guess, we used C,R,A,N,E so we must avoid A,N,E.

 Some candidate words: 
   ""curry"" -> but has double R? 
   ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> not necessarily, but we don't know about H,O,D.
   ""crypt"" -> C R Y P T -> R is in position 2? But we got '-' for R in position 2 meaning it shouldn't be in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that would be bad? Actually, the feedback told us R is not in position 2, so in the new guess we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, our next guess should try to have R in a different position (i.e., not second).

 Since the word starts with C, and R is present but not in second position, possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 We should avoid repeating the letters that were already guessed and found absent: A, N, E.

 Let's think of words that start with C, have R in positions 3,4, or 5, and use new letters.

 Examples:
 - Position 3: e.g., ""co_ _ _"", but what? We don't know. How about ""charm""? Wait, but A is not allowed? A was absent, so we cannot use A. Since A is out, ""charm"" is invalid because it has A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word. So we cannot include A in the guess.

 Similarly, avoid N and E.

 Possible words:
 - R at position 3: ""c_ R _ _"", e.g., ""curry"" -> C U R R Y -> but note we don't know about U and Y. Also, it has double R? But we don't know if R is repeated? The feedback only said there is an R, but possibly more? We don't know. But we can use such words.

 - R at position 4: ""c_ _ R _"", e.g., ""court"" -> C O U R T -> but O, U, T are new.

 - R at position 5: ""c_ _ _ R"", e.g., ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> but second letter H? We don't know.

 We also want to cover common letters to get more information.

 Another idea: since we know position 1 is C, and R is present somewhere else, we can try a word that puts R in position 3,4 or 5 and uses other common letters.

 Let me list common letters that we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.

 We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence yet.

 Since we don't have E or A, common vowels left are O, I, U.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C, avoids positions 1 and 2 for R (but position 1 is fixed as C so R won't go there) and R not in position 2.

 Candidate: ""curbs"" -> C U R B S -> R in position 3? Checks: no A,N,E, and R is in position 3 (so not 2). But is it a valid word? Yes, curbs is a word.

 Another: ""crisp"" -> but R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. So ""crisp"" is not okay because R is in position 2.

 What about ""crops""? C R O P S -> again, R is in position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2.

 So we must not put R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that start with C and have R in positions 3,4,5.

 Let me think of words:
 - With R in position 3: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> letters U, L, Y are new.
 - ""curvy"" -> C U R V Y -> V and Y new.
 - ""curds"" -> C U R D S -> D and S new.

 - With R in position 4: ""court"" -> C O U R T -> O, U, T new.
 - ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> H, O, D new.
 - ""churn"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So invalid because N is not allowed? But the word ""churn"" has N? So avoid it.

 - With R in position 5: ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> H, O, I new.
 - ""cedar"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So avoid.

 We need a word without A, E, N. 

 I think ""court"" is a good candidate because it introduces O, U, R, T and R is in position 4 (so we test the position). Also, position 2 is O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" is good because it tests D and S.

 But let me see which letters cover more common? S is a very common letter.

 Also note: we must not reuse the absent letters (A, E, N).

 Another word: ""curio"" -> C U R I O -> R in position 3? But it is 5 letters? ""curio"" is 5 letters: C U R I O -> R is in position 3? Wait, positions: 
  1: C
  2: U
  3: R
  4: I
  5: O
 So it is valid? Yes.

 But perhaps ""crypt"" is more common? ""crypt"": C R Y P T -> but R is in position 2 -> avoid! So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

 So back to words without R in second.

 Another word: ""crowd"" -> C R O W D -> again, R in position 2 -> avoid.

 So we must only consider words with R in positions 3,4,5.

 Let me choose ""curly"": 
  C U R L Y
  This introduces U (vowel), L, Y (can be vowel or consonant).

 Or ""curbs"": 
  C U R B S
  Introduces U, B, S.

 Since S is more common, maybe ""curbs"" is better? But we want to cover letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 5? 

 Word: ""civic"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word? Wait, the word must include R.

 So the word must have R somewhere from 3 to 5.

 So how about ""comic""? That doesn't have R. So we must include R.

 So what about ""circa""? But C is already in position 1? And it has A? A is absent, so avoid.

 Okay, let's choose ""curbs"": 
   C - position 1: we know it's correct and we'll get ✓ for that.
   We put U at position 2: we don't know about U? It could be present or absent? but we haven't tested U before.
   R at position 3: we hope to check if R is at position 3? 
   B at position 4: new letter.
   S at position 5: new letter.

 But also, we can consider testing multiple letters? 

 Another word: ""chirp"" -> C H I R P -> but R is in position 4? However, we don't know about H,I,P. And it doesn't have A,E,N. But also, note that the word starts with C, so H is at position 2? 

 But we have never tested position 2? So we might get information about H? 

 Similarly, in ""curbs"", U is at position 2? 

 So both are options.

 However, ""chirp"" avoids using U, but we don't know if U is in the word? We might want to test U? 

 But note, the secret word might have other vowels? Since A,E are absent, the vowel must be O,I,U, or Y? 

 We should prioritize checking vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, we can use ""proxy"" but not starting with C? We must start with C? So no.

 Another word: ""crypt"" but we can't because of R in position 2.

 What about ""crock""? But it has two C's? And we already know C is at the start? But the word has C at both start and end? But the secret word has C at position 1, and we don't know about other positions? However, we haven't tested C in other positions? But the feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was in position 1. However, it's possible the word has more than one C? The feedback didn't indicate that. But we don't know.

 Actually, the feedback only marked the C in position 1 as correct. If there were another C, we would have seen another ✓ or - for the other occurrence? But we didn't? But we didn't have any other C? So we don't know.

 So we can consider words with repeated C? But we don't have evidence, so let's avoid for now.

 Considering the options, I think ""court"" is a strong candidate:
   C O U R T
   Positions: 
     1: C (will be ✓)
     2: O (new letter, vowel)
     3: U (new letter, vowel)
     4: R (testing R in position 4? Since we know it's not in position 2, and we haven't tried position 4)
     5: T (new letter, common consonant)

 But note: we have already ruled out A,E,N. So O,U,T are all new.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" uses D and S? 

 But ""court"" uses two vowels (O and U) which might be helpful? And T is common.

 Another candidate: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> L and Y.

 Let's pick ""court"" for now? 

 But we must also avoid using letters we know are absent? And we are only avoiding A,E,N.

 So, I choose ""court"": 
   C O U R T

 But let me double-check: 
   - It has R in position 4? Yes, which is not position 2? Correct.
   - No A,E,N? Correct.

 Also, it's a common word.

 Alternatively, ""curbs"" is another good candidate? 

 To make a decision: I think trying a word that covers more vowels might be good? ""court"" has two vowels: O and U? But O is in position 2 and U in position 3? 

 But ""curbs"" has U at position 2 and that's the only vowel?

 But wait: the word ""court"" has O at position2? We haven't tested position2 at all? So we can get information about position2? And U at position3? 

 Also, we should note that we are testing T at the end? 

 So let's guess ""court"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓ for C: Correct letter in correct position (position 1)
- - for R: R is in the word but not in position 2
- x for A, N, E: None of these letters are in the word

For the second guess:

So we might get information about H? \n\n Similarly, in ""curbs"", U is at position 2? \n\n So both are options.\n\n However, ""chirp"" avoids using U, but we don\'t know if U is in the word? We might want to test U? \n\n But note, the secret word might have other vowels? Since A,E are absent, the vowel must be O,I,U, or Y? \n\n We should prioritize checking vowels and common consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""proxy"" but not starting with C? We must start with C? So no.\n\n Another word: ""crypt"" but we can\'t because of R in position 2.\n\n What about ""crock""? But it has two C\'s? And we already know C is at the start? But the word has C at both start and end? But the secret word has C at position 1, and we don\'t know about other positions? However, we haven\'t tested C in other positions? But the feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was in position 1. However, it\'s possible the word has more than one C? The feedback didn\'t indicate that. But we don\'t know.\n\n Actually, the feedback only marked the C in position 1 as correct. If there were another C, we would have seen another ✓ or - for the other occurrence? But we didn\'t? But we didn\'t have any other C? So we don\'t know.\n\n So we can consider words with repeated C? But we don\'t have evidence, so let\'s avoid for now.\n\n Considering the options, I think ""court"" is a strong candidate:\n   C O U R T\n   Positions: \n     1: C (will be ✓)\n     2: O (new letter, vowel)\n     3: U (new letter, vowel)\n     4: R (testing R in position 4? Since we know it\'s not in position 2, and we haven\'t tried position 4)\n     5: T (new letter, common consonant)\n\n But note: we have already ruled out A,E,N. So O,U,T are all new.\n\n Alternatively, ""curds"" uses D and S? \n\n But ""court"" uses two vowels (O and U) which might be helpful? And T is common.\n\n Another candidate: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> L and Y.\n\n Let\'s pick ""court"" for now? \n\n But we must also avoid using letters we know are absent? And we are only avoiding A,E,N.\n\n So, I choose ""court"": \n   C O U R T\n\n But let me double-check: \n   - It has R in position 4? Yes, which is not position 2? Correct.\n   - No A,E,N? Correct.\n\n Also, it\'s a common word.\n\n Alternatively, ""curbs"" is another good candidate? \n\n To make a decision: I think trying a word that covers more vowels might be good? ""court"" has two vowels: O and U? But O is in position 2 and U in position 3? \n\n But ""curbs"" has U at position 2 and that\'s the only vowel? \n\n So ""court"" might give us more information about vowels.\n\n However, note the first guess had R at position 2 (in ""crane"") which was misplaced, so R is in the word but not at pos2? That doesn\'t prevent the word from having a vowel at pos2? So position2 might be a vowel? \n\n Also, the secret word: since it starts with C, and we don\'t have E, then the second letter might be O, U, I? Or even H? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""court"".\n\n But wait: the word ""court"" has O at position2? We haven\'t tested position2 at all? So we can get information about position2? And U at position3? \n\n Also, we should note that we are testing T at the end? \n\n So let\'s guess ""court"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ✓ for C: Correct letter in correct position (position 1)\n- - for R: R is in the word but not in position 2\n- x for A, N, E: None of these letters are in the word\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must start with C (position 1 confirmed)\n- Must include R, but **not** in position 2\n- Cannot use A, N, or E\n- Ideal to test new common letters for positions 2-5\n\nBest strategy:  \n- Select a word starting with C that places R in positions 3–5 to test new locations  \n- Include vowels not yet tested (O, U, I) and common consonants  \n- Avoid reused letters (A, N, E) and R in position 2  \n\nChosen word: **COURT**  \n- C in position 1 (verifies existing known)  \n- O in position 2 (tests a new vowel)  \n- U in position 3 (tests another vowel)  \n- R in position 4 (tests R away from position 2)  \n- T in position 5 (tests a common consonant)\n\n<guess>court</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: court -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(-) R(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is correct and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is present in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""court""):
- C is correct (position 1) – confirms the first letter.
- O is absent. So O is not in the word.
- U is present but not in position 3 (since we got '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- R is present but not in position 4 (again, '-' indicates wrong position).
- T is absent. So T is not in the word.

What we know:
- The secret word starts with C (position 1).
- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? 
  But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5? 
  However, we also have U present, and it was in position 3 in ""court"", so U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But position 1 is C, so U cannot be in position 1. Therefore, U must be in position 2,4, or 5? But note: R must be in the word and the only positions left for R are 3 and 5 (since 2 is not allowed and 4 is now not allowed?).

But wait: from the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2.
Then in the second guess, we put R in position 4 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 4? So R is in position 3 or 5? 

Similarly, U: we put U in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3? So U must be in positions 2,4, or 5? 

But note: the secret word cannot have duplicates unless they are repeated? But we don't know. However, we have not encountered any duplicate letters so far.

Now, we also have confirmed absent letters: 
- A (from first guess)
- N (from first guess)
- E (from first guess)
- O (from second guess)
- T (from second guess)

So absent: A, E, N, O, T.

We have present letters: 
- C (fixed at position 1)
- R (must be in position 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are eliminated? But note: we only tested position 4? It could be in position 5? Or position 3?)
- U (must be in position 2,4, or 5? Since it cannot be in 3)

So the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Positions 2,3,4,5: must include R and U? But not necessarily: could have R and U, but R must be somewhere? U must be somewhere? 
But note: R is already confirmed? Yes, from the first guess. And U is confirmed from the second guess.

Also, the current state:

Known positions: 
1: C
2: unknown? but cannot be O (since O absent) and cannot be R? (since R in wrong position when placed in 2). But also, U might be at 2?
3: unknown? 
4: unknown? 
5: unknown?

Constraints:

- Letter at position 2: cannot be A,E,N,O,T (absent), and if we put R in position 2 we already got it wrong? Yes. So it must be a new letter? And U could be there? Or other letters? 

But U must be in in 2,4, or 5? So position 2 is a candidate for U.

Similarly, R must be in 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are wrong? 

But wait: the second guess: R was in position 4 and we got '-', meaning R is present but not in position 4? So for R, positions 2 and 4 are wrong. Since position 1 is C, R must be in position 3 or 5? 

For U: last guess had U in position 3? We got '-' meaning U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 2,4, or 5? 

Therefore, the secret word must be:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: U? or another letter? 
3: could be R? or if not, then not R? 
4: U? or another letter? 
5: R? or U? 

But note: we have only two confirmed letters: R and U? Or we might have more letters? But we know C, R, U? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? 

But we have now: C (pos1), and then R and U? So the word must have three more letters? But we already have three letters? So including C? 

Actually: 
- C is at pos1.
- R must be at one of the remaining positions? 
- U must be at one of the remaining positions? 

But R and U could be the same? Only if the word has two R's or two U's? But we don't know. But so far, we haven't seen duplicates? 

However, it's possible? But we haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates? Because in the feedback, we didn't mark duplicate? 

But let's assume we don't have duplicates for simplicity? Since no duplicate indication? 

If we assume no duplicates: then R and U are distinct? Then the secret word has exactly these: C, R, U, plus two other letters? 

Therefore, positions:

We must assign two remaining letters? 

But we know that? 

Now, the letter pool: we have C,R,U and then two other letters? 

But which letters? 

The absent letters: A,E,N,O,T are out? 

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a word that starts with C, has R and U? 

We also know positions:

- Position 1: C
- Position 2: cannot be R? (because then we would have gotten R correct? We tried R at position2 and we got '-', meaning not there). If position2 had been R, we would have gotten a checkmark? But we did not? So R is not in position2? So position2 cannot be R? 

Similarly, position4 cannot be R? Because we put R at pos4 and got '-'? So if R were at pos4, we should have gotten a checkmark? But we got '-', meaning present but not at pos4? So R not at pos4? 

Similarly for U: we put U at pos3? If U were at pos3, we would have gotten ✓ for U? But we got '-' meaning present but not at pos3? So U is not at pos3? 

Therefore:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be one of the letters? It can be U? Since U must be at 2,4, or 5? 
- Position 3: cannot be U? So must be either R? Or something else? But R can be at pos3? 
- Position 4: cannot be R and cannot be U? Wait, no? U can be at position4? Because U might be at pos4? But position4: cannot be R? But U can be? 
- Position 5: can be R or U? 

So:

Option 1: R at pos3, U at pos2? Then positions: 
  pos2: U? 
  pos3: R? 
  then positions 4 and 5: unknowns? 

Option 2: R at pos3, U at pos4? 
  pos2: ? 
  pos3: R
  pos4: U

Option 3: R at pos3, U at pos5?
  pos2: ?
  pos3: R
  pos5: U

Option 4: R at pos5, U at pos2? 
  pos2: U
  pos3: ?
  pos5: R

Option 5: R at pos5, U at pos4? 

But wait: U can be at pos2,4,or5? 
And R must be in positions 3 or 5? 

So:
Option 1: R at pos3, U at pos2 -> then the word is: C U R ? ?
Option 2: R at pos3, U at pos4 -> C ? R U ?
Option 3: R at pos3, U at pos5 -> C ? R ? U
Option 4: R at pos5, U at pos2 -> C U ? ? R
Option 5: R at pos5, U at pos4 -> C ? ? U R

We need to fill the remaining two positions with letters that aren't A,E,N,O,T, and also not C? (unless duplicates? But no duplicate of C indicated? So we avoid C too?) 

Since position1 is C and we haven't seen duplicate feedback, we assume no duplicate C? Similarly for R and U? But we don't know? But we don't have evidence, so avoid duplicates? 

Also, we have used: C, R, U? So the other two letters must be new? 

Therefore, the secret word is one of these patterns? 

Now, common words? 

Option 1: CUR_X_? 
Example: CUR_Y? CURBY? Not a word? CURSE? But S and E? E is absent? CURRY? But R repeated? 
But note: R is repeated? In ""curry"", R at pos3 and R at pos4? But we know R is at least at one position? But it can be repeated? 

But in our previous guesses:
- In first guess, we had C R A N E: only one R? And we got R at position2 as present but mislocated? Which meant at least one R exists? 
- In second guess: C O U R T: R at pos4? We got R present but mislocated? That could be because R is at a different position? Or because there is another R? 

But if the word had two R? Then both would have been marked? In the first guess? But we only had one R? So we marked one? 

Similarly, in the second guess, we marked one R? 

So it's possible? But we don't know? 

But without evidence, we can assume only one R? Similarly for U? 

But wait: in the second guess, U was only one? 

So let's assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, in Option 1: CUR?? where the last two letters not R or U? 

Similarly, other patterns? 

Possible words:

Pattern CUR??:
- CURDS? But D and S? And D,S are not absent? 
  We guessed: ""crane"" and ""court"": for CURDS, 
  Letters: C,U,R,D,S? 
  We haven't used D or S? And A,E,N,O,T absent? 
  CURDS is a valid word: ""curds"" meaning lumps in cheese? etc.

Pattern CR?U? (R at pos3, U at pos5): 
  Example: CRUS? But that's not 5 letters? CRU? Something? CRUMB? Not 5? CRU? something? 
  CRUMP? But M and P? Not a common word? 

Alternatively, Pattern CU?R? (R at pos5? and U at pos2?): 
  Example: CUS?ER? Not common? 

More feasible:

Pattern C?R?U: 
  Example: CHURN? But N is absent? So not allowed? 

Pattern C?RU? 
  Example: CRUMB? Again, not 5? 

Let me list candidate words?

We know:
Secret word must: start with C, contain R and U? And two other letters? 

Common words: 
- CURD? But that's 4 letters? 
- CURVE? But V? Only? 
- CURRY? But it has two R's? And Y? But that would be: CURRY: positions? 
  C U R R Y
  So pattern: CURRY: 
    Position1: C (correct)
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: R? 
    Position4: R? 
    Position5: Y? 

But then we are using R twice? 

If the word is CURRY:
In first guess: ""crane"": 
  C (pos1:✓), R (pos2: -> present, but at pos2? But the secret has R at pos3 and pos4? So R is present? And we marked R at pos2 as '-' (wrong position)? 
  That applies because R is present but not at pos2? 

Then second guess ""court"":
  C (✓), O (absent? but CURRY has O? No? CURRY has O? CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y? No O? So O should be absent? Which matches? 
  U: at pos3? But in the secret, U is at pos2? So U is present but not at pos3? Should be marked '-' ? Yes? 
  R: at pos4? In secret, R at pos3 and pos4? So R at pos4? Should be ✓? Not '-'? 

But in the feedback for court: R got '-', meaning wrong position? 
But if CURRY has R at pos4? Then guess court puts R at pos4? Should be ✓? 

But we got '-' for R? So that means that in the secret word, position4 is not R? 

Therefore, CURRY would be incorrect? Because it has R at pos4? 

But we got for R in court: '-' for R? So secret word does not have R at position4? 

Therefore, CURRY has R at pos4? So it cannot be CURRY? 

Similarly, any word with R at pos4? 

So R must be at pos3 or pos5? 

Therefore, CURRY is invalid? 

Now, let's consider without duplicates? 

Pattern C U R ? ? 

Possible words: 
- CURED? Has E? E absent? 
- CURVE? But V? and E? E absent? 
- CURVY? Not common? 
- CURBS? but we have S? 
  CURBS: 
    Positions: C U R B S? 

Would it fit? 
In secret word: 
Position1: C (✓) 
Position2: U? 
Position3: R? 
Position4: B? 
Position5: S? 

Check against first guess?
Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  Positions: 
    C at1: ✓ 
    R at2: present but not at2? In secret R at3? So not at2 -> '-' -> correct?
    A: absent? CURBS has no A -> x -> correct? 
    N: absent -> x?
    E: absent? -> x?

Second guess: ""court"" -> 
  CURBS: 
    C: ✓ 
    O: absent? CURBS has no O -> x -> correct? 
    U: we put U at position3? But secret has U at position2? So U is present but at different position? '-' -> we got that? 
    R: we put R at position4? But secret has R at position3? So R present but at4? -> '-' -> correct? 
    T: absent? CURBS has no T -> x? 

So it fits? 

Another word? CURDS? Same? 

So CURBS? or CURDS?

But CURBS and CURDS both seem to fit? 

Also: 
Pattern C U ? ? R (if R at5?): 
For example: C U S R ? not common? 

Or CUL?R? 
CUBER? But E? not?

But CURBS seems a good candidate? 

But we haven't tried CUR?X? We should consider? 

What about words without U at position2? 

Pattern: C ? R U ? ? 
Example: CRUD? Not 5 letters? 

Pattern: C ? R ? U 
Example: CHIRU? Not English? 

Pattern: C ? ? U R 
e.g., CLAUR? Not word? 

So the most likely: CURxx? 

So CURBS? CURDS? CURVY? but V? 

Also: CURIO? 
CURIO: C U R I O -> positions: 
  Pos2: U 
  Pos3: R 

Then this? 
But O is absent? So CURIO? 
In the second guess: we guessed court: 
  For CURIO: 
    O is in the secret? Second guess: court: O is at position2? But CURIO has O at position5? So O is present? But the feedback for court said O is absent? 

But wait: in second guess court: 
  we got O? But our feedback says court: O -> x? meaning absent? 
Therefore, CURIO cannot be because it has O? 

Therefore, O in CURIO would be present? But we know O is absent? 

Thus, CURIO invalid? 

Similarly, any word containing O, T, A, E, N? 

Therefore, CURBS and CURDS? 
Also: CURVY? But V and Y? 

Now, CURBS: letters B,S? 
CURDS: letters D,S? 

We don't know which? 

We need to make a guess? 

I think CURBS is a valid word? 

But our previous guesses: we haven't tested B or D? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that contains R at pos5? But we don't have any obvious word? 

But note: U must be in 2,4,5? And if we avoid position2? 

Position2?:

If we make a guess that tests position2? 

We have not guessed position2? 

We know it cannot be A,E,N,O,T? So possibilities? 

But we know U can be at pos2? 

Alternatively, letters: B, C? But we cannot use C? 

We can try: CURBS? 

But let me think? We can also try to get more information? 

Since CURBS might be the word? But we don't know? 

We can also try:

Word: CHUR? But without special? 

Actually, we can try ""curbs"": C U R B S? 

Or: since we have three positions left? We need to guess? 

We have 6 tries? We are on third? 

We need to test: is U at pos2? R at pos3? Then the last two? 

But we don't know?

Alternatively, we could guess a word that has different placements? 

But we have constraints? 

We want to verify U's position? If we think U might be at pos2? 

We can make a guess that has U at pos2? That we haven't done? We haven't put U at pos2? 

First guess: U is not used? 
Second guess: U at pos3? 
So we haven't tried U at pos2? 

If we guess CUR?S? Then we are testing U at pos2? 

Similarly, we must include R? 

And avoid absent letters: A,E,N,O,T? 

So: CUR?S? 

We have: CUR?S? And ? cannot be already absent? 

Possible letters? 

So: 

Word: CURBS (B), CURDS (D), or CURFS? Not word? 

Alternatively: if we don't put that pattern? 

But to test non-CUR words? 

Pattern: C U ? ? R? 

Example: CUP?R? Not common? 

So we stick to CURxx? 

Choose CURDS? 

Because D and S? 

But CURBS is also good? 

Alternative: we can test a word that has R at position5? 

For example: 
Put U at pos2? R at pos5? Then word: C U ? ? R? 

Examples: 
CUMIN? N? Out? 
CUBER? E? Out? 
CUTEr? Too many? 
So? 

CUB?R? Not? 

Perhaps CURLY? 
But L and Y? 
Pattern: C U R L Y? 
But we would have R at pos3? 

And U at pos2? 
And L at pos4? Y at pos5? 

Is that valid? 

Against first guess: 
""crane"" -> 
  R at pos2: we put? Then R at pos2? But secret has R at pos3? So R present but not at2: '-' -> ok? 
  Then in second guess: ""court""-> 
    O: absent? CURLY has O? No? 
    U: placed at pos3? Secret at pos2? So U present but not at3? '-' -> ok? 
    R: placed at pos4? Secret has R at pos3? So R present but at4? -> '-' -> ok? 
    T: absent? CURLY has no T? -> ok? 

What about letters? 
First guess: contains no L or Y? 
Second guess: contains no L or Y? 

So it fits? 

Therefore: CURLY? 
Or CURDS? CURBS? 

All fit? 

But we need to choose one? 

How about choosing a word that uses common letters? 

S is common? 

So CURBS? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, to avoid locking? 

We can guess a word that tests multiple positions? 

But at this point, we know:

- Position1: C
- Position2: we suspect U? 
- Position3: we suspect R? 
- Position4 and 5: two new letters? 

So we can guess CURBS? 

If we guess CURBS? and the word is CURBS, we get solved? 

If not? 

But we don't know? 

Also, position5: we haven't tested? 

But note: we have only one pattern? 

Alternatively, there is another pattern: 

Option: R at pos5? U at pos2? 
Then word: C U ? ? R? 

Example: CUBER? But E is absent? 
CUTER? E? 
CUV?E? No? 
CUS?R? 

CURVY? But R at pos3? 

Wait, C U R V Y? R at pos3? 

So only CUR?X patterns? 

Or CUK?R? Not? 

So CURxx? 

Therefore: Let us guess ""curbs"": 

Because ""curbs"" includes B? B is common? 

But CURBS? 

Perhaps CURLS? Has L and S? 

But L? 

But we haven't tested L? 

Alternatively: 

We can make a guess that doesn't assume U at pos2? 

For example: 

Word: ? 

Pattern: C ? R U ? 

But U is at pos4? And R at pos3? 

Example: CHURU? Not word? 

Pattern: C ? R ? U 
Example: CHIRU? Not word? 
SHIRU? Not? 

So only CUR? at the beginning? 

Therefore, we guess CURBS? 

CURBS: 
  C U R B S

Is that valid? 

Yes. 

But note: what if U is not at pos2? But at pos4? Then what? 

For instance: word like CRUS? But not? 

But let's think: 

If U is at pos4? Then pattern: C ? ? U ? 

And R? Must be at pos3 or pos5? 

But if at pos3? Then word: C ? R U ? 

But to avoid R at pos3? Then only R at pos5? So: C ? ? U R? 

Example: CHIUR? Not? 

Could it be? 

Example: CL? U R? 

Or: CLUB? Not? 

No common words? 

So likely the only possibility is CURxx? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""curbs"". 

But note: we have not tested B? 

But we have 6 guesses? We can guess and then learn? 

Since we are on third guess? 

So: guessed word: ""curbs""

But let me write the guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word with different vowels? 

But we have U? 

So: CURBS? 

But let's confirm: 
<guess>curbs</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:

- **First Guess: CRANE**
  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is C.
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): Eliminates A, N, E.

- **Second Guess: COURT**
  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is still C (consistent).
  - O(x): Eliminates O.
  - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - T(x): Eliminates T.

**Key Deductions:**
- The word starts with C.
- Contains R and U, but R cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and U cannot be in position 3.
- R must be in position 3 or 5, and U must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, E, N, O, T.
- Possible letters for remaining positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The pattern must accommodate R/U placement without clashes (e.g., not R in position 2 or 4, not U in position 3).

Given U is likely in position 2 and R in position 3 (common pattern), **CURBS** fits:
- C (position 1), U (position 2), R (position 3), B (new), S (new).
- Tests all constraints and avoids eliminated letters.
- Provides new information on positions 4 (B) and 5 (S).

<guess>curbs</guess>",curbs,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is correct and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is present in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""court""):
- C is correct (position 1) – confirms the first letter.
- O is absent. So O is not in the word.
- U is present but not in position 3 (since we got '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- R is present but not in position 4 (again, '-' indicates wrong position).
- T is absent. So T is not in the word.

What we know:
- The secret word starts with C (position 1).
- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? 
  But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5? 
  However, we also have U present, and it was in position 3 in ""court"", so U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But position 1 is C, so U cannot be in position 1. Therefore, U must be in position 2,4, or 5? But note: R must be in the word and the only positions left for R are 3 and 5 (since 2 is not allowed and 4 is now not allowed?).

But wait: from the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2.
Then in the second guess, we put R in position 4 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 4? So R is in position 3 or 5? 

Similarly, U: we put U in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3? So U must be in positions 2,4, or 5? 

But note: the secret word cannot have duplicates unless they are repeated? But we don't know. However, we have not encountered any duplicate letters so far.

Now, we also have confirmed absent letters: 
- A (from first guess)
- N (from first guess)
- E (from first guess)
- O (from second guess)
- T (from second guess)

So absent: A, E, N, O, T.

We have present letters: 
- C (fixed at position 1)
- R (must be in position 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are eliminated? But note: we only tested position 4? It could be in position 5? Or position 3?)
- U (must be in position 2,4, or 5? Since it cannot be in 3)

So the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Positions 2,3,4,5: must include R and U? But not necessarily: could have R and U, but R must be somewhere? U must be somewhere? 
But note: R is already confirmed? Yes, from the first guess. And U is confirmed from the second guess.

Also, the current state:

Known positions: 
1: C
2: unknown? but cannot be O (since O absent) and cannot be R? (since R in wrong position when placed in 2). But also, U might be at 2?
3: unknown? 
4: unknown? 
5: unknown?

Constraints:

- Letter at position 2: cannot be A,E,N,O,T (absent), and if we put R in position 2 we already got it wrong? Yes. So it must be a new letter? And U could be there? Or other letters? 

But U must be in in 2,4, or 5? So position 2 is a candidate for U.

Similarly, R must be in 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are wrong? 

But wait: the second guess: R was in position 4 and we got '-', meaning R is present but not in position 4? So for R, positions 2 and 4 are wrong. Since position 1 is C, R must be in position 3 or 5? 

For U: last guess had U in position 3? We got '-' meaning U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 2,4, or 5? 

Therefore, the secret word must be:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: U? or another letter? 
3: could be R? or if not, then not R? 
4: U? or another letter? 
5: R? or U? 

But note: we have only two confirmed letters: R and U? Or we might have more letters? But we know C, R, U? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? 

But we have now: C (pos1), and then R and U? So the word must have three more letters? But we already have three letters? So including C? 

Actually: 
- C is at pos1.
- R must be at one of the remaining positions? 
- U must be at one of the remaining positions? 

But R and U could be the same? Only if the word has two R's or two U's? But we don't know. But so far, we haven't seen duplicates? 

However, it's possible? But we haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates? Because in the feedback, we didn't mark duplicate? 

But let's assume we don't have duplicates for simplicity? Since no duplicate indication? 

If we assume no duplicates: then R and U are distinct? Then the secret word has exactly these: C, R, U, plus two other letters? 

Therefore, positions:

We must assign two remaining letters? 

But we know that? 

Now, the letter pool: we have C,R,U and then two other letters? 

But which letters? 

The absent letters: A,E,N,O,T are out? 

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a word that starts with C, has R and U? 

We also know positions:

- Position 1: C
- Position 2: cannot be R? (because then we would have gotten R correct? We tried R at position2 and we got '-', meaning not there). If position2 had been R, we would have gotten a checkmark? But we did not? So R is not in position2? So position2 cannot be R? 

Similarly, position4 cannot be R? Because we put R at pos4 and got '-'? So if R were at pos4, we should have gotten a checkmark? But we got '-', meaning present but not at pos4? So R not at pos4? 

Similarly for U: we put U at pos3? If U were at pos3, we would have gotten ✓ for U? But we got '-' meaning present but not at pos3? So U is not at pos3? 

Therefore:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be one of the letters? It can be U? Since U must be at 2,4, or 5? 
- Position 3: cannot be U? So must be either R? Or something else? But R can be at pos3? 
- Position 4: cannot be R and cannot be U? Wait, no? U can be at position4? Because U might be at pos4? But position4: cannot be R? But U can be? 
- Position 5: can be R or U? 

So:

Option 1: R at pos3, U at pos2? Then positions: 
  pos2: U? 
  pos3: R? 
  then positions 4 and 5: unknowns? 

Option 2: R at pos3, U at pos4? 
  pos2: ? 
  pos3: R
  pos4: U

Option 3: R at pos3, U at pos5?
  pos2: ?
  pos3: R
  pos5: U

Option 4: R at pos5, U at pos2? 
  pos2: U
  pos3: ?
  pos5: R

Option 5: R at pos5, U at pos4? 

But wait: U can be at pos2,4,or5? 
And R must be in positions 3 or 5? 

So:
Option 1: R at pos3, U at pos2 -> then the word is: C U R ? ?
Option 2: R at pos3, U at pos4 -> C ? R U ?
Option 3: R at pos3, U at pos5 -> C ? R ? U
Option 4: R at pos5, U at pos2 -> C U ? ? R
Option 5: R at pos5, U at pos4 -> C ? ? U R

We need to fill the remaining two positions with letters that aren't A,E,N,O,T, and also not C? (unless duplicates? But no duplicate of C indicated? So we avoid C too?) 

Since position1 is C and we haven't seen duplicate feedback, we assume no duplicate C? Similarly for R and U? But we don't know? But we don't have evidence, so avoid duplicates? 

Also, we have used: C, R, U? So the other two letters must be new? 

Therefore, the secret word is one of these patterns? 

Now, common words? 

Option 1: CUR_X_? 
Example: CUR_Y? CURBY? Not a word? CURSE? But S and E? E is absent? CURRY? But R repeated? 
But note: R is repeated? In ""curry"", R at pos3 and R at pos4? But we know R is at least at one position? But it can be repeated? 

But in our previous guesses:
- In first guess, we had C R A N E: only one R? And we got R at position2 as present but mislocated? Which meant at least one R exists? 
- In second guess: C O U R T: R at pos4? We got R present but mislocated? That could be because R is at a different position? Or because there is another R? 

But if the word had two R? Then both would have been marked? In the first guess? But we only had one R? So we marked one? 

Similarly, in the second guess, we marked one R? 

So it's possible? But we don't know? 

But without evidence, we can assume only one R? Similarly for U? 

But wait: in the second guess, U was only one? 

So let's assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, in Option 1: CUR?? where the last two letters not R or U? 

Similarly, other patterns? 

Possible words:

Pattern CUR??:
- CURDS? But D and S? And D,S are not absent? 
  We guessed: ""crane"" and ""court"": for CURDS, 
  Letters: C,U,R,D,S? 
  We haven't used D or S? And A,E,N,O,T absent? 
  CURDS is a valid word: ""curds"" meaning lumps in cheese? etc.

Pattern CR?U? (R at pos3, U at pos5): 
  Example: CRUS? But that's not 5 letters? CRU? Something? CRUMB? Not 5? CRU? something? 
  CRUMP? But M and P? Not a common word? 

Alternatively, Pattern CU?R? (R at pos5? and U at pos2?): 
  Example: CUS?ER? Not common? 

More feasible:

Pattern C?R?U: 
  Example: CHURN? But N is absent? So not allowed? 

Pattern C?RU? 
  Example: CRUMB? Again, not 5? 

Let me list candidate words?

We know:
Secret word must: start with C, contain R and U? And two other letters? 

Common words: 
- CURD? But that's 4 letters? 
- CURVE? But V? Only? 
- CURRY? But it has two R's? And Y? But that would be: CURRY: positions? 
  C U R R Y
  So pattern: CURRY: 
    Position1: C (correct)
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: R? 
    Position4: R? 
    Position5: Y? 

But then we are using R twice? 

If the word is CURRY:
In first guess: ""crane"": 
  C (pos1:✓), R (pos2: -> present, but at pos2? But the secret has R at pos3 and pos4? So R is present? And we marked R at pos2 as '-' (wrong position)? 
  That applies because R is present but not at pos2? 

Then second guess ""court"":
  C (✓), O (absent? but CURRY has O? No? CURRY has O? CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y? No O? So O should be absent? Which matches? 
  U: at pos3? But in the secret, U is at pos2? So U is present but not at pos3? Should be marked '-' ? Yes? 
  R: at pos4? In secret, R at pos3 and pos4? So R at pos4? Should be ✓? Not '-'? 

But in the feedback for court: R got '-', meaning wrong position? 
But if CURRY has R at pos4? Then guess court puts R at pos4? Should be ✓? 

But we got '-' for R? So that means that in the secret word, position4 is not R? 

Therefore, CURRY would be incorrect? Because it has R at pos4? 

But we got for R in court: '-' for R? So secret word does not have R at position4? 

Therefore, CURRY has R at pos4? So it cannot be CURRY? 

Similarly, any word with R at pos4? 

So R must be at pos3 or pos5? 

Therefore, CURRY is invalid? 

Now, let's consider without duplicates? 

Pattern C U R ? ? 

Possible words: 
- CURED? Has E? E absent? 
- CURVE? But V? and E? E absent? 
- CURVY? Not common? 
- CURBS? but we have S? 
  CURBS: 
    Positions: C U R B S? 

Would it fit? 
In secret word: 
Position1: C (✓) 
Position2: U? 
Position3: R? 
Position4: B? 
Position5: S? 

Check against first guess?
Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  Positions: 
    C at1: ✓ 
    R at2: present but not at2? In secret R at3? So not at2 -> '-' -> correct?
    A: absent? CURBS has no A -> x -> correct? 
    N: absent -> x?
    E: absent? -> x?

Second guess: ""court"" -> 
  CURBS: 
    C: ✓ 
    O: absent? CURBS has no O -> x -> correct? 
    U: we put U at position3? But secret has U at position2? So U is present but at different position? '-' -> we got that? 
    R: we put R at position4? But secret has R at position3? So R present but at4? -> '-' -> correct? 
    T: absent? CURBS has no T -> x? 

So it fits? 

Another word? CURDS? Same? 

So CURBS? or CURDS?

But CURBS and CURDS both seem to fit? 

Also: 
Pattern C U ? ? R (if R at5?): 
For example: C U S R ? not common? 

Or CUL?R? 
CUBER? But E? not?

But CURBS seems a good candidate? 

But we haven't tried CUR?X? We should consider? 

What about words without U at position2? 

Pattern: C ? R U ? ? 
Example: CRUD? Not 5 letters? 

Pattern: C ? R ? U 
Example: CHIRU? Not English? 

Pattern: C ? ? U R 
e.g., CLAUR? Not word? 

So the most likely: CURxx? 

So CURBS? CURDS? CURVY? but V? 

Also: CURIO? 
CURIO: C U R I O -> positions: 
  Pos2: U 
  Pos3: R 

Then this? 
But O is absent? So CURIO? 
In the second guess: we guessed court: 
  For CURIO: 
    O is in the secret? Second guess: court: O is at position2? But CURIO has O at position5? So O is present? But the feedback for court said O is absent? 

But wait: in second guess court: 
  we got O? But our feedback says court: O -> x? meaning absent? 
Therefore, CURIO cannot be because it has O? 

Therefore, O in CURIO would be present? But we know O is absent? 

Thus, CURIO invalid? 

Similarly, any word containing O, T, A, E, N? 

Therefore, CURBS and CURDS? 
Also: CURVY? But V and Y? 

Now, CURBS: letters B,S? 
CURDS: letters D,S? 

We don't know which? 

We need to make a guess? 

I think CURBS is a valid word? 

But our previous guesses: we haven't tested B or D? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that contains R at pos5? But we don't have any obvious word? 

But note: U must be in 2,4,5? And if we avoid position2? 

Position2?:

If we make a guess that tests position2? 

We have not guessed position2? 

We know it cannot be A,E,N,O,T? So possibilities? 

But we know U can be at pos2? 

Alternatively, letters: B, C? But we cannot use C? 

We can try: CURBS? 

But let me think? We can also try to get more information? 

Since CURBS might be the word? But we don't know? 

We can also try:

Word: CHUR? But without special? 

Actually, we can try ""curbs"": C U R B S? 

Or: since we have three positions left? We need to guess? 

We have 6 tries? We are on third? 

We need to test: is U at pos2? R at pos3? Then the last two? 

But we don't know?

Alternatively, we could guess a word that has different placements? 

But we have constraints? 

We want to verify U's position? If we think U might be at pos2? 

We can make a guess that has U at pos2? That we haven't done? We haven't put U at pos2? 

First guess: U is not used? 
Second guess: U at pos3? 
So we haven't tried U at pos2? 

If we guess CUR?S? Then we are testing U at pos2? 

Similarly, we must include R? 

And avoid absent letters: A,E,N,O,T? 

So: CUR?S? 

We have: CUR?S? And ? cannot be already absent? 

Possible letters? 

So: 

Word: CURBS (B), CURDS (D), or CURFS? Not word? 

Alternatively: if we don't put that pattern? 

But to test non-CUR words? 

Pattern: C U ? ? R? 

Example: CUP?R? Not common? 

So we stick to CURxx? 

Choose CURDS? 

Because D and S? 

But CURBS is also good? 

Alternative: we can test a word that has R at position5? 

For example: 
Put U at pos2? R at pos5? Then word: C U ? ? R? 

Examples: 
CUMIN? N? Out? 
CUBER? E? Out? 
CUTEr? Too many? 
So? 

CUB?R? Not? 

Perhaps CURLY? 
But L and Y? 
Pattern: C U R L Y? 
But we would have R at pos3? 

And U at pos2? 
And L at pos4? Y at pos5? 

Is that valid? 

Against first guess: 
""crane"" -> 
  R at pos2: we put? Then R at pos2? But secret has R at pos3? So R present but not at2: '-' -> ok? 
  Then in second guess: ""court""-> 
    O: absent? CURLY has O? No? 
    U: placed at pos3? Secret at pos2? So U present but not at3? '-' -> ok? 
    R: placed at pos4? Secret has R at pos3? So R present but at4? -> '-' -> ok? 
    T: absent? CURLY has no T? -> ok? 

What about letters? 
First guess: contains no L or Y? 
Second guess: contains no L or Y? 

So it fits? 

Therefore: CURLY? 
Or CURDS? CURBS? 

All fit? 

But we need to choose one? 

How about choosing a word that uses common letters? 

S is common? 

So CURBS? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, to avoid locking? 

We can guess a word that tests multiple positions? 

But at this point, we know:

- Position1: C
- Position2: we suspect U? 
- Position3: we suspect R? 
- Position4 and 5: two new letters? 

So we can guess CURBS? 

If we guess CURBS? and the word is CURBS, we get solved? 

If not? 

But we don't know? 

Also, position5: we haven't tested? 

But note: we have only one pattern? 

Alternatively, there is another pattern: 

Option: R at pos5? U at pos2? 
Then word: C U ? ? R? 

Example: CUBER? But E is absent? 
CUTER? E? 
CUV?E? No? 
CUS?R? 

CURVY? But R at pos3? 

Wait, C U R V Y? R at pos3? 

So only CUR?X patterns? 

Or CUK?R? Not? 

So CURxx? 

Therefore: Let us guess ""curbs"": 

Because ""curbs"" includes B? B is common? 

But CURBS? 

Perhaps CURLS? Has L and S? 

But L? 

But we haven't tested L? 

Alternatively: 

We can make a guess that doesn't assume U at pos2? 

For example: 

Word: ? 

Pattern: C ? R U ? 

But U is at pos4? And R at pos3? 

Example: CHURU? Not word? 

Pattern: C ? R ? U 
Example: CHIRU? Not word? 
SHIRU? Not? 

So only CUR? at the beginning? 

Therefore, we guess CURBS? 

CURBS: 
  C U R B S

Is that valid? 

Yes. 

But note: what if U is not at pos2? But at pos4? Then what? 

For instance: word like CRUS? But not? 

But let's think: 

If U is at pos4? Then pattern: C ? ? U ? 

And R? Must be at pos3 or pos5? 

But if at pos3? Then word: C ? R U ? 

But to avoid R at pos3? Then only R at pos5? So: C ? ? U R? 

Example: CHIUR? Not? 

Could it be? 

Example: CL? U R? 

Or: CLUB? Not? 

No common words? 

So likely the only possibility is CURxx? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""curbs"". 

But note: we have not tested B? 

But we have 6 guesses? We can guess and then learn? 

Since we are on third guess? 

So: guessed word: ""curbs""

But let me write the guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word with different vowels? 

But we have U? 

So: CURBS? 

But let's confirm: 
<guess>curbs</guess>Based on the feedback:

- **First Guess: CRANE**
  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is C.
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): Eliminates A, N, E.

- **Second Guess: COURT**
  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is still C (consistent).
  - O(x): Eliminates O.
  - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - T(x): Eliminates T.

**Key Deductions:**
- The word starts with C.
- Contains R and U, but R cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and U cannot be in position 3.
- R must be in position 3 or 5, and U must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, E, N, O, T.
- Possible letters for remaining positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The pattern must accommodate R/U placement without clashes (e.g., not R in position 2 or 4, not U in position 3).

Given U is likely in position 2 and R in position 3 (common pattern), **CURBS** fits:
- C (position 1), U (position 2), R (position 3), B (new), S (new).
- Tests all constraints and avoids eliminated letters.
- Provides new information on positions 4 (B) and 5 (S).",Guess 3: curbs -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) B(x) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,CURLY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-', meaning wrong position).
 - A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 So, the secret word:
 - Starts with C.
 - Contains the letter R, but not in position 2.
 - Does not contain A, N, or E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints:
 - The word must start with C (from the ✓ on C).
 - The word must contain R, but R cannot be in the second position (because in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).

 Also, we know the word does not have A, N, or E.

 We need to think of words that start with C and contain R, avoiding A, N, E.

 Possible letters: Since A, N, E are out, we focus on other vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: O, I, U (but note: Y is sometimes a vowel, but also consonant).
 Consonants: Many others like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z, etc.

 We also know R must appear somewhere from position 3 to 5 (since position 2 is excluded for R).

 Let's list some possibilities:
 - Words starting with C and having R: e.g., ""crisp"", ""crisp""? But note we don't know about I or S or P yet.

 But note: in the first guess, we used C,R,A,N,E so we must avoid A,N,E.

 Some candidate words: 
   ""curry"" -> but has double R? 
   ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> not necessarily, but we don't know about H,O,D.
   ""crypt"" -> C R Y P T -> R is in position 2? But we got '-' for R in position 2 meaning it shouldn't be in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that would be bad? Actually, the feedback told us R is not in position 2, so in the new guess we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, our next guess should try to have R in a different position (i.e., not second).

 Since the word starts with C, and R is present but not in second position, possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 We should avoid repeating the letters that were already guessed and found absent: A, N, E.

 Let's think of words that start with C, have R in positions 3,4, or 5, and use new letters.

 Examples:
 - Position 3: e.g., ""co_ _ _"", but what? We don't know. How about ""charm""? Wait, but A is not allowed? A was absent, so we cannot use A. Since A is out, ""charm"" is invalid because it has A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word. So we cannot include A in the guess.

 Similarly, avoid N and E.

 Possible words:
 - R at position 3: ""c_ R _ _"", e.g., ""curry"" -> C U R R Y -> but note we don't know about U and Y. Also, it has double R? But we don't know if R is repeated? The feedback only said there is an R, but possibly more? We don't know. But we can use such words.

 - R at position 4: ""c_ _ R _"", e.g., ""court"" -> C O U R T -> but O, U, T are new.

 - R at position 5: ""c_ _ _ R"", e.g., ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> but second letter H? We don't know.

 We also want to cover common letters to get more information.

 Another idea: since we know position 1 is C, and R is present somewhere else, we can try a word that puts R in position 3,4 or 5 and uses other common letters.

 Let me list common letters that we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.

 We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence yet.

 Since we don't have E or A, common vowels left are O, I, U.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C, avoids positions 1 and 2 for R (but position 1 is fixed as C so R won't go there) and R not in position 2.

 Candidate: ""curbs"" -> C U R B S -> R in position 3? Checks: no A,N,E, and R is in position 3 (so not 2). But is it a valid word? Yes, curbs is a word.

 Another: ""crisp"" -> but R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. So ""crisp"" is not okay because R is in position 2.

 What about ""crops""? C R O P S -> again, R is in position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2.

 So we must not put R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that start with C and have R in positions 3,4,5.

 Let me think of words:
 - With R in position 3: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> letters U, L, Y are new.
 - ""curvy"" -> C U R V Y -> V and Y new.
 - ""curds"" -> C U R D S -> D and S new.

 - With R in position 4: ""court"" -> C O U R T -> O, U, T new.
 - ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> H, O, D new.
 - ""churn"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So invalid because N is not allowed? But the word ""churn"" has N? So avoid it.

 - With R in position 5: ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> H, O, I new.
 - ""cedar"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So avoid.

 We need a word without A, E, N. 

 I think ""court"" is a good candidate because it introduces O, U, R, T and R is in position 4 (so we test the position). Also, position 2 is O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" is good because it tests D and S.

 But let me see which letters cover more common? S is a very common letter.

 Also note: we must not reuse the absent letters (A, E, N).

 Another word: ""curio"" -> C U R I O -> R in position 3? But it is 5 letters? ""curio"" is 5 letters: C U R I O -> R is in position 3? Wait, positions: 
  1: C
  2: U
  3: R
  4: I
  5: O
 So it is valid? Yes.

 But perhaps ""crypt"" is more common? ""crypt"": C R Y P T -> but R is in position 2 -> avoid! So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

 So back to words without R in second.

 Another word: ""crowd"" -> C R O W D -> again, R in position 2 -> avoid.

 So we must only consider words with R in positions 3,4,5.

 Let me choose ""curly"": 
  C U R L Y
  This introduces U (vowel), L, Y (can be vowel or consonant).

 Or ""curbs"": 
  C U R B S
  Introduces U, B, S.

 Since S is more common, maybe ""curbs"" is better? But we want to cover letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 5? 

 Word: ""civic"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word? Wait, the word must include R.

 So the word must have R somewhere from 3 to 5.

 So how about ""comic""? That doesn't have R. So we must include R.

 So what about ""circa""? But C is already in position 1? And it has A? A is absent, so avoid.

 Okay, let's choose ""curbs"": 
   C - position 1: we know it's correct and we'll get ✓ for that.
   We put U at position 2: we don't know about U? It could be present or absent? but we haven't tested U before.
   R at position 3: we hope to check if R is at position 3? 
   B at position 4: new letter.
   S at position 5: new letter.

 But also, we can consider testing multiple letters? 

 Another word: ""chirp"" -> C H I R P -> but R is in position 4? However, we don't know about H,I,P. And it doesn't have A,E,N. But also, note that the word starts with C, so H is at position 2? 

 But we have never tested position 2? So we might get information about H? 

 Similarly, in ""curbs"", U is at position 2? 

 So both are options.

 However, ""chirp"" avoids using U, but we don't know if U is in the word? We might want to test U? 

 But note, the secret word might have other vowels? Since A,E are absent, the vowel must be O,I,U, or Y? 

 We should prioritize checking vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, we can use ""proxy"" but not starting with C? We must start with C? So no.

 Another word: ""crypt"" but we can't because of R in position 2.

 What about ""crock""? But it has two C's? And we already know C is at the start? But the word has C at both start and end? But the secret word has C at position 1, and we don't know about other positions? However, we haven't tested C in other positions? But the feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was in position 1. However, it's possible the word has more than one C? The feedback didn't indicate that. But we don't know.

 Actually, the feedback only marked the C in position 1 as correct. If there were another C, we would have seen another ✓ or - for the other occurrence? But we didn't? But we didn't have any other C? So we don't know.

 So we can consider words with repeated C? But we don't have evidence, so let's avoid for now.

 Considering the options, I think ""court"" is a strong candidate:
   C O U R T
   Positions: 
     1: C (will be ✓)
     2: O (new letter, vowel)
     3: U (new letter, vowel)
     4: R (testing R in position 4? Since we know it's not in position 2, and we haven't tried position 4)
     5: T (new letter, common consonant)

 But note: we have already ruled out A,E,N. So O,U,T are all new.

 Alternatively, ""curds"" uses D and S? 

 But ""court"" uses two vowels (O and U) which might be helpful? And T is common.

 Another candidate: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> L and Y.

 Let's pick ""court"" for now? 

 But we must also avoid using letters we know are absent? And we are only avoiding A,E,N.

 So, I choose ""court"": 
   C O U R T

 But let me double-check: 
   - It has R in position 4? Yes, which is not position 2? Correct.
   - No A,E,N? Correct.

 Also, it's a common word.

 Alternatively, ""curbs"" is another good candidate? 

 To make a decision: I think trying a word that covers more vowels might be good? ""court"" has two vowels: O and U? But O is in position 2 and U in position 3? 

 But ""curbs"" has U at position 2 and that's the only vowel? 

 So ""court"" might give us more information about vowels.

 However, note the first guess had R at position 2 (in ""crane"") which was misplaced, so R is in the word but not at pos2? That doesn't prevent the word from having a vowel at pos2? So position2 might be a vowel? 

 Also, the secret word: since it starts with C, and we don't have E, then the second letter might be O, U, I? Or even H? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""court"".

 But wait: the word ""court"" has O at position2? We haven't tested position2 at all? So we can get information about position2? And U at position3? 

 Also, we should note that we are testing T at the end? 

 So let's guess ""court"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓ for C: Correct letter in correct position (position 1)
- - for R: R is in the word but not in position 2
- x for A, N, E: None of these letters are in the word

For the second guess:
- Must start with C (position 1 confirmed)
- Must include R, but **not** in position 2
- Cannot use A, N, or E
- Ideal to test new common letters for positions 2-5

Best strategy:  
- Select a word starting with C that places R in positions 3–5 to test new locations  
- Include vowels not yet tested (O, U, I) and common consonants  
- Avoid reused letters (A, N, E) and R in position 2  

Chosen word: **COURT**  
- C in position 1 (verifies existing known)  
- O in position 2 (tests a new vowel)  
- U in position 3 (tests another vowel)  
- R in position 4 (tests R away from position 2)  
- T in position 5 (tests a common consonant)

<guess>court</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: court -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(-) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is correct and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is present in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (""court""):
- C is correct (position 1) – confirms the first letter.
- O is absent. So O is not in the word.
- U is present but not in position 3 (since we got '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- R is present but not in position 4 (again, '-' indicates wrong position).
- T is absent. So T is not in the word.

What we know:
- The secret word starts with C (position 1).
- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? 
  But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5? 
  However, we also have U present, and it was in position 3 in ""court"", so U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But position 1 is C, so U cannot be in position 1. Therefore, U must be in position 2,4, or 5? But note: R must be in the word and the only positions left for R are 3 and 5 (since 2 is not allowed and 4 is now not allowed?).

But wait: from the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2.
Then in the second guess, we put R in position 4 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 4? So R is in position 3 or 5? 

Similarly, U: we put U in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3? So U must be in positions 2,4, or 5? 

But note: the secret word cannot have duplicates unless they are repeated? But we don't know. However, we have not encountered any duplicate letters so far.

Now, we also have confirmed absent letters: 
- A (from first guess)
- N (from first guess)
- E (from first guess)
- O (from second guess)
- T (from second guess)

So absent: A, E, N, O, T.

We have present letters: 
- C (fixed at position 1)
- R (must be in position 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are eliminated? But note: we only tested position 4? It could be in position 5? Or position 3?)
- U (must be in position 2,4, or 5? Since it cannot be in 3)

So the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Positions 2,3,4,5: must include R and U? But not necessarily: could have R and U, but R must be somewhere? U must be somewhere? 
But note: R is already confirmed? Yes, from the first guess. And U is confirmed from the second guess.

Also, the current state:

Known positions: 
1: C
2: unknown? but cannot be O (since O absent) and cannot be R? (since R in wrong position when placed in 2). But also, U might be at 2?
3: unknown? 
4: unknown? 
5: unknown?

Constraints:

- Letter at position 2: cannot be A,E,N,O,T (absent), and if we put R in position 2 we already got it wrong? Yes. So it must be a new letter? And U could be there? Or other letters? 

But U must be in in 2,4, or 5? So position 2 is a candidate for U.

Similarly, R must be in 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are wrong? 

But wait: the second guess: R was in position 4 and we got '-', meaning R is present but not in position 4? So for R, positions 2 and 4 are wrong. Since position 1 is C, R must be in position 3 or 5? 

For U: last guess had U in position 3? We got '-' meaning U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 2,4, or 5? 

Therefore, the secret word must be:

Positions:
1: C (fixed)
2: U? or another letter? 
3: could be R? or if not, then not R? 
4: U? or another letter? 
5: R? or U? 

But note: we have only two confirmed letters: R and U? Or we might have more letters? But we know C, R, U? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? 

But we have now: C (pos1), and then R and U? So the word must have three more letters? But we already have three letters? So including C? 

Actually: 
- C is at pos1.
- R must be at one of the remaining positions? 
- U must be at one of the remaining positions? 

But R and U could be the same? Only if the word has two R's or two U's? But we don't know. But so far, we haven't seen duplicates? 

However, it's possible? But we haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates? Because in the feedback, we didn't mark duplicate? 

But let's assume we don't have duplicates for simplicity? Since no duplicate indication? 

If we assume no duplicates: then R and U are distinct? Then the secret word has exactly these: C, R, U, plus two other letters? 

Therefore, positions:

We must assign two remaining letters? 

But we know that? 

Now, the letter pool: we have C,R,U and then two other letters? 

But which letters? 

The absent letters: A,E,N,O,T are out? 

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a word that starts with C, has R and U? 

We also know positions:

- Position 1: C
- Position 2: cannot be R? (because then we would have gotten R correct? We tried R at position2 and we got '-', meaning not there). If position2 had been R, we would have gotten a checkmark? But we did not? So R is not in position2? So position2 cannot be R? 

Similarly, position4 cannot be R? Because we put R at pos4 and got '-'? So if R were at pos4, we should have gotten a checkmark? But we got '-', meaning present but not at pos4? So R not at pos4? 

Similarly for U: we put U at pos3? If U were at pos3, we would have gotten ✓ for U? But we got '-' meaning present but not at pos3? So U is not at pos3? 

Therefore:

- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: must be one of the letters? It can be U? Since U must be at 2,4, or 5? 
- Position 3: cannot be U? So must be either R? Or something else? But R can be at pos3? 
- Position 4: cannot be R and cannot be U? Wait, no? U can be at position4? Because U might be at pos4? But position4: cannot be R? But U can be? 
- Position 5: can be R or U? 

So:

Option 1: R at pos3, U at pos2? Then positions: 
  pos2: U? 
  pos3: R? 
  then positions 4 and 5: unknowns? 

Option 2: R at pos3, U at pos4? 
  pos2: ? 
  pos3: R
  pos4: U

Option 3: R at pos3, U at pos5?
  pos2: ?
  pos3: R
  pos5: U

Option 4: R at pos5, U at pos2? 
  pos2: U
  pos3: ?
  pos5: R

Option 5: R at pos5, U at pos4? 

But wait: U can be at pos2,4,or5? 
And R must be in positions 3 or 5? 

So:
Option 1: R at pos3, U at pos2 -> then the word is: C U R ? ?
Option 2: R at pos3, U at pos4 -> C ? R U ?
Option 3: R at pos3, U at pos5 -> C ? R ? U
Option 4: R at pos5, U at pos2 -> C U ? ? R
Option 5: R at pos5, U at pos4 -> C ? ? U R

We need to fill the remaining two positions with letters that aren't A,E,N,O,T, and also not C? (unless duplicates? But no duplicate of C indicated? So we avoid C too?) 

Since position1 is C and we haven't seen duplicate feedback, we assume no duplicate C? Similarly for R and U? But we don't know? But we don't have evidence, so avoid duplicates? 

Also, we have used: C, R, U? So the other two letters must be new? 

Therefore, the secret word is one of these patterns? 

Now, common words? 

Option 1: CUR_X_? 
Example: CUR_Y? CURBY? Not a word? CURSE? But S and E? E is absent? CURRY? But R repeated? 
But note: R is repeated? In ""curry"", R at pos3 and R at pos4? But we know R is at least at one position? But it can be repeated? 

But in our previous guesses:
- In first guess, we had C R A N E: only one R? And we got R at position2 as present but mislocated? Which meant at least one R exists? 
- In second guess: C O U R T: R at pos4? We got R present but mislocated? That could be because R is at a different position? Or because there is another R? 

But if the word had two R? Then both would have been marked? In the first guess? But we only had one R? So we marked one? 

Similarly, in the second guess, we marked one R? 

So it's possible? But we don't know? 

But without evidence, we can assume only one R? Similarly for U? 

But wait: in the second guess, U was only one? 

So let's assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, in Option 1: CUR?? where the last two letters not R or U? 

Similarly, other patterns? 

Possible words:

Pattern CUR??:
- CURDS? But D and S? And D,S are not absent? 
  We guessed: ""crane"" and ""court"": for CURDS, 
  Letters: C,U,R,D,S? 
  We haven't used D or S? And A,E,N,O,T absent? 
  CURDS is a valid word: ""curds"" meaning lumps in cheese? etc.

Pattern CR?U? (R at pos3, U at pos5): 
  Example: CRUS? But that's not 5 letters? CRU? Something? CRUMB? Not 5? CRU? something? 
  CRUMP? But M and P? Not a common word? 

Alternatively, Pattern CU?R? (R at pos5? and U at pos2?): 
  Example: CUS?ER? Not common? 

More feasible:

Pattern C?R?U: 
  Example: CHURN? But N is absent? So not allowed? 

Pattern C?RU? 
  Example: CRUMB? Again, not 5? 

Let me list candidate words?

We know:
Secret word must: start with C, contain R and U? And two other letters? 

Common words: 
- CURD? But that's 4 letters? 
- CURVE? But V? Only? 
- CURRY? But it has two R's? And Y? But that would be: CURRY: positions? 
  C U R R Y
  So pattern: CURRY: 
    Position1: C (correct)
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: R? 
    Position4: R? 
    Position5: Y? 

But then we are using R twice? 

If the word is CURRY:
In first guess: ""crane"": 
  C (pos1:✓), R (pos2: -> present, but at pos2? But the secret has R at pos3 and pos4? So R is present? And we marked R at pos2 as '-' (wrong position)? 
  That applies because R is present but not at pos2? 

Then second guess ""court"":
  C (✓), O (absent? but CURRY has O? No? CURRY has O? CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y? No O? So O should be absent? Which matches? 
  U: at pos3? But in the secret, U is at pos2? So U is present but not at pos3? Should be marked '-' ? Yes? 
  R: at pos4? In secret, R at pos3 and pos4? So R at pos4? Should be ✓? Not '-'? 

But in the feedback for court: R got '-', meaning wrong position? 
But if CURRY has R at pos4? Then guess court puts R at pos4? Should be ✓? 

But we got '-' for R? So that means that in the secret word, position4 is not R? 

Therefore, CURRY would be incorrect? Because it has R at pos4? 

But we got for R in court: '-' for R? So secret word does not have R at position4? 

Therefore, CURRY has R at pos4? So it cannot be CURRY? 

Similarly, any word with R at pos4? 

So R must be at pos3 or pos5? 

Therefore, CURRY is invalid? 

Now, let's consider without duplicates? 

Pattern C U R ? ? 

Possible words: 
- CURED? Has E? E absent? 
- CURVE? But V? and E? E absent? 
- CURVY? Not common? 
- CURBS? but we have S? 
  CURBS: 
    Positions: C U R B S? 

Would it fit? 
In secret word: 
Position1: C (✓) 
Position2: U? 
Position3: R? 
Position4: B? 
Position5: S? 

Check against first guess?
Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  Positions: 
    C at1: ✓ 
    R at2: present but not at2? In secret R at3? So not at2 -> '-' -> correct?
    A: absent? CURBS has no A -> x -> correct? 
    N: absent -> x?
    E: absent? -> x?

Second guess: ""court"" -> 
  CURBS: 
    C: ✓ 
    O: absent? CURBS has no O -> x -> correct? 
    U: we put U at position3? But secret has U at position2? So U is present but at different position? '-' -> we got that? 
    R: we put R at position4? But secret has R at position3? So R present but at4? -> '-' -> correct? 
    T: absent? CURBS has no T -> x? 

So it fits? 

Another word? CURDS? Same? 

So CURBS? or CURDS?

But CURBS and CURDS both seem to fit? 

Also: 
Pattern C U ? ? R (if R at5?): 
For example: C U S R ? not common? 

Or CUL?R? 
CUBER? But E? not?

But CURBS seems a good candidate? 

But we haven't tried CUR?X? We should consider? 

What about words without U at position2? 

Pattern: C ? R U ? ? 
Example: CRUD? Not 5 letters? 

Pattern: C ? R ? U 
Example: CHIRU? Not English? 

Pattern: C ? ? U R 
e.g., CLAUR? Not word? 

So the most likely: CURxx? 

So CURBS? CURDS? CURVY? but V? 

Also: CURIO? 
CURIO: C U R I O -> positions: 
  Pos2: U 
  Pos3: R 

Then this? 
But O is absent? So CURIO? 
In the second guess: we guessed court: 
  For CURIO: 
    O is in the secret? Second guess: court: O is at position2? But CURIO has O at position5? So O is present? But the feedback for court said O is absent? 

But wait: in second guess court: 
  we got O? But our feedback says court: O -> x? meaning absent? 
Therefore, CURIO cannot be because it has O? 

Therefore, O in CURIO would be present? But we know O is absent? 

Thus, CURIO invalid? 

Similarly, any word containing O, T, A, E, N? 

Therefore, CURBS and CURDS? 
Also: CURVY? But V and Y? 

Now, CURBS: letters B,S? 
CURDS: letters D,S? 

We don't know which? 

We need to make a guess? 

I think CURBS is a valid word? 

But our previous guesses: we haven't tested B or D? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that contains R at pos5? But we don't have any obvious word? 

But note: U must be in 2,4,5? And if we avoid position2? 

Position2?:

If we make a guess that tests position2? 

We have not guessed position2? 

We know it cannot be A,E,N,O,T? So possibilities? 

But we know U can be at pos2? 

Alternatively, letters: B, C? But we cannot use C? 

We can try: CURBS? 

But let me think? We can also try to get more information? 

Since CURBS might be the word? But we don't know? 

We can also try:

Word: CHUR? But without special? 

Actually, we can try ""curbs"": C U R B S? 

Or: since we have three positions left? We need to guess? 

We have 6 tries? We are on third? 

We need to test: is U at pos2? R at pos3? Then the last two? 

But we don't know?

Alternatively, we could guess a word that has different placements? 

But we have constraints? 

We want to verify U's position? If we think U might be at pos2? 

We can make a guess that has U at pos2? That we haven't done? We haven't put U at pos2? 

First guess: U is not used? 
Second guess: U at pos3? 
So we haven't tried U at pos2? 

If we guess CUR?S? Then we are testing U at pos2? 

Similarly, we must include R? 

And avoid absent letters: A,E,N,O,T? 

So: CUR?S? 

We have: CUR?S? And ? cannot be already absent? 

Possible letters? 

So: 

Word: CURBS (B), CURDS (D), or CURFS? Not word? 

Alternatively: if we don't put that pattern? 

But to test non-CUR words? 

Pattern: C U ? ? R? 

Example: CUP?R? Not common? 

So we stick to CURxx? 

Choose CURDS? 

Because D and S? 

But CURBS is also good? 

Alternative: we can test a word that has R at position5? 

For example: 
Put U at pos2? R at pos5? Then word: C U ? ? R? 

Examples: 
CUMIN? N? Out? 
CUBER? E? Out? 
CUTEr? Too many? 
So? 

CUB?R? Not? 

Perhaps CURLY? 
But L and Y? 
Pattern: C U R L Y? 
But we would have R at pos3? 

And U at pos2? 
And L at pos4? Y at pos5? 

Is that valid? 

Against first guess: 
""crane"" -> 
  R at pos2: we put? Then R at pos2? But secret has R at pos3? So R present but not at2: '-' -> ok? 
  Then in second guess: ""court""-> 
    O: absent? CURLY has O? No? 
    U: placed at pos3? Secret at pos2? So U present but not at3? '-' -> ok? 
    R: placed at pos4? Secret has R at pos3? So R present but at4? -> '-' -> ok? 
    T: absent? CURLY has no T? -> ok? 

What about letters? 
First guess: contains no L or Y? 
Second guess: contains no L or Y? 

So it fits? 

Therefore: CURLY? 
Or CURDS? CURBS? 

All fit? 

But we need to choose one? 

How about choosing a word that uses common letters? 

S is common? 

So CURBS? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, to avoid locking? 

We can guess a word that tests multiple positions? 

But at this point, we know:

- Position1: C
- Position2: we suspect U? 
- Position3: we suspect R? 
- Position4 and 5: two new letters? 

So we can guess CURBS? 

If we guess CURBS? and the word is CURBS, we get solved? 

If not? 

But we don't know? 

Also, position5: we haven't tested? 

But note: we have only one pattern? 

Alternatively, there is another pattern: 

Option: R at pos5? U at pos2? 
Then word: C U ? ? R? 

Example: CUBER? But E is absent? 
CUTER? E? 
CUV?E? No? 
CUS?R? 

CURVY? But R at pos3? 

Wait, C U R V Y? R at pos3? 

So only CUR?X patterns? 

Or CUK?R? Not? 

So CURxx? 

Therefore: Let us guess ""curbs"": 

Because ""curbs"" includes B? B is common? 

But CURBS? 

Perhaps CURLS? Has L and S? 

But L? 

But we haven't tested L? 

Alternatively: 

We can make a guess that doesn't assume U at pos2? 

For example: 

Word: ? 

Pattern: C ? R U ? 

But U is at pos4? And R at pos3? 

Example: CHURU? Not word? 

Pattern: C ? R ? U 
Example: CHIRU? Not word? 
SHIRU? Not? 

So only CUR? at the beginning? 

Therefore, we guess CURBS? 

CURBS: 
  C U R B S

Is that valid? 

Yes. 

But note: what if U is not at pos2? But at pos4? Then what? 

For instance: word like CRUS? But not? 

But let's think: 

If U is at pos4? Then pattern: C ? ? U ? 

And R? Must be at pos3 or pos5? 

But if at pos3? Then word: C ? R U ? 

But to avoid R at pos3? Then only R at pos5? So: C ? ? U R? 

Example: CHIUR? Not? 

Could it be? 

Example: CL? U R? 

Or: CLUB? Not? 

No common words? 

So likely the only possibility is CURxx? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""curbs"". 

But note: we have not tested B? 

But we have 6 guesses? We can guess and then learn? 

Since we are on third guess? 

So: guessed word: ""curbs""

But let me write the guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word with different vowels? 

But we have U? 

So: CURBS? 

But let's confirm: 
<guess>curbs</guess>Based on the feedback:

- **First Guess: CRANE**
  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is C.
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A(x), N(x), E(x): Eliminates A, N, E.

- **Second Guess: COURT**
  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is still C (consistent).
  - O(x): Eliminates O.
  - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - T(x): Eliminates T.

**Key Deductions:**
- The word starts with C.
- Contains R and U, but R cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and U cannot be in position 3.
- R must be in position 3 or 5, and U must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated letters: A, E, N, O, T.
- Possible letters for remaining positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The pattern must accommodate R/U placement without clashes (e.g., not R in position 2 or 4, not U in position 3).

Given U is likely in position 2 and R in position 3 (common pattern), **CURBS** fits:
- C (position 1), U (position 2), R (position 3), B (new), S (new).
- Tests all constraints and avoids eliminated letters.
- Provides new information on positions 4 (B) and 5 (S).

But note we don\'t know about I or S or P yet.\n\n But note: in the first guess, we used C,R,A,N,E so we must avoid A,N,E.\n\n Some candidate words: \n   ""curry"" -> but has double R? \n   ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> not necessarily, but we don\'t know about H,O,D.\n   ""crypt"" -> C R Y P T -> R is in position 2? But we got \'-\' for R in position 2 meaning it shouldn\'t be in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that would be bad? Actually, the feedback told us R is not in position 2, so in the new guess we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, our next guess should try to have R in a different position (i.e., not second).\n\n Since the word starts with C, and R is present but not in second position, possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n We should avoid repeating the letters that were already guessed and found absent: A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of words that start with C, have R in positions 3,4, or 5, and use new letters.\n\n Examples:\n - Position 3: e.g., ""co_ _ _"", but what? We don\'t know. How about ""charm""? Wait, but A is not allowed? A was absent, so we cannot use A. Since A is out, ""charm"" is invalid because it has A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was \'x\' meaning A is not in the secret word. So we cannot include A in the guess.\n\n Similarly, avoid N and E.\n\n Possible words:\n - R at position 3: ""c_ R _ _"", e.g., ""curry"" -> C U R R Y -> but note we don\'t know about U and Y. Also, it has double R? But we don\'t know if R is repeated? The feedback only said there is an R, but possibly more? We don\'t know. But we can use such words.\n\n - R at position 4: ""c_ _ R _"", e.g., ""court"" -> C O U R T -> but O, U, T are new.\n\n - R at position 5: ""c_ _ _ R"", e.g., ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> but second letter H? We don\'t know.\n\n We also want to cover common letters to get more information.\n\n Another idea: since we know position 1 is C, and R is present somewhere else, we can try a word that puts R in position 3,4 or 5 and uses other common letters.\n\n Let me list common letters that we haven\'t used: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.\n\n We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t have evidence yet.\n\n Since we don\'t have E or A, common vowels left are O, I, U.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that starts with C, avoids positions 1 and 2 for R (but position 1 is fixed as C so R won\'t go there) and R not in position 2.\n\n Candidate: ""curbs"" -> C U R B S -> R in position 3? Checks: no A,N,E, and R is in position 3 (so not 2). But is it a valid word? Yes, curbs is a word.\n\n Another: ""crisp"" -> but R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. So ""crisp"" is not okay because R is in position 2.\n\n What about ""crops""? C R O P S -> again, R is in position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2.\n\n So we must not put R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, words that start with C and have R in positions 3,4,5.\n\n Let me think of words:\n - With R in position 3: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> letters U, L, Y are new.\n - ""curvy"" -> C U R V Y -> V and Y new.\n - ""curds"" -> C U R D S -> D and S new.\n\n - With R in position 4: ""court"" -> C O U R T -> O, U, T new.\n - ""chord"" -> C H O R D -> H, O, D new.\n - ""churn"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So invalid because N is not allowed? But the word ""churn"" has N? So avoid it.\n\n - With R in position 5: ""choir"" -> C H O I R -> H, O, I new.\n - ""cedar"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n We need a word without A, E, N. \n\n I think ""court"" is a good candidate because it introduces O, U, R, T and R is in position 4 (so we test the position). Also, position 2 is O, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n Alternatively, ""curds"" is good because it tests D and S.\n\n But let me see which letters cover more common? S is a very common letter.\n\n Also note: we must not reuse the absent letters (A, E, N).\n\n Another word: ""curio"" -> C U R I O -> R in position 3? But it is 5 letters? ""curio"" is 5 letters: C U R I O -> R is in position 3? Wait, positions: \n  1: C\n  2: U\n  3: R\n  4: I\n  5: O\n So it is valid? Yes.\n\n But perhaps ""crypt"" is more common? ""crypt"": C R Y P T -> but R is in position 2 -> avoid! So we cannot use words with R in the second position.\n\n So back to words without R in second.\n\n Another word: ""crowd"" -> C R O W D -> again, R in position 2 -> avoid.\n\n So we must only consider words with R in positions 3,4,5.\n\n Let me choose ""curly"": \n  C U R L Y\n  This introduces U (vowel), L, Y (can be vowel or consonant).\n\n Or ""curbs"": \n  C U R B S\n  Introduces U, B, S.\n\n Since S is more common, maybe ""curbs"" is better? But we want to cover letters? \n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 5? \n\n Word: ""civic"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word? Wait, the word must include R.\n\n So the word must have R somewhere from 3 to 5.\n\n So how about ""comic""? That doesn\'t have R. So we must include R.\n\n So what about ""circa""? But C is already in position 1? And it has A? A is absent, so avoid.\n\n Okay, let\'s choose ""curbs"": \n   C - position 1: we know it\'s correct and we\'ll get ✓ for that.\n   We put U at position 2: we don\'t know about U? It could be present or absent? but we haven\'t tested U before.\n   R at position 3: we hope to check if R is at position 3? \n   B at position 4: new letter.\n   S at position 5: new letter.\n\n But also, we can consider testing multiple letters? \n\n Another word: ""chirp"" -> C H I R P -> but R is in position 4? However, we don\'t know about H,I,P. And it doesn\'t have A,E,N. But also, note that the word starts with C, so H is at position 2? \n\n But we have never tested position 2? So we might get information about H? \n\n Similarly, in ""curbs"", U is at position 2? \n\n So both are options.\n\n However, ""chirp"" avoids using U, but we don\'t know if U is in the word? We might want to test U? \n\n But note, the secret word might have other vowels? Since A,E are absent, the vowel must be O,I,U, or Y? \n\n We should prioritize checking vowels and common consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""proxy"" but not starting with C? We must start with C? So no.\n\n Another word: ""crypt"" but we can\'t because of R in position 2.\n\n What about ""crock""? But it has two C\'s? And we already know C is at the start? But the word has C at both start and end? But the secret word has C at position 1, and we don\'t know about other positions? However, we haven\'t tested C in other positions? But the feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was in position 1. However, it\'s possible the word has more than one C? The feedback didn\'t indicate that. But we don\'t know.\n\n Actually, the feedback only marked the C in position 1 as correct. If there were another C, we would have seen another ✓ or - for the other occurrence? But we didn\'t? But we didn\'t have any other C? So we don\'t know.\n\n So we can consider words with repeated C? But we don\'t have evidence, so let\'s avoid for now.\n\n Considering the options, I think ""court"" is a strong candidate:\n   C O U R T\n   Positions: \n     1: C (will be ✓)\n     2: O (new letter, vowel)\n     3: U (new letter, vowel)\n     4: R (testing R in position 4? Since we know it\'s not in position 2, and we haven\'t tried position 4)\n     5: T (new letter, common consonant)\n\n But note: we have already ruled out A,E,N. So O,U,T are all new.\n\n Alternatively, ""curds"" uses D and S? \n\n But ""court"" uses two vowels (O and U) which might be helpful? And T is common.\n\n Another candidate: ""curly"" -> C U R L Y -> L and Y.\n\n Let\'s pick ""court"" for now? \n\n But we must also avoid using letters we know are absent? And we are only avoiding A,E,N.\n\n So, I choose ""court"": \n   C O U R T\n\n But let me double-check: \n   - It has R in position 4? Yes, which is not position 2? Correct.\n   - No A,E,N? Correct.\n\n Also, it\'s a common word.\n\n Alternatively, ""curbs"" is another good candidate? \n\n To make a decision: I think trying a word that covers more vowels might be good? ""court"" has two vowels: O and U? But O is in position 2 and U in position 3? \n\n But ""curbs"" has U at position 2 and that\'s the only vowel? \n\n So ""court"" might give us more information about vowels.\n\n However, note the first guess had R at position 2 (in ""crane"") which was misplaced, so R is in the word but not at pos2? That doesn\'t prevent the word from having a vowel at pos2? So position2 might be a vowel? \n\n Also, the secret word: since it starts with C, and we don\'t have E, then the second letter might be O, U, I? Or even H? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""court"".\n\n But wait: the word ""court"" has O at position2? We haven\'t tested position2 at all? So we can get information about position2? And U at position3? \n\n Also, we should note that we are testing T at the end? \n\n So let\'s guess ""court"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ✓ for C: Correct letter in correct position (position 1)\n- - for R: R is in the word but not in position 2\n- x for A, N, E: None of these letters are in the word\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must start with C (position 1 confirmed)\n- Must include R, but **not** in position 2\n- Cannot use A, N, or E\n- Ideal to test new common letters for positions 2-5\n\nBest strategy:  \n- Select a word starting with C that places R in positions 3–5 to test new locations  \n- Include vowels not yet tested (O, U, I) and common consonants  \n- Avoid reused letters (A, N, E) and R in position 2  \n\nChosen word: **COURT**  \n- C in position 1 (verifies existing known)  \n- O in position 2 (tests a new vowel)  \n- U in position 3 (tests another vowel)  \n- R in position 4 (tests R away from position 2)  \n- T in position 5 (tests a common consonant)\n\n<guess>court</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: court -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(-) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C is correct and in the correct position (position 1).

So O is not in the word.\n- U is present but not in position 3 (since we got \'-\', meaning present but wrong position).\n- R is present but not in position 4 (again, \'-\' indicates wrong position).\n- T is absent. So T is not in the word.\n\nWhat we know:\n- The secret word starts with C (position 1).\n- The word contains R, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? \n  But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5? \n  However, we also have U present, and it was in position 3 in ""court"", so U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But position 1 is C, so U cannot be in position 1. Therefore, U must be in position 2,4, or 5? But note: R must be in the word and the only positions left for R are 3 and 5 (since 2 is not allowed and 4 is now not allowed?).\n\nBut wait: from the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2.\nThen in the second guess, we put R in position 4 and got \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in position 4? So R is in position 3 or 5? \n\nSimilarly, U: we put U in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3? So U must be in positions 2,4, or 5? \n\nBut note: the secret word cannot have duplicates unless they are repeated? But we don\'t know. However, we have not encountered any duplicate letters so far.\n\nNow, we also have confirmed absent letters: \n- A (from first guess)\n- N (from first guess)\n- E (from first guess)\n- O (from second guess)\n- T (from second guess)\n\nSo absent: A, E, N, O, T.\n\nWe have present letters: \n- C (fixed at position 1)\n- R (must be in position 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are eliminated? But note: we only tested position 4? It could be in position 5? Or position 3?)\n- U (must be in position 2,4, or 5? Since it cannot be in 3)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Position 1: C\n- Positions 2,3,4,5: must include R and U? But not necessarily: could have R and U, but R must be somewhere? U must be somewhere? \nBut note: R is already confirmed? Yes, from the first guess. And U is confirmed from the second guess.\n\nAlso, the current state:\n\nKnown positions: \n1: C\n2: unknown? but cannot be O (since O absent) and cannot be R?

Yes. So it must be a new letter? And U could be there? Or other letters? \n\nBut U must be in in 2,4, or 5? So position 2 is a candidate for U.\n\nSimilarly, R must be in 3 or 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are wrong? \n\nBut wait: the second guess: R was in position 4 and we got \'-\', meaning R is present but not in position 4? So for R, positions 2 and 4 are wrong. Since position 1 is C, R must be in position 3 or 5? \n\nFor U: last guess had U in position 3? We got \'-\' meaning U is present but not in position 3? So U must be in position 2,4, or 5? \n\nTherefore, the secret word must be:\n\nPositions:\n1: C (fixed)\n2: U? or another letter? \n3: could be R? or if not, then not R? \n4: U? or another letter? \n5: R? or U? \n\nBut note: we have only two confirmed letters: R and U? Or we might have more letters? But we know C, R, U? \n\nAlso, the word must be 5 letters? \n\nBut we have now: C (pos1), and then R and U? So the word must have three more letters? But we already have three letters? So including C? \n\nActually: \n- C is at pos1.\n- R must be at one of the remaining positions? \n- U must be at one of the remaining positions? \n\nBut R and U could be the same? Only if the word has two R\'s or two U\'s? But we don\'t know. But so far, we haven\'t seen duplicates? \n\nHowever, it\'s possible? But we haven\'t had any feedback indicating duplicates? Because in the feedback, we didn\'t mark duplicate? \n\nBut let\'s assume we don\'t have duplicates for simplicity? Since no duplicate indication? \n\nIf we assume no duplicates: then R and U are distinct? Then the secret word has exactly these: C, R, U, plus two other letters? \n\nTherefore, positions:\n\nWe must assign two remaining letters? \n\nBut we know that? \n\nNow, the letter pool: we have C,R,U and then two other letters? \n\nBut which letters? \n\nThe absent letters: A,E,N,O,T are out? \n\nPossible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that starts with C, has R and U? \n\nWe also know positions:\n\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: cannot be R? (because then we would have gotten R correct? We tried R at position2 and we got \'-\', meaning not there). If position2 had been R, we would have gotten a checkmark? But we did not? So R is not in position2? So position2 cannot be R? \n\nSimilarly, position4 cannot be R? Because we put R at pos4 and got \'-\'? So if R were at pos4, we should have gotten a checkmark? But we got \'-\', meaning present but not at pos4? So R not at pos4? \n\nSimilarly for U: we put U at pos3? If U were at pos3, we would have gotten ✓ for U? But we got \'-\' meaning present but not at pos3? So U is not at pos3? \n\nTherefore:\n\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- Position 2: must be one of the letters? It can be U? Since U must be at 2,4, or 5? \n- Position 3: cannot be U? So must be either R? Or something else? But R can be at pos3? \n- Position 4: cannot be R and cannot be U? Wait, no? U can be at position4? Because U might be at pos4? But position4: cannot be R? But U can be? \n- Position 5: can be R or U? \n\nSo:\n\nOption 1: R at pos3, U at pos2? Then positions: \n  pos2: U? \n  pos3: R? \n  then positions 4 and 5: unknowns? \n\nOption 2: R at pos3, U at pos4? \n  pos2: ? \n  pos3: R\n  pos4: U\n\nOption 3: R at pos3, U at pos5?\n  pos2: ?\n  pos3: R\n  pos5: U\n\nOption 4: R at pos5, U at pos2? \n  pos2: U\n  pos3: ?\n  pos5: R\n\nOption 5: R at pos5, U at pos4? \n\nBut wait: U can be at pos2,4,or5? \nAnd R must be in positions 3 or 5? \n\nSo:\nOption 1: R at pos3, U at pos2 -> then the word is: C U R ? ?\nOption 2: R at pos3, U at pos4 -> C ? R U ?\nOption 3: R at pos3, U at pos5 -> C ? R ? U\nOption 4: R at pos5, U at pos2 -> C U ? ? R\nOption 5: R at pos5, U at pos4 -> C ? ? U R\n\nWe need to fill the remaining two positions with letters that aren\'t A,E,N,O,T, and also not C? (unless duplicates? But no duplicate of C indicated? So we avoid C too?) \n\nSince position1 is C and we haven\'t seen duplicate feedback, we assume no duplicate C? Similarly for R and U? But we don\'t know? But we don\'t have evidence, so avoid duplicates? \n\nAlso, we have used: C, R, U? So the other two letters must be new? \n\nTherefore, the secret word is one of these patterns? \n\nNow, common words? \n\nOption 1: CUR_X_? \nExample: CUR_Y? CURBY? Not a word? CURSE? But S and E? E is absent? CURRY? But R repeated? \nBut note: R is repeated? In ""curry"", R at pos3 and R at pos4? But we know R is at least at one position? But it can be repeated? \n\nBut in our previous guesses:\n- In first guess, we had C R A N E: only one R? And we got R at position2 as present but mislocated? Which meant at least one R exists? \n- In second guess: C O U R T: R at pos4? We got R present but mislocated? That could be because R is at a different position? Or because there is another R? \n\nBut if the word had two R? Then both would have been marked? In the first guess? But we only had one R? So we marked one? \n\nSimilarly, in the second guess, we marked one R? \n\nSo it\'s possible? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut without evidence, we can assume only one R? Similarly for U? \n\nBut wait: in the second guess, U was only one? \n\nSo let\'s assume no duplicates? \n\nTherefore, in Option 1: CUR?? where the last two letters not R or U? \n\nSimilarly, other patterns? \n\nPossible words:\n\nPattern CUR??:\n- CURDS? But D and S? And D,S are not absent? \n  We guessed: ""crane"" and ""court"": for CURDS, \n  Letters: C,U,R,D,S? \n  We haven\'t used D or S? And A,E,N,O,T absent? \n  CURDS is a valid word: ""curds"" meaning lumps in cheese? etc.\n\nPattern CR?U? (R at pos3, U at pos5): \n  Example: CRUS? But that\'s not 5 letters? CRU? Something? CRUMB? Not 5? CRU? something? \n  CRUMP? But M and P? Not a common word? \n\nAlternatively, Pattern CU?R? (R at pos5? and U at pos2?): \n  Example: CUS?ER? Not common? \n\nMore feasible:\n\nPattern C?R?U: \n  Example: CHURN? But N is absent? So not allowed? \n\nPattern C?RU? \n  Example: CRUMB? Again, not 5? \n\nLet me list candidate words?\n\nWe know:\nSecret word must: start with C, contain R and U? And two other letters? \n\nCommon words: \n- CURD? But that\'s 4 letters? \n- CURVE? But V? Only? \n- CURRY? But it has two R\'s? And Y? But that would be: CURRY: positions? \n  C U R R Y\n  So pattern: CURRY: \n    Position1: C (correct)\n    Position2: U? \n    Position3: R? \n    Position4: R? \n    Position5: Y? \n\nBut then we are using R twice? \n\nIf the word is CURRY:\nIn first guess: ""crane"": \n  C (pos1:✓), R (pos2: -> present, but at pos2? But the secret has R at pos3 and pos4? So R is present? And we marked R at pos2 as \'-\' (wrong position)? \n  That applies because R is present but not at pos2? \n\nThen second guess ""court"":\n  C (✓), O (absent? but CURRY has O? No? CURRY has O? CURRY: C,U,R,R,Y? No O? So O should be absent? Which matches? \n  U: at pos3? But in the secret, U is at pos2? So U is present but not at pos3? Should be marked \'-\' ? Yes? \n  R: at pos4? In secret, R at pos3 and pos4? So R at pos4? Should be ✓? Not \'-\'? \n\nBut in the feedback for court: R got \'-\', meaning wrong position? \nBut if CURRY has R at pos4? Then guess court puts R at pos4? Should be ✓? \n\nBut we got \'-\' for R? So that means that in the secret word, position4 is not R? \n\nTherefore, CURRY would be incorrect? Because it has R at pos4? \n\nBut we got for R in court: \'-\' for R? So secret word does not have R at position4? \n\nTherefore, CURRY has R at pos4? So it cannot be CURRY? \n\nSimilarly, any word with R at pos4? \n\nSo R must be at pos3 or pos5? \n\nTherefore, CURRY is invalid? \n\nNow, let\'s consider without duplicates? \n\nPattern C U R ? ? \n\nPossible words: \n- CURED? Has E? E absent? \n- CURVE? But V? and E? E absent? \n- CURVY? Not common? \n- CURBS? but we have S? \n  CURBS: \n    Positions: C U R B S? \n\nWould it fit? \nIn secret word: \nPosition1: C (✓) \nPosition2: U? \nPosition3: R? \nPosition4: B? \nPosition5: S? \n\nCheck against first guess?\nGuess1: ""crane"" -> \n  Positions: \n    C at1: ✓ \n    R at2: present but not at2? In secret R at3? So not at2 -> \'-\' -> correct?\n    A: absent? CURBS has no A -> x -> correct? \n    N: absent -> x?\n    E: absent? -> x?\n\nSecond guess: ""court"" -> \n  CURBS: \n    C: ✓ \n    O: absent? CURBS has no O -> x -> correct? \n    U: we put U at position3? But secret has U at position2? So U is present but at different position? \'-\' -> we got that? \n    R: we put R at position4? But secret has R at position3? So R present but at4? -> \'-\' -> correct? \n    T: absent? CURBS has no T -> x? \n\nSo it fits? \n\nAnother word? CURDS? Same? \n\nSo CURBS? or CURDS?\n\nBut CURBS and CURDS both seem to fit? \n\nAlso: \nPattern C U ? ? R (if R at5?): \nFor example: C U S R ? not common? \n\nOr CUL?R? \nCUBER? But E? not?\n\nBut CURBS seems a good candidate? \n\nBut we haven\'t tried CUR?X? We should consider? \n\nWhat about words without U at position2? \n\nPattern: C ? R U ? ? \nExample: CRUD? Not 5 letters? \n\nPattern: C ? R ? U \nExample: CHIRU? Not English? \n\nPattern: C ? ? U R \ne.g., CLAUR? Not word? \n\nSo the most likely: CURxx? \n\nSo CURBS? CURDS? CURVY? but V? \n\nAlso: CURIO? \nCURIO: C U R I O -> positions: \n  Pos2: U \n  Pos3: R \n\nThen this? \nBut O is absent? So CURIO? \nIn the second guess: we guessed court: \n  For CURIO: \n    O is in the secret? Second guess: court: O is at position2? But CURIO has O at position5? So O is present? But the feedback for court said O is absent? \n\nBut wait: in second guess court: \n  we got O? But our feedback says court: O -> x? meaning absent? \nTherefore, CURIO cannot be because it has O? \n\nTherefore, O in CURIO would be present? But we know O is absent? \n\nThus, CURIO invalid? \n\nSimilarly, any word containing O, T, A, E, N? \n\nTherefore, CURBS and CURDS? \nAlso: CURVY? But V and Y? \n\nNow, CURBS: letters B,S? \nCURDS: letters D,S? \n\nWe don\'t know which? \n\nWe need to make a guess? \n\nI think CURBS is a valid word? \n\nBut our previous guesses: we haven\'t tested B or D? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that contains R at pos5? But we don\'t have any obvious word? \n\nBut note: U must be in 2,4,5? And if we avoid position2? \n\nPosition2?:\n\nIf we make a guess that tests position2? \n\nWe have not guessed position2? \n\nWe know it cannot be A,E,N,O,T? So possibilities? \n\nBut we know U can be at pos2? \n\nAlternatively, letters: B, C? But we cannot use C? \n\nWe can try: CURBS? \n\nBut let me think? We can also try to get more information? \n\nSince CURBS might be the word? But we don\'t know? \n\nWe can also try:\n\nWord: CHUR? But without special? \n\nActually, we can try ""curbs"": C U R B S? \n\nOr: since we have three positions left? We need to guess? \n\nWe have 6 tries? We are on third? \n\nWe need to test: is U at pos2? R at pos3? Then the last two? \n\nBut we don\'t know?\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that has different placements? \n\nBut we have constraints? \n\nWe want to verify U\'s position? If we think U might be at pos2? \n\nWe can make a guess that has U at pos2? That we haven\'t done? We haven\'t put U at pos2? \n\nFirst guess: U is not used? \nSecond guess: U at pos3? \nSo we haven\'t tried U at pos2? \n\nIf we guess CUR?S? Then we are testing U at pos2? \n\nSimilarly, we must include R? \n\nAnd avoid absent letters: A,E,N,O,T? \n\nSo: CUR?S? \n\nWe have: CUR?S? And ? cannot be already absent? \n\nPossible letters? \n\nSo: \n\nWord: CURBS (B), CURDS (D), or CURFS? Not word? \n\nAlternatively: if we don\'t put that pattern? \n\nBut to test non-CUR words? \n\nPattern: C U ? ? R? \n\nExample: CUP?R? Not common? \n\nSo we stick to CURxx? \n\nChoose CURDS? \n\nBecause D and S? \n\nBut CURBS is also good? \n\nAlternative: we can test a word that has R at position5? \n\nFor example: \nPut U at pos2? R at pos5? Then word: C U ? ? R? \n\nExamples: \nCUMIN? N? Out? \nCUBER? E? Out? \nCUTEr? Too many? \nSo? \n\nCUB?R? Not? \n\nPerhaps CURLY? \nBut L and Y? \nPattern: C U R L Y? \nBut we would have R at pos3? \n\nAnd U at pos2? \nAnd L at pos4? Y at pos5? \n\nIs that valid? \n\nAgainst first guess: \n""crane"" -> \n  R at pos2: we put? Then R at pos2? But secret has R at pos3? So R present but not at2: \'-\' -> ok? \n  Then in second guess: ""court""-> \n    O: absent? CURLY has O? No? \n    U: placed at pos3? Secret at pos2? So U present but not at3? \'-\' -> ok? \n    R: placed at pos4? Secret has R at pos3? So R present but at4? -> \'-\' -> ok? \n    T: absent? CURLY has no T? -> ok? \n\nWhat about letters? \nFirst guess: contains no L or Y? \nSecond guess: contains no L or Y? \n\nSo it fits? \n\nTherefore: CURLY? \nOr CURDS? CURBS? \n\nAll fit? \n\nBut we need to choose one? \n\nHow about choosing a word that uses common letters? \n\nS is common? \n\nSo CURBS? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, to avoid locking? \n\nWe can guess a word that tests multiple positions? \n\nBut at this point, we know:\n\n- Position1: C\n- Position2: we suspect U? \n- Position3: we suspect R? \n- Position4 and 5: two new letters? \n\nSo we can guess CURBS? \n\nIf we guess CURBS? and the word is CURBS, we get solved? \n\nIf not? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlso, position5: we haven\'t tested? \n\nBut note: we have only one pattern? \n\nAlternatively, there is another pattern: \n\nOption: R at pos5? U at pos2? \nThen word: C U ? ? R? \n\nExample: CUBER? But E is absent? \nCUTER? E? \nCUV?E? No? \nCUS?R? \n\nCURVY? But R at pos3? \n\nWait, C U R V Y? R at pos3? \n\nSo only CUR?X patterns? \n\nOr CUK?R? Not? \n\nSo CURxx? \n\nTherefore: Let us guess ""curbs"": \n\nBecause ""curbs"" includes B? B is common? \n\nBut CURBS? \n\nPerhaps CURLS? Has L and S? \n\nBut L? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested L? \n\nAlternatively: \n\nWe can make a guess that doesn\'t assume U at pos2? \n\nFor example: \n\nWord: ? \n\nPattern: C ? R U ? \n\nBut U is at pos4? And R at pos3? \n\nExample: CHURU? Not word? \n\nPattern: C ? R ? U \nExample: CHIRU? Not word? \nSHIRU? Not? \n\nSo only CUR? at the beginning? \n\nTherefore, we guess CURBS? \n\nCURBS: \n  C U R B S\n\nIs that valid? \n\nYes. \n\nBut note: what if U is not at pos2? But at pos4? Then what? \n\nFor instance: word like CRUS? But not? \n\nBut let\'s think: \n\nIf U is at pos4? Then pattern: C ? ? U ? \n\nAnd R? Must be at pos3 or pos5? \n\nBut if at pos3? Then word: C ? R U ? \n\nBut to avoid R at pos3? Then only R at pos5? So: C ? ? U R? \n\nExample: CHIUR? Not? \n\nCould it be? \n\nExample: CL? U R? \n\nOr: CLUB? Not? \n\nNo common words? \n\nSo likely the only possibility is CURxx? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""curbs"". \n\nBut note: we have not tested B? \n\nBut we have 6 guesses? We can guess and then learn? \n\nSince we are on third guess? \n\nSo: guessed word: ""curbs""\n\nBut let me write the guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word with different vowels? \n\nBut we have U? \n\nSo: CURBS? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n<guess>curbs</guess>Based on the feedback:\n\n- **First Guess: CRANE**\n  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is C.\n  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - A(x), N(x), E(x): Eliminates A, N, E.\n\n- **Second Guess: COURT**\n  - C(✓): Confirms position 1 is still C (consistent).\n  - O(x): Eliminates O.\n  - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 3.\n  - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.\n  - T(x): Eliminates T.\n\n**Key Deductions:**\n- The word starts with C.\n- Contains R and U, but R cannot be in positions 2 or 4, and U cannot be in position 3.\n- R must be in position 3 or 5, and U must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- Eliminated letters: A, E, N, O, T.\n- Possible letters for remaining positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The pattern must accommodate R/U placement without clashes (e.g., not R in position 2 or 4, not U in position 3).\n\nGiven U is likely in position 2 and R in position 3 (common pattern), **CURBS** fits:\n- C (position 1), U (position 2), R (position 3), B (new), S (new).\n- Tests all constraints and avoids eliminated letters.\n- Provides new information on positions 4 (B) and 5 (S).\n\n<guess>curbs</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: court -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) U(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: curbs -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) B(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""curbs"":
- C(✓): Correct, position 1 is C (as before).
- U(✓): Correct, position 2 is U. This is new information: U is in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓): Correct, position 3 is R. This is also new: R is in the correct position (position 3).
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word is C U R _ _ (positions 1,2,3 are C, U, R respectively).
- We have eliminated letters: A, E, N, O, T, B, S.
- The remaining two letters (positions 4 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters: A, B, E, N, O, T, S.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CUR"" and ends with two letters from the available set.

Common words that fit ""CUR"" + two letters:
- CURDL? (but L is available, but CURDL is not 5 letters? CURDLE is 6. CURD is 4.)
- CURDY? (CURDY: meaning like curd? but is it a word? Sometimes used, but let's see)
- CURIO? But O is eliminated? O is absent, so no.
- CURVY? V and Y are available? But we have CURVY: C U R V Y -> positions 4: V, 5: Y.

But is CURVY a valid word? Yes, meaning curved.

Other possibilities:
- CURGY? Not a word.
- CURMY? No.
- CURFY? No.
- CURVY seems a strong candidate.

But are there others?
- CURLY: C U R L Y -> L and Y. But we have L and Y available? Yes. And CURLY is a common word.

But in the feedback for ""curbs"", we got S and B absent, but L and Y haven't been tested? So both are possible.

But we have two possibilities: CURVY and CURLY? 

But let's check if they fit the previous feedback.

First, for CURLY:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(-) ... R was at position 2, but in CURLY, R is at position 3? So R is present but not at position 2? That matches the '-' for R in guess1.
- Guess 2: ""court"" -> U was at position 3? But in CURLY, U is at position 2? So U is present but not at position 3? That matches the '-' for U. Also, O and T are absent? CURLY has no O or T? Correct.
- Guess 3: ""curbs"" -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) B(x) S(x) -> CURLY has no B or S? So B and S absent? Correct.

Similarly, for CURVY:
- Same as above? 
- Guess1: same? 
- Guess2: same? 
- Guess3: CURVY has no B or S? So B and S absent? Correct.

So both CURLY and CURVY are possible? 

But we need to choose one? 

We can also consider:
- CURDY? Meaning resembling curd? But is it a valid word? Sometimes, but less common. And D is available? 
  CURDY: C U R D Y -> positions 4: D, 5: Y.
- CURFS? Not a word? 
- CURVY and CURLY are more common.

But note: we have not tested L, V, Y, D, etc.

We are on the fourth guess? We have two possibilities? 

We can guess one? 

But if we guess CURLY and it's wrong, we still have one more guess? 

But we have 6 guesses? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that tests multiple letters? 

But we know the first three letters? So we have to fill the last two? 

We can guess CURLY? 

But let's see: if we guess CURLY and it's correct, we win? 

If not, we get feedback? 

Similarly for CURVY? 

But we don't know which? 

We can also consider CURDY? 

But let's list all possible words? 

Possible words: 
- CURLY (L and Y)
- CURVY (V and Y)
- CURDY (D and Y)
- CURFY? Not a word.
- CURGY? No.
- CURMY? No.
- CURPY? No.
- CURWY? No.
- CURKY? No.
- CURQY? No.

Also, with other letters? 
- CURLS? But S is absent? So no? 
- CURDS? But S is absent? 
- CURBS? We tried? and B absent? 

So only words ending with Y? 

What about without Y? 
- CURL? Not 5 letters? 
- CURD? Not 5? 
- CURF? Not? 

So it seems the only possibilities are CUR?Y? 

With the fourth letter being L, V, D, etc? 

But we have: 
- CURLY: L at pos4, Y at pos5
- CURVY: V at pos4, Y at pos5
- CURDY: D at pos4, Y at pos5
- CURMY? Not a word? 
- CURPY? Not? 
- CURWY? Not? 
- CURKY? Not? 
- CURQY? Not? 
- CURXY? Not? 

So only CURLY, CURVY, CURDY? 

But CURDY is less common? 

We can also check CURVY and CURLY? 

But we have not tested L, V, D? 

We can guess CURLY? 

But to be safe? 

Since we have multiple options, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters? 

But we are constrained? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily the answer but tests the possible letters? 

For example, we can guess a word that has L, V, D? 

But we don't have such a word? 

We know the first three letters? So we must guess a word starting with CUR? 

So we have to choose one? 

We can guess CURLY? 

If it's wrong, we know the fourth letter is not L? Then we can try CURVY? 

Similarly? 

But we have two guesses left? 

So let's guess CURLY? 

Because it's a common word? 

So: 

<guess>curly</guess> 

But let me write? 

Alternatively, we can think: 

In the available letters, Y is common? 

But both have Y? 

So we need to test the fourth letter? 

We can guess CURLY? 

Yes.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(✓) confirms position 1 is C. R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. A(x), N(x), E(x) eliminate A, N, E.
- **Guess 2 (COURT)**: C(✓) reconfirms position 1. O(x) eliminates O. U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3. R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4. T(x) eliminates T.
- **Guess 3 (CURBS)**: C(✓) reconfirms position 1. U(✓) confirms U is in position 2. R(✓) confirms R is in position 3. B(x) and S(x) eliminate B and S.

### Deductions:
- The word starts with **CUR** (positions 1–3 confirmed).
- Eliminated letters: **A, B, E, N, O, T, S**.
- Remaining letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word pattern is **CUR _ _** (positions 4 and 5 unknown).

### Analysis:
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""CUR"" and ending with two letters from the remaining pool include **CURLY** (L and Y), **CURVY** (V and Y), and **CURDY** (D and Y).
- **CURLY** is a high-frequency word and tests two common letters (L and Y). If incorrect, feedback will help narrow down position 4/5 options (e.g., if L is absent, CURVY or CURDY become candidates).

Given this, **CURLY** is the optimal guess to maximize information and solve efficiently.

<guess>curly</guess>",curly,"We have feedback from the third guess ""curbs"":
- C(✓): Correct, position 1 is C (as before).
- U(✓): Correct, position 2 is U. This is new information: U is in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓): Correct, position 3 is R. This is also new: R is in the correct position (position 3).
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word is C U R _ _ (positions 1,2,3 are C, U, R respectively).
- We have eliminated letters: A, E, N, O, T, B, S.
- The remaining two letters (positions 4 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters: A, B, E, N, O, T, S.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CUR"" and ends with two letters from the available set.

Common words that fit ""CUR"" + two letters:
- CURDL? (but L is available, but CURDL is not 5 letters? CURDLE is 6. CURD is 4.)
- CURDY? (CURDY: meaning like curd? but is it a word? Sometimes used, but let's see)
- CURIO? But O is eliminated? O is absent, so no.
- CURVY? V and Y are available? But we have CURVY: C U R V Y -> positions 4: V, 5: Y.

But is CURVY a valid word? Yes, meaning curved.

Other possibilities:
- CURGY? Not a word.
- CURMY? No.
- CURFY? No.
- CURVY seems a strong candidate.

But are there others?
- CURLY: C U R L Y -> L and Y. But we have L and Y available? Yes. And CURLY is a common word.

But in the feedback for ""curbs"", we got S and B absent, but L and Y haven't been tested? So both are possible.

But we have two possibilities: CURVY and CURLY? 

But let's check if they fit the previous feedback.

First, for CURLY:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(-) ... R was at position 2, but in CURLY, R is at position 3? So R is present but not at position 2? That matches the '-' for R in guess1.
- Guess 2: ""court"" -> U was at position 3? But in CURLY, U is at position 2? So U is present but not at position 3? That matches the '-' for U. Also, O and T are absent? CURLY has no O or T? Correct.
- Guess 3: ""curbs"" -> C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) B(x) S(x) -> CURLY has no B or S? So B and S absent? Correct.

Similarly, for CURVY:
- Same as above? 
- Guess1: same? 
- Guess2: same? 
- Guess3: CURVY has no B or S? So B and S absent? Correct.

So both CURLY and CURVY are possible? 

But we need to choose one? 

We can also consider:
- CURDY? Meaning resembling curd? But is it a valid word? Sometimes, but less common. And D is available? 
  CURDY: C U R D Y -> positions 4: D, 5: Y.
- CURFS? Not a word? 
- CURVY and CURLY are more common.

But note: we have not tested L, V, Y, D, etc.

We are on the fourth guess? We have two possibilities? 

We can guess one? 

But if we guess CURLY and it's wrong, we still have one more guess? 

But we have 6 guesses? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that tests multiple letters? 

But we know the first three letters? So we have to fill the last two? 

We can guess CURLY? 

But let's see: if we guess CURLY and it's correct, we win? 

If not, we get feedback? 

Similarly for CURVY? 

But we don't know which? 

We can also consider CURDY? 

But let's list all possible words? 

Possible words: 
- CURLY (L and Y)
- CURVY (V and Y)
- CURDY (D and Y)
- CURFY? Not a word.
- CURGY? No.
- CURMY? No.
- CURPY? No.
- CURWY? No.
- CURKY? No.
- CURQY? No.

Also, with other letters? 
- CURLS? But S is absent? So no? 
- CURDS? But S is absent? 
- CURBS? We tried? and B absent? 

So only words ending with Y? 

What about without Y? 
- CURL? Not 5 letters? 
- CURD? Not 5? 
- CURF? Not? 

So it seems the only possibilities are CUR?Y? 

With the fourth letter being L, V, D, etc? 

But we have: 
- CURLY: L at pos4, Y at pos5
- CURVY: V at pos4, Y at pos5
- CURDY: D at pos4, Y at pos5
- CURMY? Not a word? 
- CURPY? Not? 
- CURWY? Not? 
- CURKY? Not? 
- CURQY? Not? 
- CURXY? Not? 

So only CURLY, CURVY, CURDY? 

But CURDY is less common? 

We can also check CURVY and CURLY? 

But we have not tested L, V, D? 

We can guess CURLY? 

But to be safe? 

Since we have multiple options, we can try to guess a word that uses common letters? 

But we are constrained? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily the answer but tests the possible letters? 

For example, we can guess a word that has L, V, D? 

But we don't have such a word? 

We know the first three letters? So we must guess a word starting with CUR? 

So we have to choose one? 

We can guess CURLY? 

If it's wrong, we know the fourth letter is not L? Then we can try CURVY? 

Similarly? 

But we have two guesses left? 

So let's guess CURLY? 

Because it's a common word? 

So: 

<guess>curly</guess> 

But let me write? 

Alternatively, we can think: 

In the available letters, Y is common? 

But both have Y? 

So we need to test the fourth letter? 

We can guess CURLY? 

Yes.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(✓) confirms position 1 is C. R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. A(x), N(x), E(x) eliminate A, N, E.
- **Guess 2 (COURT)**: C(✓) reconfirms position 1. O(x) eliminates O. U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3. R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4. T(x) eliminates T.
- **Guess 3 (CURBS)**: C(✓) reconfirms position 1. U(✓) confirms U is in position 2. R(✓) confirms R is in position 3. B(x) and S(x) eliminate B and S.

### Deductions:
- The word starts with **CUR** (positions 1–3 confirmed).
- Eliminated letters: **A, B, E, N, O, T, S**.
- Remaining letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word pattern is **CUR _ _** (positions 4 and 5 unknown).

### Analysis:
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""CUR"" and ending with two letters from the remaining pool include **CURLY** (L and Y), **CURVY** (V and Y), and **CURDY** (D and Y).
- **CURLY** is a high-frequency word and tests two common letters (L and Y). If incorrect, feedback will help narrow down position 4/5 options (e.g., if L is absent, CURVY or CURDY become candidates).

Given this, **CURLY** is the optimal guess to maximize information and solve efficiently.",Guess 4: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
