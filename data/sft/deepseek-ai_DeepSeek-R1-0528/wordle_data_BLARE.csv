We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: marked as ""x"" (not in the word)
- R: marked as ""-"" (in the word but wrong position)
- A: marked as ""✓"" (correct position, so A is the second letter)
- N: marked as ""x"" (not in the word)
- E: marked as ""✓"" (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

From the feedback:
- The second letter is A (since A is ✓ at position 2).
- The fifth letter is E (since E is ✓ at position 5).
- The letter R is in the word but not in the first position (since R was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
- C and N are not in the word.

The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E

We also know that R is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A, and position 5 is E, R must be in position 3 or 4.

We have 5 letters: the secret word is 5 letters long. Known positions: 2=A, 5=E. Known included letters: R (somewhere in 3 or 4). Known exclusions: C and N are not in the word.

For the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of R and also discover other letters.

We should use a word that:
- Has A at position 2 and E at position 5 (to keep the correct ones and test new letters).
- Includes R in either position 3 or 4 (to see where it fits).
- Does not use C or N (since they are excluded).

Moreover, we want to cover common letters to get more information.

Possible candidates: We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? A ? ? E

The third and fourth letters are unknown, but we must include R in one of them.

Let me think of words that fit:
- One common word is ""RAREE"" but that has two R's? However, we don't know if R can repeat. The feedback didn't show two R's, but we only guessed one R. We can't rule out two R's yet.

Alternatively, ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> This has A at position 2 and E at position 5, and R at position 3. Also, avoids C and N.

But note: we don't know if B or G are in the word? They are new letters.

Another word: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.

Or ""CARVE"": But C is excluded, so not allowed.

How about ""FARCE"": F A R C E -> C is excluded, so not allowed.

We must avoid C and N.

Another word: ""MARVE"" is not a word. 

Consider ""WARSE"" — not common. 

List of possible words: 
- R at position 3: words like BARGE, PARSE, FARSE (not word), DARES? but DARES has S at position 4? D A R E S -> but E is at position 4, not 5, so it would be D A R E S, which is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not E? We need E at the fifth.

So, pattern: _ A _ _ E

Let me find words: 
- With R at position 3: e.g., BARES (not common), CARES (but C excluded), DARES (if we use DARES, then position 4 is E, but the fifth is S? so not E at fifth).

Wait, no: the pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So, for example:
- MAPLE -> M A P L E: A at 2, E at 5. But where is R? We haven't included R? We must include R because we know R is in the word.

The feedback says R is in the word, so our next guess must include R? Actually, no: it's optional because we can try to find other letters, but it might be better to test for R.

Alternatively, we can skip testing R and try to get more information about other positions? But we know R is there and we haven't tested other positions. It's efficient to use the information.

So, let's choose a word that includes R and tries it in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- ""BARRE"" — two R's? Not common and might not be allowed? But let's see: BARRE is a word (meaning a ballet bar).
- ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3. Avoids C and N.
- ""PARGE"" — not common.
- ""TARES"": T A R E S -> but E at position 4? Then S at fifth? But E is at position 4, not fifth? No, we need E at fifth: so T A R E S? That's T[0], A[1], R[2], E[3], S[4] — but position 3 would be E, and fourth? This pattern doesn't have E at fifth? So it would be T A R E S -> [0]T, [1]A, [2]R, [3]E, [4]S: fifth is S. But we need fifth to be E? Then we cannot have any other letter at fifth? Why? Because the correct word has E at fifth? Yes.

So we must have E at the fifth position? Exactly: the pattern is: _ A _ _ E

Therefore, position 1: unknown, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

Words of the form: ? A ? ? E

And we must have an R in either position 3 or 4? Actually, except if we don't put R but then we risk not getting information? It's better to test R? The feedback says R is in the word, but we haven't fixed its position.

Valid words:
- With R at position 3: LARGE, BARGE, MARGE, PARGE? but PARGE is not common? Marge is acceptable? No, Marge is typically a name? But we need English words.

Common words:
- BARGE, LARGE, MARGE? not standard? 
- FARGE? not a word.

How about ""WARE""? That's 4 letters? Not 5.

""CARED"" — C excluded and E at fourth? Not fifth.

Then with R at position 4: words like ? A ? R E

For example: MAPRE? Not a word. Or LATER? Let's see: L A T E R -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But the fifth letter is R, not E. So that's L A T E R, and E is at position 4? Not 5? So doesn't fit.

Another possibility: F A C E R — again, C excluded and E at fourth? Fifth is R? Not E? 

It's challenging. Consider: ? A ? R E

The fifth letter must be E? Then position 4 is R? So pattern: _ A _ R E.

What are the words?
- ""CARE"" is 4 letters? 
- ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Fifth letter is R? Not E? So no.

Alternatively, ""BAR"": too short.

Actually, the pattern _ A _ R E: meaning position 4 is R and position 5 is E? So the word ends with ""RE""? 

For example: ""CARE"" is not 5. ""STARE"": S T A R E -> S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Doesn't fit? Because A must be at position 2? So pattern: position 0 is ?, position 1 is A (position 2?), let me index: 
Position 0: first letter (non-A)
Position 1: A (second letter)
Position 2: third letter
Position 3: R? 
Position 4: E (fifth)

And must be valid English words.

Examples: 
- ""PARRE""? Not word.
- ""FARSE""? Not word.
- ""BARGE"" — B A R G E: so position 0=B, position 1=A, position 2=R, position 3=G, position 4=E?
That doesn't put R at position 3 but at position 2 (third letter). Position 3 is G? 

Perhaps it's easier to list words: 
Known words: 
- LARGE: L A R G E -> fits pattern: first letter L, second A, third R, fourth G, fifth E? So positions = L(0), A(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) — so in terms of feedback: A at position 2? If A is second letter, we call it position 1? 

Clarify indexing: 
Guess word: 5 letters, position 1 to 5? Typically in programming we start index at 0? But the feedback: in the example, ""BRAVE"" -> B(1? ✓), R(2? ✓), etc? According to the example: ""Guess 1: STORM"" where S is first letter? Feedback: S(-) then T(x) etc.

In the feedback notation: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""
So it goes letter by letter in order? So the feedback corresponds to the positions? So for ""STORM"": 
Position 1: S -> marked as -
Position 2: T -> marked as x
Position 3: O -> marked as x
Position 4: R -> marked as -
Position 5: M -> marked as x

Similarly, in our case, ""crane"": 
- C (position 1): x? 
But the feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
So C is position 1? Then R at position 2? A at position 3? But feedback A is marked ✓, meaning correct position? So A is the third letter? 

Wait, feedback A(✓) says: the letter is in the word and in correct position? Therefore, in the secret word, A must be at the same position as in ""CRANE"" — which is position 3? Because ""CRANE"" is spelled: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Therefore:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in secret word
Position 2: R (-) -> in word, but not at position 2? So R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait: 
We know from feedback: A is at position 3? And E at position 5? So R must be in positions 1 or 4? Because position 3 is A? and 5 is E? 

Let me map:
Secret word: 5 letters: let's say position 1,2,3,4,5.
From first guess ""CRANE"":
- Position 1 (C): not in secret word -> secret[0] != C
- Position 2 (R): present but not at position 2 -> secret has R, but not at index 1 (position 2)
- Position 3 (A): present at position 3 -> secret[2] = A
- Position 4 (N): not in secret word -> secret[3] != N and word doesn't contain N
- Position 5 (E): present at position 5 -> secret[4] = E

Therefore, the secret word has:
- R somewhere, but not at position 2 (index 1). And not position 3 (which is A) or 5 (which is E)? So R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have no information about position 1 and 4.

Summary: 
Secret word: 
- Position 1: not C, and could be R? or a new letter
- Position 2: R is not there? Actually, the position 2 in secret must be a letter? But we know? No, we don't know what is in position 2? We know only position 3 is A and position 5 is E? 

Secret indices:
0: (first letter) - not C, but could be R or other
1: (second letter) - is not R? Feedback: R was guessed at position 2? Meaning at index 1? So secret[1] != R? So position 2 is not R? So R is at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A? So R cannot be at position 3? Position 5 is E? So R cannot be at position 5? Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Positions are defined as per order? Let me label:
In 5-letter word:
- Index 0: first character (position 1)
- Index 1: second character (position 2)
- Index 2: third character (position 3)
- Index 3: fourth character (position 4)
- Index 4: fifth character (position 5)

First guess ""CRANE"": 
- Index 0: 'C' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 1: 'R' -> - (present, but secret index1 != R)
- Index 2: 'A' -> ✓ (secret index2 = A)
- Index 3: 'N' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 4: 'E' -> ✓ (secret index4 = E)

So:
Secret[2] = A
Secret[4] = E
Secret contains R, but secret[1] != R? And R is not at index0 because we don't know? But secret[1] != R? Then R can be only at index3? Because index0, 2, 4 we have: index0 is ? (but not C), index2 = A (so R can't be), index4 = E (so R can't be). So secret must have R at index3? 

But index3 is the fourth letter? So position 4? 

Summary: 
Secret word: 
Index0: unknown, not C
Index1: unknown, but not R
Index2: A
Index3: ? - but since R is in the word and the only position left is index3 (unless there are multiple letters? but we don't know? For now, single R?) So likely R at index3?
Index4: E

Therefore, the secret word is: ? ? A R E

We know index1 cannot be R? But we don't know its value? Also, index0 is not C.

Therefore, the word is: [unknown not C] [unknown not R] A R E

But the fourth letter is R? And fifth E? So word: ??? + ""ARE""? So the word ends with ""ARE""? But wait: index2=A, index3=R, index4=E, so the last three letters are ""A R E"". In order: ... A, then R, then E? So ...ARE.

Not necessarily the word ending? Index2,3,4 make up positions 3,4,5: so letters 3: A, letter4: R, letter5: E.

Therefore, the secret word: 
- letter1 = ?
- letter2 = ? (cannot be R)
- letter3 = A
- letter4 = R
- letter5 = E

But we also know: no C, no N.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

For the next guess, it must be a 5-letter English word? We want to test possibilities for letter1 and letter2? We know letter2 is not R? And letter1 is not C? And not N? Since N is excluded.

Also, we can try to find letter1 and letter2? 

Good choices: use common consonants? For example, words like ""SHARE"": S H A R E -> S at index0, H at index1, and then A R E? But in ""SHARE"": positions: 
0: S
1: H
2: A -> correct? 
3: R -> correct? 
4: E -> correct? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Similarly, ""SPARE"": S P A R E

But that would give the pattern? 

We can also test ""PLARE""? Not a word.

Common words: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, etc.

But note: we want to maximize information? Because we know the pattern is ? ? A R E? And letters at positions 0 and 1? 

Alternatively, we could pick a word that has the required A R E at positions 2,3,4? But positions in the word: we need index2='A', index3='R', index4='E'. Also, our guess must be a word? 

For the next guess, we can have any word? Not necessarily matching the known positions? But matching known positions might be efficient.

Since we know A at position3 (index2) and R at position4 (index3) and E at position5 (index4), we can set them? Then only positions 1 and 2 (index0 and index1) are unknown? 

So guess pattern: X Y A R E? 

Now, what are possible? We need X and Y? Also, Y cannot be R? And X cannot be C or N? 

Common words of the form _ _ARE:

Examples: 
- SHARE: S H A R E -> Y=H at index1?
- SPARE: S P A R E -> Y=P?
- STARE: S T A R E -> Y=T?
- SNARE? But N is excluded? So we cannot use SNARE? Since N is excluded? 
- SWARE: is that a word? S W A R E? Not common? 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> Y=L?

Let's list: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, GLARE, BLARE, FLARE, etc.

But we don't know about the new letters? 

We also have the constraint that letter2 (index1) cannot be R? That's already known? And we aren't putting R at index1? So it's ok? 

We want to try letters that are common? To test possibilities.

Perhaps try ""SHARE"": 
- If it's SHARE, we win? Feedback will all be ✓? 
- But if not, we get information on S and H.

Similarly, we could try ""STARE"": to test T? 

But note: sometimes in the first positions? It might be efficient to use a word that tests two new letters? 

Choose ""STARE"": 
S T A R E

Then:
Position 0 (S): if S is in word? And correct or incorrect?
Position 1 (T): if T is in word? But we know position 1 cannot be R? And not C or N? T is possible.
Then position2 A: ✓
position3 R: ✓
position4 E: ✓

Then feedback will tell us for S and T? 

Alternatively, ""PLARE"" is not a word? So use ""SHARE"" or ""STARE"". 

Also, avoid known exclusions: we know C and N are out? So no issue.

I think ""STARE"" might be a good choice? Or ""SHARE""? 

But note: we haven't tested any vowels other than A, E? Remaining vowels: O, I, U? Also consonants? 

Since we are guessing two positions: index0 and index1? We can choose different starting letters? 

Let me pick ""BLARE"": B L A R E? To test B and L? 

""FLARE"": F L A R E, etc.

Perhaps ""SHARE""? S and H are common? 

I'll go with ""STARE"": to test S and T? Because S and T are common? 

""STARE"" is a common word.

So the guess is: STARE

But confirm: 
- Pattern: S T A R E? 
In the word STARE: 
Index0: S
Index1: T
Index2: A
Index3: R
Index4: E

We know Index2=A and Index3=R and Index4=E? So the feedback of A should be ✓, R should be ✓, E should be ✓.

Then S and T are the variables? But S in position 0 and T in position 1? 

If the secret word is BLARE, then for STARE:
Index0: S != B (so if B then S would be x or if in wrong position? But if secret has S? 

Since we don't know, we will get feedback: 
- S: might be ✓ if secret[0]=S? or - if secret has S but not at 0? or x if not in word? 
Similar for T? 

This will give us two new pieces of information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that avoids S and T? But in the pattern _ _ARE, we need to pick first letters? 

I think STARE is fine.

Another option: ""GLARE"": G and L? 

To avoid possible letters? But randomly, I think STARE is as good as any? 

So I'll stick with STARE for guess 2.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: correct position (✓)
- N: not present (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

We know:
1. The second letter (position 2) is A (✓).
2. The fifth letter (position 5) is E (✓).
3. R is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (since it was marked as - in position 2). Given that positions 2 (A) and 5 (E) are fixed, R must be in position 4 (the only remaining position where it can appear).
4. The word has the pattern: _ A _ R E (positions: 1 = ?, 2 = A, 3 = ?, 4 = R, 5 = E).
5. C and N are eliminated.

For the next guess:
- The word must be of the form ? ? A R E to test the remaining positions (1 and 3).
- ""STARE"" fits the pattern: 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: T (but note position 2 cannot be R!)
  - Position 3: A (✓)
  - Position 4: R (✓)
  - Position 5: E (✓)
- Using ""STARE"" tests S at position 1 and T at position 2, while confirming A, R, E at their fixed positions. This helps gather information on two new letters efficiently.

Another word: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.

Or ""CARVE"": But C is excluded, so not allowed.

How about ""FARCE"": F A R C E -> C is excluded, so not allowed.

We must avoid C and N.

Another word: ""MARVE"" is not a word. 

Consider ""WARSE"" — not common. 

List of possible words: 
- R at position 3: words like BARGE, PARSE, FARSE (not word), DARES? but DARES has S at position 4? D A R E S -> but E is at position 4, not 5, so it would be D A R E S, which is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not E? We need E at the fifth.

So, pattern: _ A _ _ E

Let me find words: 
- With R at position 3: e.g., BARES (not common), CARES (but C excluded), DARES (if we use DARES, then position 4 is E, but the fifth is S? so not E at fifth).

Wait, no: the pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So, for example:
- MAPLE -> M A P L E: A at 2, E at 5. But where is R? We haven't included R? We must include R because we know R is in the word.

The feedback says R is in the word, so our next guess must include R? Actually, no: it's optional because we can try to find other letters, but it might be better to test for R.

Alternatively, we can skip testing R and try to get more information about other positions? But we know R is there and we haven't tested other positions. It's efficient to use the information.

So, let's choose a word that includes R and tries it in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- ""BARRE"" — two R's? Not common and might not be allowed? But let's see: BARRE is a word (meaning a ballet bar).
- ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3. Avoids C and N.
- ""PARGE"" — not common.
- ""TARES"": T A R E S -> but E at position 4? Then S at fifth? But E is at position 4, not fifth? No, we need E at fifth: so T A R E S? That's T[0], A[1], R[2], E[3], S[4] — but position 3 would be E, and fourth? This pattern doesn't have E at fifth? So it would be T A R E S -> [0]T, [1]A, [2]R, [3]E, [4]S: fifth is S. But we need fifth to be E? Then we cannot have any other letter at fifth? Why? Because the correct word has E at fifth? Yes.

So we must have E at the fifth position? Exactly: the pattern is: _ A _ _ E

Therefore, position 1: unknown, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

Words of the form: ? A ? ? E

And we must have an R in either position 3 or 4? Actually, except if we don't put R but then we risk not getting information? It's better to test R? The feedback says R is in the word, but we haven't fixed its position.

Valid words:
- With R at position 3: LARGE, BARGE, MARGE, PARGE? but PARGE is not common? Marge is acceptable? No, Marge is typically a name? But we need English words.

Common words:
- BARGE, LARGE, MARGE? not standard? 
- FARGE? not a word.

How about ""WARE""? That's 4 letters? Not 5.

""CARED"" — C excluded and E at fourth? Not fifth.

Then with R at position 4: words like ? A ? R E

For example: MAPRE? Not a word. Or LATER? Let's see: L A T E R -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But the fifth letter is R, not E. So that's L A T E R, and E is at position 4? Not 5? So doesn't fit.

Another possibility: F A C E R — again, C excluded and E at fourth? Fifth is R? Not E? 

It's challenging. Consider: ? A ? R E

The fifth letter must be E? Then position 4 is R? So pattern: _ A _ R E.

What are the words?
- ""CARE"" is 4 letters? 
- ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Fifth letter is R? Not E? So no.

Alternatively, ""BAR"": too short.

Actually, the pattern _ A _ R E: meaning position 4 is R and position 5 is E? So the word ends with ""RE""? 

For example: ""CARE"" is not 5. ""STARE"": S T A R E -> S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Doesn't fit? Because A must be at position 2? So pattern: position 0 is ?, position 1 is A (position 2?), let me index: 
Position 0: first letter (non-A)
Position 1: A (second letter)
Position 2: third letter
Position 3: R? 
Position 4: E (fifth)

And must be valid English words.

Examples: 
- ""PARRE""? Not word.
- ""FARSE""? Not word.
- ""BARGE"" — B A R G E: so position 0=B, position 1=A, position 2=R, position 3=G, position 4=E?
That doesn't put R at position 3 but at position 2 (third letter). Position 3 is G? 

Perhaps it's easier to list words: 
Known words: 
- LARGE: L A R G E -> fits pattern: first letter L, second A, third R, fourth G, fifth E? So positions = L(0), A(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) — so in terms of feedback: A at position 2? If A is second letter, we call it position 1? 

Clarify indexing: 
Guess word: 5 letters, position 1 to 5? Typically in programming we start index at 0? But the feedback: in the example, ""BRAVE"" -> B(1? ✓), R(2? ✓), etc? According to the example: ""Guess 1: STORM"" where S is first letter? Feedback: S(-) then T(x) etc.

In the feedback notation: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""
So it goes letter by letter in order? So the feedback corresponds to the positions? So for ""STORM"": 
Position 1: S -> marked as -
Position 2: T -> marked as x
Position 3: O -> marked as x
Position 4: R -> marked as -
Position 5: M -> marked as x

Similarly, in our case, ""crane"": 
- C (position 1): x? 
But the feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
So C is position 1? Then R at position 2? A at position 3? But feedback A is marked ✓, meaning correct position? So A is the third letter? 

Wait, feedback A(✓) says: the letter is in the word and in correct position? Therefore, in the secret word, A must be at the same position as in ""CRANE"" — which is position 3? Because ""CRANE"" is spelled: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Therefore:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in secret word
Position 2: R (-) -> in word, but not at position 2? So R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait: 
We know from feedback: A is at position 3? And E at position 5? So R must be in positions 1 or 4? Because position 3 is A? and 5 is E? 

Let me map:
Secret word: 5 letters: let's say position 1,2,3,4,5.
From first guess ""CRANE"":
- Position 1 (C): not in secret word -> secret[0] != C
- Position 2 (R): present but not at position 2 -> secret has R, but not at index 1 (position 2)
- Position 3 (A): present at position 3 -> secret[2] = A
- Position 4 (N): not in secret word -> secret[3] != N and word doesn't contain N
- Position 5 (E): present at position 5 -> secret[4] = E

Therefore, the secret word has:
- R somewhere, but not at position 2 (index 1). And not position 3 (which is A) or 5 (which is E)? So R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have no information about position 1 and 4.

Summary: 
Secret word: 
- Position 1: not C, and could be R? or a new letter
- Position 2: R is not there? Actually, the position 2 in secret must be a letter? But we know? No, we don't know what is in position 2? We know only position 3 is A and position 5 is E? 

Secret indices:
0: (first letter) - not C, but could be R or other
1: (second letter) - is not R? Feedback: R was guessed at position 2? Meaning at index 1? So secret[1] != R? So position 2 is not R? So R is at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A? So R cannot be at position 3? Position 5 is E? So R cannot be at position 5? Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Positions are defined as per order? Let me label:
In 5-letter word:
- Index 0: first character (position 1)
- Index 1: second character (position 2)
- Index 2: third character (position 3)
- Index 3: fourth character (position 4)
- Index 4: fifth character (position 5)

First guess ""CRANE"": 
- Index 0: 'C' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 1: 'R' -> - (present, but secret index1 != R)
- Index 2: 'A' -> ✓ (secret index2 = A)
- Index 3: 'N' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 4: 'E' -> ✓ (secret index4 = E)

So:
Secret[2] = A
Secret[4] = E
Secret contains R, but secret[1] != R? And R is not at index0 because we don't know? But secret[1] != R? Then R can be only at index3? Because index0, 2, 4 we have: index0 is ? (but not C), index2 = A (so R can't be), index4 = E (so R can't be). So secret must have R at index3? 

But index3 is the fourth letter? So position 4? 

Summary: 
Secret word: 
Index0: unknown, not C
Index1: unknown, but not R
Index2: A
Index3: ? - but since R is in the word and the only position left is index3 (unless there are multiple letters? but we don't know? For now, single R?) So likely R at index3?
Index4: E

Therefore, the secret word is: ? ? A R E

We know index1 cannot be R? But we don't know its value? Also, index0 is not C.

Therefore, the word is: [unknown not C] [unknown not R] A R E

But the fourth letter is R? And fifth E? So word: ??? + ""ARE""? So the word ends with ""ARE""? But wait: index2=A, index3=R, index4=E, so the last three letters are ""A R E"". In order: ... A, then R, then E? So ...ARE.

Not necessarily the word ending? Index2,3,4 make up positions 3,4,5: so letters 3: A, letter4: R, letter5: E.

Therefore, the secret word: 
- letter1 = ?
- letter2 = ? (cannot be R)
- letter3 = A
- letter4 = R
- letter5 = E

But we also know: no C, no N.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

For the next guess, it must be a 5-letter English word? We want to test possibilities for letter1 and letter2? We know letter2 is not R? And letter1 is not C? And not N? Since N is excluded.

Also, we can try to find letter1 and letter2? 

Good choices: use common consonants? For example, words like ""SHARE"": S H A R E -> S at index0, H at index1, and then A R E? But in ""SHARE"": positions: 
0: S
1: H
2: A -> correct? 
3: R -> correct? 
4: E -> correct? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Similarly, ""SPARE"": S P A R E

But that would give the pattern? 

We can also test ""PLARE""? Not a word.

Common words: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, etc.

But note: we want to maximize information? Because we know the pattern is ? ? A R E? And letters at positions 0 and 1? 

Alternatively, we could pick a word that has the required A R E at positions 2,3,4? But positions in the word: we need index2='A', index3='R', index4='E'. Also, our guess must be a word? 

For the next guess, we can have any word? Not necessarily matching the known positions? But matching known positions might be efficient.

Since we know A at position3 (index2) and R at position4 (index3) and E at position5 (index4), we can set them? Then only positions 1 and 2 (index0 and index1) are unknown? 

So guess pattern: X Y A R E? 

Now, what are possible? We need X and Y? Also, Y cannot be R? And X cannot be C or N? 

Common words of the form _ _ARE:

Examples: 
- SHARE: S H A R E -> Y=H at index1?
- SPARE: S P A R E -> Y=P?
- STARE: S T A R E -> Y=T?
- SNARE? But N is excluded? So we cannot use SNARE? Since N is excluded? 
- SWARE: is that a word? S W A R E? Not common? 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> Y=L?

Let's list: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, GLARE, BLARE, FLARE, etc.

But we don't know about the new letters? 

We also have the constraint that letter2 (index1) cannot be R? That's already known? And we aren't putting R at index1? So it's ok? 

We want to try letters that are common? To test possibilities.

Perhaps try ""SHARE"": 
- If it's SHARE, we win? Feedback will all be ✓? 
- But if not, we get information on S and H.

Similarly, we could try ""STARE"": to test T? 

But note: sometimes in the first positions? It might be efficient to use a word that tests two new letters? 

Choose ""STARE"": 
S T A R E

Then:
Position 0 (S): if S is in word? And correct or incorrect?
Position 1 (T): if T is in word? But we know position 1 cannot be R? And not C or N? T is possible.
Then position2 A: ✓
position3 R: ✓
position4 E: ✓

Then feedback will tell us for S and T? 

Alternatively, ""PLARE"" is not a word? So use ""SHARE"" or ""STARE"". 

Also, avoid known exclusions: we know C and N are out? So no issue.

I think ""STARE"" might be a good choice? Or ""SHARE""? 

But note: we haven't tested any vowels other than A, E? Remaining vowels: O, I, U? Also consonants? 

Since we are guessing two positions: index0 and index1? We can choose different starting letters? 

Let me pick ""BLARE"": B L A R E? To test B and L? 

""FLARE"": F L A R E, etc.

Perhaps ""SHARE""? S and H are common? 

I'll go with ""STARE"": to test S and T? Because S and T are common? 

""STARE"" is a common word.

So the guess is: STARE

But confirm: 
- Pattern: S T A R E? 
In the word STARE: 
Index0: S
Index1: T
Index2: A
Index3: R
Index4: E

We know Index2=A and Index3=R and Index4=E? So the feedback of A should be ✓, R should be ✓, E should be ✓.

Then S and T are the variables? But S in position 0 and T in position 1? 

If the secret word is BLARE, then for STARE:
Index0: S != B (so if B then S would be x or if in wrong position? But if secret has S? 

Since we don't know, we will get feedback: 
- S: might be ✓ if secret[0]=S? or - if secret has S but not at 0? or x if not in word? 
Similar for T? 

This will give us two new pieces of information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that avoids S and T? But in the pattern _ _ARE, we need to pick first letters? 

I think STARE is fine.

Another option: ""GLARE"": G and L? 

To avoid possible letters? But randomly, I think STARE is as good as any? 

So I'll stick with STARE for guess 2.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: correct position (✓)
- N: not present (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

We know:
1. The second letter (position 2) is A (✓).
2. The fifth letter (position 5) is E (✓).
3. R is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (since it was marked as - in position 2). Given that positions 2 (A) and 5 (E) are fixed, R must be in position 4 (the only remaining position where it can appear).
4. The word has the pattern: _ A _ R E (positions: 1 = ?, 2 = A, 3 = ?, 4 = R, 5 = E).
5. C and N are eliminated.

For the next guess:
- The word must be of the form ? ? A R E to test the remaining positions (1 and 3).
- ""STARE"" fits the pattern: 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: T (but note position 2 cannot be R!)
  - Position 3: A (✓)
  - Position 4: R (✓)
  - Position 5: E (✓)
- Using ""STARE"" tests S at position 1 and T at position 2, while confirming A, R, E at their fixed positions. This helps gather information on two new letters efficiently.",Guess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BLARE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: marked as ""x"" (not in the word)
- R: marked as ""-"" (in the word but wrong position)
- A: marked as ""✓"" (correct position, so A is the second letter)
- N: marked as ""x"" (not in the word)
- E: marked as ""✓"" (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

From the feedback:
- The second letter is A (since A is ✓ at position 2).
- The fifth letter is E (since E is ✓ at position 5).
- The letter R is in the word but not in the first position (since R was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
- C and N are not in the word.

The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E

We also know that R is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A, and position 5 is E, R must be in position 3 or 4.

We have 5 letters: the secret word is 5 letters long. Known positions: 2=A, 5=E. Known included letters: R (somewhere in 3 or 4). Known exclusions: C and N are not in the word.

For the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of R and also discover other letters.

We should use a word that:
- Has A at position 2 and E at position 5 (to keep the correct ones and test new letters).
- Includes R in either position 3 or 4 (to see where it fits).
- Does not use C or N (since they are excluded).

Moreover, we want to cover common letters to get more information.

Possible candidates: We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? A ? ? E

The third and fourth letters are unknown, but we must include R in one of them.

Let me think of words that fit:
- One common word is ""RAREE"" but that has two R's? However, we don't know if R can repeat. The feedback didn't show two R's, but we only guessed one R. We can't rule out two R's yet.

Alternatively, ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> This has A at position 2 and E at position 5, and R at position 3. Also, avoids C and N.

But note: we don't know if B or G are in the word? They are new letters.

Another word: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.

Or ""CARVE"": But C is excluded, so not allowed.

How about ""FARCE"": F A R C E -> C is excluded, so not allowed.

We must avoid C and N.

Another word: ""MARVE"" is not a word. 

Consider ""WARSE"" — not common. 

List of possible words: 
- R at position 3: words like BARGE, PARSE, FARSE (not word), DARES? but DARES has S at position 4? D A R E S -> but E is at position 4, not 5, so it would be D A R E S, which is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not E? We need E at the fifth.

So, pattern: _ A _ _ E

Let me find words: 
- With R at position 3: e.g., BARES (not common), CARES (but C excluded), DARES (if we use DARES, then position 4 is E, but the fifth is S? so not E at fifth).

Wait, no: the pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So, for example:
- MAPLE -> M A P L E: A at 2, E at 5. But where is R? We haven't included R? We must include R because we know R is in the word.

The feedback says R is in the word, so our next guess must include R? Actually, no: it's optional because we can try to find other letters, but it might be better to test for R.

Alternatively, we can skip testing R and try to get more information about other positions? But we know R is there and we haven't tested other positions. It's efficient to use the information.

So, let's choose a word that includes R and tries it in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- ""BARRE"" — two R's? Not common and might not be allowed? But let's see: BARRE is a word (meaning a ballet bar).
- ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3. Avoids C and N.
- ""PARGE"" — not common.
- ""TARES"": T A R E S -> but E at position 4? Then S at fifth? But E is at position 4, not fifth? No, we need E at fifth: so T A R E S? That's T[0], A[1], R[2], E[3], S[4] — but position 3 would be E, and fourth? This pattern doesn't have E at fifth? So it would be T A R E S -> [0]T, [1]A, [2]R, [3]E, [4]S: fifth is S. But we need fifth to be E? Then we cannot have any other letter at fifth? Why? Because the correct word has E at fifth? Yes.

So we must have E at the fifth position? Exactly: the pattern is: _ A _ _ E

Therefore, position 1: unknown, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

Words of the form: ? A ? ? E

And we must have an R in either position 3 or 4? Actually, except if we don't put R but then we risk not getting information? It's better to test R? The feedback says R is in the word, but we haven't fixed its position.

Valid words:
- With R at position 3: LARGE, BARGE, MARGE, PARGE? but PARGE is not common? Marge is acceptable? No, Marge is typically a name? But we need English words.

Common words:
- BARGE, LARGE, MARGE? not standard? 
- FARGE? not a word.

How about ""WARE""? That's 4 letters? Not 5.

""CARED"" — C excluded and E at fourth? Not fifth.

Then with R at position 4: words like ? A ? R E

For example: MAPRE? Not a word. Or LATER? Let's see: L A T E R -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But the fifth letter is R, not E. So that's L A T E R, and E is at position 4? Not 5? So doesn't fit.

Another possibility: F A C E R — again, C excluded and E at fourth? Fifth is R? Not E? 

It's challenging. Consider: ? A ? R E

The fifth letter must be E? Then position 4 is R? So pattern: _ A _ R E.

What are the words?
- ""CARE"" is 4 letters? 
- ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Fifth letter is R? Not E? So no.

Alternatively, ""BAR"": too short.

Actually, the pattern _ A _ R E: meaning position 4 is R and position 5 is E? So the word ends with ""RE""? 

For example: ""CARE"" is not 5. ""STARE"": S T A R E -> S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Doesn't fit? Because A must be at position 2? So pattern: position 0 is ?, position 1 is A (position 2?), let me index: 
Position 0: first letter (non-A)
Position 1: A (second letter)
Position 2: third letter
Position 3: R? 
Position 4: E (fifth)

And must be valid English words.

Examples: 
- ""PARRE""? Not word.
- ""FARSE""? Not word.
- ""BARGE"" — B A R G E: so position 0=B, position 1=A, position 2=R, position 3=G, position 4=E?
That doesn't put R at position 3 but at position 2 (third letter). Position 3 is G? 

Perhaps it's easier to list words: 
Known words: 
- LARGE: L A R G E -> fits pattern: first letter L, second A, third R, fourth G, fifth E? So positions = L(0), A(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) — so in terms of feedback: A at position 2? If A is second letter, we call it position 1? 

Clarify indexing: 
Guess word: 5 letters, position 1 to 5? Typically in programming we start index at 0? But the feedback: in the example, ""BRAVE"" -> B(1? ✓), R(2? ✓), etc? According to the example: ""Guess 1: STORM"" where S is first letter? Feedback: S(-) then T(x) etc.

In the feedback notation: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""
So it goes letter by letter in order? So the feedback corresponds to the positions? So for ""STORM"": 
Position 1: S -> marked as -
Position 2: T -> marked as x
Position 3: O -> marked as x
Position 4: R -> marked as -
Position 5: M -> marked as x

Similarly, in our case, ""crane"": 
- C (position 1): x? 
But the feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
So C is position 1? Then R at position 2? A at position 3? But feedback A is marked ✓, meaning correct position? So A is the third letter? 

Wait, feedback A(✓) says: the letter is in the word and in correct position? Therefore, in the secret word, A must be at the same position as in ""CRANE"" — which is position 3? Because ""CRANE"" is spelled: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Therefore:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in secret word
Position 2: R (-) -> in word, but not at position 2? So R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait: 
We know from feedback: A is at position 3? And E at position 5? So R must be in positions 1 or 4? Because position 3 is A? and 5 is E? 

Let me map:
Secret word: 5 letters: let's say position 1,2,3,4,5.
From first guess ""CRANE"":
- Position 1 (C): not in secret word -> secret[0] != C
- Position 2 (R): present but not at position 2 -> secret has R, but not at index 1 (position 2)
- Position 3 (A): present at position 3 -> secret[2] = A
- Position 4 (N): not in secret word -> secret[3] != N and word doesn't contain N
- Position 5 (E): present at position 5 -> secret[4] = E

Therefore, the secret word has:
- R somewhere, but not at position 2 (index 1). And not position 3 (which is A) or 5 (which is E)? So R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have no information about position 1 and 4.

Summary: 
Secret word: 
- Position 1: not C, and could be R? or a new letter
- Position 2: R is not there? Actually, the position 2 in secret must be a letter? But we know? No, we don't know what is in position 2? We know only position 3 is A and position 5 is E? 

Secret indices:
0: (first letter) - not C, but could be R or other
1: (second letter) - is not R? Feedback: R was guessed at position 2? Meaning at index 1? So secret[1] != R? So position 2 is not R? So R is at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A? So R cannot be at position 3? Position 5 is E? So R cannot be at position 5? Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Positions are defined as per order? Let me label:
In 5-letter word:
- Index 0: first character (position 1)
- Index 1: second character (position 2)
- Index 2: third character (position 3)
- Index 3: fourth character (position 4)
- Index 4: fifth character (position 5)

First guess ""CRANE"": 
- Index 0: 'C' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 1: 'R' -> - (present, but secret index1 != R)
- Index 2: 'A' -> ✓ (secret index2 = A)
- Index 3: 'N' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 4: 'E' -> ✓ (secret index4 = E)

So:
Secret[2] = A
Secret[4] = E
Secret contains R, but secret[1] != R? And R is not at index0 because we don't know? But secret[1] != R? Then R can be only at index3? Because index0, 2, 4 we have: index0 is ? (but not C), index2 = A (so R can't be), index4 = E (so R can't be). So secret must have R at index3? 

But index3 is the fourth letter? So position 4? 

Summary: 
Secret word: 
Index0: unknown, not C
Index1: unknown, but not R
Index2: A
Index3: ? - but since R is in the word and the only position left is index3 (unless there are multiple letters? but we don't know? For now, single R?) So likely R at index3?
Index4: E

Therefore, the secret word is: ? ? A R E

We know index1 cannot be R? But we don't know its value? Also, index0 is not C.

Therefore, the word is: [unknown not C] [unknown not R] A R E

But the fourth letter is R? And fifth E? So word: ??? + ""ARE""? So the word ends with ""ARE""? But wait: index2=A, index3=R, index4=E, so the last three letters are ""A R E"". In order: ... A, then R, then E? So ...ARE.

Not necessarily the word ending? Index2,3,4 make up positions 3,4,5: so letters 3: A, letter4: R, letter5: E.

Therefore, the secret word: 
- letter1 = ?
- letter2 = ? (cannot be R)
- letter3 = A
- letter4 = R
- letter5 = E

But we also know: no C, no N.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

For the next guess, it must be a 5-letter English word? We want to test possibilities for letter1 and letter2? We know letter2 is not R? And letter1 is not C? And not N? Since N is excluded.

Also, we can try to find letter1 and letter2? 

Good choices: use common consonants? For example, words like ""SHARE"": S H A R E -> S at index0, H at index1, and then A R E? But in ""SHARE"": positions: 
0: S
1: H
2: A -> correct? 
3: R -> correct? 
4: E -> correct? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Similarly, ""SPARE"": S P A R E

But that would give the pattern? 

We can also test ""PLARE""? Not a word.

Common words: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, etc.

But note: we want to maximize information? Because we know the pattern is ? ? A R E? And letters at positions 0 and 1? 

Alternatively, we could pick a word that has the required A R E at positions 2,3,4? But positions in the word: we need index2='A', index3='R', index4='E'. Also, our guess must be a word? 

For the next guess, we can have any word? Not necessarily matching the known positions? But matching known positions might be efficient.

Since we know A at position3 (index2) and R at position4 (index3) and E at position5 (index4), we can set them? Then only positions 1 and 2 (index0 and index1) are unknown? 

So guess pattern: X Y A R E? 

Now, what are possible? We need X and Y? Also, Y cannot be R? And X cannot be C or N? 

Common words of the form _ _ARE:

Examples: 
- SHARE: S H A R E -> Y=H at index1?
- SPARE: S P A R E -> Y=P?
- STARE: S T A R E -> Y=T?
- SNARE? But N is excluded? So we cannot use SNARE? Since N is excluded? 
- SWARE: is that a word? S W A R E? Not common? 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> Y=L?

Let's list: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, GLARE, BLARE, FLARE, etc.

But we don't know about the new letters? 

We also have the constraint that letter2 (index1) cannot be R? That's already known? And we aren't putting R at index1? So it's ok? 

We want to try letters that are common? To test possibilities.

Perhaps try ""SHARE"": 
- If it's SHARE, we win? Feedback will all be ✓? 
- But if not, we get information on S and H.

Similarly, we could try ""STARE"": to test T? 

But note: sometimes in the first positions? It might be efficient to use a word that tests two new letters? 

Choose ""STARE"": 
S T A R E

Then:
Position 0 (S): if S is in word? And correct or incorrect?
Position 1 (T): if T is in word? But we know position 1 cannot be R? And not C or N? T is possible.
Then position2 A: ✓
position3 R: ✓
position4 E: ✓

Then feedback will tell us for S and T? 

Alternatively, ""PLARE"" is not a word? So use ""SHARE"" or ""STARE"". 

Also, avoid known exclusions: we know C and N are out? So no issue.

I think ""STARE"" might be a good choice? Or ""SHARE""? 

But note: we haven't tested any vowels other than A, E? Remaining vowels: O, I, U? Also consonants? 

Since we are guessing two positions: index0 and index1? We can choose different starting letters? 

Let me pick ""BLARE"": B L A R E? To test B and L? 

""FLARE"": F L A R E, etc.

Perhaps ""SHARE""? S and H are common? 

I'll go with ""STARE"": to test S and T? Because S and T are common? 

""STARE"" is a common word.

So the guess is: STARE

But confirm: 
- Pattern: S T A R E? 
In the word STARE: 
Index0: S
Index1: T
Index2: A
Index3: R
Index4: E

We know Index2=A and Index3=R and Index4=E? So the feedback of A should be ✓, R should be ✓, E should be ✓.

Then S and T are the variables? But S in position 0 and T in position 1? 

If the secret word is BLARE, then for STARE:
Index0: S != B (so if B then S would be x or if in wrong position? But if secret has S? 

Since we don't know, we will get feedback: 
- S: might be ✓ if secret[0]=S? or - if secret has S but not at 0? or x if not in word? 
Similar for T? 

This will give us two new pieces of information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that avoids S and T? But in the pattern _ _ARE, we need to pick first letters? 

I think STARE is fine.

Another option: ""GLARE"": G and L? 

To avoid possible letters? But randomly, I think STARE is as good as any? 

So I'll stick with STARE for guess 2.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: correct position (✓)
- N: not present (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

We know:
1. The second letter (position 2) is A (✓).
2. The fifth letter (position 5) is E (✓).
3. R is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (since it was marked as - in position 2). Given that positions 2 (A) and 5 (E) are fixed, R must be in position 4 (the only remaining position where it can appear).
4. The word has the pattern: _ A _ R E (positions: 1 = ?, 2 = A, 3 = ?, 4 = R, 5 = E).
5. C and N are eliminated.

For the next guess:
- The word must be of the form ? ? A R E to test the remaining positions (1 and 3).
- ""STARE"" fits the pattern: 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: T (but note position 2 cannot be R!)
  - Position 3: A (✓)
  - Position 4: R (✓)
  - Position 5: E (✓)
- Using ""STARE"" tests S at position 1 and T at position 2, while confirming A, R, E at their fixed positions. This helps gather information on two new letters efficiently.

Known exclusions: C and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of R and also discover other letters.\n\nWe should use a word that:\n- Has A at position 2 and E at position 5 (to keep the correct ones and test new letters).\n- Includes R in either position 3 or 4 (to see where it fits).\n- Does not use C or N (since they are excluded).\n\nMoreover, we want to cover common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible candidates: We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? A ? ? E\n\nThe third and fourth letters are unknown, but we must include R in one of them.\n\nLet me think of words that fit:\n- One common word is ""RAREE"" but that has two R\'s? However, we don\'t know if R can repeat. The feedback didn\'t show two R\'s, but we only guessed one R. We can\'t rule out two R\'s yet.\n\nAlternatively, ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> This has A at position 2 and E at position 5, and R at position 3. Also, avoids C and N.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if B or G are in the word? They are new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.\n\nOr ""CARVE"": But C is excluded, so not allowed.\n\nHow about ""FARCE"": F A R C E -> C is excluded, so not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid C and N.\n\nAnother word: ""MARVE"" is not a word. \n\nConsider ""WARSE"" — not common. \n\nList of possible words: \n- R at position 3: words like BARGE, PARSE, FARSE (not word), DARES? but DARES has S at position 4? D A R E S -> but E is at position 4, not 5, so it would be D A R E S, which is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not E? We need E at the fifth.\n\nSo, pattern: _ A _ _ E\n\nLet me find words: \n- With R at position 3: e.g., BARES (not common), CARES (but C excluded), DARES (if we use DARES, then position 4 is E, but the fifth is S? so not E at fifth).\n\nWait, no: the pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So, for example:\n- MAPLE -> M A P L E: A at 2, E at 5. But where is R? We haven\'t included R? We must include R because we know R is in the word.\n\nThe feedback says R is in the word, so our next guess must include R? Actually, no: it\'s optional because we can try to find other letters, but it might be better to test for R.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip testing R and try to get more information about other positions? But we know R is there and we haven\'t tested other positions. It\'s efficient to use the information.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that includes R and tries it in position 3 or 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BARRE"" — two R\'s? Not common and might not be allowed? But let\'s see: BARRE is a word (meaning a ballet bar).\n- ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3. Avoids C and N.\n- ""PARGE"" — not common.\n- ""TARES"": T A R E S -> but E at position 4? Then S at fifth? But E is at position 4, not fifth? No, we need E at fifth: so T A R E S? That\'s T[0], A[1], R[2], E[3], S[4] — but position 3 would be E, and fourth? This pattern doesn\'t have E at fifth? So it would be T A R E S -> [0]T, [1]A, [2]R, [3]E, [4]S: fifth is S. But we need fifth to be E? Then we cannot have any other letter at fifth? Why? Because the correct word has E at fifth? Yes.\n\nSo we must have E at the fifth position? Exactly: the pattern is: _ A _ _ E\n\nTherefore, position 1: unknown, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: E.\n\nWords of the form: ? A ? ? E\n\nAnd we must have an R in either position 3 or 4? Actually, except if we don\'t put R but then we risk not getting information? It\'s better to test R? The feedback says R is in the word, but we haven\'t fixed its position.\n\nValid words:\n- With R at position 3: LARGE, BARGE, MARGE, PARGE? but PARGE is not common? Marge is acceptable? No, Marge is typically a name? But we need English words.\n\nCommon words:\n- BARGE, LARGE, MARGE? not standard? \n- FARGE? not a word.\n\nHow about ""WARE""? That\'s 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n""CARED"" — C excluded and E at fourth? Not fifth.\n\nThen with R at position 4: words like ? A ? R E\n\nFor example: MAPRE? Not a word. Or LATER? Let\'s see: L A T E R -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But the fifth letter is R, not E. So that\'s L A T E R, and E is at position 4? Not 5? So doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother possibility: F A C E R — again, C excluded and E at fourth? Fifth is R? Not E? \n\nIt\'s challenging. Consider: ? A ? R E\n\nThe fifth letter must be E? Then position 4 is R? So pattern: _ A _ R E.\n\nWhat are the words?\n- ""CARE"" is 4 letters? \n- ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Fifth letter is R? Not E? So no.\n\nAlternatively, ""BAR"": too short.\n\nActually, the pattern _ A _ R E: meaning position 4 is R and position 5 is E? So the word ends with ""RE""? \n\nFor example: ""CARE"" is not 5. ""STARE"": S T A R E -> S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Doesn\'t fit? Because A must be at position 2? So pattern: position 0 is ?, position 1 is A (position 2?), let me index: \nPosition 0: first letter (non-A)\nPosition 1: A (second letter)\nPosition 2: third letter\nPosition 3: R? \nPosition 4: E (fifth)\n\nAnd must be valid English words.\n\nExamples: \n- ""PARRE""? Not word.\n- ""FARSE""? Not word.\n- ""BARGE"" — B A R G E: so position 0=B, position 1=A, position 2=R, position 3=G, position 4=E?\nThat doesn\'t put R at position 3 but at position 2 (third letter). Position 3 is G? \n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to list words: \nKnown words: \n- LARGE: L A R G E -> fits pattern: first letter L, second A, third R, fourth G, fifth E? So positions = L(0), A(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) — so in terms of feedback: A at position 2? If A is second letter, we call it position 1? \n\nClarify indexing: \nGuess word: 5 letters, position 1 to 5? Typically in programming we start index at 0? But the feedback: in the example, ""BRAVE"" -> B(1? ✓), R(2? ✓), etc? According to the example: ""Guess 1: STORM"" where S is first letter? Feedback: S(-) then T(x) etc.\n\nIn the feedback notation: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""\nSo it goes letter by letter in order? So the feedback corresponds to the positions? So for ""STORM"": \nPosition 1: S -> marked as -\nPosition 2: T -> marked as x\nPosition 3: O -> marked as x\nPosition 4: R -> marked as -\nPosition 5: M -> marked as x\n\nSimilarly, in our case, ""crane"": \n- C (position 1): x? \nBut the feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nSo C is position 1? Then R at position 2? A at position 3? But feedback A is marked ✓, meaning correct position? So A is the third letter? \n\nWait, feedback A(✓) says: the letter is in the word and in correct position? Therefore, in the secret word, A must be at the same position as in ""CRANE"" — which is position 3? Because ""CRANE"" is spelled: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Therefore:\nPosition 1: C (x) -> not in secret word\nPosition 2: R (-) -> in word, but not at position 2? So R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait: \nWe know from feedback: A is at position 3? And E at position 5? So R must be in positions 1 or 4? Because position 3 is A? and 5 is E? \n\nLet me map:\nSecret word: 5 letters: let\'s say position 1,2,3,4,5.\nFrom first guess ""CRANE"":\n- Position 1 (C): not in secret word -> secret[0] != C\n- Position 2 (R): present but not at position 2 -> secret has R, but not at index 1 (position 2)\n- Position 3 (A): present at position 3 -> secret[2] = A\n- Position 4 (N): not in secret word -> secret[3] != N and word doesn\'t contain N\n- Position 5 (E): present at position 5 -> secret[4] = E\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- R somewhere, but not at position 2 (index 1). And not position 3 (which is A) or 5 (which is E)? So R must be at position 1 or 4? \n\nAlso, we have no information about position 1 and 4.\n\nSummary: \nSecret word: \n- Position 1: not C, and could be R? or a new letter\n- Position 2: R is not there? Actually, the position 2 in secret must be a letter? But we know? No, we don\'t know what is in position 2? We know only position 3 is A and position 5 is E? \n\nSecret indices:\n0: (first letter) - not C, but could be R or other\n1: (second letter) - is not R? Feedback: R was guessed at position 2? Meaning at index 1? So secret[1] != R? So position 2 is not R? So R is at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A? So R cannot be at position 3? Position 5 is E? So R cannot be at position 5? Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 4? \n\nPositions are defined as per order? Let me label:\nIn 5-letter word:\n- Index 0: first character (position 1)\n- Index 1: second character (position 2)\n- Index 2: third character (position 3)\n- Index 3: fourth character (position 4)\n- Index 4: fifth character (position 5)\n\nFirst guess ""CRANE"": \n- Index 0: \'C\' -> x (not in secret word)\n- Index 1: \'R\' -> - (present, but secret index1 != R)\n- Index 2: \'A\' -> ✓ (secret index2 = A)\n- Index 3: \'N\' -> x (not in secret word)\n- Index 4: \'E\' -> ✓ (secret index4 = E)\n\nSo:\nSecret[2] = A\nSecret[4] = E\nSecret contains R, but secret[1] != R?

So position 4? \n\nSummary: \nSecret word: \nIndex0: unknown, not C\nIndex1: unknown, but not R\nIndex2: A\nIndex3: ? - but since R is in the word and the only position left is index3 (unless there are multiple letters? but we don\'t know?

But wait: index2=A, index3=R, index4=E, so the last three letters are ""A R E"". In order: ... A, then R, then E? So ...ARE.\n\nNot necessarily the word ending? Index2,3,4 make up positions 3,4,5: so letters 3: A, letter4: R, letter5: E.\n\nTherefore, the secret word: \n- letter1 = ?\n- letter2 = ? (cannot be R)\n- letter3 = A\n- letter4 = R\n- letter5 = E\n\nBut we also know: no C, no N.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ A R E\n\nFor the next guess, it must be a 5-letter English word? We want to test possibilities for letter1 and letter2? We know letter2 is not R? And letter1 is not C? And not N? Since N is excluded.\n\nAlso, we can try to find letter1 and letter2? \n\nGood choices: use common consonants? For example, words like ""SHARE"": S H A R E -> S at index0, H at index1, and then A R E? But in ""SHARE"": positions: \n0: S\n1: H\n2: A -> correct? \n3: R -> correct? \n4: E -> correct? \n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word? \n\nSimilarly, ""SPARE"": S P A R E\n\nBut that would give the pattern? \n\nWe can also test ""PLARE""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, etc.\n\nBut note: we want to maximize information? Because we know the pattern is ? ? A R E? And letters at positions 0 and 1? \n\nAlternatively, we could pick a word that has the required A R E at positions 2,3,4? But positions in the word: we need index2=\'A\', index3=\'R\', index4=\'E\'.

But matching known positions might be efficient.\n\nSince we know A at position3 (index2) and R at position4 (index3) and E at position5 (index4), we can set them? Then only positions 1 and 2 (index0 and index1) are unknown? \n\nSo guess pattern: X Y A R E? \n\nNow, what are possible? We need X and Y? Also, Y cannot be R? And X cannot be C or N? \n\nCommon words of the form _ _ARE:\n\nExamples: \n- SHARE: S H A R E -> Y=H at index1?\n- SPARE: S P A R E -> Y=P?\n- STARE: S T A R E -> Y=T?\n- SNARE? But N is excluded? So we cannot use SNARE? Since N is excluded? \n- SWARE: is that a word? S W A R E? Not common? \n- GLARE: G L A R E -> Y=L?\n\nLet\'s list: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, GLARE, BLARE, FLARE, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know about the new letters? \n\nWe also have the constraint that letter2 (index1) cannot be R? That\'s already known? And we aren\'t putting R at index1? So it\'s ok? \n\nWe want to try letters that are common? To test possibilities.\n\nPerhaps try ""SHARE"": \n- If it\'s SHARE, we win? Feedback will all be ✓? \n- But if not, we get information on S and H.\n\nSimilarly, we could try ""STARE"": to test T? \n\nBut note: sometimes in the first positions? It might be efficient to use a word that tests two new letters? \n\nChoose ""STARE"": \nS T A R E\n\nThen:\nPosition 0 (S): if S is in word? And correct or incorrect?\nPosition 1 (T): if T is in word? But we know position 1 cannot be R? And not C or N? T is possible.\nThen position2 A: ✓\nposition3 R: ✓\nposition4 E: ✓\n\nThen feedback will tell us for S and T? \n\nAlternatively, ""PLARE"" is not a word? So use ""SHARE"" or ""STARE"". \n\nAlso, avoid known exclusions: we know C and N are out? So no issue.\n\nI think ""STARE"" might be a good choice? Or ""SHARE""? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested any vowels other than A, E? Remaining vowels: O, I, U? Also consonants? \n\nSince we are guessing two positions: index0 and index1? We can choose different starting letters? \n\nLet me pick ""BLARE"": B L A R E? To test B and L? \n\n""FLARE"": F L A R E, etc.\n\nPerhaps ""SHARE""? S and H are common? \n\nI\'ll go with ""STARE"": to test S and T? Because S and T are common? \n\n""STARE"" is a common word.\n\nSo the guess is: STARE\n\nBut confirm: \n- Pattern: S T A R E? \nIn the word STARE: \nIndex0: S\nIndex1: T\nIndex2: A\nIndex3: R\nIndex4: E\n\nWe know Index2=A and Index3=R and Index4=E? So the feedback of A should be ✓, R should be ✓, E should be ✓.\n\nThen S and T are the variables? But S in position 0 and T in position 1? \n\nIf the secret word is BLARE, then for STARE:\nIndex0: S != B (so if B then S would be x or if in wrong position? But if secret has S? \n\nSince we don\'t know, we will get feedback: \n- S: might be ✓ if secret[0]=S? or - if secret has S but not at 0? or x if not in word? \nSimilar for T? \n\nThis will give us two new pieces of information? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that avoids S and T? But in the pattern _ _ARE, we need to pick first letters? \n\nI think STARE is fine.\n\nAnother option: ""GLARE"": G and L? \n\nTo avoid possible letters? But randomly, I think STARE is as good as any? \n\nSo I\'ll stick with STARE for guess 2.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- A: correct position (✓)\n- N: not present (x)\n- E: correct position (✓)\n\nWe know:\n1. The second letter (position 2) is A (✓).\n2. The fifth letter (position 5) is E (✓).\n3. R is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (since it was marked as - in position 2). Given that positions 2 (A) and 5 (E) are fixed, R must be in position 4 (the only remaining position where it can appear).\n4. The word has the pattern: _ A _ R E (positions: 1 = ?, 2 = A, 3 = ?, 4 = R, 5 = E).\n5. C and N are eliminated.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must be of the form ? ? A R E to test the remaining positions (1 and 3).\n- ""STARE"" fits the pattern: \n  - Position 1: S\n  - Position 2: T (but note position 2 cannot be R!)\n  - Position 3: A (✓)\n  - Position 4: R (✓)\n  - Position 5: E (✓)\n- Using ""STARE"" tests S at position 1 and T at position 2, while confirming A, R, E at their fixed positions. This helps gather information on two new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>stare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is E)

From this, we deduced:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E (positions: 1,2,3,4,5 with 3=A and 5=E)
- R is in the word, but not at position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as -). Given the fixed positions, R must be at position 4 (the only other possible position, since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 1 is unknown but R can't be at 2). So the word is _ _ A R E.

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (as expected)
- R: ✓ (as expected, at position 4)
- E: ✓ (as expected)

So now we know:
- S and T are not in the word.
- The word is _ _ A R E, with the first and second letters unknown, but we know:
  - First letter: not C, not S, not T (and not N, from guess1)
  - Second letter: not R (from guess1), and now not T? Actually, T is not in the word at all, so second letter cannot be T. Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know it's not T and not S (but S is not in the word, so it can't be second anyway).

The secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Constraints:
- letter1: cannot be C, N, S, T (and must be a letter not yet excluded)
- letter2: cannot be R, and cannot be T (since T is not in the word at all), and also cannot be S (not in word). Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know T and S are not in the word, so letter2 is not T and not S.

But we don't know if letter2 is fixed? We only know what it cannot be? And we need to find what it can be.

Also, we have no information about other possible letters? We have tested only a few.

We need to make a new guess that fits the pattern? But we don't know the first two letters? We can try a word that has the form _ _ A R E, but with new letters? Or we can try a different word to test more letters? 

But note: we know the last three letters are fixed as A, R, E? So any guess must have A at position 3, R at position 4, E at position 5? Because if we change that, we might get incorrect feedback? But we can use a word that doesn't have A at 3 or R at 4? But that would be inefficient? Because we know they are fixed? 

Actually, we can use a word that has different letters to test? But we have to consider that the secret word has A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? So if we guess a word without A at 3, then the feedback for A would be - or x? But we know it should be ✓? So it's better to keep the known letters fixed? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use a word of the form X Y A R E, where X and Y are new letters that we haven't tested? And we avoid the excluded letters: C, N, S, T.

Excluded letters so far: C, N, S, T.

Available letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But A, E, R are already in the word? But we are testing X and Y.

We need to choose X and Y? 

Common words of the form _ _ A R E:

Examples:
- GLARE: G L A R E
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- AWARE: but that has W at position 2? A W A R E? Then position 1 is A? But then pattern: A W A R E? So index0=A, index1=W, index2=A? But we have A at index2? So if we use AWARE, then index0=A? But we don't know if A is at index0? 

But note: we have not tested A at index0? So it could be? But in the first guess, we had A at index2? And it was correct? But that doesn't prevent A from being at index0? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had A at index2 correct? But if the word has A at index0, then in ""crane"" we didn't have A at index0? So we wouldn't know? 

But in ""stare"", we had S at index0? Which was x? So if we use AWARE: 
- A at index0: if the secret word has A at index0? Then it would be marked as - or ✓? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if we guess AWARE, and secret has A at index0? Then the feedback for A at index0 would be - (because it's in the word but not at index0? But it is at index2? So it would be marked as - for index0? And then at index2 it would be ✓? 

But we already know index2 is A? So it's redundant? And we are trying to find the first two letters? 

Moreover, AWARE has two A's? So it might be possible? 

But let's list possible words without using excluded letters? 

Possible words: 
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- GLARE: G L A R E
- Other: PARER? Not the pattern? 
- RARER? Not the pattern? 
- DARER? Not? 
- HARE? too short? 
- SHARE? But S is excluded? 
- SPARE? S excluded? 
- STARE? T excluded? 
- So we have BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? 

Also, ""AWARE"": A W A R E? This has two A's? And W? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? 

Similarly, ""SCARE"": S excluded? 

""UCARE""? Not a word? 

So common ones: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? 

But AWARE: A at index0 and index2? 

We can use one of these? 

But we want to test new letters? 

We have not tested: B, F, G, L, W, etc? 

If we guess ""BLARE"", then:
- If the secret is BLARE, we win? 
- If not, we get feedback on B and L? 

Similarly for others? 

But we have three possibilities? We have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? 

We can also try a word that doesn't have the fixed pattern? But that might be less efficient? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But with the fixed pattern, we have to test the first two letters? 

Since we have multiple candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? We can choose one? 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters? 

Also, we can consider that the second letter (index1) might be a vowel? 

But let's list the possibilities we know: 
- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L
- AWARE: A and W

But in AWARE, the first letter is A? So if we guess AWARE, and the secret is not AWARE, then:
- If A is at index0? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if the secret has only one A? Then A at index0 would be wrong? 

But it might have two A's? 

We don't know? 

To be safe, let's avoid AWARE for now? Because it might complicate? 

So among BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? 

We can choose ""GLARE"" to test G and L? 

But note: L is common? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses different letters? But we have to use the pattern? 

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have the fixed pattern? For example, we can use a word that has A, R, E in different positions? But we know they are fixed? So it's better to keep them? 

I think we should guess one of the candidates? 

Let me pick ""GLARE"": G L A R E? 

Then, if it's correct, we win? 

If not, we get feedback on G and L? 

If G is correct at index0? Or L at index1? 

But if the secret is, say, FLARE, then for GLARE: 
- G at index0: if secret has F? Then G would be x? 
- L at index1: if secret has L at index1? Then ✓? But if secret is FLARE, then L is at index1? So L would be ✓? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that has the pattern but with letters that are common? 

I think ""GLARE"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback: 

After guess2, we have: 
- S and T are not in the word? 
- So the secret word has only the letters we know: A, R, E, and two more? 

We know the word is ? ? A R E? 

The first two letters must be from the remaining alphabet? 

Possible words: 
- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L
- Also, ""PARER"" is not? 
- ""HAREM""? But that is H A R E M? Then pattern: H at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, M at4? But we need A at index2? So not? 
- ""MARRY""? Not? 
- ""WARES""? But S excluded? 
- ""BARED""? But E at index4? D at5? Not E? 
- So only the ones with L? Or AWARE? 

Another: ""OARED""? O A R E D? Then index0=O, index1=A, index2=R? But we need index2=A? So not? 

So the only common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? 

AWARE: A W A R E? 
- index0: A
- index1: W
- index2: A
- index3: R
- index4: E

This matches the pattern? Because index2=A, index3=R, index4=E? 

And index0 and index1 are A and W? 

But we know the secret has A at index2? But it might have A at index0? 

In the first guess ""crane"", we had A at index2? But we didn't have A at index0? So if the secret has A at index0, it would not have been revealed? Because we didn't test it? 

Similarly, in ""stare"", we had no A at index0? 

So it's possible? 

Therefore, AWARE is a candidate? 

But we have four candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? 

We are at guess 3? We can try one? 

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we can't? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use L? Because if we choose GLARE and it's wrong, we know L is not in the word? Then we can eliminate? 

But if we choose AWARE, we test A and W? 

But A is already known? 

I think it's better to choose one without repeating letters? 

AWARE has two A's? 

So let's avoid? 

Choose ""GLARE"": 

<guess>glare</guess> 

But let's see the feedback? 

If we get: 
- G: ? 
- L: ? 
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Then we know if G and L are correct? 

If the secret is BLARE, then G would be x? and L would be ✓? 

Similarly, if FLARE, G x, L ✓? 

If GLARE, all ✓? 

If AWARE, then G x, L x? Because AWARE has no G or L? 

Then we would know? 

So it's a good test? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GLARE"". 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters? G and L are not excluded? 

So guess: GLARE
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and N are not in the word.  
  - Deduction: The word pattern is `_ _ A _ E`, with R located at position 4 (the only remaining position it can occupy, given the constraints).

- **Guess 2: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A, R, and E are confirmed in their correct positions (positions 3, 4, and 5).  
    - S and T are not in the word.  
  - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ _ A R E` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T.  
  - Known letters: A, R, E (fixed at positions 3, 4, 5).  
  - Unknown: Positions 1 and 2, which must be filled with letters not excluded and not yet tested extensively.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must fit the pattern `_ _ A R E` to maintain the confirmed positions (A at 3, R at 4, E at 5).  
- Test new, common consonants for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, S, T).  
- Possible candidate words: `GLARE` (tests G and L), `BLARE` (tests B and L), or `FLARE` (tests F and L).  
- Choosing `GLARE`:  
  - Tests G at position 1 and L at position 2.  
  - If correct, we solve the word.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on G and L will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if G is wrong, `BLARE` or `FLARE` become likely; if L is wrong, `AWARE` becomes a candidate, though it has a repeated A).  
- `GLARE` is a valid English word and efficiently tests two new letters.

<guess>glare</guess>",glare,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is E)

From this, we deduced:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E (positions: 1,2,3,4,5 with 3=A and 5=E)
- R is in the word, but not at position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as -). Given the fixed positions, R must be at position 4 (the only other possible position, since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 1 is unknown but R can't be at 2). So the word is _ _ A R E.

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (as expected)
- R: ✓ (as expected, at position 4)
- E: ✓ (as expected)

So now we know:
- S and T are not in the word.
- The word is _ _ A R E, with the first and second letters unknown, but we know:
  - First letter: not C, not S, not T (and not N, from guess1)
  - Second letter: not R (from guess1), and now not T? Actually, T is not in the word at all, so second letter cannot be T. Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know it's not T and not S (but S is not in the word, so it can't be second anyway).

The secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Constraints:
- letter1: cannot be C, N, S, T (and must be a letter not yet excluded)
- letter2: cannot be R, and cannot be T (since T is not in the word at all), and also cannot be S (not in word). Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know T and S are not in the word, so letter2 is not T and not S.

But we don't know if letter2 is fixed? We only know what it cannot be? And we need to find what it can be.

Also, we have no information about other possible letters? We have tested only a few.

We need to make a new guess that fits the pattern? But we don't know the first two letters? We can try a word that has the form _ _ A R E, but with new letters? Or we can try a different word to test more letters? 

But note: we know the last three letters are fixed as A, R, E? So any guess must have A at position 3, R at position 4, E at position 5? Because if we change that, we might get incorrect feedback? But we can use a word that doesn't have A at 3 or R at 4? But that would be inefficient? Because we know they are fixed? 

Actually, we can use a word that has different letters to test? But we have to consider that the secret word has A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? So if we guess a word without A at 3, then the feedback for A would be - or x? But we know it should be ✓? So it's better to keep the known letters fixed? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use a word of the form X Y A R E, where X and Y are new letters that we haven't tested? And we avoid the excluded letters: C, N, S, T.

Excluded letters so far: C, N, S, T.

Available letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But A, E, R are already in the word? But we are testing X and Y.

We need to choose X and Y? 

Common words of the form _ _ A R E:

Examples:
- GLARE: G L A R E
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- AWARE: but that has W at position 2? A W A R E? Then position 1 is A? But then pattern: A W A R E? So index0=A, index1=W, index2=A? But we have A at index2? So if we use AWARE, then index0=A? But we don't know if A is at index0? 

But note: we have not tested A at index0? So it could be? But in the first guess, we had A at index2? And it was correct? But that doesn't prevent A from being at index0? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had A at index2 correct? But if the word has A at index0, then in ""crane"" we didn't have A at index0? So we wouldn't know?

- A at index0: if the secret word has A at index0? Then it would be marked as - or ✓? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if we guess AWARE, and secret has A at index0? Then the feedback for A at index0 would be - (because it's in the word but not at index0? But it is at index2? So it would be marked as - for index0? And then at index2 it would be ✓? 

But we already know index2 is A? So it's redundant? And we are trying to find the first two letters? 

Moreover, AWARE has two A's? So it might be possible? 

But let's list possible words without using excluded letters? 

Possible words: 
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- GLARE: G L A R E
- Other: PARER? Not the pattern? 
- RARER? Not the pattern? 
- DARER? Not? 
- HARE? too short? 
- SHARE? But S is excluded? 
- SPARE? S excluded? 
- STARE? T excluded? 
- So we have BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? 

Also, ""AWARE"": A W A R E? This has two A's? And W? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? 

Similarly, ""SCARE"": S excluded? 

""UCARE""? Not a word? 

So common ones: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? 

But AWARE: A at index0 and index2? 

We can use one of these? 

But we want to test new letters? 

We have not tested: B, F, G, L, W, etc? 

If we guess ""BLARE"", then:
- If the secret is BLARE, we win? 
- If not, we get feedback on B and L? 

Similarly for others? 

But we have three possibilities? We have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? 

We can also try a word that doesn't have the fixed pattern? But that might be less efficient? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But with the fixed pattern, we have to test the first two letters? 

Since we have multiple candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? We can choose one? 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters? 

Also, we can consider that the second letter (index1) might be a vowel? 

But let's list the possibilities we know: 
- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L
- AWARE: A and W

But in AWARE, the first letter is A? So if we guess AWARE, and the secret is not AWARE, then:
- If A is at index0? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if the secret has only one A? Then A at index0 would be wrong? 

But it might have two A's? 

We don't know? 

To be safe, let's avoid AWARE for now? Because it might complicate? 

So among BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? 

We can choose ""GLARE"" to test G and L? 

But note: L is common? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses different letters? But we have to use the pattern? 

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have the fixed pattern? For example, we can use a word that has A, R, E in different positions? But we know they are fixed? So it's better to keep them? 

I think we should guess one of the candidates? 

Let me pick ""GLARE"": G L A R E? 

Then, if it's correct, we win? 

If not, we get feedback on G and L? 

If G is correct at index0? Or L at index1? 

But if the secret is, say, FLARE, then for GLARE: 
- G at index0: if secret has F? Then G would be x? 
- L at index1: if secret has L at index1? Then ✓? But if secret is FLARE, then L is at index1? So L would be ✓? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that has the pattern but with letters that are common? 

I think ""GLARE"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback: 

After guess2, we have: 
- S and T are not in the word? 
- So the secret word has only the letters we know: A, R, E, and two more? 

We know the word is ? ? A R E? 

The first two letters must be from the remaining alphabet? 

Possible words: 
- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L
- Also, ""PARER"" is not? 
- ""HAREM""? But that is H A R E M? Then pattern: H at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, M at4? But we need A at index2? So not? 
- ""MARRY""? Not? 
- ""WARES""? But S excluded? 
- ""BARED""? But E at index4? D at5? Not E? 
- So only the ones with L? Or AWARE? 

Another: ""OARED""? O A R E D? Then index0=O, index1=A, index2=R? But we need index2=A? So not? 

So the only common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? 

AWARE: A W A R E? 
- index0: A
- index1: W
- index2: A
- index3: R
- index4: E

This matches the pattern? Because index2=A, index3=R, index4=E? 

And index0 and index1 are A and W? 

But we know the secret has A at index2? But it might have A at index0? 

In the first guess ""crane"", we had A at index2? But we didn't have A at index0? So if the secret has A at index0, it would not have been revealed? Because we didn't test it? 

Similarly, in ""stare"", we had no A at index0? 

So it's possible? 

Therefore, AWARE is a candidate? 

But we have four candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? 

We are at guess 3? We can try one? 

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we can't? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use L? Because if we choose GLARE and it's wrong, we know L is not in the word? Then we can eliminate? 

But if we choose AWARE, we test A and W? 

But A is already known? 

I think it's better to choose one without repeating letters? 

AWARE has two A's? 

So let's avoid? 

Choose ""GLARE"": 

<guess>glare</guess> 

But let's see the feedback? 

If we get: 
- G: ? 
- L: ? 
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Then we know if G and L are correct? 

If the secret is BLARE, then G would be x? and L would be ✓? 

Similarly, if FLARE, G x, L ✓? 

If GLARE, all ✓? 

If AWARE, then G x, L x? Because AWARE has no G or L? 

Then we would know? 

So it's a good test? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GLARE"". 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters? G and L are not excluded? 

So guess: GLAREBased on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and N are not in the word.  
  - Deduction: The word pattern is `_ _ A _ E`, with R located at position 4 (the only remaining position it can occupy, given the constraints).

- **Guess 2: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A, R, and E are confirmed in their correct positions (positions 3, 4, and 5).  
    - S and T are not in the word.  
  - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ _ A R E` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T.  
  - Known letters: A, R, E (fixed at positions 3, 4, 5).  
  - Unknown: Positions 1 and 2, which must be filled with letters not excluded and not yet tested extensively.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must fit the pattern `_ _ A R E` to maintain the confirmed positions (A at 3, R at 4, E at 5).  
- Test new, common consonants for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, S, T).  
- Possible candidate words: `GLARE` (tests G and L), `BLARE` (tests B and L), or `FLARE` (tests F and L).  
- Choosing `GLARE`:  
  - Tests G at position 1 and L at position 2.  
  - If correct, we solve the word.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on G and L will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if G is wrong, `BLARE` or `FLARE` become likely; if L is wrong, `AWARE` becomes a candidate, though it has a repeated A).  
- `GLARE` is a valid English word and efficiently tests two new letters.",Guess 3: glare -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BLARE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: marked as ""x"" (not in the word)
- R: marked as ""-"" (in the word but wrong position)
- A: marked as ""✓"" (correct position, so A is the second letter)
- N: marked as ""x"" (not in the word)
- E: marked as ""✓"" (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

From the feedback:
- The second letter is A (since A is ✓ at position 2).
- The fifth letter is E (since E is ✓ at position 5).
- The letter R is in the word but not in the first position (since R was guessed at position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
- C and N are not in the word.

The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E

We also know that R is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A, and position 5 is E, R must be in position 3 or 4.

We have 5 letters: the secret word is 5 letters long. Known positions: 2=A, 5=E. Known included letters: R (somewhere in 3 or 4). Known exclusions: C and N are not in the word.

For the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of R and also discover other letters.

We should use a word that:
- Has A at position 2 and E at position 5 (to keep the correct ones and test new letters).
- Includes R in either position 3 or 4 (to see where it fits).
- Does not use C or N (since they are excluded).

Moreover, we want to cover common letters to get more information.

Possible candidates: We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? A ? ? E

The third and fourth letters are unknown, but we must include R in one of them.

Let me think of words that fit:
- One common word is ""RAREE"" but that has two R's? However, we don't know if R can repeat. The feedback didn't show two R's, but we only guessed one R. We can't rule out two R's yet.

Alternatively, ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> This has A at position 2 and E at position 5, and R at position 3. Also, avoids C and N.

But note: we don't know if B or G are in the word? They are new letters.

Another word: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.

Or ""CARVE"": But C is excluded, so not allowed.

How about ""FARCE"": F A R C E -> C is excluded, so not allowed.

We must avoid C and N.

Another word: ""MARVE"" is not a word. 

Consider ""WARSE"" — not common. 

List of possible words: 
- R at position 3: words like BARGE, PARSE, FARSE (not word), DARES? but DARES has S at position 4? D A R E S -> but E is at position 4, not 5, so it would be D A R E S, which is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not E? We need E at the fifth.

So, pattern: _ A _ _ E

Let me find words: 
- With R at position 3: e.g., BARES (not common), CARES (but C excluded), DARES (if we use DARES, then position 4 is E, but the fifth is S? so not E at fifth).

Wait, no: the pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So, for example:
- MAPLE -> M A P L E: A at 2, E at 5. But where is R? We haven't included R? We must include R because we know R is in the word.

The feedback says R is in the word, so our next guess must include R? Actually, no: it's optional because we can try to find other letters, but it might be better to test for R.

Alternatively, we can skip testing R and try to get more information about other positions? But we know R is there and we haven't tested other positions. It's efficient to use the information.

So, let's choose a word that includes R and tries it in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- ""BARRE"" — two R's? Not common and might not be allowed? But let's see: BARRE is a word (meaning a ballet bar).
- ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3. Avoids C and N.
- ""PARGE"" — not common.
- ""TARES"": T A R E S -> but E at position 4? Then S at fifth? But E is at position 4, not fifth? No, we need E at fifth: so T A R E S? That's T[0], A[1], R[2], E[3], S[4] — but position 3 would be E, and fourth? This pattern doesn't have E at fifth? So it would be T A R E S -> [0]T, [1]A, [2]R, [3]E, [4]S: fifth is S. But we need fifth to be E? Then we cannot have any other letter at fifth? Why? Because the correct word has E at fifth? Yes.

So we must have E at the fifth position? Exactly: the pattern is: _ A _ _ E

Therefore, position 1: unknown, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: E.

Words of the form: ? A ? ? E

And we must have an R in either position 3 or 4? Actually, except if we don't put R but then we risk not getting information? It's better to test R? The feedback says R is in the word, but we haven't fixed its position.

Valid words:
- With R at position 3: LARGE, BARGE, MARGE, PARGE? but PARGE is not common? Marge is acceptable? No, Marge is typically a name? But we need English words.

Common words:
- BARGE, LARGE, MARGE? not standard? 
- FARGE? not a word.

How about ""WARE""? That's 4 letters? Not 5.

""CARED"" — C excluded and E at fourth? Not fifth.

Then with R at position 4: words like ? A ? R E

For example: MAPRE? Not a word. Or LATER? Let's see: L A T E R -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But the fifth letter is R, not E. So that's L A T E R, and E is at position 4? Not 5? So doesn't fit.

Another possibility: F A C E R — again, C excluded and E at fourth? Fifth is R? Not E? 

It's challenging. Consider: ? A ? R E

The fifth letter must be E? Then position 4 is R? So pattern: _ A _ R E.

What are the words?
- ""CARE"" is 4 letters? 
- ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Fifth letter is R? Not E? So no.

Alternatively, ""BAR"": too short.

Actually, the pattern _ A _ R E: meaning position 4 is R and position 5 is E? So the word ends with ""RE""? 

For example: ""CARE"" is not 5. ""STARE"": S T A R E -> S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Doesn't fit? Because A must be at position 2? So pattern: position 0 is ?, position 1 is A (position 2?), let me index: 
Position 0: first letter (non-A)
Position 1: A (second letter)
Position 2: third letter
Position 3: R? 
Position 4: E (fifth)

And must be valid English words.

Examples: 
- ""PARRE""? Not word.
- ""FARSE""? Not word.
- ""BARGE"" — B A R G E: so position 0=B, position 1=A, position 2=R, position 3=G, position 4=E?
That doesn't put R at position 3 but at position 2 (third letter). Position 3 is G? 

Perhaps it's easier to list words: 
Known words: 
- LARGE: L A R G E -> fits pattern: first letter L, second A, third R, fourth G, fifth E? So positions = L(0), A(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) — so in terms of feedback: A at position 2? If A is second letter, we call it position 1? 

Clarify indexing: 
Guess word: 5 letters, position 1 to 5? Typically in programming we start index at 0? But the feedback: in the example, ""BRAVE"" -> B(1? ✓), R(2? ✓), etc? According to the example: ""Guess 1: STORM"" where S is first letter? Feedback: S(-) then T(x) etc.

In the feedback notation: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""
So it goes letter by letter in order? So the feedback corresponds to the positions? So for ""STORM"": 
Position 1: S -> marked as -
Position 2: T -> marked as x
Position 3: O -> marked as x
Position 4: R -> marked as -
Position 5: M -> marked as x

Similarly, in our case, ""crane"": 
- C (position 1): x? 
But the feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
So C is position 1? Then R at position 2? A at position 3? But feedback A is marked ✓, meaning correct position? So A is the third letter? 

Wait, feedback A(✓) says: the letter is in the word and in correct position? Therefore, in the secret word, A must be at the same position as in ""CRANE"" — which is position 3? Because ""CRANE"" is spelled: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Therefore:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in secret word
Position 2: R (-) -> in word, but not at position 2? So R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait: 
We know from feedback: A is at position 3? And E at position 5? So R must be in positions 1 or 4? Because position 3 is A? and 5 is E? 

Let me map:
Secret word: 5 letters: let's say position 1,2,3,4,5.
From first guess ""CRANE"":
- Position 1 (C): not in secret word -> secret[0] != C
- Position 2 (R): present but not at position 2 -> secret has R, but not at index 1 (position 2)
- Position 3 (A): present at position 3 -> secret[2] = A
- Position 4 (N): not in secret word -> secret[3] != N and word doesn't contain N
- Position 5 (E): present at position 5 -> secret[4] = E

Therefore, the secret word has:
- R somewhere, but not at position 2 (index 1). And not position 3 (which is A) or 5 (which is E)? So R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Also, we have no information about position 1 and 4.

Summary: 
Secret word: 
- Position 1: not C, and could be R? or a new letter
- Position 2: R is not there? Actually, the position 2 in secret must be a letter? But we know? No, we don't know what is in position 2? We know only position 3 is A and position 5 is E? 

Secret indices:
0: (first letter) - not C, but could be R or other
1: (second letter) - is not R? Feedback: R was guessed at position 2? Meaning at index 1? So secret[1] != R? So position 2 is not R? So R is at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A? So R cannot be at position 3? Position 5 is E? So R cannot be at position 5? Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 4? 

Positions are defined as per order? Let me label:
In 5-letter word:
- Index 0: first character (position 1)
- Index 1: second character (position 2)
- Index 2: third character (position 3)
- Index 3: fourth character (position 4)
- Index 4: fifth character (position 5)

First guess ""CRANE"": 
- Index 0: 'C' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 1: 'R' -> - (present, but secret index1 != R)
- Index 2: 'A' -> ✓ (secret index2 = A)
- Index 3: 'N' -> x (not in secret word)
- Index 4: 'E' -> ✓ (secret index4 = E)

So:
Secret[2] = A
Secret[4] = E
Secret contains R, but secret[1] != R? And R is not at index0 because we don't know? But secret[1] != R? Then R can be only at index3? Because index0, 2, 4 we have: index0 is ? (but not C), index2 = A (so R can't be), index4 = E (so R can't be). So secret must have R at index3? 

But index3 is the fourth letter? So position 4? 

Summary: 
Secret word: 
Index0: unknown, not C
Index1: unknown, but not R
Index2: A
Index3: ? - but since R is in the word and the only position left is index3 (unless there are multiple letters? but we don't know? For now, single R?) So likely R at index3?
Index4: E

Therefore, the secret word is: ? ? A R E

We know index1 cannot be R? But we don't know its value? Also, index0 is not C.

Therefore, the word is: [unknown not C] [unknown not R] A R E

But the fourth letter is R? And fifth E? So word: ??? + ""ARE""? So the word ends with ""ARE""? But wait: index2=A, index3=R, index4=E, so the last three letters are ""A R E"". In order: ... A, then R, then E? So ...ARE.

Not necessarily the word ending? Index2,3,4 make up positions 3,4,5: so letters 3: A, letter4: R, letter5: E.

Therefore, the secret word: 
- letter1 = ?
- letter2 = ? (cannot be R)
- letter3 = A
- letter4 = R
- letter5 = E

But we also know: no C, no N.

So pattern: _ _ A R E

For the next guess, it must be a 5-letter English word? We want to test possibilities for letter1 and letter2? We know letter2 is not R? And letter1 is not C? And not N? Since N is excluded.

Also, we can try to find letter1 and letter2? 

Good choices: use common consonants? For example, words like ""SHARE"": S H A R E -> S at index0, H at index1, and then A R E? But in ""SHARE"": positions: 
0: S
1: H
2: A -> correct? 
3: R -> correct? 
4: E -> correct? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Similarly, ""SPARE"": S P A R E

But that would give the pattern? 

We can also test ""PLARE""? Not a word.

Common words: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, etc.

But note: we want to maximize information? Because we know the pattern is ? ? A R E? And letters at positions 0 and 1? 

Alternatively, we could pick a word that has the required A R E at positions 2,3,4? But positions in the word: we need index2='A', index3='R', index4='E'. Also, our guess must be a word? 

For the next guess, we can have any word? Not necessarily matching the known positions? But matching known positions might be efficient.

Since we know A at position3 (index2) and R at position4 (index3) and E at position5 (index4), we can set them? Then only positions 1 and 2 (index0 and index1) are unknown? 

So guess pattern: X Y A R E? 

Now, what are possible? We need X and Y? Also, Y cannot be R? And X cannot be C or N? 

Common words of the form _ _ARE:

Examples: 
- SHARE: S H A R E -> Y=H at index1?
- SPARE: S P A R E -> Y=P?
- STARE: S T A R E -> Y=T?
- SNARE? But N is excluded? So we cannot use SNARE? Since N is excluded? 
- SWARE: is that a word? S W A R E? Not common? 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> Y=L?

Let's list: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, GLARE, BLARE, FLARE, etc.

But we don't know about the new letters? 

We also have the constraint that letter2 (index1) cannot be R? That's already known? And we aren't putting R at index1? So it's ok? 

We want to try letters that are common? To test possibilities.

Perhaps try ""SHARE"": 
- If it's SHARE, we win? Feedback will all be ✓? 
- But if not, we get information on S and H.

Similarly, we could try ""STARE"": to test T? 

But note: sometimes in the first positions? It might be efficient to use a word that tests two new letters? 

Choose ""STARE"": 
S T A R E

Then:
Position 0 (S): if S is in word? And correct or incorrect?
Position 1 (T): if T is in word? But we know position 1 cannot be R? And not C or N? T is possible.
Then position2 A: ✓
position3 R: ✓
position4 E: ✓

Then feedback will tell us for S and T? 

Alternatively, ""PLARE"" is not a word? So use ""SHARE"" or ""STARE"". 

Also, avoid known exclusions: we know C and N are out? So no issue.

I think ""STARE"" might be a good choice? Or ""SHARE""? 

But note: we haven't tested any vowels other than A, E? Remaining vowels: O, I, U? Also consonants? 

Since we are guessing two positions: index0 and index1? We can choose different starting letters? 

Let me pick ""BLARE"": B L A R E? To test B and L? 

""FLARE"": F L A R E, etc.

Perhaps ""SHARE""? S and H are common? 

I'll go with ""STARE"": to test S and T? Because S and T are common? 

""STARE"" is a common word.

So the guess is: STARE

But confirm: 
- Pattern: S T A R E? 
In the word STARE: 
Index0: S
Index1: T
Index2: A
Index3: R
Index4: E

We know Index2=A and Index3=R and Index4=E? So the feedback of A should be ✓, R should be ✓, E should be ✓.

Then S and T are the variables? But S in position 0 and T in position 1? 

If the secret word is BLARE, then for STARE:
Index0: S != B (so if B then S would be x or if in wrong position? But if secret has S? 

Since we don't know, we will get feedback: 
- S: might be ✓ if secret[0]=S? or - if secret has S but not at 0? or x if not in word? 
Similar for T? 

This will give us two new pieces of information? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that avoids S and T? But in the pattern _ _ARE, we need to pick first letters? 

I think STARE is fine.

Another option: ""GLARE"": G and L? 

To avoid possible letters? But randomly, I think STARE is as good as any? 

So I'll stick with STARE for guess 2.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: correct position (✓)
- N: not present (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

We know:
1. The second letter (position 2) is A (✓).
2. The fifth letter (position 5) is E (✓).
3. R is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (since it was marked as - in position 2). Given that positions 2 (A) and 5 (E) are fixed, R must be in position 4 (the only remaining position where it can appear).
4. The word has the pattern: _ A _ R E (positions: 1 = ?, 2 = A, 3 = ?, 4 = R, 5 = E).
5. C and N are eliminated.

For the next guess:
- The word must be of the form ? ? A R E to test the remaining positions (1 and 3).
- ""STARE"" fits the pattern: 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: T (but note position 2 cannot be R!)
  - Position 3: A (✓)
  - Position 4: R (✓)
  - Position 5: E (✓)
- Using ""STARE"" tests S at position 1 and T at position 2, while confirming A, R, E at their fixed positions. This helps gather information on two new letters efficiently.

<guess>stare</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is E)

From this, we deduced:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E (positions: 1,2,3,4,5 with 3=A and 5=E)
- R is in the word, but not at position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as -). Given the fixed positions, R must be at position 4 (the only other possible position, since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 1 is unknown but R can't be at 2). So the word is _ _ A R E.

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (as expected)
- R: ✓ (as expected, at position 4)
- E: ✓ (as expected)

So now we know:
- S and T are not in the word.
- The word is _ _ A R E, with the first and second letters unknown, but we know:
  - First letter: not C, not S, not T (and not N, from guess1)
  - Second letter: not R (from guess1), and now not T? Actually, T is not in the word at all, so second letter cannot be T. Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know it's not T and not S (but S is not in the word, so it can't be second anyway).

The secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A R E

Constraints:
- letter1: cannot be C, N, S, T (and must be a letter not yet excluded)
- letter2: cannot be R, and cannot be T (since T is not in the word at all), and also cannot be S (not in word). Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know T and S are not in the word, so letter2 is not T and not S.

But we don't know if letter2 is fixed? We only know what it cannot be? And we need to find what it can be.

Also, we have no information about other possible letters? We have tested only a few.

We need to make a new guess that fits the pattern? But we don't know the first two letters? We can try a word that has the form _ _ A R E, but with new letters? Or we can try a different word to test more letters? 

But note: we know the last three letters are fixed as A, R, E? So any guess must have A at position 3, R at position 4, E at position 5? Because if we change that, we might get incorrect feedback? But we can use a word that doesn't have A at 3 or R at 4? But that would be inefficient? Because we know they are fixed? 

Actually, we can use a word that has different letters to test? But we have to consider that the secret word has A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? So if we guess a word without A at 3, then the feedback for A would be - or x? But we know it should be ✓? So it's better to keep the known letters fixed? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use a word of the form X Y A R E, where X and Y are new letters that we haven't tested? And we avoid the excluded letters: C, N, S, T.

Excluded letters so far: C, N, S, T.

Available letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But A, E, R are already in the word? But we are testing X and Y.

We need to choose X and Y? 

Common words of the form _ _ A R E:

Examples:
- GLARE: G L A R E
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- AWARE: but that has W at position 2? A W A R E? Then position 1 is A? But then pattern: A W A R E? So index0=A, index1=W, index2=A? But we have A at index2? So if we use AWARE, then index0=A? But we don't know if A is at index0? 

But note: we have not tested A at index0? So it could be? But in the first guess, we had A at index2? And it was correct? But that doesn't prevent A from being at index0? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had A at index2 correct? But if the word has A at index0, then in ""crane"" we didn't have A at index0? So we wouldn't know? 

But in ""stare"", we had S at index0? Which was x? So if we use AWARE: 
- A at index0: if the secret word has A at index0? Then it would be marked as - or ✓? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if we guess AWARE, and secret has A at index0? Then the feedback for A at index0 would be - (because it's in the word but not at index0? But it is at index2? So it would be marked as - for index0? And then at index2 it would be ✓? 

But we already know index2 is A? So it's redundant? And we are trying to find the first two letters? 

Moreover, AWARE has two A's? So it might be possible? 

But let's list possible words without using excluded letters? 

Possible words: 
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- GLARE: G L A R E
- Other: PARER? Not the pattern? 
- RARER? Not the pattern? 
- DARER? Not? 
- HARE? too short? 
- SHARE? But S is excluded? 
- SPARE? S excluded? 
- STARE? T excluded? 
- So we have BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? 

Also, ""AWARE"": A W A R E? This has two A's? And W? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? 

Similarly, ""SCARE"": S excluded? 

""UCARE""? Not a word? 

So common ones: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? 

But AWARE: A at index0 and index2? 

We can use one of these? 

But we want to test new letters? 

We have not tested: B, F, G, L, W, etc? 

If we guess ""BLARE"", then:
- If the secret is BLARE, we win? 
- If not, we get feedback on B and L? 

Similarly for others? 

But we have three possibilities? We have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? 

We can also try a word that doesn't have the fixed pattern? But that might be less efficient? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But with the fixed pattern, we have to test the first two letters? 

Since we have multiple candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? We can choose one? 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters? 

Also, we can consider that the second letter (index1) might be a vowel? 

But let's list the possibilities we know: 
- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L
- AWARE: A and W

But in AWARE, the first letter is A? So if we guess AWARE, and the secret is not AWARE, then:
- If A is at index0? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if the secret has only one A? Then A at index0 would be wrong? 

But it might have two A's? 

We don't know? 

To be safe, let's avoid AWARE for now? Because it might complicate? 

So among BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? 

We can choose ""GLARE"" to test G and L? 

But note: L is common? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses different letters? But we have to use the pattern? 

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't have the fixed pattern? For example, we can use a word that has A, R, E in different positions? But we know they are fixed? So it's better to keep them? 

I think we should guess one of the candidates? 

Let me pick ""GLARE"": G L A R E? 

Then, if it's correct, we win? 

If not, we get feedback on G and L? 

If G is correct at index0? Or L at index1? 

But if the secret is, say, FLARE, then for GLARE: 
- G at index0: if secret has F? Then G would be x? 
- L at index1: if secret has L at index1? Then ✓? But if secret is FLARE, then L is at index1? So L would be ✓? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that has the pattern but with letters that are common? 

I think ""GLARE"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback: 

After guess2, we have: 
- S and T are not in the word? 
- So the secret word has only the letters we know: A, R, E, and two more? 

We know the word is ? ? A R E? 

The first two letters must be from the remaining alphabet? 

Possible words: 
- BLARE: B and L
- FLARE: F and L
- GLARE: G and L
- Also, ""PARER"" is not? 
- ""HAREM""? But that is H A R E M? Then pattern: H at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, M at4? But we need A at index2? So not? 
- ""MARRY""? Not? 
- ""WARES""? But S excluded? 
- ""BARED""? But E at index4? D at5? Not E? 
- So only the ones with L? Or AWARE? 

Another: ""OARED""? O A R E D? Then index0=O, index1=A, index2=R? But we need index2=A? So not? 

So the only common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? 

AWARE: A W A R E? 
- index0: A
- index1: W
- index2: A
- index3: R
- index4: E

This matches the pattern? Because index2=A, index3=R, index4=E? 

And index0 and index1 are A and W? 

But we know the secret has A at index2? But it might have A at index0? 

In the first guess ""crane"", we had A at index2? But we didn't have A at index0? So if the secret has A at index0, it would not have been revealed? Because we didn't test it? 

Similarly, in ""stare"", we had no A at index0? 

So it's possible? 

Therefore, AWARE is a candidate? 

But we have four candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? 

We are at guess 3? We can try one? 

To maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we can't? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use L? Because if we choose GLARE and it's wrong, we know L is not in the word? Then we can eliminate? 

But if we choose AWARE, we test A and W? 

But A is already known? 

I think it's better to choose one without repeating letters? 

AWARE has two A's? 

So let's avoid? 

Choose ""GLARE"": 

<guess>glare</guess> 

But let's see the feedback? 

If we get: 
- G: ? 
- L: ? 
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- E: ✓

Then we know if G and L are correct? 

If the secret is BLARE, then G would be x? and L would be ✓? 

Similarly, if FLARE, G x, L ✓? 

If GLARE, all ✓? 

If AWARE, then G x, L x? Because AWARE has no G or L? 

Then we would know? 

So it's a good test? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GLARE"". 

But note: we have to avoid excluded letters? G and L are not excluded? 

So guess: GLAREBased on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C and N are not in the word.  
  - Deduction: The word pattern is `_ _ A _ E`, with R located at position 4 (the only remaining position it can occupy, given the constraints).

- **Guess 2: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A, R, and E are confirmed in their correct positions (positions 3, 4, and 5).  
    - S and T are not in the word.  
  - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ _ A R E` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T.  
  - Known letters: A, R, E (fixed at positions 3, 4, 5).  
  - Unknown: Positions 1 and 2, which must be filled with letters not excluded and not yet tested extensively.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must fit the pattern `_ _ A R E` to maintain the confirmed positions (A at 3, R at 4, E at 5).  
- Test new, common consonants for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, S, T).  
- Possible candidate words: `GLARE` (tests G and L), `BLARE` (tests B and L), or `FLARE` (tests F and L).  
- Choosing `GLARE`:  
  - Tests G at position 1 and L at position 2.  
  - If correct, we solve the word.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on G and L will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if G is wrong, `BLARE` or `FLARE` become likely; if L is wrong, `AWARE` becomes a candidate, though it has a repeated A).  
- `GLARE` is a valid English word and efficiently tests two new letters.

Known exclusions: C and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of R and also discover other letters.\n\nWe should use a word that:\n- Has A at position 2 and E at position 5 (to keep the correct ones and test new letters).\n- Includes R in either position 3 or 4 (to see where it fits).\n- Does not use C or N (since they are excluded).\n\nMoreover, we want to cover common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible candidates: We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? A ? ? E\n\nThe third and fourth letters are unknown, but we must include R in one of them.\n\nLet me think of words that fit:\n- One common word is ""RAREE"" but that has two R\'s? However, we don\'t know if R can repeat. The feedback didn\'t show two R\'s, but we only guessed one R. We can\'t rule out two R\'s yet.\n\nAlternatively, ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> This has A at position 2 and E at position 5, and R at position 3. Also, avoids C and N.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if B or G are in the word? They are new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.\n\nOr ""CARVE"": But C is excluded, so not allowed.\n\nHow about ""FARCE"": F A R C E -> C is excluded, so not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid C and N.\n\nAnother word: ""MARVE"" is not a word. \n\nConsider ""WARSE"" — not common. \n\nList of possible words: \n- R at position 3: words like BARGE, PARSE, FARSE (not word), DARES? but DARES has S at position 4? D A R E S -> but E is at position 4, not 5, so it would be D A R E S, which is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not E? We need E at the fifth.\n\nSo, pattern: _ A _ _ E\n\nLet me find words: \n- With R at position 3: e.g., BARES (not common), CARES (but C excluded), DARES (if we use DARES, then position 4 is E, but the fifth is S? so not E at fifth).\n\nWait, no: the pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So, for example:\n- MAPLE -> M A P L E: A at 2, E at 5. But where is R? We haven\'t included R? We must include R because we know R is in the word.\n\nThe feedback says R is in the word, so our next guess must include R? Actually, no: it\'s optional because we can try to find other letters, but it might be better to test for R.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip testing R and try to get more information about other positions? But we know R is there and we haven\'t tested other positions. It\'s efficient to use the information.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that includes R and tries it in position 3 or 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BARRE"" — two R\'s? Not common and might not be allowed? But let\'s see: BARRE is a word (meaning a ballet bar).\n- ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> A at 2, E at 5, R at 3. Avoids C and N.\n- ""PARGE"" — not common.\n- ""TARES"": T A R E S -> but E at position 4? Then S at fifth? But E is at position 4, not fifth? No, we need E at fifth: so T A R E S? That\'s T[0], A[1], R[2], E[3], S[4] — but position 3 would be E, and fourth? This pattern doesn\'t have E at fifth? So it would be T A R E S -> [0]T, [1]A, [2]R, [3]E, [4]S: fifth is S. But we need fifth to be E? Then we cannot have any other letter at fifth? Why? Because the correct word has E at fifth? Yes.\n\nSo we must have E at the fifth position? Exactly: the pattern is: _ A _ _ E\n\nTherefore, position 1: unknown, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: E.\n\nWords of the form: ? A ? ? E\n\nAnd we must have an R in either position 3 or 4? Actually, except if we don\'t put R but then we risk not getting information? It\'s better to test R? The feedback says R is in the word, but we haven\'t fixed its position.\n\nValid words:\n- With R at position 3: LARGE, BARGE, MARGE, PARGE? but PARGE is not common? Marge is acceptable? No, Marge is typically a name? But we need English words.\n\nCommon words:\n- BARGE, LARGE, MARGE? not standard? \n- FARGE? not a word.\n\nHow about ""WARE""? That\'s 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n""CARED"" — C excluded and E at fourth? Not fifth.\n\nThen with R at position 4: words like ? A ? R E\n\nFor example: MAPRE? Not a word. Or LATER? Let\'s see: L A T E R -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But the fifth letter is R, not E. So that\'s L A T E R, and E is at position 4? Not 5? So doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother possibility: F A C E R — again, C excluded and E at fourth? Fifth is R? Not E? \n\nIt\'s challenging. Consider: ? A ? R E\n\nThe fifth letter must be E? Then position 4 is R? So pattern: _ A _ R E.\n\nWhat are the words?\n- ""CARE"" is 4 letters? \n- ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Fifth letter is R? Not E? So no.\n\nAlternatively, ""BAR"": too short.\n\nActually, the pattern _ A _ R E: meaning position 4 is R and position 5 is E? So the word ends with ""RE""? \n\nFor example: ""CARE"" is not 5. ""STARE"": S T A R E -> S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Doesn\'t fit? Because A must be at position 2? So pattern: position 0 is ?, position 1 is A (position 2?), let me index: \nPosition 0: first letter (non-A)\nPosition 1: A (second letter)\nPosition 2: third letter\nPosition 3: R? \nPosition 4: E (fifth)\n\nAnd must be valid English words.\n\nExamples: \n- ""PARRE""? Not word.\n- ""FARSE""? Not word.\n- ""BARGE"" — B A R G E: so position 0=B, position 1=A, position 2=R, position 3=G, position 4=E?\nThat doesn\'t put R at position 3 but at position 2 (third letter). Position 3 is G? \n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to list words: \nKnown words: \n- LARGE: L A R G E -> fits pattern: first letter L, second A, third R, fourth G, fifth E? So positions = L(0), A(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) — so in terms of feedback: A at position 2? If A is second letter, we call it position 1? \n\nClarify indexing: \nGuess word: 5 letters, position 1 to 5? Typically in programming we start index at 0? But the feedback: in the example, ""BRAVE"" -> B(1? ✓), R(2? ✓), etc? According to the example: ""Guess 1: STORM"" where S is first letter? Feedback: S(-) then T(x) etc.\n\nIn the feedback notation: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""\nSo it goes letter by letter in order? So the feedback corresponds to the positions? So for ""STORM"": \nPosition 1: S -> marked as -\nPosition 2: T -> marked as x\nPosition 3: O -> marked as x\nPosition 4: R -> marked as -\nPosition 5: M -> marked as x\n\nSimilarly, in our case, ""crane"": \n- C (position 1): x? \nBut the feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nSo C is position 1? Then R at position 2? A at position 3? But feedback A is marked ✓, meaning correct position? So A is the third letter? \n\nWait, feedback A(✓) says: the letter is in the word and in correct position? Therefore, in the secret word, A must be at the same position as in ""CRANE"" — which is position 3? Because ""CRANE"" is spelled: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Therefore:\nPosition 1: C (x) -> not in secret word\nPosition 2: R (-) -> in word, but not at position 2? So R must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait: \nWe know from feedback: A is at position 3? And E at position 5? So R must be in positions 1 or 4? Because position 3 is A? and 5 is E? \n\nLet me map:\nSecret word: 5 letters: let\'s say position 1,2,3,4,5.\nFrom first guess ""CRANE"":\n- Position 1 (C): not in secret word -> secret[0] != C\n- Position 2 (R): present but not at position 2 -> secret has R, but not at index 1 (position 2)\n- Position 3 (A): present at position 3 -> secret[2] = A\n- Position 4 (N): not in secret word -> secret[3] != N and word doesn\'t contain N\n- Position 5 (E): present at position 5 -> secret[4] = E\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- R somewhere, but not at position 2 (index 1). And not position 3 (which is A) or 5 (which is E)? So R must be at position 1 or 4? \n\nAlso, we have no information about position 1 and 4.\n\nSummary: \nSecret word: \n- Position 1: not C, and could be R? or a new letter\n- Position 2: R is not there? Actually, the position 2 in secret must be a letter? But we know? No, we don\'t know what is in position 2? We know only position 3 is A and position 5 is E? \n\nSecret indices:\n0: (first letter) - not C, but could be R or other\n1: (second letter) - is not R? Feedback: R was guessed at position 2? Meaning at index 1? So secret[1] != R? So position 2 is not R? So R is at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 3 is A? So R cannot be at position 3? Position 5 is E? So R cannot be at position 5? Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 4? \n\nPositions are defined as per order? Let me label:\nIn 5-letter word:\n- Index 0: first character (position 1)\n- Index 1: second character (position 2)\n- Index 2: third character (position 3)\n- Index 3: fourth character (position 4)\n- Index 4: fifth character (position 5)\n\nFirst guess ""CRANE"": \n- Index 0: \'C\' -> x (not in secret word)\n- Index 1: \'R\' -> - (present, but secret index1 != R)\n- Index 2: \'A\' -> ✓ (secret index2 = A)\n- Index 3: \'N\' -> x (not in secret word)\n- Index 4: \'E\' -> ✓ (secret index4 = E)\n\nSo:\nSecret[2] = A\nSecret[4] = E\nSecret contains R, but secret[1] != R? And R is not at index0 because we don\'t know? But secret[1] != R? Then R can be only at index3? Because index0, 2, 4 we have: index0 is ? (but not C), index2 = A (so R can\'t be), index4 = E (so R can\'t be). So secret must have R at index3? \n\nBut index3 is the fourth letter? So position 4? \n\nSummary: \nSecret word: \nIndex0: unknown, not C\nIndex1: unknown, but not R\nIndex2: A\nIndex3: ? - but since R is in the word and the only position left is index3 (unless there are multiple letters? but we don\'t know? For now, single R?) So likely R at index3?\nIndex4: E\n\nTherefore, the secret word is: ? ? A R E\n\nWe know index1 cannot be R? But we don\'t know its value? Also, index0 is not C.\n\nTherefore, the word is: [unknown not C] [unknown not R] A R E\n\nBut the fourth letter is R? And fifth E? So word: ??? + ""ARE""? So the word ends with ""ARE""? But wait: index2=A, index3=R, index4=E, so the last three letters are ""A R E"". In order: ... A, then R, then E? So ...ARE.\n\nNot necessarily the word ending? Index2,3,4 make up positions 3,4,5: so letters 3: A, letter4: R, letter5: E.\n\nTherefore, the secret word: \n- letter1 = ?\n- letter2 = ? (cannot be R)\n- letter3 = A\n- letter4 = R\n- letter5 = E\n\nBut we also know: no C, no N.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ A R E\n\nFor the next guess, it must be a 5-letter English word? We want to test possibilities for letter1 and letter2? We know letter2 is not R? And letter1 is not C? And not N? Since N is excluded.\n\nAlso, we can try to find letter1 and letter2? \n\nGood choices: use common consonants? For example, words like ""SHARE"": S H A R E -> S at index0, H at index1, and then A R E? But in ""SHARE"": positions: \n0: S\n1: H\n2: A -> correct? \n3: R -> correct? \n4: E -> correct? \n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word? \n\nSimilarly, ""SPARE"": S P A R E\n\nBut that would give the pattern? \n\nWe can also test ""PLARE""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, etc.\n\nBut note: we want to maximize information? Because we know the pattern is ? ? A R E? And letters at positions 0 and 1? \n\nAlternatively, we could pick a word that has the required A R E at positions 2,3,4? But positions in the word: we need index2=\'A\', index3=\'R\', index4=\'E\'. Also, our guess must be a word? \n\nFor the next guess, we can have any word? Not necessarily matching the known positions? But matching known positions might be efficient.\n\nSince we know A at position3 (index2) and R at position4 (index3) and E at position5 (index4), we can set them? Then only positions 1 and 2 (index0 and index1) are unknown? \n\nSo guess pattern: X Y A R E? \n\nNow, what are possible? We need X and Y? Also, Y cannot be R? And X cannot be C or N? \n\nCommon words of the form _ _ARE:\n\nExamples: \n- SHARE: S H A R E -> Y=H at index1?\n- SPARE: S P A R E -> Y=P?\n- STARE: S T A R E -> Y=T?\n- SNARE? But N is excluded? So we cannot use SNARE? Since N is excluded? \n- SWARE: is that a word? S W A R E? Not common? \n- GLARE: G L A R E -> Y=L?\n\nLet\'s list: SHARE, SPARE, STARE, GLARE, BLARE, FLARE, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know about the new letters? \n\nWe also have the constraint that letter2 (index1) cannot be R? That\'s already known? And we aren\'t putting R at index1? So it\'s ok? \n\nWe want to try letters that are common? To test possibilities.\n\nPerhaps try ""SHARE"": \n- If it\'s SHARE, we win? Feedback will all be ✓? \n- But if not, we get information on S and H.\n\nSimilarly, we could try ""STARE"": to test T? \n\nBut note: sometimes in the first positions? It might be efficient to use a word that tests two new letters? \n\nChoose ""STARE"": \nS T A R E\n\nThen:\nPosition 0 (S): if S is in word? And correct or incorrect?\nPosition 1 (T): if T is in word? But we know position 1 cannot be R? And not C or N? T is possible.\nThen position2 A: ✓\nposition3 R: ✓\nposition4 E: ✓\n\nThen feedback will tell us for S and T? \n\nAlternatively, ""PLARE"" is not a word? So use ""SHARE"" or ""STARE"". \n\nAlso, avoid known exclusions: we know C and N are out? So no issue.\n\nI think ""STARE"" might be a good choice? Or ""SHARE""? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested any vowels other than A, E? Remaining vowels: O, I, U? Also consonants? \n\nSince we are guessing two positions: index0 and index1? We can choose different starting letters? \n\nLet me pick ""BLARE"": B L A R E? To test B and L? \n\n""FLARE"": F L A R E, etc.\n\nPerhaps ""SHARE""? S and H are common? \n\nI\'ll go with ""STARE"": to test S and T? Because S and T are common? \n\n""STARE"" is a common word.\n\nSo the guess is: STARE\n\nBut confirm: \n- Pattern: S T A R E? \nIn the word STARE: \nIndex0: S\nIndex1: T\nIndex2: A\nIndex3: R\nIndex4: E\n\nWe know Index2=A and Index3=R and Index4=E? So the feedback of A should be ✓, R should be ✓, E should be ✓.\n\nThen S and T are the variables? But S in position 0 and T in position 1? \n\nIf the secret word is BLARE, then for STARE:\nIndex0: S != B (so if B then S would be x or if in wrong position? But if secret has S? \n\nSince we don\'t know, we will get feedback: \n- S: might be ✓ if secret[0]=S? or - if secret has S but not at 0? or x if not in word? \nSimilar for T? \n\nThis will give us two new pieces of information? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that avoids S and T? But in the pattern _ _ARE, we need to pick first letters? \n\nI think STARE is fine.\n\nAnother option: ""GLARE"": G and L? \n\nTo avoid possible letters? But randomly, I think STARE is as good as any? \n\nSo I\'ll stick with STARE for guess 2.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- A: correct position (✓)\n- N: not present (x)\n- E: correct position (✓)\n\nWe know:\n1. The second letter (position 2) is A (✓).\n2. The fifth letter (position 5) is E (✓).\n3. R is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (since it was marked as - in position 2). Given that positions 2 (A) and 5 (E) are fixed, R must be in position 4 (the only remaining position where it can appear).\n4. The word has the pattern: _ A _ R E (positions: 1 = ?, 2 = A, 3 = ?, 4 = R, 5 = E).\n5. C and N are eliminated.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must be of the form ? ? A R E to test the remaining positions (1 and 3).\n- ""STARE"" fits the pattern: \n  - Position 1: S\n  - Position 2: T (but note position 2 cannot be R!)\n  - Position 3: A (✓)\n  - Position 4: R (✓)\n  - Position 5: E (✓)\n- Using ""STARE"" tests S at position 1 and T at position 2, while confirming A, R, E at their fixed positions. This helps gather information on two new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>stare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is E)\n\nFrom this, we deduced:\n- The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E (positions: 1,2,3,4,5 with 3=A and 5=E)\n- R is in the word, but not at position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and marked as -). Given the fixed positions, R must be at position 4 (the only other possible position, since position 3 is A and 5 is E, and position 1 is unknown but R can\'t be at 2).

Actually, T is not in the word at all, so second letter cannot be T. Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know it\'s not T and not S (but S is not in the word, so it can\'t be second anyway).\n\nThe secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A R E\n\nConstraints:\n- letter1: cannot be C, N, S, T (and must be a letter not yet excluded)\n- letter2: cannot be R, and cannot be T (since T is not in the word at all), and also cannot be S (not in word). Also, from guess1, we know the second letter is not R, and now we know T and S are not in the word, so letter2 is not T and not S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if letter2 is fixed? We only know what it cannot be? And we need to find what it can be.\n\nAlso, we have no information about other possible letters? We have tested only a few.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that fits the pattern? But we don\'t know the first two letters? We can try a word that has the form _ _ A R E, but with new letters? Or we can try a different word to test more letters? \n\nBut note: we know the last three letters are fixed as A, R, E? So any guess must have A at position 3, R at position 4, E at position 5? Because if we change that, we might get incorrect feedback? But we can use a word that doesn\'t have A at 3 or R at 4? But that would be inefficient? Because we know they are fixed? \n\nActually, we can use a word that has different letters to test? But we have to consider that the secret word has A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? So if we guess a word without A at 3, then the feedback for A would be - or x? But we know it should be ✓? So it\'s better to keep the known letters fixed? \n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should use a word of the form X Y A R E, where X and Y are new letters that we haven\'t tested? And we avoid the excluded letters: C, N, S, T.\n\nExcluded letters so far: C, N, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But A, E, R are already in the word? But we are testing X and Y.\n\nWe need to choose X and Y? \n\nCommon words of the form _ _ A R E:\n\nExamples:\n- GLARE: G L A R E\n- BLARE: B L A R E\n- FLARE: F L A R E\n- AWARE: but that has W at position 2? A W A R E? Then position 1 is A? But then pattern: A W A R E? So index0=A, index1=W, index2=A? But we have A at index2? So if we use AWARE, then index0=A? But we don\'t know if A is at index0? \n\nBut note: we have not tested A at index0? So it could be? But in the first guess, we had A at index2? And it was correct? But that doesn\'t prevent A from being at index0? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had A at index2 correct? But if the word has A at index0, then in ""crane"" we didn\'t have A at index0? So we wouldn\'t know? \n\nBut in ""stare"", we had S at index0? Which was x? So if we use AWARE: \n- A at index0: if the secret word has A at index0? Then it would be marked as - or ✓? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if we guess AWARE, and secret has A at index0? Then the feedback for A at index0 would be - (because it\'s in the word but not at index0? But it is at index2? So it would be marked as - for index0? And then at index2 it would be ✓? \n\nBut we already know index2 is A? So it\'s redundant? And we are trying to find the first two letters? \n\nMoreover, AWARE has two A\'s? So it might be possible? \n\nBut let\'s list possible words without using excluded letters? \n\nPossible words: \n- BLARE: B L A R E\n- FLARE: F L A R E\n- GLARE: G L A R E\n- Other: PARER? Not the pattern? \n- RARER? Not the pattern? \n- DARER? Not? \n- HARE? too short? \n- SHARE? But S is excluded? \n- SPARE? S excluded? \n- STARE? T excluded? \n- So we have BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? \n\nAlso, ""AWARE"": A W A R E? This has two A\'s? And W? \n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? \n\nSimilarly, ""SCARE"": S excluded? \n\n""UCARE""? Not a word? \n\nSo common ones: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? \n\nBut AWARE: A at index0 and index2? \n\nWe can use one of these? \n\nBut we want to test new letters? \n\nWe have not tested: B, F, G, L, W, etc? \n\nIf we guess ""BLARE"", then:\n- If the secret is BLARE, we win? \n- If not, we get feedback on B and L? \n\nSimilarly for others? \n\nBut we have three possibilities? We have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 3? \n\nWe can also try a word that doesn\'t have the fixed pattern? But that might be less efficient? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But with the fixed pattern, we have to test the first two letters? \n\nSince we have multiple candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? We can choose one? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid excluded letters? \n\nAlso, we can consider that the second letter (index1) might be a vowel? \n\nBut let\'s list the possibilities we know: \n- BLARE: B and L\n- FLARE: F and L\n- GLARE: G and L\n- AWARE: A and W\n\nBut in AWARE, the first letter is A? So if we guess AWARE, and the secret is not AWARE, then:\n- If A is at index0? But we know the secret has A at index2? So if the secret has only one A? Then A at index0 would be wrong? \n\nBut it might have two A\'s? \n\nWe don\'t know? \n\nTo be safe, let\'s avoid AWARE for now? Because it might complicate? \n\nSo among BLARE, FLARE, GLARE? \n\nWe can choose ""GLARE"" to test G and L? \n\nBut note: L is common? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses different letters? But we have to use the pattern? \n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that doesn\'t have the fixed pattern? For example, we can use a word that has A, R, E in different positions? But we know they are fixed? So it\'s better to keep them? \n\nI think we should guess one of the candidates? \n\nLet me pick ""GLARE"": G L A R E? \n\nThen, if it\'s correct, we win? \n\nIf not, we get feedback on G and L? \n\nIf G is correct at index0? Or L at index1? \n\nBut if the secret is, say, FLARE, then for GLARE: \n- G at index0: if secret has F? Then G would be x? \n- L at index1: if secret has L at index1? Then ✓? But if secret is FLARE, then L is at index1? So L would be ✓? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has the pattern but with letters that are common? \n\nI think ""GLARE"" is fine? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: \n\nAfter guess2, we have: \n- S and T are not in the word? \n- So the secret word has only the letters we know: A, R, E, and two more? \n\nWe know the word is ? ? A R E? \n\nThe first two letters must be from the remaining alphabet? \n\nPossible words: \n- BLARE: B and L\n- FLARE: F and L\n- GLARE: G and L\n- Also, ""PARER"" is not? \n- ""HAREM""? But that is H A R E M? Then pattern: H at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, M at4? But we need A at index2? So not? \n- ""MARRY""? Not? \n- ""WARES""? But S excluded? \n- ""BARED""? But E at index4? D at5? Not E? \n- So only the ones with L? Or AWARE? \n\nAnother: ""OARED""? O A R E D? Then index0=O, index1=A, index2=R? But we need index2=A? So not? \n\nSo the only common words are BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, and AWARE? \n\nAWARE: A W A R E? \n- index0: A\n- index1: W\n- index2: A\n- index3: R\n- index4: E\n\nThis matches the pattern? Because index2=A, index3=R, index4=E? \n\nAnd index0 and index1 are A and W? \n\nBut we know the secret has A at index2? But it might have A at index0? \n\nIn the first guess ""crane"", we had A at index2? But we didn\'t have A at index0? So if the secret has A at index0, it would not have been revealed? Because we didn\'t test it? \n\nSimilarly, in ""stare"", we had no A at index0? \n\nSo it\'s possible? \n\nTherefore, AWARE is a candidate? \n\nBut we have four candidates: BLARE, FLARE, GLARE, AWARE? \n\nWe are at guess 3? We can try one? \n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple? But we can\'t? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use L? Because if we choose GLARE and it\'s wrong, we know L is not in the word? Then we can eliminate? \n\nBut if we choose AWARE, we test A and W? \n\nBut A is already known? \n\nI think it\'s better to choose one without repeating letters? \n\nAWARE has two A\'s? \n\nSo let\'s avoid? \n\nChoose ""GLARE"": \n\n<guess>glare</guess> \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback? \n\nIf we get: \n- G: ? \n- L: ? \n- A: ✓\n- R: ✓\n- E: ✓\n\nThen we know if G and L are correct? \n\nIf the secret is BLARE, then G would be x? and L would be ✓? \n\nSimilarly, if FLARE, G x, L ✓? \n\nIf GLARE, all ✓? \n\nIf AWARE, then G x, L x? Because AWARE has no G or L? \n\nThen we would know? \n\nSo it\'s a good test? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""GLARE"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid excluded letters? G and L are not excluded? \n\nSo guess: GLAREBased on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  \n    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  \n    - R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n    - C and N are not in the word.  \n  - Deduction: The word pattern is `_ _ A _ E`, with R located at position 4 (the only remaining position it can occupy, given the constraints).\n\n- **Guess 2: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - A, R, and E are confirmed in their correct positions (positions 3, 4, and 5).  \n    - S and T are not in the word.  \n  - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ _ A R E` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  \n  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T.  \n  - Known letters: A, R, E (fixed at positions 3, 4, 5).  \n  - Unknown: Positions 1 and 2, which must be filled with letters not excluded and not yet tested extensively.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- The word must fit the pattern `_ _ A R E` to maintain the confirmed positions (A at 3, R at 4, E at 5).  \n- Test new, common consonants for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.  \n- Avoid excluded letters (C, N, S, T).  \n- Possible candidate words: `GLARE` (tests G and L), `BLARE` (tests B and L), or `FLARE` (tests F and L).  \n- Choosing `GLARE`:  \n  - Tests G at position 1 and L at position 2.  \n  - If correct, we solve the word.  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on G and L will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if G is wrong, `BLARE` or `FLARE` become likely; if L is wrong, `AWARE` becomes a candidate, though it has a repeated A).  \n- `GLARE` is a valid English word and efficiently tests two new letters.\n\n<guess>glare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: glare -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""

- R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

From this, we deduced:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
- R is in the word, but not at position 2. Given positions 3 and 5 are fixed, R must be at position 4 (the only remaining position).

Guess 2: ""stare""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- R: ✓ (position 4, confirming our deduction)
- E: ✓ (position 5)

So the pattern is now: _ _ A R E
Excluded letters: C, N, S, T

Guess 3: ""glare""
- G: x (not in the word)
- L: ✓ (correct, at position 2? Let's check the position)

Wait, let's clarify the positions for ""glare"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: E

Feedback:
- G: x → not in the word
- L: ✓ → correct and in the correct position. So position 2 is L.
- A: ✓ → position 3
- R: ✓ → position 4
- E: ✓ → position 5

Therefore, the feedback tells us:
- L is at position 2 (so the second letter is L).
- G is not in the word.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ L A R E

We know:
- Position 1: unknown (but not C, N, S, T, G)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: E

Excluded letters: C, N, S, T, G

We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter not excluded and form a valid English word.

Possible words of the form ? L A R E:
- BLARE: B L A R E
- FLARE: F L A R E
- Other possibilities? Like ""ALARE"" isn't a word. ""PLARE"" isn't a word. ""ULARE"" isn't a word.

Common words: BLARE, FLARE.

We have two strong candidates. We need to choose one to guess.

We can guess ""BLARE"" to test B. If it's not that, then it must be ""FLARE"".

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't fit the pattern to test multiple letters? But that might be inefficient since we have only two options and we are at guess 4.

Given we have two options, we can guess one of them.

Let's choose ""BLARE"" for the next guess.

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it must be ""FLARE"".

So, the next guess is ""BLARE"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - A is in position 3 (✓).  
    - E is in position 5 (✓).  
    - R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
    - C and N are excluded (x).  
  - Deduced pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, with R at position 4 (only possible position).

- **Guess 2: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - A, R, E confirmed in positions 3, 4, 5 (✓).

    - A, R, E remain confirmed.  
  - Deduced pattern: `_ L A R E` (only position 1 unknown).  
  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T, G.

### Current State:
- **Secret word pattern**: `? L A R E`  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, S, T, G (cannot be in the word).  
- **Possible words**: Only two common English words fit:  
  - **BLARE** (B at position 1)  
  - **FLARE** (F at position 1)  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Guess **BLARE** to test B at position 1.  
  - If correct, the word is solved.  
  - If incorrect, the word must be **FLARE** (since B would be excluded, leaving F as the only option).  
- This approach efficiently narrows down to the solution in at most 2 guesses.

  - Deduced pattern: `_ _ A R E` (positions 1 and 2 unknown).  
  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T.

- **Guess 3: GLARE** → Feedback: G(x) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - L is in position 2 (✓).  
    - G is excluded (x).  
    - A, R, E remain confirmed.  
  - Deduced pattern: `_ L A R E` (only position 1 unknown).  
  - Excluded letters: C, N, S, T, G.

### Current State:
- **Secret word pattern**: `? L A R E`  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, S, T, G (cannot be in the word).  
- **Possible words**: Only two common English words fit:  
  - **BLARE** (B at position 1)  
  - **FLARE** (F at position 1)  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Guess **BLARE** to test B at position 1.  
  - If correct, the word is solved.  
  - If incorrect, the word must be **FLARE** (since B would be excluded, leaving F as the only option).  
- This approach efficiently narrows down to the solution in at most 2 guesses.",Guess 4: blare -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
