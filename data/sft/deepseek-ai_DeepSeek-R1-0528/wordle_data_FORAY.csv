We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, our first guess: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 3 respectively).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, N, or E.
- Contains R and A, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3).

Also, since we have two known letters (R and A), we should try to place them in different positions and include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We should avoid repeating the positions for R and A.

Possible positions for R: since it was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong, R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
Similarly, A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

We also want to maximize new information by including new common letters.

Let's think of words that have R and A, and three other new letters (avoiding C, N, E).

Some candidate words:
- ""STARK"": has S, T, A, R, K. But note: A is in position 3? Wait, in ""stark"": S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), K(5). However, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3. Therefore, ""STARK"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

We need a word where A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2.

Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). 
- A is in position 2 (which is allowed because previously it was in 3, so 2 is new)
- R is in position 3 (allowed because previously it was in 2, so 3 is new)
- Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

But note: we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word. This seems a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ROAST"": R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But A is in position 3 again? We cannot use position 3 for A because we know A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Another: ""TRAIL"": T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). Here R is in position 2 again? But in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again. Also, A is in position 3 again. So this is invalid.

We must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

Let's try ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
- R is in position 1 (new position, allowed)
- A is in position 2 (new position, allowed)
- But we have D, I, O as new letters.

This seems valid.

Another: ""PARIS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
- A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed).

But note: we are using R in position 3 and A in position 2.

We can also consider ""RASPY"": R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
- A in position 2, R in position 1? Wait, in ""raspy"": R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). So A is in 2 and R in 1.

But we have to be cautious: we know that R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 for R is allowed. Similarly, A in position 2 is allowed.

However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E. None of these words have those.

Now, which word to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We might want to include S and T because they are very common.

So, a word with R, A, S, T would be ideal, but we have to place R and A in new positions.

Can we form such a word? 
- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3.

Example: ""STAIR"" - S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). But A is in position 3? Not allowed.

""TARES"": T(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). But E is in the word? We know E is not in the secret word because it was in the first guess and got x. So we cannot use E.

""RANTS"": but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- T, I, O are new.

This seems good.

""PARTY"": as before, P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). Also good.

Between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", which one?

We might prefer one that has more vowels? But we already have A, so we can try to get consonants.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R and A in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are free as long as we avoid the forbidden positions.

I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice because it has P, A, R, T, Y. We get to test P, T, Y.

Similarly, ""RATIO"" has R, A, T, I, O.

But note: in ""RATIO"", R is in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Another candidate: ""ROAST"" is invalid because of A in 3. 

""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). 
- R is in position 2? Forbidden because we know R is not in position 2. Also, A is in position 3? Forbidden. And N is not allowed. So invalid.

""BRAVE"": B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). 
- R in position 2? Forbidden. 
- A in position 3? Forbidden. 
- E is not allowed. 
So invalid.

Let's go with ""PARTY"". It uses P, A, R, T, Y. 
- P is new, T is new, Y is new.

We can also consider ""SPRAY"": S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
- R is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 2, so 3 is new)
- A is in position 4 (allowed, because previously it was in 3, so 4 is new)
- We are introducing S, P, Y.

This is also a good candidate because it places R and A in new positions (3 and 4) and we get to test S, P, Y.

But note: in ""SPRAY"", we have R in position 3 and A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it's a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""PANSY"" has N and S? But N is not allowed, so invalid.

I think ""SPRAY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in positions we haven't tried.

But let's check the letters: S, P, R, A, Y. We know R and A are in the word, so we are testing S, P, Y.

Another candidate: ""TAPIR"": T(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), R(5). 
- A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed). 
- Letters: T, A, P, I, R.

This is also good.

But I think ""SPRAY"" might be better because it has S and Y, which are common.

We can also consider ""DAIRY"": D(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5). 
- A in position 2, R in position 4. 
- But we are introducing D, I, Y.

But D and I are less common than S and T? Not necessarily.

Given the constraints, I think any of these are acceptable.

I'll go with ""PARTY"" for now because it's a common word and we get to test P, T, Y.

So, second guess: PARTY

But let's confirm the positions:
- P in position 1
- A in position 2 (which is a new position for A, since previously A was in position 3 and now we are trying position 2)
- R in position 3 (new position for R, previously in position 2, now 3)
- T in position 4
- Y in position 5

This is valid.

We are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E).

Therefore, we guess ""PARTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and A, but avoid positions 2 for R and 3 for A.
- It must exclude C, N, and E.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) and avoid repeating positions for R and A.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- P (new letter) in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new position for A, not 3).
- R in position 3 (new position for R, not 2).
- T (new letter) in position 4.
- Y (new letter) in position 5.

This tests new letters and positions while adhering to the feedback.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters R and A are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 3 respectively).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, N, or E.
- Contains R and A, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3).

Also, since we have two known letters (R and A), we should try to place them in different positions and include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We should avoid repeating the positions for R and A.

Possible positions for R: since it was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong, R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
Similarly, A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

We also want to maximize new information by including new common letters.

Let's think of words that have R and A, and three other new letters (avoiding C, N, E).

Some candidate words:
- ""STARK"": has S, T, A, R, K. But note: A is in position 3? Wait, in ""stark"": S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), K(5). However, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we cannot put A in position 3. Therefore, ""STARK"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

We need a word where A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2.

Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). 
- A is in position 2 (which is allowed because previously it was in 3, so 2 is new)
- R is in position 3 (allowed because previously it was in 2, so 3 is new)
- Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

But note: we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word. This seems a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ROAST"": R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But A is in position 3 again? We cannot use position 3 for A because we know A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Another: ""TRAIL"": T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). Here R is in position 2 again? But in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again. Also, A is in position 3 again. So this is invalid.

We must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

Let's try ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
- R is in position 1 (new position, allowed)
- A is in position 2 (new position, allowed)
- But we have D, I, O as new letters.

This seems valid.

Another: ""PARIS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
- A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed).

But note: we are using R in position 3 and A in position 2.

We can also consider ""RASPY"": R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
- A in position 2, R in position 1? Wait, in ""raspy"": R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). So A is in 2 and R in 1.

But we have to be cautious: we know that R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 for R is allowed. Similarly, A in position 2 is allowed.

However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E. None of these words have those.

Now, which word to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We might want to include S and T because they are very common.

So, a word with R, A, S, T would be ideal, but we have to place R and A in new positions.

Can we form such a word? 
- R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3.

Example: ""STAIR"" - S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). But A is in position 3? Not allowed.

""TARES"": T(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). But E is in the word? We know E is not in the secret word because it was in the first guess and got x. So we cannot use E.

""RANTS"": but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- T, I, O are new.

This seems good.

""PARTY"": as before, P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). Also good.

Between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", which one?

We might prefer one that has more vowels? But we already have A, so we can try to get consonants.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R and A in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are free as long as we avoid the forbidden positions.

I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice because it has P, A, R, T, Y. We get to test P, T, Y.

Similarly, ""RATIO"" has R, A, T, I, O.

But note: in ""RATIO"", R is in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

Another candidate: ""ROAST"" is invalid because of A in 3. 

""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). 
- R is in position 2? Forbidden because we know R is not in position 2. Also, A is in position 3? Forbidden. And N is not allowed. So invalid.

""BRAVE"": B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). 
- R in position 2? Forbidden. 
- A in position 3? Forbidden. 
- E is not allowed. 
So invalid.

Let's go with ""PARTY"". It uses P, A, R, T, Y. 
- P is new, T is new, Y is new.

We can also consider ""SPRAY"": S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
- R is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 2, so 3 is new)
- A is in position 4 (allowed, because previously it was in 3, so 4 is new)
- We are introducing S, P, Y.

This is also a good candidate because it places R and A in new positions (3 and 4) and we get to test S, P, Y.

But note: in ""SPRAY"", we have R in position 3 and A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it's a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""PANSY"" has N and S? But N is not allowed, so invalid.

I think ""SPRAY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in positions we haven't tried.

But let's check the letters: S, P, R, A, Y. We know R and A are in the word, so we are testing S, P, Y.

Another candidate: ""TAPIR"": T(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), R(5). 
- A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed). 
- Letters: T, A, P, I, R.

This is also good.

But I think ""SPRAY"" might be better because it has S and Y, which are common.

We can also consider ""DAIRY"": D(1), A(2), I(3), R(4), Y(5). 
- A in position 2, R in position 4. 
- But we are introducing D, I, Y.

But D and I are less common than S and T? Not necessarily.

Given the constraints, I think any of these are acceptable.

I'll go with ""PARTY"" for now because it's a common word and we get to test P, T, Y.

So, second guess: PARTY

But let's confirm the positions:
- P in position 1
- A in position 2 (which is a new position for A, since previously A was in position 3 and now we are trying position 2)
- R in position 3 (new position for R, previously in position 2, now 3)
- T in position 4
- Y in position 5

This is valid.

We are not using any forbidden letters (C, N, E).

Therefore, we guess ""PARTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and A, but avoid positions 2 for R and 3 for A.
- It must exclude C, N, and E.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) and avoid repeating positions for R and A.

The word ""party"" fits these criteria:
- P (new letter) in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new position for A, not 3).
- R in position 3 (new position for R, not 2).
- T (new letter) in position 4.
- Y (new letter) in position 5.

This tests new letters and positions while adhering to the feedback.

We are given feedback for the second guess ""party"":
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- R: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this feedback:
- R is in the word and in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3 and it was correct).
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (since we guessed Y in position 5 and it was correct).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (because we got a '-' for A in position 2).
- P and T are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R and A are in the word (which we already know) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (and now we know R is in position 3, which is consistent because in the first guess R was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we have it correct in position 3).

So, to summarize:
- Correct letters and positions: R in position 3, Y in position 5.
- Letters that are in the word but not in the guessed position: A (not in position 2, and also not in position 3 because position 3 is taken by R, and we know from the first guess it wasn't in 3 either, but now we have more constraints).
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E, P, T.

We also know that A must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from this guess) and not in position 3 (from the first guess and now position 3 is R). Also, from the first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, and now we have position 3 as R (correct) so A cannot be there. Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is Y, so A cannot be there either? Wait, position 5 is Y and correct, so A cannot be in position 5. And positions 2 and 3 are taken by other letters? Not exactly, but we know A is not in 2 or 3, and 5 is fixed by Y, so A must be in position 1 or 4.

The word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Position 2: we don't know yet, but we know A is not there (from the '-' in the second guess) and also we know that the letter in position 2 is not A.

So A must be in position 1 or 4.

Also, we have to fill position 1, 2, and 4. But we know A is in one of 1 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters that are not C, N, E, P, T, and also not R or Y (since R and Y are already placed, and we don't have duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically Wordle words can have duplicates? However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now. The feedback for ""crane"" had no duplicates and the secret word might have duplicates? But in this case, we have R and Y placed, and A is another letter, so likely no duplicates. So we assume the word has 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Position 1: either A or a new letter
- Position 2: a new letter (not A, and not any of the excluded letters)
- Position 4: either A (if not in 1) or a new letter.

But we know A is in the word and not in 2,3,5, so it must be in 1 or 4.

Now, the excluded letters are: C, N, E, P, T.

We need to guess a word that:
- Has R in position 3 and Y in position 5.
- Has A in position 1 or 4 (but not 2 or 3, and not 5).
- The other two positions (if A is in 1 then positions 2 and 4 are new; if A is in 4 then positions 1 and 2 are new) must be filled with letters not in the excluded list and not R, Y, or A (since no duplicates).

Also, we must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.

We have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to get more information.

But we also have the opportunity to test the position of A.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: A is in position 1.
Then the word is: A, ?, R, ?, Y

Case 2: A is in position 4.
Then the word is: ?, ?, R, A, Y

We can design a guess that can help distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.

We have to fill the unknown positions with new letters.

Available letters: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common letters: S, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form words that fit the pattern and use common letters.

First, let's try to form a word with A in position 1 and then one with A in position 4, and see which one is a valid word.

But we don't know which one is correct, so we should choose a word that has A in one of these positions and also tests other common letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in position 1 or 4? But we know A must be in 1 or 4, so we have to include A in one of them.

We can try to put A in position 1 and then use common letters for the others.

For example, if we put A in position 1, then we need to fill position 2 and 4.

Possible words: 
- ""A?R?Y""

Examples: 
- ""AIRLY"" - but is that a word? Not really.
- ""ARMOR"" - but has duplicate R? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is allowed, but we have two R's? We already have R in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be duplicate. But we don't know if the word has duplicate R? The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume no duplicates. So we cannot use R again.

Similarly, we cannot use Y again.

So, for position 2 and 4, we need two new distinct letters, not in {A, R, Y} and not excluded.

Let me try to find words that fit the pattern.

Common words: 
- ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). But in this case, A is in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2 (from the second guess feedback). So invalid.

- ""LARKY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). Again, A in position 2? Not allowed.

We need A in position 1 or 4.

So for A in position 1: 
- ""A__R_Y"" -> positions: 1=A, 2=?, 3=R, 4=?, 5=Y

Possible words: 
- ""AIRSY"" - not a word.
- ""AUDIO"" - but that doesn't have R and Y? No, we need R in 3 and Y in 5.

We need the word to have R in 3 and Y in 5.

So: ""A?R?Y""

Words: 
- ""AIRLY"" - not a word.
- ""ACRYL"" - not a word, and also C is excluded.
- ""AMBRY"": A(1), M(2), B(3)? But we need R in position 3, not B. So no.

Actually, we need the third letter to be R and fifth to be Y, so the word must be: [A] [letter2] [R] [letter4] [Y]

What are some words that fit this pattern?
- ""AWRY"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""AERIE"" - but E is excluded and not 5 letters? ""Aerie"" is 5? A,E,R,I,E - but E is excluded and duplicates? Also, E is not allowed.

Another: ""ALARY"" - A(1), L(2), A(3)? But we have A in 1 and 3? Duplicate A? And position 3 is R, so not A. So invalid.

""AGGRY"" - not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe A in position 1 is not common.

Now, try A in position 4: 
Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [R] [A] [Y]

So: ? ? R A Y

Words:
- ""BRAY"" is 4 letters.
- ""DRAINY"" - not 5 letters.
- ""BRAKY"" - B(1), R(2)? But we need R in position 3. So no.

We need R in position 3: so ? ? R A Y

Examples:
- ""BURAY"" - not a word.
- ""FORAY"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word! Meaning: a sudden attack or incursion.

Check the letters: F, O, R, A, Y. 
- R is in position 3 (correct), Y in position 5 (correct), A in position 4 (which is allowed, since we are testing A in position 4).
- We are introducing F and O, which are new and not excluded.

Also, we avoid the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.

So ""FORAY"" is a valid guess.

Another word: ""GRAVY"": G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), Y(5). But here R is in position 2? We need R in position 3. So no.

""TRAYS"": T(1), R(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But T is excluded, and R is in position 2, not 3. So invalid.

""WRAYS"" - not a word.

Another: ""DRAY"" is 4 letters.

""FRAY"" is 4 letters.

So ""FORAY"" seems a good candidate.

But what about the other case? We are testing A in position 4. If we get feedback that A is correct in position 4, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 1.

But we don't have a good word for A in position 1? Let me try again.

Another word for A in position 1: ""AARGH"" - but no R in position 3? It has R in position 2 and 3? A(1), A(2)? Duplicate A? And R in 3? But we have A in 1 and 2? Not standard.

""ALARY"" is not common.

""ANGRY"": A(1), N(2), G(3), R(4), Y(5). But N is excluded, and R is in position 4, not 3. So invalid.

""APERY"": A(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5). But P and E are excluded. Invalid.

So it seems hard to find a word with A in position 1, R in 3, Y in 5.

Therefore, we can try ""FORAY"" to test A in position 4.

If A is in position 4, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A must be in position 1, and we can adjust in the next guess.

Also, by using ""FORAY"", we test F and O.

So let's go with ""FORAY"".

But note: in ""FORAY"", we have:
- F: new letter
- O: new letter
- R: already correct (so we expect ✓)
- A: in position 4 (we are testing this)
- Y: already correct (✓)

We might get feedback that tells us about F and O.

If the word is ""FORAY"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback on F and O.

So it's a good guess.

Another possibility: ""GRAVY"" doesn't work because R is in 2.

What about ""MARRY""? M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). But duplicate R? And A is in position 2 which is not allowed. So invalid.

""PARLY"" - not a word.

So I think ""FORAY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""FORAY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word). This means:
  - R and A are in the secret word, but not in positions 2 or 3 (respectively).
  - C, N, and E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: PARTY** → Feedback: P(not in word), A(in word, wrong position), R(correct position), T(not in word), Y(correct position). This means:
  - R is in position 3 and Y is in position 5 (both confirmed correct).
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.
  - P and T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 5: Y
- **A must be in position 1 or 4**: A is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2) or 3 (from Guess 1, and position 3 is now R). Position 5 is Y, so A must be in 1 or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T (not in the word).
- **Available letters**: All letters except C, N, E, P, T, R, Y (R and Y are confirmed, so no duplicates assumed). Focus on common letters like F, O, S, L, I, etc.
- **Goal for Guess 3**: 
  - Test if A is in position 1 or 4.
  - Introduce new common letters to gather more information (e.g., F, O).

### Chosen Guess: FORAY
- **Pattern**: F (position 1), O (position 2), R (position 3, confirmed), A (position 4, testing), Y (position 5, confirmed).
- **Why this word?**
  - Tests A in position 4 (if A is correct here, it resolves the position; if not, A must be in position 1).
  - Uses new common letters (F and O) to maximize information gain.
  - Avoids excluded letters and respects known positions (R in 3, Y in 5).
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: a sudden attack or incursion).

If A is in position 4, this guess could solve the puzzle. If not, the feedback will confirm A must be in position 1, and we can adjust accordingly.

<guess>foray</guess>",foray,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""party"":
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- R: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this feedback:
- R is in the word and in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3 and it was correct).
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (since we guessed Y in position 5 and it was correct).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (because we got a '-' for A in position 2).
- P and T are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, E are not in the word.
- R and A are in the word (which we already know) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (and now we know R is in position 3, which is consistent because in the first guess R was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we have it correct in position 3).

So, to summarize:
- Correct letters and positions: R in position 3, Y in position 5.
- Letters that are in the word but not in the guessed position: A (not in position 2, and also not in position 3 because position 3 is taken by R, and we know from the first guess it wasn't in 3 either, but now we have more constraints).
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E, P, T.

We also know that A must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from this guess) and not in position 3 (from the first guess and now position 3 is R). Also, from the first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, and now we have position 3 as R (correct) so A cannot be there. Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is Y, so A cannot be there either? Wait, position 5 is Y and correct, so A cannot be in position 5. And positions 2 and 3 are taken by other letters? Not exactly, but we know A is not in 2 or 3, and 5 is fixed by Y, so A must be in position 1 or 4.

The word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Position 2: we don't know yet, but we know A is not there (from the '-' in the second guess) and also we know that the letter in position 2 is not A.

So A must be in position 1 or 4.

Also, we have to fill position 1, 2, and 4. But we know A is in one of 1 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters that are not C, N, E, P, T, and also not R or Y (since R and Y are already placed, and we don't have duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically Wordle words can have duplicates? However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now. The feedback for ""crane"" had no duplicates and the secret word might have duplicates? But in this case, we have R and Y placed, and A is another letter, so likely no duplicates. So we assume the word has 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- Position 1: either A or a new letter
- Position 2: a new letter (not A, and not any of the excluded letters)
- Position 4: either A (if not in 1) or a new letter.

But we know A is in the word and not in 2,3,5, so it must be in 1 or 4.

Now, the excluded letters are: C, N, E, P, T.

We need to guess a word that:
- Has R in position 3 and Y in position 5.
- Has A in position 1 or 4 (but not 2 or 3, and not 5).
- The other two positions (if A is in 1 then positions 2 and 4 are new; if A is in 4 then positions 1 and 2 are new) must be filled with letters not in the excluded list and not R, Y, or A (since no duplicates).

Also, we must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.

We have 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to get more information.

But we also have the opportunity to test the position of A.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: A is in position 1.
Then the word is: A, ?, R, ?, Y

Case 2: A is in position 4.
Then the word is: ?, ?, R, A, Y

We can design a guess that can help distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.

We have to fill the unknown positions with new letters.

Available letters: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common letters: S, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We can try to form words that fit the pattern and use common letters.

First, let's try to form a word with A in position 1 and then one with A in position 4, and see which one is a valid word.

But we don't know which one is correct, so we should choose a word that has A in one of these positions and also tests other common letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in position 1 or 4? But we know A must be in 1 or 4, so we have to include A in one of them.

We can try to put A in position 1 and then use common letters for the others.

For example, if we put A in position 1, then we need to fill position 2 and 4.

Possible words: 
- ""A?R?Y""

Examples: 
- ""AIRLY"" - but is that a word? Not really.
- ""ARMOR"" - but has duplicate R? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is allowed, but we have two R's? We already have R in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be duplicate. But we don't know if the word has duplicate R? The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume no duplicates. So we cannot use R again.

Similarly, we cannot use Y again.

So, for position 2 and 4, we need two new distinct letters, not in {A, R, Y} and not excluded.

Let me try to find words that fit the pattern.

Common words: 
- ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). But in this case, A is in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2 (from the second guess feedback). So invalid.

- ""LARKY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). Again, A in position 2? Not allowed.

We need A in position 1 or 4.

So for A in position 1: 
- ""A__R_Y"" -> positions: 1=A, 2=?, 3=R, 4=?, 5=Y

Possible words: 
- ""AIRSY"" - not a word.
- ""AUDIO"" - but that doesn't have R and Y? No, we need R in 3 and Y in 5.

We need the word to have R in 3 and Y in 5.

So: ""A?R?Y""

Words: 
- ""AIRLY"" - not a word.
- ""ACRYL"" - not a word, and also C is excluded.
- ""AMBRY"": A(1), M(2), B(3)? But we need R in position 3, not B. So no.

Actually, we need the third letter to be R and fifth to be Y, so the word must be: [A] [letter2] [R] [letter4] [Y]

What are some words that fit this pattern?
- ""AWRY"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""AERIE"" - but E is excluded and not 5 letters? ""Aerie"" is 5? A,E,R,I,E - but E is excluded and duplicates? Also, E is not allowed.

Another: ""ALARY"" - A(1), L(2), A(3)? But we have A in 1 and 3? Duplicate A? And position 3 is R, so not A. So invalid.

""AGGRY"" - not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe A in position 1 is not common.

Now, try A in position 4: 
Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [R] [A] [Y]

So: ? ? R A Y

Words:
- ""BRAY"" is 4 letters.
- ""DRAINY"" - not 5 letters.
- ""BRAKY"" - B(1), R(2)? But we need R in position 3. So no.

We need R in position 3: so ? ? R A Y

Examples:
- ""BURAY"" - not a word.
- ""FORAY"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word! Meaning: a sudden attack or incursion.

Check the letters: F, O, R, A, Y. 
- R is in position 3 (correct), Y in position 5 (correct), A in position 4 (which is allowed, since we are testing A in position 4).
- We are introducing F and O, which are new and not excluded.

Also, we avoid the excluded letters: C, N, E, P, T.

So ""FORAY"" is a valid guess.

Another word: ""GRAVY"": G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), Y(5). But here R is in position 2? We need R in position 3. So no.

""TRAYS"": T(1), R(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But T is excluded, and R is in position 2, not 3. So invalid.

""WRAYS"" - not a word.

Another: ""DRAY"" is 4 letters.

""FRAY"" is 4 letters.

So ""FORAY"" seems a good candidate.

But what about the other case? We are testing A in position 4. If we get feedback that A is correct in position 4, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 1.

But we don't have a good word for A in position 1? Let me try again.

Another word for A in position 1: ""AARGH"" - but no R in position 3? It has R in position 2 and 3? A(1), A(2)? Duplicate A? And R in 3? But we have A in 1 and 2? Not standard.

""ALARY"" is not common.

""ANGRY"": A(1), N(2), G(3), R(4), Y(5). But N is excluded, and R is in position 4, not 3. So invalid.

""APERY"": A(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5). But P and E are excluded. Invalid.

So it seems hard to find a word with A in position 1, R in 3, Y in 5.

Therefore, we can try ""FORAY"" to test A in position 4.

If A is in position 4, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A must be in position 1, and we can adjust in the next guess.

Also, by using ""FORAY"", we test F and O.

So let's go with ""FORAY"".

But note: in ""FORAY"", we have:
- F: new letter
- O: new letter
- R: already correct (so we expect ✓)
- A: in position 4 (we are testing this)
- Y: already correct (✓)

We might get feedback that tells us about F and O.

If the word is ""FORAY"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback on F and O.

So it's a good guess.

Another possibility: ""GRAVY"" doesn't work because R is in 2.

What about ""MARRY""? M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). But duplicate R? And A is in position 2 which is not allowed. So invalid.

""PARLY"" - not a word.

So I think ""FORAY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""FORAY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

  - P and T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
