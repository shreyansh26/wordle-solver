We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels, and without repeating letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. These are all common letters.

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - The letter 'R' is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since R is the second letter in ""crane"").
   - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'R' in the second position, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since we know the second letter is 'R', we can form a new guess that includes 'R' in the second position and avoids the letters C, A, N, E.

 We also note that the secret word is 5 letters long and must be a valid English word.

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Has 'R' as the second letter.
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
   - Contains other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many of the common consonants and vowels as possible. The remaining vowels are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
 But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O, U, or Y.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
   - Second letter: R
   - First letter: one of the common consonants (like S, T, B, etc.)
   - Third, fourth, fifth: other common letters, avoiding C, A, N, E.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
   - ""TRIP"" -> but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
   - ""TRIPS"" -> 5 letters, but we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven't ruled out S.

 Actually, we can use S, T, etc.

 Let me think of words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

 Examples:
   - BRICK: B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed (we got C(x) in the first guess, so C is not in the word). So avoid C.
   - BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> no C, A, N, E. But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> no C, A, N, E. But we don't have any of the common letters like S or T.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with S and T, and with R in the second position.

 Word: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P -> but note the positions: 
   - First: S, second: R (which is fixed), third: I, fourth: P? Actually, ""STRIP"" has the second letter as T? Wait, let's spell: 
     S-T-R-I-P -> so the second letter is T, not R. That doesn't work.

 We need the second letter to be R. So the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? ?

 Words that fit:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> avoids C, A, N, E.
   - BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> as above.
   - TRUST: T, R, U, S, T -> but T is repeated? And we have two T's? Also, we don't know if T is in the word.

 But note: we haven't tried T, so it might be in the word. However, we have to avoid the known absent letters.

 Another common word: ""DRINK"" -> D, R, I, N, K -> but N is not allowed (we got N(x) in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me think of words without C, A, N, E and with R in the second position.

 Some options:
   - BRICK (invalid because of C)
   - BROIL: B, R, O, I, L -> no C, A, N, E. Valid.
   - BRUTE: B, R, U, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we got E(x) in the first guess). So invalid.
   - FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> no C, A, N, E? Yes, and it has F, R, U, I, T. But note: the second letter is R? 
        F (1st), R (2nd), U (3rd), I (4th), T (5th). So yes.

 However, we don't know if F, U, I, T are in the word. But that's okay.

 Another option: ""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M -> no C, A, N, E.

 We can choose one that covers more common letters. The letters we haven't tried that are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's compare:
   - BROIL: letters B, R, O, I, L -> covers O, I, L, and B.
   - PRISM: letters P, R, I, S, M -> covers P, I, S, M.
   - FRUIT: letters F, R, U, I, T -> covers F, U, I, T.

 The most common letters (in English) that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

 I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate because it has S and I, and also M and P. But note that we also have the letter I which is a vowel.

 Alternatively, we can use ""TRIPS"" but that doesn't have R in the second position? 
   T-R-I-P-S: second letter is R? Actually, yes: T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). And it avoids C, A, N, E.

 But wait, we have to avoid E? Yes, and ""TRIPS"" does not have E. Also, it has T, R, I, P, S.

 However, we already know that R is in the second position, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we are required to put R in the second position because we know it's correct. So we can use that.

 But note: the feedback for R was ✓, so we must keep R in the second position.

 So ""TRIPS"" is a valid guess: T, R, I, P, S.

 Another candidate: ""ORBIT"" -> O, R, B, I, T -> but the second letter is R? 
   O (1st), R (2nd), B (3rd), I (4th), T (5th). And it avoids C, A, N, E.

 We have multiple options.

 Let me list a few more:
   - ""CRISP"" -> but C is not allowed? We got C(x) so we cannot use C. So invalid.
   - ""GRIPS"" -> G, R, I, P, S -> valid.

 How about ""SHIRT""? -> S, H, I, R, T -> but the second letter is H, not R. So invalid.

 We must have the second letter as R.

 So the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

 We need to choose a word that uses common letters and avoids C, A, N, E.

 I think ""TRIPS"" is a good choice because it includes T, S (very common) and I (vowel). 
 But note: we are not sure if T, I, P, S are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""BROWS"" -> B, R, O, W, S -> avoids C, A, N, E. And has O, W, S.

 However, I think ""TRIPS"" is more common and covers more common letters.

 But let's check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

 Common letters: S, E, A, O, R, I, ... but we know E and A are out. So S, O, I, R (we already have R) are good.

 So including S and I and T (which is also common) is good.

 Therefore, I choose ""TRIPS"".

 However, note that we have already used the letter R and we know it's in the word, so we are not testing R again. But we are using it in the correct position.

 But we are testing T, I, P, S.

 So let's go with ""TRIPS"".

<guess>trips</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""R"" is correct and in position 2 (✓).
- ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must have ""R"" as the second letter.
- Avoid ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, L) to maximize information.

Good candidates include ""TRIPS"" (T, R, I, P, S), which:
- Places ""R"" correctly in position 2.
- Tests new common letters (T, I, P, S).
- Avoids forbidden letters.

 We should try to include as many of the common consonants and vowels as possible. The remaining vowels are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
 But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word must be from I, O, U, or Y.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
   - Second letter: R
   - First letter: one of the common consonants (like S, T, B, etc.)
   - Third, fourth, fifth: other common letters, avoiding C, A, N, E.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
   - ""TRIP"" -> but that's 4 letters, we need 5.
   - ""TRIPS"" -> 5 letters, but we have to avoid S? Actually, we haven't ruled out S.

 Actually, we can use S, T, etc.

 Let me think of words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

 Examples:
   - BRICK: B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed (we got C(x) in the first guess, so C is not in the word). So avoid C.
   - BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> no C, A, N, E. But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> no C, A, N, E. But we don't have any of the common letters like S or T.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with S and T, and with R in the second position.

 Word: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P -> but note the positions: 
   - First: S, second: R (which is fixed), third: I, fourth: P? Actually, ""STRIP"" has the second letter as T? Wait, let's spell: 
     S-T-R-I-P -> so the second letter is T, not R. That doesn't work.

 We need the second letter to be R. So the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? ?

 Words that fit:
   - BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> avoids C, A, N, E.
   - BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> as above.
   - TRUST: T, R, U, S, T -> but T is repeated? And we have two T's? Also, we don't know if T is in the word.

 But note: we haven't tried T, so it might be in the word. However, we have to avoid the known absent letters.

 Another common word: ""DRINK"" -> D, R, I, N, K -> but N is not allowed (we got N(x) in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me think of words without C, A, N, E and with R in the second position.

 Some options:
   - BRICK (invalid because of C)
   - BROIL: B, R, O, I, L -> no C, A, N, E. Valid.
   - BRUTE: B, R, U, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we got E(x) in the first guess). So invalid.
   - FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> no C, A, N, E? Yes, and it has F, R, U, I, T. But note: the second letter is R? 
        F (1st), R (2nd), U (3rd), I (4th), T (5th). So yes.

 However, we don't know if F, U, I, T are in the word. But that's okay.

 Another option: ""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M -> no C, A, N, E.

 We can choose one that covers more common letters. The letters we haven't tried that are common: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's compare:
   - BROIL: letters B, R, O, I, L -> covers O, I, L, and B.
   - PRISM: letters P, R, I, S, M -> covers P, I, S, M.
   - FRUIT: letters F, R, U, I, T -> covers F, U, I, T.

 The most common letters (in English) that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

 I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate because it has S and I, and also M and P. But note that we also have the letter I which is a vowel.

 Alternatively, we can use ""TRIPS"" but that doesn't have R in the second position? 
   T-R-I-P-S: second letter is R? Actually, yes: T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). And it avoids C, A, N, E.

 But wait, we have to avoid E? Yes, and ""TRIPS"" does not have E. Also, it has T, R, I, P, S.

 However, we already know that R is in the second position, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we are required to put R in the second position because we know it's correct. So we can use that.

 But note: the feedback for R was ✓, so we must keep R in the second position.

 So ""TRIPS"" is a valid guess: T, R, I, P, S.

 Another candidate: ""ORBIT"" -> O, R, B, I, T -> but the second letter is R? 
   O (1st), R (2nd), B (3rd), I (4th), T (5th). And it avoids C, A, N, E.

 We have multiple options.

 Let me list a few more:
   - ""CRISP"" -> but C is not allowed? We got C(x) so we cannot use C. So invalid.
   - ""GRIPS"" -> G, R, I, P, S -> valid.

 How about ""SHIRT""? -> S, H, I, R, T -> but the second letter is H, not R. So invalid.

 We must have the second letter as R.

 So the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

 We need to choose a word that uses common letters and avoids C, A, N, E.

 I think ""TRIPS"" is a good choice because it includes T, S (very common) and I (vowel). 
 But note: we are not sure if T, I, P, S are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""BROWS"" -> B, R, O, W, S -> avoids C, A, N, E. And has O, W, S.

 However, I think ""TRIPS"" is more common and covers more common letters.

 But let's check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

 Common letters: S, E, A, O, R, I, ... but we know E and A are out. So S, O, I, R (we already have R) are good.

 So including S and I and T (which is also common) is good.

 Therefore, I choose ""TRIPS"".

 However, note that we have already used the letter R and we know it's in the word, so we are not testing R again. But we are using it in the correct position.

 But we are testing T, I, P, S.

 So let's go with ""TRIPS"".

<guess>trips</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""R"" is correct and in position 2 (✓).
- ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must have ""R"" as the second letter.
- Avoid ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, L) to maximize information.

Good candidates include ""TRIPS"" (T, R, I, P, S), which:
- Places ""R"" correctly in position 2.
- Tests new common letters (T, I, P, S).
- Avoids forbidden letters.

We are given:
- Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- Guess 2: trips -> Feedback: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)

From Guess 1:
- The second letter is R (correct and in position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2:
- The second letter R is again correct (as expected).
- T, I, P are not in the word (x). So we add T, I, P to the absent letters.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So S is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since we had S at the end in ""trips"").

So now we know:
- Forbidden letters (absent): C, A, N, E, T, I, P
- Present letters: S (but not in position 5) and R (in position 2)
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We also know:
- The letter S is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the second position is R, S cannot be there. So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We have only 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Contains S (since we know it's present) but not in position 5 (and not position 2, which is R). So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, P.

We have to use the available letters. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we must include S.

Important: We have two pieces of information: one correct letter position (R at 2) and one present letter in the wrong position (S, not at 5).

We should choose a word that tests new common letters to narrow down the possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tried: L, O, U, D, H, etc.

We must include S in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's think of words that fit: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And the word must contain S in one of positions 1,3,4.

Since we are constrained by the forbidden letters, let's think.

Possible scenarios:

Option A: S in position 1 -> word structure: S R ? ? ?

Option B: S in position 3 -> ? R S ? ?

Option C: S in position 4 -> ? R ? S ?

We need to fill the other positions with letters not in {C,A,N,E,T,I,P}.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

First, try Option A: S at position 1 -> ""S R ? ? ?""

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters from the available set, avoiding forbidden ones.

Examples: ""S R O W ?"", ""S R U B ?"", but let me see actual words.

- ""SURLY"" -> S,U,R,L,Y? But U is at position 2? No: we have R as position 2. So the word must be S (1), R (2), then U, L, Y? That would be S-R-U-L-Y? Not a word.

Valid words starting with ""SR"": rare, but possible words include:
- ""SRSLY""? Not valid.
- ""SHARD"": S,H,A,R,D -> but A is forbidden? A is not allowed (from first guess feedback: A(x)). So invalid.
- ""SHRUG"": S,H,R,U,G -> letters: H, R (fixed at 2), U, G. Avoids forbidden? A, C, N, E, T, I, P are absent. H, U, G are new. So ""SHRUG"" could be an option.

However, note the structure: S (1) H (3) R (2)? No, wait: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: R? But in ""SHRUG"", the second letter is H? Actually, S-H-R-U-G -> so position 2 is H, but we need position 2 to be R. So it's not.

In our guess, the word must have exactly: [1][2][3][4][5] and we fix position 2 as R. So for ""SHRUG"", the positions would be:
- 1: S
- 2: H -> but we need it to be R? So that doesn't work.

Any word starting with ""SR"" that is English? For example:
- ""SERIF"" -> S,E,R,I,F -> E and I are forbidden? E and I are in forbidden list (from guess1 and guess2). So invalid.
- ""SORRY"" -> S,O,R,R,Y? This has double R? And the second letter is O? S-O-R-Y? No. Actually: S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). But we need second letter to be R. So invalid.

This is tricky. ""SR"" at the beginning is rare in English.

Now Option B: S at position 3 -> structure: ? R S ? ?

So, letter1 is unknown, then R at 2, S at 3, then two more letters.

Possible words:
- ""URBAN"" -> U,R,B,A,N -> but A and N are forbidden. Invalid.
- ""FROSH"" -> F,R,O,S,H -> avoids forbidden? F, R (fixed), O, S (at pos 3? Actually: F(1), R(2), O(3)? But we need S at pos 3? Here we have O at position 3. Invalid.
We need S at position 3? Wait: ""F R ?"", we need S at 3? Then the word is F, R, S, then two more.

Example: ""FRESH"" -> F,R,E,S,H -> E is forbidden? Yes (E(x) from first guess). Invalid.

- ""GRASP"" -> G,R,A,S,P -> A forbidden, P forbidden? P is forbidden from guess2 (P(x)). Invalid.
- ""DRUSE"" -> D,R,U,S,E -> E forbidden? Invalid.
- ""CRUST"" -> C and T forbidden? C and T are forbidden. Invalid.
- ""WREST"" -> W,R,E,S,T -> E and T forbidden. Invalid.
- ""HORSY"" -> H,O,R,S,Y -> O at 3? H(1),O(2)? No, position 2 is R? Actually: H(1),O(2),R(3),S(4),Y(5). So S is at position 4? That is option C, not B.

We are considering S at position 3.

Another example: ""FRIST"" (if valid) or ""FRISK""? 
- ""FRISK"" -> F,R,I,S,K -> but I is forbidden (I(x) from guess2). So invalid.

Perhaps ""BROS"" but that's 4 letters? Or ""BRUSH"": B,R,U,S,H. S is at position 4? So actually: B(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), H(5). So S at position 4? This is option C.

We are having a hard time finding a word with S at position 3. 

Now Option C: S at position 4 -> structure: ? R ? S ?

Possible words:
- ""BRUSH"" -> B,R,U,S,H -> letters: B, R (fixed), U, S (at 4), H. Avoids C,A,N,E,T,I,P? Yes: we haven't used B, U, H. So valid word? Yes.
- ""DRUSY"" -> not common? D-R-U-S-Y? But D,R,U,S,Y => avoids forbidden? D, U, Y are allowed. But is it a valid word? Maybe.
- Other: ""CRUSH"" -> C forbidden.
- ""FRESH"" -> E forbidden.
- ""WREST"" -> E forbidden.

Also, we don't know if any of these letters are beyond the forbidden set.

But we must choose one that tests new letters.

Alternative words: ""GRASP"" -> G,R,A,S,P -> A and P forbidden? Invalid.

Another: ""ORCIN"" -> contains N? Probably invalid.

But ""BRUSH"" seems a good candidate: letters B, R, U, S, H. We haven't encountered B, U, H before.

Moreover, we can get information on U and H as well.

We must note that we are not constrained by repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicate issues. However, we don't know if the word has duplicates.

But since we haven't seen duplicates, we can assume not? But not necessarily.

We might consider ""BROSY"" but that word might not be common. 

Another word: ""GROGS""? G,R,O,G,S -> S at position 5? But we need S at position 4? Actually: G(1), R(2), O(3), G(4), S(5) -> S at 5? But we know S cannot be at position 5 (from guess2: S at position 5 was marked as wrong position, meaning S is not at 5? But in the feedback, it was ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. So in the next guess, we can put S at position 4? Yes.

So S at position 4 is allowed.

Therefore, ""BRUSH"" (B, R, U, S, H) is a valid guess.

But are there other options? Like ""PRISM"" -> P is forbidden? So no.

""AROSE"" -> A and E forbidden.

So ""BRUSH"" seems good.

But what about vowels? We know A,E,I are not in the word (from feedback). And O,U are possibilities? In ""BRUSH"", we have U. We haven't tested U, so if U is in the word, we'll get feedback.

Similarly, H and B.

We might consider if there is a word that uses more common letters? The common letters left are O, L, D, etc. But ""BRUSH"" uses U and H which are less common? But we have to use S and R.

Another word: ""GROWS"" -> G,R,O,W,S -> S at position 5? But we cannot put S at position 5 because we know from previous feedback that position 5 is not where S is. So if we put S at 5, we will get S(x) because it's in the wrong position? No, we know S is in the word, but not at 5. So if we put S at 5, the feedback might be ""-"" for S? But we already know S is present, so if we put S again at 5, we risk getting feedback that it's not there? But actually, the feedback tells us per position.

But we are trying to put S at a new position? Yes.

In ""BRUSH"", we put S at position 4.

But we must put S somewhere. And we have to avoid position 5.

Alternatively, we could put S at position 1? That seems less common? We had a hard time finding words with S at 1 and R at 2.

Another word: ""SHIRE""? S,H,I,R,E -> I and E forbidden. Invalid.

""SHORL"" -> S,H,O,R,L -> and structure: S at 1, H at 2? We need R at position 2. So: 
- Position1: S
- Position2: H -> but must be R? So no.

We cannot change the position2.

So the only practical structures are S at position 3? We didn't find many, or S at position 4? Like ""BRUSH"" or ""DRUSE"" (but E forbidden).

""BROSY"" -> B,R,O,S,Y -> S is at position 4? Yes: B(1),R(2),O(3),S(4),Y(5). Avoids forbidden? B,R,O,S,Y -> no forbidden letters. Valid word? Meaning ""brotherlike"" or relating to bros? Maybe not common, but valid? We can check later.

Perhaps use ""BROWS"": B,R,O,W,S -> S at position 5? So invalid because position5? We cannot put S at 5.

So ""BROWS"" has S at 5? Not allowed.

Therefore, we'll go with ""BRUSH"".

But note: we have the letter U? We haven't tested U. Similarly, B and H.

We can get information on these letters.

There might be a word that uses S at position 4 and has more common letters? For example, O or L.

""GROSS"" -> G,R,O,S,S -> has double S? And S at position 4? Actually: G(1),R(2),O(3),S(4),S(5). But position 5 is S? And we know S cannot be at position 5? So putting S at position5 would give S(x) if the secret word doesn't have S at 5? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S at 5, it might be wrong? But the feedback will tell us.

But in ""GROSS"", we have S at 4 and 5. We avoid forbidden letters? G,R,O,S -> no forbidden? But S at 5? We don't know if it's allowed? Actually, the secret word might have only one S? Or two? We don't know.

But we are constrained: we must not put S at 5? Because we already know that position 5 is not S? Yes, from the previous feedback: when we put S at 5 in ""trips"", we got ""-"" meaning S is in the word but not at 5. So S is not at 5. Therefore, putting S at 5 in a new guess would be incorrect? But we are testing the letter at that position? We might get feedback that S is not at 5? But we already know that. So it would give an x for position5. But we are testing other positions.

Using ""GROSS"" would waste a position? Because S at 5 we know is wrong. So better to avoid.

Stick to words without S at 5.

Therefore, I choose ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H.

So the guess is ""brush"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Crane**: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → The second letter is R (correct position), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Trips**: T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(x), S(-) → The second letter R is correct, T, I, P are absent, and S is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed position**: R must be in the second position.
- **Present letter**: S must be in the word, but not in the fifth position (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, T, I, P cannot be in the word.
- **Task**: Guess a valid 5-letter word with R in position 2, S in position 1, 3, or 4, using only the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize words testing new common letters (e.g., B, U, H, O) to gather more feedback.
- After evaluating options, ""brush"" meets the criteria:
  - Position 2 = R (as required).
  - Position 4 = S (testing a new position for S).
  - Letters B, U, H are new and avoid the absent list.
- The word ""brush"" is valid and tests multiple possibilities.

<guess>brush</guess>",brush,"We are given:
- Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- Guess 2: trips -> Feedback: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)

From Guess 1:
- The second letter is R (correct and in position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2:
- The second letter R is again correct (as expected).
- T, I, P are not in the word (x). So we add T, I, P to the absent letters.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So S is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since we had S at the end in ""trips"").

So now we know:
- Forbidden letters (absent): C, A, N, E, T, I, P
- Present letters: S (but not in position 5) and R (in position 2)
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We also know:
- The letter S is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the second position is R, S cannot be there. So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We have only 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Contains S (since we know it's present) but not in position 5 (and not position 2, which is R). So S must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, P.

We have to use the available letters. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we must include S.

Important: We have two pieces of information: one correct letter position (R at 2) and one present letter in the wrong position (S, not at 5).

We should choose a word that tests new common letters to narrow down the possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tried: L, O, U, D, H, etc.

We must include S in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's think of words that fit: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And the word must contain S in one of positions 1,3,4.

Since we are constrained by the forbidden letters, let's think.

Possible scenarios:

Option A: S in position 1 -> word structure: S R ? ? ?

Option B: S in position 3 -> ? R S ? ?

Option C: S in position 4 -> ? R ? S ?

We need to fill the other positions with letters not in {C,A,N,E,T,I,P}.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

First, try Option A: S at position 1 -> ""S R ? ? ?""

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters from the available set, avoiding forbidden ones.

Examples: ""S R O W ?"", ""S R U B ?"", but let me see actual words.

- ""SURLY"" -> S,U,R,L,Y? But U is at position 2? No: we have R as position 2. So the word must be S (1), R (2), then U, L, Y? That would be S-R-U-L-Y? Not a word.

Valid words starting with ""SR"": rare, but possible words include:
- ""SRSLY""? Not valid.
- ""SHARD"": S,H,A,R,D -> but A is forbidden? A is not allowed (from first guess feedback: A(x)). So invalid.
- ""SHRUG"": S,H,R,U,G -> letters: H, R (fixed at 2), U, G. Avoids forbidden? A, C, N, E, T, I, P are absent. H, U, G are new. So ""SHRUG"" could be an option.

However, note the structure: S (1) H (3) R (2)? No, wait: 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: R? But in ""SHRUG"", the second letter is H? Actually, S-H-R-U-G -> so position 2 is H, but we need position 2 to be R. So it's not.

In our guess, the word must have exactly: [1][2][3][4][5] and we fix position 2 as R. So for ""SHRUG"", the positions would be:
- 1: S
- 2: H -> but we need it to be R? So that doesn't work.

Any word starting with ""SR"" that is English? For example:
- ""SERIF"" -> S,E,R,I,F -> E and I are forbidden? E and I are in forbidden list (from guess1 and guess2). So invalid.
- ""SORRY"" -> S,O,R,R,Y? This has double R? And the second letter is O? S-O-R-Y? No. Actually: S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). But we need second letter to be R. So invalid.

This is tricky. ""SR"" at the beginning is rare in English.

Now Option B: S at position 3 -> structure: ? R S ? ?

So, letter1 is unknown, then R at 2, S at 3, then two more letters.

Possible words:
- ""URBAN"" -> U,R,B,A,N -> but A and N are forbidden. Invalid.
- ""FROSH"" -> F,R,O,S,H -> avoids forbidden? F, R (fixed), O, S (at pos 3? Actually: F(1), R(2), O(3)? But we need S at pos 3? Here we have O at position 3. Invalid.
We need S at position 3? Wait: ""F R ?"", we need S at 3? Then the word is F, R, S, then two more.

Example: ""FRESH"" -> F,R,E,S,H -> E is forbidden? Yes (E(x) from first guess). Invalid.

- ""GRASP"" -> G,R,A,S,P -> A forbidden, P forbidden? P is forbidden from guess2 (P(x)). Invalid.
- ""DRUSE"" -> D,R,U,S,E -> E forbidden? Invalid.
- ""CRUST"" -> C and T forbidden? C and T are forbidden. Invalid.
- ""WREST"" -> W,R,E,S,T -> E and T forbidden. Invalid.
- ""HORSY"" -> H,O,R,S,Y -> O at 3? H(1),O(2)? No, position 2 is R? Actually: H(1),O(2),R(3),S(4),Y(5). So S is at position 4? That is option C, not B.

We are considering S at position 3.

Another example: ""FRIST"" (if valid) or ""FRISK""? 
- ""FRISK"" -> F,R,I,S,K -> but I is forbidden (I(x) from guess2). So invalid.

Perhaps ""BROS"" but that's 4 letters? Or ""BRUSH"": B,R,U,S,H. S is at position 4? So actually: B(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), H(5). So S at position 4? This is option C.

We are having a hard time finding a word with S at position 3. 

Now Option C: S at position 4 -> structure: ? R ? S ?

Possible words:
- ""BRUSH"" -> B,R,U,S,H -> letters: B, R (fixed), U, S (at 4), H. Avoids C,A,N,E,T,I,P? Yes: we haven't used B, U, H. So valid word? Yes.
- ""DRUSY"" -> not common? D-R-U-S-Y? But D,R,U,S,Y => avoids forbidden? D, U, Y are allowed. But is it a valid word? Maybe.
- Other: ""CRUSH"" -> C forbidden.
- ""FRESH"" -> E forbidden.
- ""WREST"" -> E forbidden.

Also, we don't know if any of these letters are beyond the forbidden set.

But we must choose one that tests new letters.

Alternative words: ""GRASP"" -> G,R,A,S,P -> A and P forbidden? Invalid.

Another: ""ORCIN"" -> contains N? Probably invalid.

But ""BRUSH"" seems a good candidate: letters B, R, U, S, H. We haven't encountered B, U, H before.

Moreover, we can get information on U and H as well.

We must note that we are not constrained by repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicate issues. However, we don't know if the word has duplicates.

But since we haven't seen duplicates, we can assume not? But not necessarily.

We might consider ""BROSY"" but that word might not be common. 

Another word: ""GROGS""? G,R,O,G,S -> S at position 5? But we need S at position 4? Actually: G(1), R(2), O(3), G(4), S(5) -> S at 5? But we know S cannot be at position 5 (from guess2: S at position 5 was marked as wrong position, meaning S is not at 5? But in the feedback, it was ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. So in the next guess, we can put S at position 4? Yes.

So S at position 4 is allowed.

Therefore, ""BRUSH"" (B, R, U, S, H) is a valid guess.

But are there other options? Like ""PRISM"" -> P is forbidden? So no.

""AROSE"" -> A and E forbidden.

So ""BRUSH"" seems good.

But what about vowels? We know A,E,I are not in the word (from feedback). And O,U are possibilities? In ""BRUSH"", we have U. We haven't tested U, so if U is in the word, we'll get feedback.

Similarly, H and B.

We might consider if there is a word that uses more common letters? The common letters left are O, L, D, etc. But ""BRUSH"" uses U and H which are less common? But we have to use S and R.

Another word: ""GROWS"" -> G,R,O,W,S -> S at position 5? But we cannot put S at position 5 because we know from previous feedback that position 5 is not where S is. So if we put S at 5, we will get S(x) because it's in the wrong position? No, we know S is in the word, but not at 5. So if we put S at 5, the feedback might be ""-"" for S? But we already know S is present, so if we put S again at 5, we risk getting feedback that it's not there? But actually, the feedback tells us per position.

But we are trying to put S at a new position? Yes.

In ""BRUSH"", we put S at position 4.

But we must put S somewhere. And we have to avoid position 5.

Alternatively, we could put S at position 1? That seems less common? We had a hard time finding words with S at 1 and R at 2.

Another word: ""SHIRE""? S,H,I,R,E -> I and E forbidden. Invalid.

""SHORL"" -> S,H,O,R,L -> and structure: S at 1, H at 2? We need R at position 2. So: 
- Position1: S
- Position2: H -> but must be R? So no.

We cannot change the position2.

So the only practical structures are S at position 3? We didn't find many, or S at position 4? Like ""BRUSH"" or ""DRUSE"" (but E forbidden).

""BROSY"" -> B,R,O,S,Y -> S is at position 4? Yes: B(1),R(2),O(3),S(4),Y(5). Avoids forbidden? B,R,O,S,Y -> no forbidden letters. Valid word? Meaning ""brotherlike"" or relating to bros? Maybe not common, but valid? We can check later.

Perhaps use ""BROWS"": B,R,O,W,S -> S at position 5? So invalid because position5? We cannot put S at 5.

So ""BROWS"" has S at 5? Not allowed.

Therefore, we'll go with ""BRUSH"".

But note: we have the letter U? We haven't tested U. Similarly, B and H.

We can get information on these letters.

There might be a word that uses S at position 4 and has more common letters? For example, O or L.

""GROSS"" -> G,R,O,S,S -> has double S? And S at position 4? Actually: G(1),R(2),O(3),S(4),S(5). But position 5 is S? And we know S cannot be at position 5? So putting S at position5 would give S(x) if the secret word doesn't have S at 5? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S at 5, it might be wrong? But the feedback will tell us.

But in ""GROSS"", we have S at 4 and 5. We avoid forbidden letters? G,R,O,S -> no forbidden? But S at 5? We don't know if it's allowed? Actually, the secret word might have only one S? Or two? We don't know.

But we are constrained: we must not put S at 5? Because we already know that position 5 is not S? Yes, from the previous feedback: when we put S at 5 in ""trips"", we got ""-"" meaning S is in the word but not at 5. So S is not at 5. Therefore, putting S at 5 in a new guess would be incorrect? But we are testing the letter at that position? We might get feedback that S is not at 5? But we already know that. So it would give an x for position5. But we are testing other positions.

Using ""GROSS"" would waste a position? Because S at 5 we know is wrong. So better to avoid.

Stick to words without S at 5.

Therefore, I choose ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H.

So the guess is ""brush"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Crane**: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → The second letter is R (correct position), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Trips**: T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(x), S(-) → The second letter R is correct, T, I, P are absent, and S is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed position**: R must be in the second position.
- **Present letter**: S must be in the word, but not in the fifth position (so positions 1, 3, or 4).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, T, I, P cannot be in the word.
- **Task**: Guess a valid 5-letter word with R in position 2, S in position 1, 3, or 4, using only the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize words testing new common letters (e.g., B, U, H, O) to gather more feedback.
- After evaluating options, ""brush"" meets the criteria:
  - Position 2 = R (as required).
  - Position 4 = S (testing a new position for S).
  - Letters B, U, H are new and avoid the absent list.
- The word ""brush"" is valid and tests multiple possibilities.",Guess 3: brush -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
