I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many words.

The English language has letters that are frequently used. According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are often vowels like E, A, I, O, U and consonants like T, N, S, R, H. But for Wordle, I should consider the letter frequency specifically in 5-letter words.

I recall that for Wordle, a good starting word often includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular because they cover several high-frequency letters.

Let me quickly think about the frequency: E is very common, followed by A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.

A standard approach is to have at least two vowels and three consonants.

For example, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's A and E as vowels, and C, R, N as consonants. All are quite common.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S and T are common, A and E vowels.

Since I need to output my guess, I'll go with one of these. Let me choose ""CRANE"" for now.

But I should ensure ""CRANE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is – it means a type of bird or a machine for lifting.

Another good one is ""RAISE"" with R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants R and S.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" is better because it has more vowels, which might help identify vowel positions.

Let me check some optimal starting words. From Wordle solvers, ""SLATE"" is often recommended, but I can use that.

To be systematic, I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step within the <thinking> tags, and then output the guess as specified.

The user said ""Make your first guess"", so I just need to provide the word.

Since it's the first guess, there's no feedback to analyze, so my thinking is straightforward: choose a word with high letter frequency to get useful feedback.

Response format: First, within <thinking> tags, I add my thought process. Then, in the guess tags.

So for this:

I need to make the first guess. With no prior information, I should choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the potential for informative feedback.

As this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. Therefore, I need to choose a starting word that maximizes the information gain for subsequent guesses. 
Ideal starting words include common letters with high frequency in English 5-letter words, especially a mix of vowels (e.g., A, E, I, O) and consonants (e.g., R, S, T, N, L). 
After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains frequent letters: C, R, A, N, E (all within the top 10 most common English letters).
- It uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants, providing good coverage.
- It avoids repeating letters, which helps test unique characters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it there and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- Letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Has R as the second letter (since we know that position is fixed).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position (because in the first guess, A was in the third and was misplaced).
- Avoids using C, N, E (since they are absent).

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think about possible positions for A:
- It cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).
- It could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has R in position 2 and contains A.

We should avoid repeating the absent letters (C, N, E) and also avoid the positions we know are wrong for A.

We can try to use other common letters to fill the remaining positions: for example, S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Must have R in the second position: _ R _ _ _

And must include A (but not in the third position).

Let's brainstorm some words:
- TRACK? But C is absent, so no.
- BRASS? But S is new, and we have A and S. Also, we have two S's? But let's see: B R A S S -> but A is in the third position? We cannot put A in third because that was the position we had in the first guess and it was misplaced. So in BRASS, A is in third? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in third.

We must avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the word, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- A in position 1: AR... (like ARRAY? but we have to avoid E and N? Array has A and R, but then A is first, R second. Then we need the rest. Array has two A's? and Y. But we don't know about Y. Also, we have to avoid E? Array has no E, but it has Y. But we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we have to consider the feedback: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. The feedback for A was a single '-' so if there is only one A, then we know it's not in third. But if there are two, then one might be in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In the first guess, we had A in third and it was present but wrong position. That means that the word has at least one A, and it is not in the third position. It doesn't tell us about other positions. So if we put A in third again, it might be that there is another A that is in the correct position? But the feedback for that position would then be ✓ if it were correct? Or if we put A in third and there is an A in the word but not in third, we might get a '-' again? But we know that the word does have an A, and it is not in the third position. So if we put A in third again, we would get a '-' again? Because the A is in the word but not in that position. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. So to avoid wasting a guess, we should avoid putting A in the third position until we have more information.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should avoid the third position for A.

So, let's try to put A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in position 1 -> A R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters that are not C, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.

We can try: A R T _ _ 

But we need a word. ART? 5 letters: ART is 3, so we need 5-letter words.

Examples:
- ARTY? Not 5 letters.
- ARTSY? 5 letters? No, that's 5: A-R-T-S-Y -> ARTSY? But is that a word? It might be informal. Better to use common words.

Common words starting with AR:
- ARBOR? But B and O? And R is already in second. ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have R at the end? And we know R is in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicates. Also, O is new. But we have to avoid E, C, N. ARBOR has O and B, which are new. Also, it has two R's? The second letter is R, and the last letter is R. So if the word has two R's, that's possible? The feedback for the first guess only told us about the R in the second position being correct, but it didn't say anything about other R's. So duplicates are possible.

But let's see: ARBOR: 
- A: we are putting in first, which is a new position.
- R: second, correct.
- B: new letter.
- O: new letter.
- R: again, so if the word has only one R, then this R might be absent? But we know the word has at least one R (in second position). So if we put an extra R, it might be that the word has two R's, or it might not.

We want to test new letters, so maybe avoid repeating R for now? Because we already know R is in the word.

Similarly, we can try other words.

Another word: AROMA? A R O M A -> but then A is repeated? We have A in first and fifth. The feedback for the first guess had A in third and it was misplaced, so if the word has two A's, then one might be in first or fifth? But we don't know. Also, we are testing O and M.

But let's see: AROMA: 
- A in first: if the word has an A, and it's not in third, it could be in first? 
- R in second: correct.
- O in third: new.
- M in fourth: new.
- A in fifth: new position for A.

This might be acceptable.

But we have to avoid E, C, N, which we are.

Another option: A in position 4: _ R _ A _

We need a word with R in second and A in fourth.

Examples: 
- GRAAL? Not common.
- ORCAS? But C is absent? ORCAS has C, which is absent. So no.
- TRAPS: T R A P S -> but A is in third? We are trying to put A in fourth? In TRAPS, the letters are: T (1), R (2), A (3), P (4), S (5). So A is in third, which we want to avoid.

We want A in fourth: so the fourth letter is A.

Words: 
- _ R _ A _
Examples: 
- BRAS? 4 letters.
- 5 letters: BRAVA? Not common.
- DRAMA: D R A M A -> but A is in third and fifth? We are trying to put A in fourth? Drama: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). So A is in third and fifth. We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.

We need a word where A is in fourth position: 
- OPERA? But O P E R A -> E is absent? We cannot use E.

Without E: 
- FORA? Not 5 letters.
- MORAY? M O R A Y -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need the second letter to be R.

So: ? R ? A ?

Examples: 
- TRADE? But E is absent and D is new. Also, A is in fourth? T R A D E -> A is in third? Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> A is in third, which we avoid.

Another: GRABS? G R A B S -> A is in third? Same issue.

We need A in fourth: so the third letter is not A.

Examples: 
- WRAPT? W R A P T -> A is in third? No, in WRAPT: W(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), T(5) -> A is in third.

It's hard to find words with R in second and A in fourth.

Let me think: 
- FRATS? F R A T S -> A in third.
- PRATS? same.

How about: 
- CROAK? But C is absent.
- GROAN? But N and O? N is absent.

Another: PROUD? P R O U D -> no A.

We need A in fourth: so the word must have the pattern: _ R _ A _

Possible words: 
- TRAG? not 5.
- URASE? not common.
- Maybe it's better to avoid this for now.

Option: A in position 5: _ R _ _ A

Words ending with A, with R in second.

Examples: 
- OPERA? O P E R A -> but E is absent.
- URBAN? U R B A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? Positions: U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> so A is in fourth, not fifth.

We want A in fifth: 
- CORDA? C and E? absent.
- VERSA? E and S? E absent.

Without E: 
- BARRA? Not common.
- PARRA? Not common.
- SORRA? Not common.

Common words: 
- EXTRA? E and X? E absent.
- ULTRA? U L T R A -> but R is in fourth? We need R in second.

So: _ R _ _ A

Examples: 
- ORD? not 5.
- ARDEB? not common.
- ARECA? A R E C A -> E and C absent? And A is first and fifth? But we have A in first? We are trying to put A only in fifth? But the word has A in first and fifth? But we know the word has at least one A, so if we put A in fifth, that's fine.

But ARECA: A(1), R(2), E(3), C(4), A(5). But E and C are absent, so we cannot use that.

Another: BRASA? B R A S A -> A in third and fifth? We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.

We are having difficulty finding a word with R in second and A not in third.

Perhaps we can put A in first: A R _ _ _

Let me list some common words starting with AR that avoid C, N, E.

- ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have two R's? And O and B are new. Also, the word has 5 letters. But we are repeating R, which we already know is in the word, so it might not be optimal for testing new letters.

- ARGON: A R G O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

- ARSON: A R S O N -> N is absent? No.

- ARTEL: A R T E L -> E is absent? No.

- ARTIS: not common.

- ARVOS: A R V O S -> no E, C, N. So letters: A, R, V, O, S. We are testing V, O, S.

This could be a candidate: ARVOS? But is it a valid word? I think ""arvo"" is Australian slang for afternoon, and ""arvos"" might be plural? But let's assume we can use it, or better to use a more common word.

Another: AROMA: A R O M A -> as I thought earlier. Letters: A, R, O, M. We are testing O and M, and we have A in first and fifth? But the word has two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's.

But we can use it: AROMA.

Another common word: AROHA? Not English.

ATRIA: A T R I A -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need R in second.

So: A R ? ? ?

Other options: 
- ARTSY: A R T S Y -> avoids C, N, E. Tests T, S, Y.
- ARRAY: A R R A Y -> has two R's and two A's. We are testing Y, but repeating R and A.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ARTSY: new letters T, S, Y.

ARTSY is a valid word? Meaning artistic, yes.

Similarly, we can use ARTSY.

Another: PARTS? P A R T S -> but R is in third? No, P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). So R is in third, not second.

We need R in second.

So let's go with ARTSY: A R T S Y

But we are putting A in first? That's a new position. And we are testing T, S, Y.

We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. So if we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A, which is still informative.

Similarly, we can try a word with A in fourth.

But earlier it was hard. What about: DRABS? D R A B S -> A in third? Avoid.

How about: GRABS? Same.

Another idea: we can try a word that has A in fourth, but with R in second.

For example: WORDS? No A.

Perhaps: FRATS? But A in third.

I found: PRATS? Same.

What about: BEARD? B E A R D -> E is absent? And R is in fourth? Not second.

We need R in second.

Let's search for words with R in second and A in fourth: 
- TRADE: has E? and A in third? 
- GRADE: G R A D E -> A in third, E at end? E absent.

Without E: 
- CRAMP? C absent.
- DRAMA: D R A M A -> A in third and fifth? So A in third? We avoid.

But in DRAMA, if we put A in third, we know it's not correct, but we might get a '-' if there is another A? But we are trying to avoid that position.

Perhaps we should not be too strict. Since we know A is not in third, if we put it in third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So it's better to try a different position.

So back to A in first: ARTSY.

Or A in fifth: but we couldn't find a common word without E, C, N.

Another word: ULTRA? U L T R A -> R in fourth.

Not second.

What about: BARMY? B A R M Y -> R in third.

No.

Perhaps: KARMA? K A R M A -> R in third.

No.

So let's go with ARTSY or AROMA.

I think ARTSY is better because it tests three new letters: T, S, Y.

AROMA tests O and M, but has two A's, which might not be efficient.

So I choose ARTSY.

But let's confirm: ARTSY: A in first, R in second (correct), T in third, S in fourth, Y in fifth.

We are testing A in first, T, S, Y.

If the word has A in first, we get a ✓ for A. If not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in first, we get a '-', and then we know it must be in fourth or fifth (since not in third).

Similarly, T, S, Y are new.

So it's a good guess.

Another common word: PARTS? But R not in second.

Or SMART? S M A R T -> R in fourth.

No.

So ARTSY it is.

But is ARTSY a valid word? Yes, meaning having the qualities of art.

We can also consider: ARTIS? Not common.

Or ARILS? A R I L S -> tests I, L, S.

But ARTSY is fine.

To have more common letters, we can try: ARISE? But E is absent? ARISE: A R I S E -> E is at the end, but we know E is absent from the feedback? In the first guess, E was guessed and was absent, so we cannot use E.

So ARISE is invalid because it has E.

Similarly, ARIAS? A R I A S -> has two A's? And I and S. But A in first and fourth? We are testing I and S.

But ARTSY has T, S, Y which are common.

Another: ARSON: A R S O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

So ARSON is out.

Therefore, I think ARTSY is a good choice.

So second guess: ARTSY

But let's write it: A R T S Y

Now, for the response format.
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not in the third position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (and not in the first or fifth positions from this guess, though other positions are possible).
- Letters C, N, and E are absent and must be avoided in future guesses.
- For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word with R in the second position, including A (but not in the third position), and avoiding C, N, E.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, Y) in untried positions.

Considering possible words:
- A in position 1: Words like ""ARTSY"" (A, R, T, S, Y) fit well, as they test new letters (T, S, Y) and avoid problematic positions for A.
- A in position 4 or 5: Fewer common options exist without using forbidden letters (e.g., ""DRAMA"" has A in the third position, which is invalid; ""ULTRA"" has R in the wrong position; ""OPERA"" contains E).

""ARTSY"" is a strong choice because:
- It places R correctly in the second position.
- It places A in the first position (a new, untried position), which will clarify if A is in position 1 or not.
- It introduces three new common letters (T, S, Y) to test for presence and position.
- It avoids C, N, E and repeats no letters from the first guess except the known R and A.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>ARTSY</guess>",ARTSY,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it there and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- Letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Has R as the second letter (since we know that position is fixed).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position (because in the first guess, A was in the third and was misplaced).
- Avoids using C, N, E (since they are absent).

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think about possible positions for A:
- It cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).
- It could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has R in position 2 and contains A.

We should avoid repeating the absent letters (C, N, E) and also avoid the positions we know are wrong for A.

We can try to use other common letters to fill the remaining positions: for example, S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Must have R in the second position: _ R _ _ _

And must include A (but not in the third position).

Let's brainstorm some words:
- TRACK? But C is absent, so no.
- BRASS? But S is new, and we have A and S. Also, we have two S's? But let's see: B R A S S -> but A is in the third position? We cannot put A in third because that was the position we had in the first guess and it was misplaced. So in BRASS, A is in third? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in third.

We must avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the word, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- A in position 1: AR... (like ARRAY? but we have to avoid E and N? Array has A and R, but then A is first, R second. Then we need the rest. Array has two A's? and Y. But we don't know about Y. Also, we have to avoid E? Array has no E, but it has Y. But we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we have to consider the feedback: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. The feedback for A was a single '-' so if there is only one A, then we know it's not in third. But if there are two, then one might be in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In the first guess, we had A in third and it was present but wrong position. That means that the word has at least one A, and it is not in the third position. It doesn't tell us about other positions. So if we put A in third again, it might be that there is another A that is in the correct position? But the feedback for that position would then be ✓ if it were correct? Or if we put A in third and there is an A in the word but not in third, we might get a '-' again? But we know that the word does have an A, and it is not in the third position. So if we put A in third again, we would get a '-' again? Because the A is in the word but not in that position. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. So to avoid wasting a guess, we should avoid putting A in the third position until we have more information.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should avoid the third position for A.

So, let's try to put A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in position 1 -> A R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters that are not C, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.

We can try: A R T _ _ 

But we need a word. ART? 5 letters: ART is 3, so we need 5-letter words.

Examples:
- ARTY? Not 5 letters.
- ARTSY? 5 letters? No, that's 5: A-R-T-S-Y -> ARTSY? But is that a word? It might be informal. Better to use common words.

Common words starting with AR:
- ARBOR? But B and O? And R is already in second. ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have R at the end? And we know R is in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicates. Also, O is new. But we have to avoid E, C, N. ARBOR has O and B, which are new. Also, it has two R's? The second letter is R, and the last letter is R. So if the word has two R's, that's possible? The feedback for the first guess only told us about the R in the second position being correct, but it didn't say anything about other R's. So duplicates are possible.

But let's see: ARBOR: 
- A: we are putting in first, which is a new position.
- R: second, correct.
- B: new letter.
- O: new letter.
- R: again, so if the word has only one R, then this R might be absent? But we know the word has at least one R (in second position). So if we put an extra R, it might be that the word has two R's, or it might not.

We want to test new letters, so maybe avoid repeating R for now? Because we already know R is in the word.

Similarly, we can try other words.

Another word: AROMA? A R O M A -> but then A is repeated? We have A in first and fifth. The feedback for the first guess had A in third and it was misplaced, so if the word has two A's, then one might be in first or fifth? But we don't know. Also, we are testing O and M.

But let's see: AROMA: 
- A in first: if the word has an A, and it's not in third, it could be in first? 
- R in second: correct.
- O in third: new.
- M in fourth: new.
- A in fifth: new position for A.

This might be acceptable.

But we have to avoid E, C, N, which we are.

Another option: A in position 4: _ R _ A _

We need a word with R in second and A in fourth.

Examples: 
- GRAAL? Not common.
- ORCAS? But C is absent? ORCAS has C, which is absent. So no.
- TRAPS: T R A P S -> but A is in third? We are trying to put A in fourth? In TRAPS, the letters are: T (1), R (2), A (3), P (4), S (5). So A is in third, which we want to avoid.

We want A in fourth: so the fourth letter is A.

Words: 
- _ R _ A _
Examples: 
- BRAS? 4 letters.
- 5 letters: BRAVA? Not common.
- DRAMA: D R A M A -> but A is in third and fifth? We are trying to put A in fourth? Drama: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). So A is in third and fifth. We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.

We need a word where A is in fourth position: 
- OPERA? But O P E R A -> E is absent? We cannot use E.

Without E: 
- FORA? Not 5 letters.
- MORAY? M O R A Y -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need the second letter to be R.

So: ? R ? A ?

Examples: 
- TRADE? But E is absent and D is new. Also, A is in fourth? T R A D E -> A is in third? Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> A is in third, which we avoid.

Another: GRABS? G R A B S -> A is in third? Same issue.

We need A in fourth: so the third letter is not A.

Examples: 
- WRAPT? W R A P T -> A is in third? No, in WRAPT: W(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), T(5) -> A is in third.

It's hard to find words with R in second and A in fourth.

Let me think: 
- FRATS? F R A T S -> A in third.
- PRATS? same.

How about: 
- CROAK? But C is absent.
- GROAN? But N and O? N is absent.

Another: PROUD? P R O U D -> no A.

We need A in fourth: so the word must have the pattern: _ R _ A _

Possible words: 
- TRAG? not 5.
- URASE? not common.
- Maybe it's better to avoid this for now.

Option: A in position 5: _ R _ _ A

Words ending with A, with R in second.

Examples: 
- OPERA? O P E R A -> but E is absent.
- URBAN? U R B A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? Positions: U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> so A is in fourth, not fifth.

We want A in fifth: 
- CORDA? C and E? absent.
- VERSA? E and S? E absent.

Without E: 
- BARRA? Not common.
- PARRA? Not common.
- SORRA? Not common.

Common words: 
- EXTRA? E and X? E absent.
- ULTRA? U L T R A -> but R is in fourth? We need R in second.

So: _ R _ _ A

Examples: 
- ORD? not 5.
- ARDEB? not common.
- ARECA? A R E C A -> E and C absent? And A is first and fifth? But we have A in first? We are trying to put A only in fifth? But the word has A in first and fifth? But we know the word has at least one A, so if we put A in fifth, that's fine.

But ARECA: A(1), R(2), E(3), C(4), A(5). But E and C are absent, so we cannot use that.

Another: BRASA? B R A S A -> A in third and fifth? We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.

We are having difficulty finding a word with R in second and A not in third.

Perhaps we can put A in first: A R _ _ _

Let me list some common words starting with AR that avoid C, N, E.

- ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have two R's? And O and B are new. Also, the word has 5 letters. But we are repeating R, which we already know is in the word, so it might not be optimal for testing new letters.

- ARGON: A R G O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

- ARSON: A R S O N -> N is absent? No.

- ARTEL: A R T E L -> E is absent? No.

- ARTIS: not common.

- ARVOS: A R V O S -> no E, C, N. So letters: A, R, V, O, S. We are testing V, O, S.

This could be a candidate: ARVOS? But is it a valid word? I think ""arvo"" is Australian slang for afternoon, and ""arvos"" might be plural? But let's assume we can use it, or better to use a more common word.

Another: AROMA: A R O M A -> as I thought earlier. Letters: A, R, O, M. We are testing O and M, and we have A in first and fifth? But the word has two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's.

But we can use it: AROMA.

Another common word: AROHA? Not English.

ATRIA: A T R I A -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need R in second.

So: A R ? ? ?

Other options: 
- ARTSY: A R T S Y -> avoids C, N, E. Tests T, S, Y.
- ARRAY: A R R A Y -> has two R's and two A's. We are testing Y, but repeating R and A.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ARTSY: new letters T, S, Y.

ARTSY is a valid word? Meaning artistic, yes.

Similarly, we can use ARTSY.

Another: PARTS? P A R T S -> but R is in third? No, P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). So R is in third, not second.

We need R in second.

So let's go with ARTSY: A R T S Y

But we are putting A in first? That's a new position. And we are testing T, S, Y.

We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. So if we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A, which is still informative.

Similarly, we can try a word with A in fourth.

But earlier it was hard. What about: DRABS? D R A B S -> A in third? Avoid.

How about: GRABS? Same.

Another idea: we can try a word that has A in fourth, but with R in second.

For example: WORDS? No A.

Perhaps: FRATS? But A in third.

I found: PRATS? Same.

What about: BEARD? B E A R D -> E is absent? And R is in fourth? Not second.

We need R in second.

Let's search for words with R in second and A in fourth: 
- TRADE: has E? and A in third? 
- GRADE: G R A D E -> A in third, E at end? E absent.

Without E: 
- CRAMP? C absent.
- DRAMA: D R A M A -> A in third and fifth? So A in third? We avoid.

But in DRAMA, if we put A in third, we know it's not correct, but we might get a '-' if there is another A? But we are trying to avoid that position.

Perhaps we should not be too strict. Since we know A is not in third, if we put it in third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So it's better to try a different position.

So back to A in first: ARTSY.

Or A in fifth: but we couldn't find a common word without E, C, N.

Another word: ULTRA? U L T R A -> R in fourth.

Not second.

What about: BARMY? B A R M Y -> R in third.

No.

Perhaps: KARMA? K A R M A -> R in third.

No.

So let's go with ARTSY or AROMA.

I think ARTSY is better because it tests three new letters: T, S, Y.

AROMA tests O and M, but has two A's, which might not be efficient.

So I choose ARTSY.

But let's confirm: ARTSY: A in first, R in second (correct), T in third, S in fourth, Y in fifth.

We are testing A in first, T, S, Y.

If the word has A in first, we get a ✓ for A. If not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in first, we get a '-', and then we know it must be in fourth or fifth (since not in third).

Similarly, T, S, Y are new.

So it's a good guess.

Another common word: PARTS? But R not in second.

Or SMART? S M A R T -> R in fourth.

No.

So ARTSY it is.

But is ARTSY a valid word? Yes, meaning having the qualities of art.

We can also consider: ARTIS? Not common.

Or ARILS? A R I L S -> tests I, L, S.

But ARTSY is fine.

To have more common letters, we can try: ARISE? But E is absent? ARISE: A R I S E -> E is at the end, but we know E is absent from the feedback? In the first guess, E was guessed and was absent, so we cannot use E.

So ARISE is invalid because it has E.

Similarly, ARIAS? A R I A S -> has two A's? And I and S. But A in first and fourth? We are testing I and S.

But ARTSY has T, S, Y which are common.

Another: ARSON: A R S O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

So ARSON is out.

Therefore, I think ARTSY is a good choice.

So second guess: ARTSY

But let's write it: A R T S Y

Now, for the response format.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not in the third position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (and not in the first or fifth positions from this guess, though other positions are possible).
- Letters C, N, and E are absent and must be avoided in future guesses.
- For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word with R in the second position, including A (but not in the third position), and avoiding C, N, E.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, Y) in untried positions.

Considering possible words:
- A in position 1: Words like ""ARTSY"" (A, R, T, S, Y) fit well, as they test new letters (T, S, Y) and avoid problematic positions for A.
- A in position 4 or 5: Fewer common options exist without using forbidden letters (e.g., ""DRAMA"" has A in the third position, which is invalid; ""ULTRA"" has R in the wrong position; ""OPERA"" contains E).

""ARTSY"" is a strong choice because:
- It places R correctly in the second position.
- It places A in the first position (a new, untried position), which will clarify if A is in position 1 or not.
- It introduces three new common letters (T, S, Y) to test for presence and position.
- It avoids C, N, E and repeats no letters from the first guess except the known R and A.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BROAD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many words.

The English language has letters that are frequently used. According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are often vowels like E, A, I, O, U and consonants like T, N, S, R, H. But for Wordle, I should consider the letter frequency specifically in 5-letter words.

I recall that for Wordle, a good starting word often includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular because they cover several high-frequency letters.

Let me quickly think about the frequency: E is very common, followed by A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.

A standard approach is to have at least two vowels and three consonants.

For example, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that's A and E as vowels, and C, R, N as consonants. All are quite common.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S and T are common, A and E vowels.

Since I need to output my guess, I'll go with one of these. Let me choose ""CRANE"" for now.

But I should ensure ""CRANE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is – it means a type of bird or a machine for lifting.

Another good one is ""RAISE"" with R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants R and S.

Perhaps ""RAISE"" is better because it has more vowels, which might help identify vowel positions.

Let me check some optimal starting words. From Wordle solvers, ""SLATE"" is often recommended, but I can use that.

To be systematic, I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Now, for the response format, I need to think step by step within the <thinking> tags, and then output the guess as specified.

The user said ""Make your first guess"", so I just need to provide the word.

Since it's the first guess, there's no feedback to analyze, so my thinking is straightforward: choose a word with high letter frequency to get useful feedback.

Response format: First, within <thinking> tags, I add my thought process. Then, in the guess tags.

So for this:

<thinking>
I need to make the first guess. With no prior information, I should choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the potential for informative feedback. Common letters include vowels like A and E, and consonants like R, S, T, N. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are good choices as they cover multiple high-frequency letters. I'll start with ""CRANE"" because it has a good balance.
</thinking>
<guess>CRANE</guess>

Yes.<thinking>
As this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. Therefore, I need to choose a starting word that maximizes the information gain for subsequent guesses. 
Ideal starting words include common letters with high frequency in English 5-letter words, especially a mix of vowels (e.g., A, E, I, O) and consonants (e.g., R, S, T, N, L). 
After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains frequent letters: C, R, A, N, E (all within the top 10 most common English letters).
- It uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants, providing good coverage.
- It avoids repeating letters, which helps test unique characters.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it there and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- Letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Has R as the second letter (since we know that position is fixed).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position (because in the first guess, A was in the third and was misplaced).
- Avoids using C, N, E (since they are absent).

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Let's think about possible positions for A:
- It cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).
- It could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has R in position 2 and contains A.

We should avoid repeating the absent letters (C, N, E) and also avoid the positions we know are wrong for A.

We can try to use other common letters to fill the remaining positions: for example, S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Must have R in the second position: _ R _ _ _

And must include A (but not in the third position).

Let's brainstorm some words:
- TRACK? But C is absent, so no.
- BRASS? But S is new, and we have A and S. Also, we have two S's? But let's see: B R A S S -> but A is in the third position? We cannot put A in third because that was the position we had in the first guess and it was misplaced. So in BRASS, A is in third? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in third.

We must avoid putting A in the third position.

So, for the word, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- A in position 1: AR... (like ARRAY? but we have to avoid E and N? Array has A and R, but then A is first, R second. Then we need the rest. Array has two A's? and Y. But we don't know about Y. Also, we have to avoid E? Array has no E, but it has Y. But we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we have to consider the feedback: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. The feedback for A was a single '-' so if there is only one A, then we know it's not in third. But if there are two, then one might be in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In the first guess, we had A in third and it was present but wrong position. That means that the word has at least one A, and it is not in the third position. It doesn't tell us about other positions. So if we put A in third again, it might be that there is another A that is in the correct position? But the feedback for that position would then be ✓ if it were correct? Or if we put A in third and there is an A in the word but not in third, we might get a '-' again? But we know that the word does have an A, and it is not in the third position. So if we put A in third again, we would get a '-' again? Because the A is in the word but not in that position. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. So to avoid wasting a guess, we should avoid putting A in the third position until we have more information.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should avoid the third position for A.

So, let's try to put A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in position 1 -> A R _ _ _
We need to fill the last three positions with letters that are not C, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.

We can try: A R T _ _ 

But we need a word. ART? 5 letters: ART is 3, so we need 5-letter words.

Examples:
- ARTY? Not 5 letters.
- ARTSY? 5 letters? No, that's 5: A-R-T-S-Y -> ARTSY? But is that a word? It might be informal. Better to use common words.

Common words starting with AR:
- ARBOR? But B and O? And R is already in second. ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have R at the end? And we know R is in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicates. Also, O is new. But we have to avoid E, C, N. ARBOR has O and B, which are new. Also, it has two R's? The second letter is R, and the last letter is R. So if the word has two R's, that's possible? The feedback for the first guess only told us about the R in the second position being correct, but it didn't say anything about other R's. So duplicates are possible.

But let's see: ARBOR: 
- A: we are putting in first, which is a new position.
- R: second, correct.
- B: new letter.
- O: new letter.
- R: again, so if the word has only one R, then this R might be absent? But we know the word has at least one R (in second position). So if we put an extra R, it might be that the word has two R's, or it might not.

We want to test new letters, so maybe avoid repeating R for now? Because we already know R is in the word.

Similarly, we can try other words.

Another word: AROMA? A R O M A -> but then A is repeated? We have A in first and fifth. The feedback for the first guess had A in third and it was misplaced, so if the word has two A's, then one might be in first or fifth? But we don't know. Also, we are testing O and M.

But let's see: AROMA: 
- A in first: if the word has an A, and it's not in third, it could be in first? 
- R in second: correct.
- O in third: new.
- M in fourth: new.
- A in fifth: new position for A.

This might be acceptable.

But we have to avoid E, C, N, which we are.

Another option: A in position 4: _ R _ A _

We need a word with R in second and A in fourth.

Examples: 
- GRAAL? Not common.
- ORCAS? But C is absent? ORCAS has C, which is absent. So no.
- TRAPS: T R A P S -> but A is in third? We are trying to put A in fourth? In TRAPS, the letters are: T (1), R (2), A (3), P (4), S (5). So A is in third, which we want to avoid.

We want A in fourth: so the fourth letter is A.

Words: 
- _ R _ A _
Examples: 
- BRAS? 4 letters.
- 5 letters: BRAVA? Not common.
- DRAMA: D R A M A -> but A is in third and fifth? We are trying to put A in fourth? Drama: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). So A is in third and fifth. We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.

We need a word where A is in fourth position: 
- OPERA? But O P E R A -> E is absent? We cannot use E.

Without E: 
- FORA? Not 5 letters.
- MORAY? M O R A Y -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need the second letter to be R.

So: ? R ? A ?

Examples: 
- TRADE? But E is absent and D is new. Also, A is in fourth? T R A D E -> A is in third? Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> A is in third, which we avoid.

Another: GRABS? G R A B S -> A is in third? Same issue.

We need A in fourth: so the third letter is not A.

Examples: 
- WRAPT? W R A P T -> A is in third? No, in WRAPT: W(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), T(5) -> A is in third.

It's hard to find words with R in second and A in fourth.

Let me think: 
- FRATS? F R A T S -> A in third.
- PRATS? same.

How about: 
- CROAK? But C is absent.
- GROAN? But N and O? N is absent.

Another: PROUD? P R O U D -> no A.

We need A in fourth: so the word must have the pattern: _ R _ A _

Possible words: 
- TRAG? not 5.
- URASE? not common.
- Maybe it's better to avoid this for now.

Option: A in position 5: _ R _ _ A

Words ending with A, with R in second.

Examples: 
- OPERA? O P E R A -> but E is absent.
- URBAN? U R B A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? Positions: U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> so A is in fourth, not fifth.

We want A in fifth: 
- CORDA? C and E? absent.
- VERSA? E and S? E absent.

Without E: 
- BARRA? Not common.
- PARRA? Not common.
- SORRA? Not common.

Common words: 
- EXTRA? E and X? E absent.
- ULTRA? U L T R A -> but R is in fourth? We need R in second.

So: _ R _ _ A

Examples: 
- ORD? not 5.
- ARDEB? not common.
- ARECA? A R E C A -> E and C absent? And A is first and fifth? But we have A in first? We are trying to put A only in fifth? But the word has A in first and fifth? But we know the word has at least one A, so if we put A in fifth, that's fine.

But ARECA: A(1), R(2), E(3), C(4), A(5). But E and C are absent, so we cannot use that.

Another: BRASA? B R A S A -> A in third and fifth? We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.

We are having difficulty finding a word with R in second and A not in third.

Perhaps we can put A in first: A R _ _ _

Let me list some common words starting with AR that avoid C, N, E.

- ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have two R's? And O and B are new. Also, the word has 5 letters. But we are repeating R, which we already know is in the word, so it might not be optimal for testing new letters.

- ARGON: A R G O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

- ARSON: A R S O N -> N is absent? No.

- ARTEL: A R T E L -> E is absent? No.

- ARTIS: not common.

- ARVOS: A R V O S -> no E, C, N. So letters: A, R, V, O, S. We are testing V, O, S.

This could be a candidate: ARVOS? But is it a valid word? I think ""arvo"" is Australian slang for afternoon, and ""arvos"" might be plural? But let's assume we can use it, or better to use a more common word.

Another: AROMA: A R O M A -> as I thought earlier. Letters: A, R, O, M. We are testing O and M, and we have A in first and fifth? But the word has two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's.

But we can use it: AROMA.

Another common word: AROHA? Not English.

ATRIA: A T R I A -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need R in second.

So: A R ? ? ?

Other options: 
- ARTSY: A R T S Y -> avoids C, N, E. Tests T, S, Y.
- ARRAY: A R R A Y -> has two R's and two A's. We are testing Y, but repeating R and A.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So ARTSY: new letters T, S, Y.

ARTSY is a valid word? Meaning artistic, yes.

Similarly, we can use ARTSY.

Another: PARTS? P A R T S -> but R is in third? No, P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). So R is in third, not second.

We need R in second.

So let's go with ARTSY: A R T S Y

But we are putting A in first? That's a new position. And we are testing T, S, Y.

We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. So if we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A, which is still informative.

Similarly, we can try a word with A in fourth.

But earlier it was hard. What about: DRABS? D R A B S -> A in third? Avoid.

How about: GRABS? Same.

Another idea: we can try a word that has A in fourth, but with R in second.

For example: WORDS? No A.

Perhaps: FRATS? But A in third.

I found: PRATS? Same.

What about: BEARD? B E A R D -> E is absent? And R is in fourth? Not second.

We need R in second.

Let's search for words with R in second and A in fourth: 
- TRADE: has E? and A in third? 
- GRADE: G R A D E -> A in third, E at end? E absent.

Without E: 
- CRAMP? C absent.
- DRAMA: D R A M A -> A in third and fifth? So A in third? We avoid.

But in DRAMA, if we put A in third, we know it's not correct, but we might get a '-' if there is another A? But we are trying to avoid that position.

Perhaps we should not be too strict. Since we know A is not in third, if we put it in third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't help. So it's better to try a different position.

So back to A in first: ARTSY.

Or A in fifth: but we couldn't find a common word without E, C, N.

Another word: ULTRA? U L T R A -> R in fourth.

Not second.

What about: BARMY? B A R M Y -> R in third.

No.

Perhaps: KARMA? K A R M A -> R in third.

No.

So let's go with ARTSY or AROMA.

I think ARTSY is better because it tests three new letters: T, S, Y.

AROMA tests O and M, but has two A's, which might not be efficient.

So I choose ARTSY.

But let's confirm: ARTSY: A in first, R in second (correct), T in third, S in fourth, Y in fifth.

We are testing A in first, T, S, Y.

If the word has A in first, we get a ✓ for A. If not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in first, we get a '-', and then we know it must be in fourth or fifth (since not in third).

Similarly, T, S, Y are new.

So it's a good guess.

Another common word: PARTS? But R not in second.

Or SMART? S M A R T -> R in fourth.

No.

So ARTSY it is.

But is ARTSY a valid word? Yes, meaning having the qualities of art.

We can also consider: ARTIS? Not common.

Or ARILS? A R I L S -> tests I, L, S.

But ARTSY is fine.

To have more common letters, we can try: ARISE? But E is absent? ARISE: A R I S E -> E is at the end, but we know E is absent from the feedback? In the first guess, E was guessed and was absent, so we cannot use E.

So ARISE is invalid because it has E.

Similarly, ARIAS? A R I A S -> has two A's? And I and S. But A in first and fourth? We are testing I and S.

But ARTSY has T, S, Y which are common.

Another: ARSON: A R S O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

So ARSON is out.

Therefore, I think ARTSY is a good choice.

So second guess: ARTSY

But let's write it: A R T S Y

Now, for the response format.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not in the third position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (and not in the first or fifth positions from this guess, though other positions are possible).
- Letters C, N, and E are absent and must be avoided in future guesses.
- For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word with R in the second position, including A (but not in the third position), and avoiding C, N, E.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, Y) in untried positions.

Considering possible words:
- A in position 1: Words like ""ARTSY"" (A, R, T, S, Y) fit well, as they test new letters (T, S, Y) and avoid problematic positions for A.
- A in position 4 or 5: Fewer common options exist without using forbidden letters (e.g., ""DRAMA"" has A in the third position, which is invalid; ""ULTRA"" has R in the wrong position; ""OPERA"" contains E).

""ARTSY"" is a strong choice because:
- It places R correctly in the second position.
- It places A in the first position (a new, untried position), which will clarify if A is in position 1 or not.
- It introduces three new common letters (T, S, Y) to test for presence and position.
- It avoids C, N, E and repeats no letters from the first guess except the known R and A.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Since it\'s the first guess, I have no prior information, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get from the feedback. That means picking a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many words.\n\nThe English language has letters that are frequently used. According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are often vowels like E, A, I, O, U and consonants like T, N, S, R, H. But for Wordle, I should consider the letter frequency specifically in 5-letter words.\n\nI recall that for Wordle, a good starting word often includes a mix of common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular because they cover several high-frequency letters.\n\nLet me quickly think about the frequency: E is very common, followed by A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.\n\nA standard approach is to have at least two vowels and three consonants.\n\nFor example, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – that\'s A and E as vowels, and C, R, N as consonants. All are quite common.\n\n""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S and T are common, A and E vowels.\n\nSince I need to output my guess, I\'ll go with one of these. Let me choose ""CRANE"" for now.\n\nBut I should ensure ""CRANE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is – it means a type of bird or a machine for lifting.\n\nAnother good one is ""RAISE"" with R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants R and S.\n\nPerhaps ""RAISE"" is better because it has more vowels, which might help identify vowel positions.\n\nLet me check some optimal starting words. From Wordle solvers, ""SLATE"" is often recommended, but I can use that.\n\nTo be systematic, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.\n\nSo, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\nNow, for the response format, I need to think step by step within the <thinking> tags, and then output the guess as specified.\n\nThe user said ""Make your first guess"", so I just need to provide the word.\n\nSince it\'s the first guess, there\'s no feedback to analyze, so my thinking is straightforward: choose a word with high letter frequency to get useful feedback.\n\nResponse format: First, within <thinking> tags, I add my thought process.

Not common.\n- ORCAS? But C is absent? ORCAS has C, which is absent. So no.\n- TRAPS: T R A P S -> but A is in third? We are trying to put A in fourth? In TRAPS, the letters are: T (1), R (2), A (3), P (4), S (5). So A is in third, which we want to avoid.\n\nWe want A in fourth: so the fourth letter is A.\n\nWords: \n- _ R _ A _\nExamples: \n- BRAS? 4 letters.\n- 5 letters: BRAVA? Not common.\n- DRAMA: D R A M A -> but A is in third and fifth? We are trying to put A in fourth? Drama: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). So A is in third and fifth. We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.\n\nWe need a word where A is in fourth position: \n- OPERA? But O P E R A -> E is absent? We cannot use E.\n\nWithout E: \n- FORA? Not 5 letters.\n- MORAY? M O R A Y -> but R is in third? We need R in second.\n\nWe need the second letter to be R.\n\nSo: ? R ? A ?\n\nExamples: \n- TRADE? But E is absent and D is new. Also, A is in fourth? T R A D E -> A is in third? Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> A is in third, which we avoid.\n\nAnother: GRABS? G R A B S -> A is in third? Same issue.\n\nWe need A in fourth: so the third letter is not A.\n\nExamples: \n- WRAPT? W R A P T -> A is in third? No, in WRAPT: W(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), T(5) -> A is in third.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with R in second and A in fourth.\n\nLet me think: \n- FRATS? F R A T S -> A in third.\n- PRATS? same.\n\nHow about: \n- CROAK? But C is absent.\n- GROAN? But N and O? N is absent.\n\nAnother: PROUD? P R O U D -> no A.\n\nWe need A in fourth: so the word must have the pattern: _ R _ A _\n\nPossible words: \n- TRAG? not 5.\n- URASE? not common.\n- Maybe it\'s better to avoid this for now.\n\nOption: A in position 5: _ R _ _ A\n\nWords ending with A, with R in second.\n\nExamples: \n- OPERA? O P E R A -> but E is absent.\n- URBAN? U R B A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? Positions: U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> so A is in fourth, not fifth.\n\nWe want A in fifth: \n- CORDA? C and E? absent.\n- VERSA? E and S? E absent.\n\nWithout E: \n- BARRA? Not common.\n- PARRA? Not common.\n- SORRA? Not common.\n\nCommon words: \n- EXTRA? E and X? E absent.\n- ULTRA? U L T R A -> but R is in fourth? We need R in second.\n\nSo: _ R _ _ A\n\nExamples: \n- ORD? not 5.\n- ARDEB? not common.\n- ARECA? A R E C A -> E and C absent? And A is first and fifth? But we have A in first? We are trying to put A only in fifth? But the word has A in first and fifth? But we know the word has at least one A, so if we put A in fifth, that\'s fine.\n\nBut ARECA: A(1), R(2), E(3), C(4), A(5). But E and C are absent, so we cannot use that.\n\nAnother: BRASA? B R A S A -> A in third and fifth? We are putting A in third again? We want to avoid that.\n\nWe are having difficulty finding a word with R in second and A not in third.\n\nPerhaps we can put A in first: A R _ _ _\n\nLet me list some common words starting with AR that avoid C, N, E.\n\n- ARBOR: A R B O R -> but we have two R\'s? And O and B are new. Also, the word has 5 letters. But we are repeating R, which we already know is in the word, so it might not be optimal for testing new letters.\n\n- ARGON: A R G O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.\n\n- ARSON: A R S O N -> N is absent? No.\n\n- ARTEL: A R T E L -> E is absent? No.\n\n- ARTIS: not common.\n\n- ARVOS: A R V O S -> no E, C, N. So letters: A, R, V, O, S. We are testing V, O, S.\n\nThis could be a candidate: ARVOS? But is it a valid word? I think ""arvo"" is Australian slang for afternoon, and ""arvos"" might be plural? But let\'s assume we can use it, or better to use a more common word.\n\nAnother: AROMA: A R O M A -> as I thought earlier. Letters: A, R, O, M. We are testing O and M, and we have A in first and fifth? But the word has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s.\n\nBut we can use it: AROMA.\n\nAnother common word: AROHA? Not English.\n\nATRIA: A T R I A -> but R is in third? We need R in second.\n\nWe need R in second.\n\nSo: A R ? ? ?\n\nOther options: \n- ARTSY: A R T S Y -> avoids C, N, E. Tests T, S, Y.\n- ARRAY: A R R A Y -> has two R\'s and two A\'s. We are testing Y, but repeating R and A.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo ARTSY: new letters T, S, Y.\n\nARTSY is a valid word? Meaning artistic, yes.\n\nSimilarly, we can use ARTSY.\n\nAnother: PARTS? P A R T S -> but R is in third? No, P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). So R is in third, not second.\n\nWe need R in second.\n\nSo let\'s go with ARTSY: A R T S Y\n\nBut we are putting A in first? That\'s a new position. And we are testing T, S, Y.\n\nWe know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in first. So if we put it in first and it\'s not, we get a \'-\' for A, which is still informative.\n\nSimilarly, we can try a word with A in fourth.\n\nBut earlier it was hard. What about: DRABS? D R A B S -> A in third? Avoid.\n\nHow about: GRABS? Same.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that has A in fourth, but with R in second.\n\nFor example: WORDS? No A.\n\nPerhaps: FRATS? But A in third.\n\nI found: PRATS? Same.\n\nWhat about: BEARD? B E A R D -> E is absent? And R is in fourth? Not second.\n\nWe need R in second.\n\nLet\'s search for words with R in second and A in fourth: \n- TRADE: has E? and A in third? \n- GRADE: G R A D E -> A in third, E at end? E absent.\n\nWithout E: \n- CRAMP? C absent.\n- DRAMA: D R A M A -> A in third and fifth? So A in third? We avoid.\n\nBut in DRAMA, if we put A in third, we know it\'s not correct, but we might get a \'-\' if there is another A? But we are trying to avoid that position.\n\nPerhaps we should not be too strict. Since we know A is not in third, if we put it in third again, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t help. So it\'s better to try a different position.\n\nSo back to A in first: ARTSY.\n\nOr A in fifth: but we couldn\'t find a common word without E, C, N.\n\nAnother word: ULTRA? U L T R A -> R in fourth.\n\nNot second.\n\nWhat about: BARMY? B A R M Y -> R in third.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps: KARMA? K A R M A -> R in third.\n\nNo.\n\nSo let\'s go with ARTSY or AROMA.\n\nI think ARTSY is better because it tests three new letters: T, S, Y.\n\nAROMA tests O and M, but has two A\'s, which might not be efficient.\n\nSo I choose ARTSY.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ARTSY: A in first, R in second (correct), T in third, S in fourth, Y in fifth.\n\nWe are testing A in first, T, S, Y.\n\nIf the word has A in first, we get a ✓ for A. If not, we get a \'-\' or \'x\'. But we know A is in the word, so if it\'s not in first, we get a \'-\', and then we know it must be in fourth or fifth (since not in third).\n\nSimilarly, T, S, Y are new.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nAnother common word: PARTS? But R not in second.\n\nOr SMART? S M A R T -> R in fourth.\n\nNo.\n\nSo ARTSY it is.\n\nBut is ARTSY a valid word? Yes, meaning having the qualities of art.\n\nWe can also consider: ARTIS? Not common.\n\nOr ARILS? A R I L S -> tests I, L, S.\n\nBut ARTSY is fine.\n\nTo have more common letters, we can try: ARISE? But E is absent? ARISE: A R I S E -> E is at the end, but we know E is absent from the feedback? In the first guess, E was guessed and was absent, so we cannot use E.\n\nSo ARISE is invalid because it has E.\n\nSimilarly, ARIAS? A R I A S -> has two A\'s? And I and S. But A in first and fourth? We are testing I and S.\n\nBut ARTSY has T, S, Y which are common.\n\nAnother: ARSON: A R S O N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.\n\nSo ARSON is out.\n\nTherefore, I think ARTSY is a good choice.\n\nSo second guess: ARTSY\n\nBut let\'s write it: A R T S Y\n\nNow, for the response format.<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not in the third position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has R as the second letter.\n- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (and not in the first or fifth positions from this guess, though other positions are possible).\n- Letters C, N, and E are absent and must be avoided in future guesses.\n- For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word with R in the second position, including A (but not in the third position), and avoiding C, N, E.\n- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, Y) in untried positions.\n\nConsidering possible words:\n- A in position 1: Words like ""ARTSY"" (A, R, T, S, Y) fit well, as they test new letters (T, S, Y) and avoid problematic positions for A.\n- A in position 4 or 5: Fewer common options exist without using forbidden letters (e.g., ""DRAMA"" has A in the third position, which is invalid; ""ULTRA"" has R in the wrong position; ""OPERA"" contains E).\n\n""ARTSY"" is a strong choice because:\n- It places R correctly in the second position.\n- It places A in the first position (a new, untried position), which will clarify if A is in position 1 or not.\n- It introduces three new common letters (T, S, Y) to test for presence and position.\n- It avoids C, N, E and repeats no letters from the first guess except the known R and A.\n\nThis guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>ARTSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ARTSY -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (in the word but not in the third position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ARTSY
- A: - (in the word but not in the first position)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is still R)
- T: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

What we know so far:
- The word has the second letter R.
- The word contains the letter A, but it is not in the first, third, or fifth position (from ARTSY: not first; from CRANE: not third; and in ARTSY, the fifth letter was Y which is absent, but A could have been in fifth? However, in ARTSY, we put A in first and got a '-', meaning A is present but not in first. We don't have direct information about the fifth position for A. But from CRANE, we know A is not in third. So possible positions for A: position 4 (since position 2 is R, so A can't be there). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
  - Position 2 is R, so A can't be there.
  - Position 1: from ARTSY, A is not there (got '-')
  - Position 3: from CRANE, A is not there (got '-')
  - So A must be in position 4? Because position 5 is still possible? But in ARTSY, we didn't test position 4 for A? Let me clarify:

In ARTSY, the letters are:
Position 1: A -> feedback '-', so A is in the word but not here.
Position 2: R -> correct.
Position 3: T -> absent.
Position 4: S -> absent.
Position 5: Y -> absent.

We don't have any information about position 4 for A? Actually, we do: the feedback for A in ARTSY is only about the first position. It doesn't tell us about other positions. But we know from CRANE that A is not in position 3. So the only positions left for A are 4 and 5? But in ARTSY, we tested position 5 with Y and it was absent, but that doesn't test A. So A could be in position 4 or 5.

But we also know that in CRANE, A was in position 3 and was misplaced, so it must be in the word in a different position. Now, from ARTSY, we have A in position 1 and it was misplaced, so it must be in the word but not in position 1. Therefore, the only positions left are 4 and 5.

Additionally, we have eliminated:
- Letters: C, N, E, T, S, Y are absent. So we must avoid these.

Also, from ARTSY, T, S, Y are absent.

So absent letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y.

We know the word has R in position 2 and A in either position 4 or 5.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Includes A, but in position 4 or 5 (to test which one).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y.
- Uses new letters to test for the remaining positions.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

We can try to put A in position 4 and see what words we can form.

Pattern: _ R _ A _

But we also need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with new letters.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5: _ R _ _ A

But we don't know which one, so we might choose one and test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and also tests other common letters.

Let's list possible words with R in second and A in fourth.

Pattern: ? R ? A ?

We need to fill:
- Position 1: a letter not in {C,E,N,T,S,Y} and not A (since A is in fourth) and not R (R is fixed in second).
- Position 3: similarly, a new letter.
- Position 5: a new letter.

And the word must be valid.

Examples:
- DRAWL: D R A W L -> but A is in third? Positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L -> so A is in third, which we know is not allowed. We need A in fourth.

We need the fourth letter to be A: so the pattern is: letter1, R, letter3, A, letter5.

So: ? R ? A ?

For example:
- GRABS: G R A B S -> but S is absent? And A is in third? In GRABS: G(1), R(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). So A is in third, which is invalid. Also, S is absent.

We need to avoid having A in third. So the third letter must not be A.

So the pattern: position 3 is not A, and position 4 is A.

Examples of words with R in second and A in fourth:
- BRAVA? Not common.
- DRABS: D R A B S -> again, A in third? D(1), R(2), A(3), B(4), S(5) -> A is in third.

I think I'm confusing: in ""DRABS"", the A is the third letter.

We need the fourth letter to be A. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.

For example, ""FORMAT"": F O R M A T -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need the second letter to be R and the fourth to be A.

So: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: any letter
Position 4: A
Position 5: any letter

Examples:
- OPERA: O P E R A -> but R is in fourth? O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> R is in fourth, not second.

We need R in second.

So: 
- URALI? Not common.
- KRAUT: K R A U T -> A in third? K(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), T(5) -> A in third.

Another: CRAWL: C R A W L -> A in third.

It's hard to find words with A in fourth and R in second.

Perhaps: FRIAR? F R I A R -> but A is in fourth? F(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), R(5). Yes! This has A in fourth.

But we have two R's? The second letter is R, and the fifth is R. We know R is in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicates. Also, F and I are new.

But FRIAR is a valid word.

However, we have to avoid T? T is absent, but FRIAR doesn't have T. It has F, R, I, A, R.

Absent letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y. So F and I are not in that list, so they are allowed.

But we have R repeated. Since we know R is in position 2, if we put R in position 5, it might be correct or not. But we are testing.

Another word: PRIOR? P R I O R -> but no A.

We need A in fourth.

Another: BRIAR: B R I A R -> similar to FRIAR, with B instead of F.

B is allowed.

Also, ""BRIAR"" is a common word.

So let's consider BRIAR: B R I A R

But we are repeating R. We might get less information because of the repeated R.

But it does test B, I, and the position of A.

Another option: put A in position 5.

Pattern: ? R ? ? A

Examples:
- ULTRA: U L T R A -> R in fourth? Not second.
- EXTRA: E X T R A -> E and T absent? and R in fourth.
- Not working.

With R in second and A in fifth:
- BARCA? Not common.
- PARMA: P A R M A -> R in third? P(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), A(5) -> but position 2 is A, but we need R in second? So no.

We need position 2 to be R.

So: ? R ? ? A

Examples:
- FORMA: F O R M A -> R in third? F(1), O(2), R(3), M(4), A(5) -> R in third, not second.
- GERMA? Not common.
- TERRA: T E R R A -> T and E absent? and R in third.

Another: VERRA? Not common.

Perhaps: MORRA? M O R R A -> R in third.

I'm struggling.

What about: HORRA? Not common.

Maybe: FURCA? F U R C A -> C absent? and R in third.

It seems difficult.

Another idea: since A must be in position 4 or 5, and we haven't tested position 4 for A, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and also tests other letters.

But from above, FRIAR and BRIAR are options.

We can also try a word that doesn't have A, but that would be inefficient because we know A is in the word, so we should use it to get feedback.

So let's go with BRIAR: B R I A R

But we have I in third and A in fourth, and R in fifth.

We are testing B, I, and the A in fourth position.

If A is in fourth, we should get a '-' or '✓' for that position? But we don't know if it's the correct position.

Similarly, if A is in fifth, then in BRIAR, the A in fourth would be wrong, so we get a '-', and the fifth is R, which might be wrong if A is in fifth.

But let's see the feedback possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5.

But we couldn't find a common one.

Another word with A in fourth and R in second: ""DROPS"" but no A.

""DRABS"" has A in third.

""GRACE"" has C and E.

I found: ""GROAN"" has N and A in fourth? G R O A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5). But N is absent, so we cannot use it.

Similarly, ""GROAN"" is invalid because of N.

""PROWL"" has no A.

""TRAWL"" has T and A in third.

Another: ""FRAUD"": F R A U D -> A in third? F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5) -> A in third.

We need to skip the third position for A.

Perhaps ""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But N is absent.

So invalid.

""ORGAN"" is out.

What about ""FORUM""? No A.

I think ""BRIAR"" or ""FRIAR"" are the best options.

Let's choose ""BRIAR"": B R I A R

But we are repeating R, which might not be ideal, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""PRIZE"" has Z and E, absent.

""CRIMP"" has C.

So I'll go with ""BRIAR"".

But let's see if there's a word with A in fifth.

For example, ""ZEBRA"" has Z and E, and R in fourth? Z E B R A -> R in fourth.

Not second.

""LYCRA"" has C, Y, and R in fourth.

No.

So ""BRIAR"" seems reasonable.

But we have to consider that in ""BRIAR"", we have:
- B in first: new letter.
- R in second: correct.
- I in third: new letter.
- A in fourth: we are testing if A is in fourth.
- R in fifth: we are testing if there is a second R.

If the word has only one R, then the fifth position R will be absent or wrong position? But we know R is in second, so if there is no second R, then R in fifth will be marked as absent? Or if it's present but wrong position? But since we already have a correct R in second, if there is no duplicate, then the R in fifth should be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word elsewhere? Or if the word has only one R, then the R in fifth is extra, so it should be x.

The feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-', but if it's not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But if the letter is in the word but we have more instances than in the secret word, then the extras are marked as not in the word? I think so.

For example, if the secret word has one R, and we guess two R's, then one R (the one in correct position) is ✓, and the other is x.

In this case, for BRIAR, if the secret word has only one R (in position 2), then:
- Position 1: B -> ? 
- Position 2: R -> ✓
- Position 3: I -> ?
- Position 4: A -> ? (if A is in fourth, then ✓, else if A is in fifth, then might be - or x, but we don't know)
- Position 5: R -> x (because only one R)

But if the secret word has two R's, then position 5 R might be - or ✓ if in correct position.

But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps we can choose a word without repeating R.

Is there a word with R in second, A in fourth, and no repeated letters?

For example, ""DRAKE"" has E and A in third? D R A K E -> A in third.

""BROAD"": B R O A D -> A in fourth? B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). Yes! And no repeated letters.

And letters: B, R, O, A, D.

We haven't tested B, O, D yet.

Also, avoids C, E, N, T, S, Y.

""BROAD"" is a valid word.

Similarly, we can use ""BROAD"".

In ""BROAD"":
- A is in fourth position, which is one of the candidates for A.
- We test B, O, D.

This is better than BRIAR because no repeated letters.

Another option: ""GROAD""? Not a word.

""PROAD""? Not common.

""FROAD""? Not common.

""BROAD"" is good.

What about ""DROID""? No A.

""BROIL"" has I and L, but no A.

So ""BROAD"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""ABHOR"" but A is first, which we know is not correct, and R is fourth? A B H O R -> R in fifth? A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5). But we need R in second.

Not matching.

So I think ""BROAD"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, third guess: BROAD

But let's confirm the pattern: B R O A D

Positions:
1: B
2: R (correct)
3: O
4: A (testing if A is here)
5: D

If A is in fourth, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in fifth, and we'll get a '-' for A in fourth? But if A is in fifth, then in this guess, A in fourth would be marked as not present? Or if the word has A, but not in fourth, then it would be '-', but since we know A is in the word, it would be '-'.

But if we get a '-' for A, then A must be in fifth position.

Similarly, we test B, O, D.

So it's informative.

We could also consider a word with A in fifth, but ""BROAD"" tests A in fourth, which is fine.

Another word: ""PROMO"" no A.

So I'll go with ""BROAD"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, N, and E are absent.

- **Guess 2: ARTSY** → Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)  
  - R is still correctly placed in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 3, from Guess 1).
  - T, S, and Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **R is fixed in position 2**.
2. **A is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (occupied by R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y. These cannot be used.
4. **New letters to test**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, W) and vowels (I, O, U) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **A in position 4** (since position 5 is the only alternative if this fails).
- Use new high-frequency letters to cover other positions (e.g., B, O, D).
- Avoid repeating letters and absent letters.

**Selected word: BROAD**  
- B (position 1): Tests a new common consonant.  
- R (position 2): Confirmed correct (fixed).  
- O (position 3): Tests a new vowel.  
- A (position 4): Tests if A is in position 4 (if not, A must be in position 5).  
- D (position 5): Tests a new consonant.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities for A while testing three new letters (B, O, D).

<guess>BROAD</guess>",BROAD,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (in the word but not in the third position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ARTSY
- A: - (in the word but not in the first position)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is still R)
- T: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

What we know so far:
- The word has the second letter R.
- The word contains the letter A, but it is not in the first, third, or fifth position (from ARTSY: not first; from CRANE: not third; and in ARTSY, the fifth letter was Y which is absent, but A could have been in fifth? However, in ARTSY, we put A in first and got a '-', meaning A is present but not in first. We don't have direct information about the fifth position for A. But from CRANE, we know A is not in third. So possible positions for A: position 4 (since position 2 is R, so A can't be there). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
  - Position 2 is R, so A can't be there.
  - Position 1: from ARTSY, A is not there (got '-')
  - Position 3: from CRANE, A is not there (got '-')
  - So A must be in position 4? Because position 5 is still possible? But in ARTSY, we didn't test position 4 for A? Let me clarify:

In ARTSY, the letters are:
Position 1: A -> feedback '-', so A is in the word but not here.
Position 2: R -> correct.
Position 3: T -> absent.
Position 4: S -> absent.
Position 5: Y -> absent.

We don't have any information about position 4 for A? Actually, we do: the feedback for A in ARTSY is only about the first position. It doesn't tell us about other positions. But we know from CRANE that A is not in position 3. So the only positions left for A are 4 and 5? But in ARTSY, we tested position 5 with Y and it was absent, but that doesn't test A. So A could be in position 4 or 5.

But we also know that in CRANE, A was in position 3 and was misplaced, so it must be in the word in a different position. Now, from ARTSY, we have A in position 1 and it was misplaced, so it must be in the word but not in position 1. Therefore, the only positions left are 4 and 5.

Additionally, we have eliminated:
- Letters: C, N, E, T, S, Y are absent. So we must avoid these.

Also, from ARTSY, T, S, Y are absent.

So absent letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y.

We know the word has R in position 2 and A in either position 4 or 5.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Includes A, but in position 4 or 5 (to test which one).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y.
- Uses new letters to test for the remaining positions.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

We can try to put A in position 4 and see what words we can form.

Pattern: _ R _ A _

But we also need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with new letters.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5: _ R _ _ A

But we don't know which one, so we might choose one and test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and also tests other common letters.

Let's list possible words with R in second and A in fourth.

Pattern: ? R ? A ?

We need to fill:
- Position 1: a letter not in {C,E,N,T,S,Y} and not A (since A is in fourth) and not R (R is fixed in second).
- Position 3: similarly, a new letter.
- Position 5: a new letter.

And the word must be valid.

Examples:
- DRAWL: D R A W L -> but A is in third? Positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L -> so A is in third, which we know is not allowed. We need A in fourth.

We need the fourth letter to be A: so the pattern is: letter1, R, letter3, A, letter5.

So: ? R ? A ?

For example:
- GRABS: G R A B S -> but S is absent? And A is in third? In GRABS: G(1), R(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). So A is in third, which is invalid. Also, S is absent.

We need to avoid having A in third. So the third letter must not be A.

So the pattern: position 3 is not A, and position 4 is A.

Examples of words with R in second and A in fourth:
- BRAVA? Not common.
- DRABS: D R A B S -> again, A in third? D(1), R(2), A(3), B(4), S(5) -> A is in third.

I think I'm confusing: in ""DRABS"", the A is the third letter.

We need the fourth letter to be A. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.

For example, ""FORMAT"": F O R M A T -> but R is in third? We need R in second.

We need the second letter to be R and the fourth to be A.

So: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: any letter
Position 4: A
Position 5: any letter

Examples:
- OPERA: O P E R A -> but R is in fourth? O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> R is in fourth, not second.

We need R in second.

So: 
- URALI? Not common.
- KRAUT: K R A U T -> A in third? K(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), T(5) -> A in third.

Another: CRAWL: C R A W L -> A in third.

It's hard to find words with A in fourth and R in second.

Perhaps: FRIAR? F R I A R -> but A is in fourth? F(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), R(5). Yes! This has A in fourth.

But we have two R's? The second letter is R, and the fifth is R. We know R is in the word, but we don't know if there are duplicates. Also, F and I are new.

But FRIAR is a valid word.

However, we have to avoid T? T is absent, but FRIAR doesn't have T. It has F, R, I, A, R.

Absent letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y. So F and I are not in that list, so they are allowed.

But we have R repeated. Since we know R is in position 2, if we put R in position 5, it might be correct or not. But we are testing.

Another word: PRIOR? P R I O R -> but no A.

We need A in fourth.

Another: BRIAR: B R I A R -> similar to FRIAR, with B instead of F.

B is allowed.

Also, ""BRIAR"" is a common word.

So let's consider BRIAR: B R I A R

But we are repeating R. We might get less information because of the repeated R.

But it does test B, I, and the position of A.

Another option: put A in position 5.

Pattern: ? R ? ? A

Examples:
- ULTRA: U L T R A -> R in fourth? Not second.
- EXTRA: E X T R A -> E and T absent? and R in fourth.
- Not working.

With R in second and A in fifth:
- BARCA? Not common.
- PARMA: P A R M A -> R in third? P(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), A(5) -> but position 2 is A, but we need R in second? So no.

We need position 2 to be R.

So: ? R ? ? A

Examples:
- FORMA: F O R M A -> R in third? F(1), O(2), R(3), M(4), A(5) -> R in third, not second.
- GERMA? Not common.
- TERRA: T E R R A -> T and E absent? and R in third.

Another: VERRA? Not common.

Perhaps: MORRA? M O R R A -> R in third.

I'm struggling.

What about: HORRA? Not common.

Maybe: FURCA? F U R C A -> C absent? and R in third.

It seems difficult.

Another idea: since A must be in position 4 or 5, and we haven't tested position 4 for A, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and also tests other letters.

But from above, FRIAR and BRIAR are options.

We can also try a word that doesn't have A, but that would be inefficient because we know A is in the word, so we should use it to get feedback.

So let's go with BRIAR: B R I A R

But we have I in third and A in fourth, and R in fifth.

We are testing B, I, and the A in fourth position.

If A is in fourth, we should get a '-' or '✓' for that position? But we don't know if it's the correct position.

Similarly, if A is in fifth, then in BRIAR, the A in fourth would be wrong, so we get a '-', and the fifth is R, which might be wrong if A is in fifth.

But let's see the feedback possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5.

But we couldn't find a common one.

Another word with A in fourth and R in second: ""DROPS"" but no A.

""DRABS"" has A in third.

""GRACE"" has C and E.

I found: ""GROAN"" has N and A in fourth? G R O A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5). But N is absent, so we cannot use it.

Similarly, ""GROAN"" is invalid because of N.

""PROWL"" has no A.

""TRAWL"" has T and A in third.

Another: ""FRAUD"": F R A U D -> A in third? F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5) -> A in third.

We need to skip the third position for A.

Perhaps ""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> but N is absent? And A is in fourth? O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But N is absent.

So invalid.

""ORGAN"" is out.

What about ""FORUM""? No A.

I think ""BRIAR"" or ""FRIAR"" are the best options.

Let's choose ""BRIAR"": B R I A R

But we are repeating R, which might not be ideal, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""PRIZE"" has Z and E, absent.

""CRIMP"" has C.

So I'll go with ""BRIAR"".

But let's see if there's a word with A in fifth.

For example, ""ZEBRA"" has Z and E, and R in fourth? Z E B R A -> R in fourth.

Not second.

""LYCRA"" has C, Y, and R in fourth.

No.

So ""BRIAR"" seems reasonable.

But we have to consider that in ""BRIAR"", we have:
- B in first: new letter.
- R in second: correct.
- I in third: new letter.
- A in fourth: we are testing if A is in fourth.
- R in fifth: we are testing if there is a second R.

If the word has only one R, then the fifth position R will be absent or wrong position? But we know R is in second, so if there is no second R, then R in fifth will be marked as absent? Or if it's present but wrong position? But since we already have a correct R in second, if there is no duplicate, then the R in fifth should be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word elsewhere? Or if the word has only one R, then the R in fifth is extra, so it should be x.

The feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-', but if it's not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But if the letter is in the word but we have more instances than in the secret word, then the extras are marked as not in the word? I think so.

For example, if the secret word has one R, and we guess two R's, then one R (the one in correct position) is ✓, and the other is x.

In this case, for BRIAR, if the secret word has only one R (in position 2), then:
- Position 1: B -> ? 
- Position 2: R -> ✓
- Position 3: I -> ?
- Position 4: A -> ? (if A is in fourth, then ✓, else if A is in fifth, then might be - or x, but we don't know)
- Position 5: R -> x (because only one R)

But if the secret word has two R's, then position 5 R might be - or ✓ if in correct position.

But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps we can choose a word without repeating R.

Is there a word with R in second, A in fourth, and no repeated letters?

For example, ""DRAKE"" has E and A in third? D R A K E -> A in third.

""BROAD"": B R O A D -> A in fourth? B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). Yes! And no repeated letters.

And letters: B, R, O, A, D.

We haven't tested B, O, D yet.

Also, avoids C, E, N, T, S, Y.

""BROAD"" is a valid word.

Similarly, we can use ""BROAD"".

In ""BROAD"":
- A is in fourth position, which is one of the candidates for A.
- We test B, O, D.

This is better than BRIAR because no repeated letters.

Another option: ""GROAD""? Not a word.

""PROAD""? Not common.

""FROAD""? Not common.

""BROAD"" is good.

What about ""DROID""? No A.

""BROIL"" has I and L, but no A.

So ""BROAD"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""ABHOR"" but A is first, which we know is not correct, and R is fourth? A B H O R -> R in fifth? A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5). But we need R in second.

Not matching.

So I think ""BROAD"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, third guess: BROAD

But let's confirm the pattern: B R O A D

Positions:
1: B
2: R (correct)
3: O
4: A (testing if A is here)
5: D

If A is in fourth, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in fifth, and we'll get a '-' for A in fourth? But if A is in fifth, then in this guess, A in fourth would be marked as not present? Or if the word has A, but not in fourth, then it would be '-', but since we know A is in the word, it would be '-'.

But if we get a '-' for A, then A must be in fifth position.

Similarly, we test B, O, D.

So it's informative.

We could also consider a word with A in fifth, but ""BROAD"" tests A in fourth, which is fine.

Another word: ""PROMO"" no A.

So I'll go with ""BROAD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, N, and E are absent.

- **Guess 2: ARTSY** → Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)  
  - R is still correctly placed in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in position 3, from Guess 1).
  - T, S, and Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **R is fixed in position 2**.
2. **A is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (occupied by R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y. These cannot be used.
4. **New letters to test**: Focus on common unused consonants (B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, W) and vowels (I, O, U) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **A in position 4** (since position 5 is the only alternative if this fails).
- Use new high-frequency letters to cover other positions (e.g., B, O, D).
- Avoid repeating letters and absent letters.

**Selected word: BROAD**  
- B (position 1): Tests a new common consonant.  
- R (position 2): Confirmed correct (fixed).  
- O (position 3): Tests a new vowel.  
- A (position 4): Tests if A is in position 4 (if not, A must be in position 5).  
- D (position 5): Tests a new consonant.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities for A while testing three new letters (B, O, D).",Guess 3: BROAD -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) O(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
