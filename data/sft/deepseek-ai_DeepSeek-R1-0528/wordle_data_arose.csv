First, I need to make the first guess for the Wordle game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like E, A, R, T, O, etc., because they're frequent in English words.

A popular first guess is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E— all fairly common letters. Or ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider something that covers more vowels. Vowels are important because most words have vowels.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

Perhaps ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" – but ""ROATE"" isn't a common word; ""RAISE"" is better.

""ADIEU"" is another one, which has many vowels: A, D, I, E, U— so four vowels and one consonant.

But ""ADIEU"" might not be ideal if the word has consonants, and U is less common.

A balanced approach is better. Let's go with ""SLATE"". It has S, L, A, T, E. S and T are common consonants, A and E are vowels, L is common.

""CRANE"" is also good: C, R, A, N, E.

I think ""CRANE"" is fine.

But let's confirm it's valid. CRANE is a valid word.

Another one is ""OUIJA"", but that might be obscure.

Stick with common words.

Since I have to output in a specific format, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

After this guess, I'll get feedback to help me narrow down future guesses.

So, for the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Final decision: Guess ""CRANE"".

For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes potential information since I have no prior feedback. The goal is to cover frequent English letters, especially vowels and common consonants. After considering options like ""ADIEU"" (many vowels), ""SLATE"" (good mix), and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" as it includes E and A (top vowels), and R, N, C (common consonants). This combination often reveals letter positioning effectively, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
- Letters C and N are not in the word.

We also know that the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to make a second guess that incorporates what we know and tests new letters.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter? 
  - Actually, no: the feedback tells us about the secret word, but our next guess doesn't have to follow that. However, to maximize information, it's often good to use the known correct positions and include other common letters.

But note: we know A is in the word, so we should include A in a different position (not third). Also, we should avoid C and N.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes A in a position that is not third (so either first or fourth) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be third, and we have positions 1 and 4 available (and 2 and 5 are fixed as R and E). So A can be in position 1 or 4.

We also need to test other letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We should avoid repeating C and N.

Let me think of words that match the pattern _ R _ _ E and have A in position 1 or 4.

Option 1: A in first position -> A R _ _ E
We need two letters in the middle. Common words: 
- ARISE: A R I S E -> but we have E at the end, so that fits. However, we already know E is at the end, so we can use this to test I and S.
- AROSE: A R O S E
- ARDOR: but that has two R's? and not 5 distinct? Actually, ARDOR is 5 letters but has two R's. But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But we don't have any duplicate letter information yet.

Option 2: A in fourth position: _ R _ A E
Words: 
- TRADE: T R A D E -> but we know A is in the word, and this puts A in the fourth position. Also, T and D are new.
- GRADE: G R A D E -> similar.

But note: we have two correct positions: R and E. So if we use a word that has R in second and E in fifth, we can confirm if A is in the fourth or not, and also test other letters.

However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the possibilities:

We know the word has: R (pos2), E (pos5), and A (somewhere not pos3). So the word has at least these three letters.

The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4.

We need to find what goes in position 1, 3, and 4.

We can try a word that uses the known R and E and places A in a new position (say position 1 or 4) and uses common letters for the other two positions.

But we have to avoid C and N.

Let me try to form words:

- If A is in position 1: A R ? ? E
  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Common: I, S, O, T, etc.
  - Words: ARISE (A, R, I, S, E), AROSE (A, R, O, S, E), ARATE? (not common), ARGLE? (not a word), ARDLE? (not common). So ARISE and AROSE are good.

- If A is in position 4: ? R ? A E
  - Words: TRADE (T, R, A, D, E), GRADE (G, R, A, D, E), BRACE? but C is not allowed, so avoid. PRASE? (P, R, A, S, E) - which is a word (a type of mineral).

But note: we don't know if A is in position 1 or 4. We could also consider that A might be in position 4, but we have position 1 and 3 to fill.

Another idea: we don't have to use A in this guess. We know A is in the word, but we might not include it to test other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know A is present, so we should use it to find its position.

So, including A is beneficial.

Let me choose a word that has:
- Second letter R
- Fifth letter E
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test one of the possibilities)
- And uses new common letters for the other positions.

For example, let's take ""ARISE"":
- A in position 1 (so if A is actually in position 1, we get a check; if not, we know it must be in position 4 because we know it's not in 3)
- Also tests I and S.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Another candidate: ""ROUSE"" - but that has O, U, S, but no A. And we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

So, I think including A is better.

What about ""RAISE""? But note, in ""RAISE"", R is first, but we know R is in the second position. So we cannot use RAISE because it has R in first, which would conflict with our known second position R.

Our guess must be a valid word, but it doesn't have to match the known positions? Actually, it can have R in a different position, but that might not be efficient because we know R is fixed at position 2.

If we put R in a different position, we might get feedback that it's present but wrong position, but we already know it's in position 2. So it's better to keep R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm they are still there (which they should be) and to test other positions.

So, the pattern should be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

We have to choose letter1, letter3, letter4.

Constraints:
- letter1 cannot be C or N (from previous feedback) and should be a new letter.
- letter3 cannot be A (because feedback said A is not in position 3) and also not C or N, and should be new.
- letter4 cannot be C or N, and should be new.

Also, we must include A in either letter1 or letter4.

So two cases:

Case 1: A in letter1 -> then word: A R ? ? E
  - Then we need to choose letter3 and letter4 (both new, not C, N, and not A in letter3? but A is already in letter1, so letter3 and letter4 are different).

Case 2: A in letter4 -> then word: ? R ? A E
  - Then we choose letter1 and letter3 (new, not C, N).

We don't know which case, so we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use A in position 1 or 4, but that might not help us locate A. But we could use a word that has A in position 4, for example.

Let me look for common words that fit the pattern and include A.

Option: ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E
- This has A in position 4? Actually, positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but wait, we know from feedback that A is not in position 3! So we cannot put A in position 3. Therefore, ""GRADE"" is invalid because it places A in position 3, which we know is wrong.

So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, for ""GRADE"", if we use it, the A would be in position 3, which is not allowed by the feedback. So we shouldn't use that.

Similarly, any word with A in position 3 is not allowed.

So, for the pattern, if we put A in the third position, it would be incorrect.

Therefore, we must have A in position 1 or 4.

Now, let's try to form words:

For A in position 1: A R ? ? E
  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. They must be from the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C and N).
  - Common: S, T, L, I, O, etc.
  - Words: 
      - ARISE: A R I S E -> positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E
      - AROSE: A R O S E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E
      - ARDLE? not common.
      - ARGUE: A R G U E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:G, 4:U, 5:E
      - ARTIE? not common.

For A in position 4: ? R ? A E
  - Words:
      - TRADE: T R A D E -> but wait, A is in position 3? No: T(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is in position 3, which is not allowed. So we cannot use TRADE because it forces A into position 3.
      - How about words with A in position 4? 
          - The pattern is: position1, R, position3, A, E.
          - So we need a word with structure: [letter1] R [letter3] A E
          - Example: GRAZE: G R A Z E -> but A is in position 3? Positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> again A in position 3, not allowed.
          - We need A in position 4? The fourth position is the one before E. So the word should be: [1] [2=R] [3] [4=A] [5=E]
          - Example: ""URAE"" is not 5 letters. 
          - ""BEAKE"" is not a word.
          - Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end.

Let me think: 
- The word must be: _ R _ A E -> but the third letter can be anything, and then the fourth is A, and fifth is E.

But in English, words ending with ""AE"" are rare. Usually, it's ""IA"" or something else.

Common words: 
- ""FRAUD"" doesn't end with E.
- ""GRACE"" has C and ends with E, but C is not allowed and A is in position 3? G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A in 3.

It seems that in many words, when A is present and E is at the end, A often comes earlier.

But we need A in position 4: so the word must have the form: [consonant] R [vowel?] A E

For example: 
- ""URSAE"" is a word (plural of ursa), but it's not very common: U R S A E -> positions: 1:U, 2:R, 3:S, 4:A, 5:E -> yes, A in position 4.
- ""BEAKE"" is not a word.
- ""CRAVE"" has A in position 3: C R A V E -> not allowed.

So ""URSAE"" is a valid word, but uncommon. We might avoid it.

Another one: ""UNAWE"" is not a word.

Perhaps it's better to go with A in position 1.

So let's focus on words starting with A, then R, then two letters, then E.

Common words: ARISE, AROSE, ARGUE, ABASE, etc.

ARISE and AROSE are good.

ARISE: tests A in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 4.
AROSE: tests A in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 4.

Both are good.

We could also test different letters. For example, we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

Another word: ""ARTEL"" but that ends with L, not E.

So for ending with E, ARISE and AROSE are solid.

I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But note: we know E is at the end, so in ""ARISE"", the E is at the end, which matches.

So, guess: ARISE

This will tell us:
- If A is in position 1 (if we get a check for A, then yes; if minus, then A is not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 because we know it's in the word and not in 3).
- Also, we test I and S.

If we get checks for R and E, that's expected.

So, let's choose ""ARISE"".

But we must ensure it's valid. Yes, ARISE is a valid word.

Therefore, second guess: ARISE

In the feedback, we had A as present but not in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

Similarly, if the word has I or S, we'll know.

So, I think it's a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and N are not in the word.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).

The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, with A present but not in position 3. For the second guess, I chose ""arise"" because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm their placement.
- It tests A in position 1 (to determine if A is in position 1 or 4, since it can't be in 3).
- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.
- It avoids C and N, which are excluded.

<guess>arise</guess>",arise,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
- Letters C and N are not in the word.

We also know that the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to make a second guess that incorporates what we know and tests new letters.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter? 
  - Actually, no: the feedback tells us about the secret word, but our next guess doesn't have to follow that. However, to maximize information, it's often good to use the known correct positions and include other common letters.

But note: we know A is in the word, so we should include A in a different position (not third). Also, we should avoid C and N.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes A in a position that is not third (so either first or fourth) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be third, and we have positions 1 and 4 available (and 2 and 5 are fixed as R and E). So A can be in position 1 or 4.

We also need to test other letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We should avoid repeating C and N.

Let me think of words that match the pattern _ R _ _ E and have A in position 1 or 4.

Option 1: A in first position -> A R _ _ E
We need two letters in the middle. Common words: 
- ARISE: A R I S E -> but we have E at the end, so that fits. However, we already know E is at the end, so we can use this to test I and S.
- AROSE: A R O S E
- ARDOR: but that has two R's? and not 5 distinct? Actually, ARDOR is 5 letters but has two R's. But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But we don't have any duplicate letter information yet.

Option 2: A in fourth position: _ R _ A E
Words: 
- TRADE: T R A D E -> but we know A is in the word, and this puts A in the fourth position. Also, T and D are new.
- GRADE: G R A D E -> similar.

But note: we have two correct positions: R and E. So if we use a word that has R in second and E in fifth, we can confirm if A is in the fourth or not, and also test other letters.

However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the possibilities:

We know the word has: R (pos2), E (pos5), and A (somewhere not pos3). So the word has at least these three letters.

The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4.

We need to find what goes in position 1, 3, and 4.

We can try a word that uses the known R and E and places A in a new position (say position 1 or 4) and uses common letters for the other two positions.

But we have to avoid C and N.

Let me try to form words:

- If A is in position 1: A R ? ? E
  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Common: I, S, O, T, etc.
  - Words: ARISE (A, R, I, S, E), AROSE (A, R, O, S, E), ARATE? (not common), ARGLE? (not a word), ARDLE? (not common). So ARISE and AROSE are good.

- If A is in position 4: ? R ? A E
  - Words: TRADE (T, R, A, D, E), GRADE (G, R, A, D, E), BRACE? but C is not allowed, so avoid. PRASE? (P, R, A, S, E) - which is a word (a type of mineral).

But note: we don't know if A is in position 1 or 4. We could also consider that A might be in position 4, but we have position 1 and 3 to fill.

Another idea: we don't have to use A in this guess. We know A is in the word, but we might not include it to test other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know A is present, so we should use it to find its position.

So, including A is beneficial.

Let me choose a word that has:
- Second letter R
- Fifth letter E
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test one of the possibilities)
- And uses new common letters for the other positions.

For example, let's take ""ARISE"":
- A in position 1 (so if A is actually in position 1, we get a check; if not, we know it must be in position 4 because we know it's not in 3)
- Also tests I and S.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Another candidate: ""ROUSE"" - but that has O, U, S, but no A. And we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

So, I think including A is better.

What about ""RAISE""? But note, in ""RAISE"", R is first, but we know R is in the second position. So we cannot use RAISE because it has R in first, which would conflict with our known second position R.

Our guess must be a valid word, but it doesn't have to match the known positions? Actually, it can have R in a different position, but that might not be efficient because we know R is fixed at position 2.

If we put R in a different position, we might get feedback that it's present but wrong position, but we already know it's in position 2. So it's better to keep R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm they are still there (which they should be) and to test other positions.

So, the pattern should be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

We have to choose letter1, letter3, letter4.

Constraints:
- letter1 cannot be C or N (from previous feedback) and should be a new letter.
- letter3 cannot be A (because feedback said A is not in position 3) and also not C or N, and should be new.
- letter4 cannot be C or N, and should be new.

Also, we must include A in either letter1 or letter4.

So two cases:

Case 1: A in letter1 -> then word: A R ? ? E
  - Then we need to choose letter3 and letter4 (both new, not C, N, and not A in letter3? but A is already in letter1, so letter3 and letter4 are different).

Case 2: A in letter4 -> then word: ? R ? A E
  - Then we choose letter1 and letter3 (new, not C, N).

We don't know which case, so we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use A in position 1 or 4, but that might not help us locate A. But we could use a word that has A in position 4, for example.

Let me look for common words that fit the pattern and include A.

Option: ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E
- This has A in position 4? Actually, positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but wait, we know from feedback that A is not in position 3! So we cannot put A in position 3. Therefore, ""GRADE"" is invalid because it places A in position 3, which we know is wrong.

So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, for ""GRADE"", if we use it, the A would be in position 3, which is not allowed by the feedback. So we shouldn't use that.

Similarly, any word with A in position 3 is not allowed.

So, for the pattern, if we put A in the third position, it would be incorrect.

Therefore, we must have A in position 1 or 4.

Now, let's try to form words:

For A in position 1: A R ? ? E
  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. They must be from the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C and N).
  - Common: S, T, L, I, O, etc.
  - Words: 
      - ARISE: A R I S E -> positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E
      - AROSE: A R O S E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E
      - ARDLE? not common.
      - ARGUE: A R G U E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:G, 4:U, 5:E
      - ARTIE? not common.

For A in position 4: ? R ? A E
  - Words:
      - TRADE: T R A D E -> but wait, A is in position 3? No: T(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is in position 3, which is not allowed. So we cannot use TRADE because it forces A into position 3.
      - How about words with A in position 4? 
          - The pattern is: position1, R, position3, A, E.
          - So we need a word with structure: [letter1] R [letter3] A E
          - Example: GRAZE: G R A Z E -> but A is in position 3? Positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> again A in position 3, not allowed.
          - We need A in position 4? The fourth position is the one before E. So the word should be: [1] [2=R] [3] [4=A] [5=E]
          - Example: ""URAE"" is not 5 letters. 
          - ""BEAKE"" is not a word.
          - Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end.

Let me think: 
- The word must be: _ R _ A E -> but the third letter can be anything, and then the fourth is A, and fifth is E.

But in English, words ending with ""AE"" are rare. Usually, it's ""IA"" or something else.

Common words: 
- ""FRAUD"" doesn't end with E.
- ""GRACE"" has C and ends with E, but C is not allowed and A is in position 3? G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A in 3.

It seems that in many words, when A is present and E is at the end, A often comes earlier.

But we need A in position 4: so the word must have the form: [consonant] R [vowel?] A E

For example: 
- ""URSAE"" is a word (plural of ursa), but it's not very common: U R S A E -> positions: 1:U, 2:R, 3:S, 4:A, 5:E -> yes, A in position 4.
- ""BEAKE"" is not a word.
- ""CRAVE"" has A in position 3: C R A V E -> not allowed.

So ""URSAE"" is a valid word, but uncommon. We might avoid it.

Another one: ""UNAWE"" is not a word.

Perhaps it's better to go with A in position 1.

So let's focus on words starting with A, then R, then two letters, then E.

Common words: ARISE, AROSE, ARGUE, ABASE, etc.

ARISE and AROSE are good.

ARISE: tests A in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 4.
AROSE: tests A in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 4.

Both are good.

We could also test different letters. For example, we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

Another word: ""ARTEL"" but that ends with L, not E.

So for ending with E, ARISE and AROSE are solid.

I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But note: we know E is at the end, so in ""ARISE"", the E is at the end, which matches.

So, guess: ARISE

This will tell us:
- If A is in position 1 (if we get a check for A, then yes; if minus, then A is not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 because we know it's in the word and not in 3).
- Also, we test I and S.

If we get checks for R and E, that's expected.

So, let's choose ""ARISE"".

But we must ensure it's valid. Yes, ARISE is a valid word.

Therefore, second guess: ARISE

In the feedback, we had A as present but not in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

Similarly, if the word has I or S, we'll know.

So, I think it's a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and N are not in the word.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).

The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, with A present but not in position 3. For the second guess, I chose ""arise"" because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm their placement.
- It tests A in position 1 (to determine if A is in position 1 or 4, since it can't be in 3).
- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.
- It avoids C and N, which are excluded.",Guess 2: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make the first guess for the Wordle game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like E, A, R, T, O, etc., because they're frequent in English words.

A popular first guess is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E— all fairly common letters. Or ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E.

But I should consider something that covers more vowels. Vowels are important because most words have vowels.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

Perhaps ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" – but ""ROATE"" isn't a common word; ""RAISE"" is better.

""ADIEU"" is another one, which has many vowels: A, D, I, E, U— so four vowels and one consonant.

But ""ADIEU"" might not be ideal if the word has consonants, and U is less common.

A balanced approach is better. Let's go with ""SLATE"". It has S, L, A, T, E. S and T are common consonants, A and E are vowels, L is common.

""CRANE"" is also good: C, R, A, N, E.

I think ""CRANE"" is fine.

But let's confirm it's valid. CRANE is a valid word.

Another one is ""OUIJA"", but that might be obscure.

Stick with common words.

Since I have to output in a specific format, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

After this guess, I'll get feedback to help me narrow down future guesses.

So, for the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Final decision: Guess ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes potential information since I have no prior feedback. The goal is to cover frequent English letters, especially vowels and common consonants. After considering options like ""ADIEU"" (many vowels), ""SLATE"" (good mix), and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" as it includes E and A (top vowels), and R, N, C (common consonants). This combination often reveals letter positioning effectively, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
- Letters C and N are not in the word.

We also know that the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to make a second guess that incorporates what we know and tests new letters.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter? 
  - Actually, no: the feedback tells us about the secret word, but our next guess doesn't have to follow that. However, to maximize information, it's often good to use the known correct positions and include other common letters.

But note: we know A is in the word, so we should include A in a different position (not third). Also, we should avoid C and N.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes A in a position that is not third (so either first or fourth) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be third, and we have positions 1 and 4 available (and 2 and 5 are fixed as R and E). So A can be in position 1 or 4.

We also need to test other letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We should avoid repeating C and N.

Let me think of words that match the pattern _ R _ _ E and have A in position 1 or 4.

Option 1: A in first position -> A R _ _ E
We need two letters in the middle. Common words: 
- ARISE: A R I S E -> but we have E at the end, so that fits. However, we already know E is at the end, so we can use this to test I and S.
- AROSE: A R O S E
- ARDOR: but that has two R's? and not 5 distinct? Actually, ARDOR is 5 letters but has two R's. But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But we don't have any duplicate letter information yet.

Option 2: A in fourth position: _ R _ A E
Words: 
- TRADE: T R A D E -> but we know A is in the word, and this puts A in the fourth position. Also, T and D are new.
- GRADE: G R A D E -> similar.

But note: we have two correct positions: R and E. So if we use a word that has R in second and E in fifth, we can confirm if A is in the fourth or not, and also test other letters.

However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the possibilities:

We know the word has: R (pos2), E (pos5), and A (somewhere not pos3). So the word has at least these three letters.

The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4.

We need to find what goes in position 1, 3, and 4.

We can try a word that uses the known R and E and places A in a new position (say position 1 or 4) and uses common letters for the other two positions.

But we have to avoid C and N.

Let me try to form words:

- If A is in position 1: A R ? ? E
  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Common: I, S, O, T, etc.
  - Words: ARISE (A, R, I, S, E), AROSE (A, R, O, S, E), ARATE? (not common), ARGLE? (not a word), ARDLE? (not common). So ARISE and AROSE are good.

- If A is in position 4: ? R ? A E
  - Words: TRADE (T, R, A, D, E), GRADE (G, R, A, D, E), BRACE? but C is not allowed, so avoid. PRASE? (P, R, A, S, E) - which is a word (a type of mineral).

But note: we don't know if A is in position 1 or 4. We could also consider that A might be in position 4, but we have position 1 and 3 to fill.

Another idea: we don't have to use A in this guess. We know A is in the word, but we might not include it to test other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know A is present, so we should use it to find its position.

So, including A is beneficial.

Let me choose a word that has:
- Second letter R
- Fifth letter E
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test one of the possibilities)
- And uses new common letters for the other positions.

For example, let's take ""ARISE"":
- A in position 1 (so if A is actually in position 1, we get a check; if not, we know it must be in position 4 because we know it's not in 3)
- Also tests I and S.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Another candidate: ""ROUSE"" - but that has O, U, S, but no A. And we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

So, I think including A is better.

What about ""RAISE""? But note, in ""RAISE"", R is first, but we know R is in the second position. So we cannot use RAISE because it has R in first, which would conflict with our known second position R.

Our guess must be a valid word, but it doesn't have to match the known positions? Actually, it can have R in a different position, but that might not be efficient because we know R is fixed at position 2.

If we put R in a different position, we might get feedback that it's present but wrong position, but we already know it's in position 2. So it's better to keep R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm they are still there (which they should be) and to test other positions.

So, the pattern should be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

We have to choose letter1, letter3, letter4.

Constraints:
- letter1 cannot be C or N (from previous feedback) and should be a new letter.
- letter3 cannot be A (because feedback said A is not in position 3) and also not C or N, and should be new.
- letter4 cannot be C or N, and should be new.

Also, we must include A in either letter1 or letter4.

So two cases:

Case 1: A in letter1 -> then word: A R ? ? E
  - Then we need to choose letter3 and letter4 (both new, not C, N, and not A in letter3? but A is already in letter1, so letter3 and letter4 are different).

Case 2: A in letter4 -> then word: ? R ? A E
  - Then we choose letter1 and letter3 (new, not C, N).

We don't know which case, so we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use A in position 1 or 4, but that might not help us locate A. But we could use a word that has A in position 4, for example.

Let me look for common words that fit the pattern and include A.

Option: ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E
- This has A in position 4? Actually, positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but wait, we know from feedback that A is not in position 3! So we cannot put A in position 3. Therefore, ""GRADE"" is invalid because it places A in position 3, which we know is wrong.

So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, for ""GRADE"", if we use it, the A would be in position 3, which is not allowed by the feedback. So we shouldn't use that.

Similarly, any word with A in position 3 is not allowed.

So, for the pattern, if we put A in the third position, it would be incorrect.

Therefore, we must have A in position 1 or 4.

Now, let's try to form words:

For A in position 1: A R ? ? E
  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. They must be from the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C and N).
  - Common: S, T, L, I, O, etc.
  - Words: 
      - ARISE: A R I S E -> positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E
      - AROSE: A R O S E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E
      - ARDLE? not common.
      - ARGUE: A R G U E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:G, 4:U, 5:E
      - ARTIE? not common.

For A in position 4: ? R ? A E
  - Words:
      - TRADE: T R A D E -> but wait, A is in position 3? No: T(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is in position 3, which is not allowed. So we cannot use TRADE because it forces A into position 3.
      - How about words with A in position 4? 
          - The pattern is: position1, R, position3, A, E.
          - So we need a word with structure: [letter1] R [letter3] A E
          - Example: GRAZE: G R A Z E -> but A is in position 3? Positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> again A in position 3, not allowed.
          - We need A in position 4? The fourth position is the one before E. So the word should be: [1] [2=R] [3] [4=A] [5=E]
          - Example: ""URAE"" is not 5 letters. 
          - ""BEAKE"" is not a word.
          - Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end.

Let me think: 
- The word must be: _ R _ A E -> but the third letter can be anything, and then the fourth is A, and fifth is E.

But in English, words ending with ""AE"" are rare. Usually, it's ""IA"" or something else.

Common words: 
- ""FRAUD"" doesn't end with E.
- ""GRACE"" has C and ends with E, but C is not allowed and A is in position 3? G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A in 3.

It seems that in many words, when A is present and E is at the end, A often comes earlier.

But we need A in position 4: so the word must have the form: [consonant] R [vowel?] A E

For example: 
- ""URSAE"" is a word (plural of ursa), but it's not very common: U R S A E -> positions: 1:U, 2:R, 3:S, 4:A, 5:E -> yes, A in position 4.
- ""BEAKE"" is not a word.
- ""CRAVE"" has A in position 3: C R A V E -> not allowed.

So ""URSAE"" is a valid word, but uncommon. We might avoid it.

Another one: ""UNAWE"" is not a word.

Perhaps it's better to go with A in position 1.

So let's focus on words starting with A, then R, then two letters, then E.

Common words: ARISE, AROSE, ARGUE, ABASE, etc.

ARISE and AROSE are good.

ARISE: tests A in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 4.
AROSE: tests A in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 4.

Both are good.

We could also test different letters. For example, we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

Another word: ""ARTEL"" but that ends with L, not E.

So for ending with E, ARISE and AROSE are solid.

I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But note: we know E is at the end, so in ""ARISE"", the E is at the end, which matches.

So, guess: ARISE

This will tell us:
- If A is in position 1 (if we get a check for A, then yes; if minus, then A is not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 because we know it's in the word and not in 3).
- Also, we test I and S.

If we get checks for R and E, that's expected.

So, let's choose ""ARISE"".

But we must ensure it's valid. Yes, ARISE is a valid word.

Therefore, second guess: ARISE

In the feedback, we had A as present but not in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

Similarly, if the word has I or S, we'll know.

So, I think it's a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and N are not in the word.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).

The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, with A present but not in position 3. For the second guess, I chose ""arise"" because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm their placement.
- It tests A in position 1 (to determine if A is in position 1 or 4, since it can't be in 3).
- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.
- It avoids C and N, which are excluded.

Since it\'s the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nCommon starting words in Wordle often include letters like E, A, R, T, O, etc., because they\'re frequent in English words.\n\nA popular first guess is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E— all fairly common letters. Or ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E.\n\nBut I should consider something that covers more vowels. Vowels are important because most words have vowels.\n\nThe most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.\n\nPerhaps ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" – but ""ROATE"" isn\'t a common word; ""RAISE"" is better.\n\n""ADIEU"" is another one, which has many vowels: A, D, I, E, U— so four vowels and one consonant.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" might not be ideal if the word has consonants, and U is less common.\n\nA balanced approach is better. Let\'s go with ""SLATE"". It has S, L, A, T, E. S and T are common consonants, A and E are vowels, L is common.\n\n""CRANE"" is also good: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s confirm it\'s valid.

The goal is to cover frequent English letters, especially vowels and common consonants. After considering options like ""ADIEU"" (many vowels), ""SLATE"" (good mix), and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" as it includes E and A (top vowels), and R, N, C (common consonants).

However, to maximize information, it\'s often good to use the known correct positions and include other common letters.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word, so we should include A in a different position (not third). Also, we should avoid C and N.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes A in a position that is not third (so either first or fourth) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it can\'t be third, and we have positions 1 and 4 available (and 2 and 5 are fixed as R and E). So A can be in position 1 or 4.\n\nWe also need to test other letters to find the remaining letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\nWe should avoid repeating C and N.\n\nLet me think of words that match the pattern _ R _ _ E and have A in position 1 or 4.\n\nOption 1: A in first position -> A R _ _ E\nWe need two letters in the middle. Common words: \n- ARISE: A R I S E -> but we have E at the end, so that fits. However, we already know E is at the end, so we can use this to test I and S.\n- AROSE: A R O S E\n- ARDOR: but that has two R\'s? and not 5 distinct? Actually, ARDOR is 5 letters but has two R\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have any duplicate letter information yet.\n\nOption 2: A in fourth position: _ R _ A E\nWords: \n- TRADE: T R A D E -> but we know A is in the word, and this puts A in the fourth position. Also, T and D are new.\n- GRADE: G R A D E -> similar.\n\nBut note: we have two correct positions: R and E. So if we use a word that has R in second and E in fifth, we can confirm if A is in the fourth or not, and also test other letters.\n\nHowever, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list the possibilities:\n\nWe know the word has: R (pos2), E (pos5), and A (somewhere not pos3). So the word has at least these three letters.\n\nThe unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4.\n\nWe need to find what goes in position 1, 3, and 4.\n\nWe can try a word that uses the known R and E and places A in a new position (say position 1 or 4) and uses common letters for the other two positions.\n\nBut we have to avoid C and N.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\n- If A is in position 1: A R ? ? E\n  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Common: I, S, O, T, etc.\n  - Words: ARISE (A, R, I, S, E), AROSE (A, R, O, S, E), ARATE? (not common), ARGLE? (not a word), ARDLE? (not common). So ARISE and AROSE are good.\n\n- If A is in position 4: ? R ? A E\n  - Words: TRADE (T, R, A, D, E), GRADE (G, R, A, D, E), BRACE? but C is not allowed, so avoid. PRASE? (P, R, A, S, E) - which is a word (a type of mineral).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A is in position 1 or 4. We could also consider that A might be in position 4, but we have position 1 and 3 to fill.\n\nAnother idea: we don\'t have to use A in this guess. We know A is in the word, but we might not include it to test other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know A is present, so we should use it to find its position.\n\nSo, including A is beneficial.\n\nLet me choose a word that has:\n- Second letter R\n- Fifth letter E\n- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test one of the possibilities)\n- And uses new common letters for the other positions.\n\nFor example, let\'s take ""ARISE"":\n- A in position 1 (so if A is actually in position 1, we get a check; if not, we know it must be in position 4 because we know it\'s not in 3)\n- Also tests I and S.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROUSE"" - but that has O, U, S, but no A. And we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.\n\nSo, I think including A is better.\n\nWhat about ""RAISE""? But note, in ""RAISE"", R is first, but we know R is in the second position. So we cannot use RAISE because it has R in first, which would conflict with our known second position R.\n\nOur guess must be a valid word, but it doesn\'t have to match the known positions? Actually, it can have R in a different position, but that might not be efficient because we know R is fixed at position 2.\n\nIf we put R in a different position, we might get feedback that it\'s present but wrong position, but we already know it\'s in position 2. So it\'s better to keep R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm they are still there (which they should be) and to test other positions.\n\nSo, the pattern should be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E\n\nWe have to choose letter1, letter3, letter4.\n\nConstraints:\n- letter1 cannot be C or N (from previous feedback) and should be a new letter.\n- letter3 cannot be A (because feedback said A is not in position 3) and also not C or N, and should be new.\n- letter4 cannot be C or N, and should be new.\n\nAlso, we must include A in either letter1 or letter4.\n\nSo two cases:\n\nCase 1: A in letter1 -> then word: A R ? ? E\n  - Then we need to choose letter3 and letter4 (both new, not C, N, and not A in letter3? but A is already in letter1, so letter3 and letter4 are different).\n\nCase 2: A in letter4 -> then word: ? R ? A E\n  - Then we choose letter1 and letter3 (new, not C, N).\n\nWe don\'t know which case, so we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use A in position 1 or 4, but that might not help us locate A. But we could use a word that has A in position 4, for example.\n\nLet me look for common words that fit the pattern and include A.\n\nOption: ""GRADE"" -> G R A D E\n- This has A in position 4? Actually, positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but wait, we know from feedback that A is not in position 3! So we cannot put A in position 3. Therefore, ""GRADE"" is invalid because it places A in position 3, which we know is wrong.\n\nSo we must avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, for ""GRADE"", if we use it, the A would be in position 3, which is not allowed by the feedback. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nSimilarly, any word with A in position 3 is not allowed.\n\nSo, for the pattern, if we put A in the third position, it would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we must have A in position 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let\'s try to form words:\n\nFor A in position 1: A R ? ? E\n  - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. They must be from the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C and N).\n  - Common: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n  - Words: \n      - ARISE: A R I S E -> positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E\n      - AROSE: A R O S E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:E\n      - ARDLE? not common.\n      - ARGUE: A R G U E -> 1:A, 2:R, 3:G, 4:U, 5:E\n      - ARTIE? not common.\n\nFor A in position 4: ? R ? A E\n  - Words:\n      - TRADE: T R A D E -> but wait, A is in position 3? No: T(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is in position 3, which is not allowed. So we cannot use TRADE because it forces A into position 3.\n      - How about words with A in position 4? \n          - The pattern is: position1, R, position3, A, E.\n          - So we need a word with structure: [letter1] R [letter3] A E\n          - Example: GRAZE: G R A Z E -> but A is in position 3? Positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> again A in position 3, not allowed.\n          - We need A in position 4? The fourth position is the one before E. So the word should be: [1] [2=R] [3] [4=A] [5=E]\n          - Example: ""URAE"" is not 5 letters. \n          - ""BEAKE"" is not a word.\n          - Actually, it\'s hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end.\n\nLet me think: \n- The word must be: _ R _ A E -> but the third letter can be anything, and then the fourth is A, and fifth is E.\n\nBut in English, words ending with ""AE"" are rare. Usually, it\'s ""IA"" or something else.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""FRAUD"" doesn\'t end with E.\n- ""GRACE"" has C and ends with E, but C is not allowed and A is in position 3? G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A in 3.\n\nIt seems that in many words, when A is present and E is at the end, A often comes earlier.\n\nBut we need A in position 4: so the word must have the form: [consonant] R [vowel?] A E\n\nFor example: \n- ""URSAE"" is a word (plural of ursa), but it\'s not very common: U R S A E -> positions: 1:U, 2:R, 3:S, 4:A, 5:E -> yes, A in position 4.\n- ""BEAKE"" is not a word.\n- ""CRAVE"" has A in position 3: C R A V E -> not allowed.\n\nSo ""URSAE"" is a valid word, but uncommon. We might avoid it.\n\nAnother one: ""UNAWE"" is not a word.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to go with A in position 1.\n\nSo let\'s focus on words starting with A, then R, then two letters, then E.\n\nCommon words: ARISE, AROSE, ARGUE, ABASE, etc.\n\nARISE and AROSE are good.\n\nARISE: tests A in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 4.\nAROSE: tests A in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 4.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nWe could also test different letters. For example, we haven\'t tested S, T, L, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""ARTEL"" but that ends with L, not E.\n\nSo for ending with E, ARISE and AROSE are solid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""ARISE"".\n\nBut note: we know E is at the end, so in ""ARISE"", the E is at the end, which matches.\n\nSo, guess: ARISE\n\nThis will tell us:\n- If A is in position 1 (if we get a check for A, then yes; if minus, then A is not in position 1, so it must be in position 4 because we know it\'s in the word and not in 3).\n- Also, we test I and S.\n\nIf we get checks for R and E, that\'s expected.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""ARISE"".\n\nBut we must ensure it\'s valid. Yes, ARISE is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ARISE\n\nIn the feedback, we had A as present but not in position 3, so if we put A in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.\n\nSimilarly, if the word has I or S, we\'ll know.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and N are not in the word.\n- R is in the correct position (second letter).\n- A is in the word but not in the third position.\n- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).\n\nThe secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, with A present but not in position 3. For the second guess, I chose ""arise"" because:\n- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 to confirm their placement.\n- It tests A in position 1 (to determine if A is in position 1 or 4, since it can\'t be in 3).\n- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.\n- It avoids C and N, which are excluded.\n\n<guess>arise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in word but wrong position, not third)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Guess 2: ARISE
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the first letter)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so S is the fourth letter? Let's see: positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. Feedback says S is correct, so S must be in the fourth position.)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So from ARISE feedback:
- A is first letter (✓)
- R is second letter (✓)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is fourth letter (✓) because it got a check and it's in position 4.
- E is fifth letter (✓)

Therefore, we now know the secret word has:
- First letter: A
- Second letter: R
- Fourth letter: S
- Fifth letter: E
- And the third letter is unknown.

Also, from the first guess, we know that A is not in the third position (which we already used) and that C and N are not in the word.

Additionally, from the second guess, I is not in the word.

So the word pattern is: A R ? S E

We need to find the third letter. It must be a letter that forms a valid English word, and it cannot be C, N, or I (since they are excluded).

We also know that the letter must be one that hasn't been tried yet, or if it has, we have to check the feedback.

But in this case, the only unknown is the third letter.

We have to make a guess that fits this pattern and tests possible letters for the third position.

Since we know four letters, we can try to guess the word directly by choosing a common letter for the third position.

What are possible words? The word is A R _ S E.

Common English words that fit:
- ARISE: but we already guessed that, and it had I in third which is wrong.
- AROSE: A R O S E -> O in third.
- ARDOR: but that has R at the end, not S E.
- ARISE is out because I is not in the word.
- Other possibilities: A R O S E (arose), A R E S E? not a word, A R U S E? not common.

Common words:
- AROSE: meaning to arise or get up, but also a past tense of arise in some contexts? Actually, ""arose"" is a valid word.
- Other: ARISE (already tried), ARRAS? not ending with SE.

Also, ""URASE"" is not a word.

Another one: ""ANISE"" but that has N, which is excluded, and A is first but N is second? No, pattern is A R ? S E, so second must be R.

So AROSE seems a good candidate.

But we need to confirm if O is possible. We haven't tested O yet.

We could also consider ""AROSE"" as a guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but second letter is B, not R. Doesn't fit.

""AROSE"" is the most common.

""ARISE"" is already tried and had I wrong.

So the only common word left is ""AROSE"".

But we must make sure that O is not excluded. From previous feedback, we have no information about O. It wasn't in the first two guesses.

First guess: CRANE - no O
Second guess: ARISE - no O

So O is a possibility.

Therefore, we can guess ""AROSE"".

If it's not ""AROSE"", then what else? There might be rare words, but let's try common ones.

Another word: ""ARVES"" not a word.

""ARGUS"": but ends with US, not SE.

""ARLES"" not ending with SE.

So ""AROSE"" seems the best bet.

We could guess a word that has a different third letter to test, but since we know four positions, we might as well guess a word that could be correct.

If we guess ""AROSE"", and it's not correct, we get feedback on O.

But if we guess and it's wrong, we know O is not in the word or not in that position, but since it's the only unknown, if O is not correct, we need to find another letter.

But let's list all possible letters for the third position that can form a word.

Possible letters: any letter except C, N, I (excluded), and we have to form a valid word.

Words: 
- AROSE: with O
- Are there others? 
  - ARDSE? not a word.
  - ARGSE? no.
  - ARESE? not common.
  - ARISE is out.
  - ARUSE? no.
  - ARTSE? no, but ""ARTSY"" not ending with E.

Another possibility: ""AROSE"" is the only common one.

But what about ""PRASE""? But P is first letter, not A.

No, first letter is fixed as A.

Perhaps ""CRASS"" but C is excluded and not ending with E.

I think ""AROSE"" is the only common word that fits A R _ S E.

There's also ""ANISE"" but N is excluded and second letter is N, not R.

So, we should guess ""AROSE"".

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback that O is not in the word or not in position, but since it's the only position, if O is present but wrong position, that doesn't make sense because there's only one unknown spot. If O is in the word but not in third, but the word has only five letters, and we know A,R,S,E, so the third must be O or something else. But if O is not in third, and we get a minus for O, then O is not in the word at all, and we need another letter.

But what other letters could it be?

Let's think of less common words:
- ""ARISE"" is out.
- ""AVISE"": A V I S E -> but I is excluded, and second letter is V, not R. Doesn't fit pattern.
- ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> second letter B, not R.
- ""AMUSE"": A M U S E -> second M, not R.
- ""AROSE"" is the main one.

Another: ""ARLES"" is not 5 letters? A R L E S, but that's 5 letters? A, R, L, E, S. But the pattern is A R ? S E, so fourth should be S and fifth E. In ""ARLES"", it would be A(1), R(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) — but we need S in fourth and E in fifth, so not matching.

Similarly, ""ARUHE"" not a word.

I think ""AROSE"" is the only common possibility.

Perhaps ""AWASH"" not ending with SE.

So, I'll go with ""AROSE"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""AROSE"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's correct: all should be green.

If not, we'll know O is not the letter.

But since we have limited guesses, and it's the most likely, we should guess it.

In the context of the game, we have to make a guess.

So, <guess>arose</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(in word but wrong position), N(not in word), E(correct position). This reveals:
  - R is the second letter.
  - E is the fifth letter.
  - A is in the word but not in the third position.
  - C and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ARISE** → Feedback: A(correct position), R(correct position), I(not in word), S(correct position), E(correct position). This reveals:
  - A is the first letter (confirmed position).
  - R is the second letter (reconfirmed).
  - S is the fourth letter (since it received a correct position feedback in the fourth slot).
  - E is the fifth letter (reconfirmed).
  - I is not in the word.

The secret word pattern is now: **A R ? S E** (first, second, fourth, and fifth letters are known, but the third letter is unknown).

### Deductions:
- The third letter must be a valid English letter that forms a real 5-letter word.
- Excluded letters: C, N, and I (from feedback).
- Common words fitting the pattern ""A R _ S E"" include:
  - **AROSE** (meaning ""to get up"" or past tense of ""arise"")—this is the most common option.
  - Other possibilities (like ""ARISE"") are invalid due to feedback (e.g., ""ARISE"" was guessed and had I in the third position, which is excluded).
- ""AROSE"" tests the letter O in the third position, which hasn't been tried yet and is a common vowel.

Given that ""AROSE"" is the only common word matching the known pattern and constraints, it is the optimal guess. If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback on O will narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if O is not in the word, rarer options like ""URSAE"" could be considered, but ""AROSE"" is the strongest candidate for now).

<guess>arose</guess>",arose,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in word but wrong position, not third)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Guess 2: ARISE
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the first letter)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so S is the fourth letter? Let's see: positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. Feedback says S is correct, so S must be in the fourth position.)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So from ARISE feedback:
- A is first letter (✓)
- R is second letter (✓)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is fourth letter (✓) because it got a check and it's in position 4.
- E is fifth letter (✓)

Therefore, we now know the secret word has:
- First letter: A
- Second letter: R
- Fourth letter: S
- Fifth letter: E
- And the third letter is unknown.

Also, from the first guess, we know that A is not in the third position (which we already used) and that C and N are not in the word.

Additionally, from the second guess, I is not in the word.

So the word pattern is: A R ? S E

We need to find the third letter. It must be a letter that forms a valid English word, and it cannot be C, N, or I (since they are excluded).

We also know that the letter must be one that hasn't been tried yet, or if it has, we have to check the feedback.

But in this case, the only unknown is the third letter.

We have to make a guess that fits this pattern and tests possible letters for the third position.

Since we know four letters, we can try to guess the word directly by choosing a common letter for the third position.

What are possible words? The word is A R _ S E.

Common English words that fit:
- ARISE: but we already guessed that, and it had I in third which is wrong.
- AROSE: A R O S E -> O in third.
- ARDOR: but that has R at the end, not S E.
- ARISE is out because I is not in the word.
- Other possibilities: A R O S E (arose), A R E S E? not a word, A R U S E? not common.

Common words:
- AROSE: meaning to arise or get up, but also a past tense of arise in some contexts? Actually, ""arose"" is a valid word.
- Other: ARISE (already tried), ARRAS? not ending with SE.

Also, ""URASE"" is not a word.

Another one: ""ANISE"" but that has N, which is excluded, and A is first but N is second? No, pattern is A R ? S E, so second must be R.

So AROSE seems a good candidate.

But we need to confirm if O is possible. We haven't tested O yet.

We could also consider ""AROSE"" as a guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but second letter is B, not R. Doesn't fit.

""AROSE"" is the most common.

""ARISE"" is already tried and had I wrong.

So the only common word left is ""AROSE"".

But we must make sure that O is not excluded. From previous feedback, we have no information about O. It wasn't in the first two guesses.

First guess: CRANE - no O
Second guess: ARISE - no O

So O is a possibility.

Therefore, we can guess ""AROSE"".

If it's not ""AROSE"", then what else? There might be rare words, but let's try common ones.

Another word: ""ARVES"" not a word.

""ARGUS"": but ends with US, not SE.

""ARLES"" not ending with SE.

So ""AROSE"" seems the best bet.

We could guess a word that has a different third letter to test, but since we know four positions, we might as well guess a word that could be correct.

If we guess ""AROSE"", and it's not correct, we get feedback on O.

But if we guess and it's wrong, we know O is not in the word or not in that position, but since it's the only unknown, if O is not correct, we need to find another letter.

But let's list all possible letters for the third position that can form a word.

Possible letters: any letter except C, N, I (excluded), and we have to form a valid word.

Words: 
- AROSE: with O
- Are there others? 
  - ARDSE? not a word.
  - ARGSE? no.
  - ARESE? not common.
  - ARISE is out.
  - ARUSE? no.
  - ARTSE? no, but ""ARTSY"" not ending with E.

Another possibility: ""AROSE"" is the only common one.

But what about ""PRASE""? But P is first letter, not A.

No, first letter is fixed as A.

Perhaps ""CRASS"" but C is excluded and not ending with E.

I think ""AROSE"" is the only common word that fits A R _ S E.

There's also ""ANISE"" but N is excluded and second letter is N, not R.

So, we should guess ""AROSE"".

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback that O is not in the word or not in position, but since it's the only position, if O is present but wrong position, that doesn't make sense because there's only one unknown spot. If O is in the word but not in third, but the word has only five letters, and we know A,R,S,E, so the third must be O or something else. But if O is not in third, and we get a minus for O, then O is not in the word at all, and we need another letter.

But what other letters could it be?

Let's think of less common words:
- ""ARISE"" is out.
- ""AVISE"": A V I S E -> but I is excluded, and second letter is V, not R. Doesn't fit pattern.
- ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> second letter B, not R.
- ""AMUSE"": A M U S E -> second M, not R.
- ""AROSE"" is the main one.

Another: ""ARLES"" is not 5 letters? A R L E S, but that's 5 letters? A, R, L, E, S. But the pattern is A R ? S E, so fourth should be S and fifth E. In ""ARLES"", it would be A(1), R(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) — but we need S in fourth and E in fifth, so not matching.

Similarly, ""ARUHE"" not a word.

I think ""AROSE"" is the only common possibility.

Perhaps ""AWASH"" not ending with SE.

So, I'll go with ""AROSE"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""AROSE"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's correct: all should be green.

If not, we'll know O is not the letter.

But since we have limited guesses, and it's the most likely, we should guess it.

In the context of the game, we have to make a guess.

So, <guess>arose</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(in word but wrong position), N(not in word), E(correct position). This reveals:
  - R is the second letter.
  - E is the fifth letter.
  - A is in the word but not in the third position.
  - C and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ARISE** → Feedback: A(correct position), R(correct position), I(not in word), S(correct position), E(correct position). This reveals:
  - A is the first letter (confirmed position).
  - R is the second letter (reconfirmed).
  - S is the fourth letter (since it received a correct position feedback in the fourth slot).
  - E is the fifth letter (reconfirmed).
  - I is not in the word.

The secret word pattern is now: **A R ? S E** (first, second, fourth, and fifth letters are known, but the third letter is unknown).

### Deductions:
- The third letter must be a valid English letter that forms a real 5-letter word.
- Excluded letters: C, N, and I (from feedback).
- Common words fitting the pattern ""A R _ S E"" include:
  - **AROSE** (meaning ""to get up"" or past tense of ""arise"")—this is the most common option.
  - Other possibilities (like ""ARISE"") are invalid due to feedback (e.g., ""ARISE"" was guessed and had I in the third position, which is excluded).
- ""AROSE"" tests the letter O in the third position, which hasn't been tried yet and is a common vowel.

Given that ""AROSE"" is the only common word matching the known pattern and constraints, it is the optimal guess. If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback on O will narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if O is not in the word, rarer options like ""URSAE"" could be considered, but ""AROSE"" is the strongest candidate for now).",Guess 3: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
